Some instructions deal with safe practices to avoid unwanted medical events during and following your surgery. Other instructions help your body prepare for the surgery and the healing process afterwards, including steps to help reduce swelling.Every surgery, every surgeon, and every patient are different. The swelling that occurs will depend on many variables.
Pay attention to the instructions provided by your surgeon to reduce swelling.;
, Be very clear, well in advance of your surgery, regarding the changes you need to make in your medications. This will involve a coordinated effort with your regular doctor, any specialists you see, and your surgeon. Some medications can cause changes that may lead to problems during surgery and difficulties after the surgery, such as additional and prolonged swelling.Make the changes in your prescription drugs, over-the-counter agents, and herbal supplements, two weeks before your surgery.
It takes time for the medications to get out of your system, and for your system to return to its baseline level of functioning.

, Provide your surgeon with a complete list of your medications, including herbal supplements and over-the-counter agents, at least 30 days before your scheduled surgery. It takes time for your doctors to communicate with each other and determine the drugs you can stop in advance and the ones you should not stop at all.Never stop or adjust your prescription medications without consulting your doctor.
Plan early with your regular doctor or specialist. Many agents require a gradual taper downward to stop the medication.
Some prescription medications should not be stopped or dose adjusted at all. Let your surgeon know of the drugs you will need to continue to take routinely, including the day of surgery.

, Your surgeon will know if you can continue some agents, such as acetaminophen. You will need to stop many things but not everything. Your surgeon will let you know what you can continue taking.OTC anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen, naproxen, and aspirin, will need to be discontinued two weeks before your surgery.
This group of medications can lead to additional bleeding which causes more swelling.

, Stop taking your herbal supplements should be stopped two to three weeks before your surgery. It may be best to plan on stopping everything you take that is an herbal product or supplement. Your surgeon will tell you exactly how to proceed.Some herbal products can interfere with anesthesia and others can increase bleeding and swelling after the procedure.
Plan on stopping products that contain omega 3’s and 6’s contained in fish oil supplements, flaxseed, ephedra, Ma Huang, feverfew, goldenseal, garlic, ginseng, ginger, licorice, valerian, and kava. This is not a complete list. Talk to your surgeon about all your herbal supplements.

, A healthy diet will promote healing and reduce swelling. This means you should start following this step as far in advance as possible and continue it through the entire post-op healing process.Include fruits and vegetables that are high in fiber. Examples of high fiber foods include peas, lentils, artichokes, brussel sprouts, lima beans, and black beans.
High fiber foods prevent constipation. Pain medications provided for surgical pain often cause constipation. Straining due to constipation can lead to bleeding at the surgical site and additional swelling.
Reduce your sodium intake to help decrease swelling after the surgery.
Stay hydrated the week leading up to the surgery. Plenty of water will also help to promote healing and reduce swelling.

, If you are a smoker, then you will need to stop smoking several weeks before your surgery.The healing process is slowed in people that smoke.
Smoking also increases the risk of developing an infection.
Avoid ingesting alcoholic drinks. Since alcohol thins the blood, avoid drinking alcohol for at least five days before the surgery., Your nose has undergone major surgery so some swelling and bruising is natural. Every person and surgery is different, so the extent of bruising and swelling will vary.Visible swelling lasts for about two weeks. This is the best time to take steps to reduce the swelling since the tissues are healing.
It may take years for the swelling inside the nose to completely subside, but in two to three weeks, your casual acquaintances will not be able to tell you had any type of facial surgery.
Bruising most often occurs under the eyes and also lasts for several weeks.

, Beginning as soon as you get home on the day of your surgery, apply cold compresses to the area around your nose. Apply the cold compresses around your eyes, on your eyes, on your forehead and cheeks, and the area around your nose. Avoid placing the ice treatments directly on your nose. This is an important step in reducing swelling.Apply the cold compress as often as possible for the first few days after the surgery. Avoid placing ice directly against your skin.
The most swelling occurs on the third day after the surgery. The more cold applications you apply during the first two days will significantly reduce the amount of swelling you see on the third.
Do not place ice packs directly on your nose. The ice packs create unwanted pressure if they are placed on top of your nose.
Surgeons have preferences about the type of ice pack or cold compress used. Some recommend using bags of frozen veggies, crushed ice in a baggie, or ice packs. Use a cloth or towel to wrap any form of cold application before putting on the area.
Continue to apply the cold compresses to help ease discomfort, beyond the initial 48 hour window for swelling reduction., It is important that you keep your head above your heart at all times, including when you are resting and sleeping. Also avoid bending over. This is important in reducing the amount of swelling that develops.It may be difficult to find a comfortable sleeping position since you need to keep your head elevated.
Try using three pillows beneath your head at night. Be sure you are sufficiently propped up and will not roll over and off the pillows.
Sleep in a recliner for at least two weeks following the surgery.
Keeping your head elevated also means no bending over for the first two weeks after surgery.
No bending over also includes no heavy lifting. This can cause your swelling to worsen and the strain can increase your blood pressure which can cause the area to start bleeding again.

, The tape, splint, and nasal packing will likely feel uncomfortable. These were placed precisely by your surgeon and are there to promote healing and reduce swelling. Even though they may feel uncomfortable, your best way to reduce swelling is to leave them alone.Your surgeon will remove the packing and splint in about one week. He or she may replace the splint to continue to help reduce swelling.
Change your dressings exactly as directed. Leave the packing and splint in place to reduce swelling.
Your surgeon may have placed an additional bandage at the end of your nose to catch fluids and blood as the wound drains. The drainage helps to reduce swelling.
Change the drip bandage exactly as directed. Do not remove it early and do not apply too much pressure when changing the dressing.

, You may not feel much like moving around, but getting up and gently moving around can help to reduce swelling.The sooner you can start walking the better. Walking prevents blood clots from forming and reduces swelling.
Do not resume your exercise routine until your surgeon gives you permission to do so.

, Follow your surgeon’s instructions for any medications provided to help with pain relief and swelling. Do not take any medication without your surgeon’s recommendation.Resume your original prescription medications per directions from your surgeon and your regular doctor or specialist.
It is important to gradually increase the dose of some prescription medications to get back to the prescribed dose.
Resume your herbal and OTC medications only if your surgeon recommends it. Some agents can still contribute to swelling and/or bleeding. You may need to wait for two to four weeks before resuming based on instructions provided by your surgeon.

, Instead of showers, take baths for the time that you have bandages. The steam and excessive moisture from the shower water may loosen the bandages or nasal packing and alter the way those tissues heal.Consult with your surgeon to determine when you can resume taking showers.
Take care when you wash your face to avoid dislodging any bandages or bumping your nose.
Brush your teeth gently. Try to avoid excessive movement of your upper lip as you brush your teeth.

, Sudden pressure, bumping your nose, or a force to the injured area can cause more swelling and may interfere with the healing process.Do not blow your nose. You will feel extra pressure in your nasal passages, but the force of blowing your nose can cause damage to sutures, tissues, cause more swelling, and prolong the healing process.
Avoid sniffing forcibly such as when you feel like you have a runny nose. This action creates pressure that can cause swelling, alter the placement of bandages and nasal packing, and interfere with healing.
Try not to sneeze. If you must sneeze, then make an effort to let the pressure exit from your mouth as you would with a cough.
Even laughing and smiling excessively can cause the muscles and ligaments that support your nose to change position and put added pressure on your surgical site.

, Minor swelling and slight pressure may still be present for more than one year following the procedure. The visible swelling is gone within a few weeks, but it may take several months or longer for all swelling to completely resolve.Most rhinoplasty procedures involve changes that are small: often so small that they are measured in millimeters.
It is possible that you do not see the results you anticipated and may consider another rhinoplasty surgery.
Some internal tissues take as long as 18 months for the swelling to completely subside. Other parts of your nose may continue to change and adjust for up to one year or more following your recent procedure.
For these reasons, most surgeons will not consider a second rhinoplasty for at least one year after the most recent one.

, Always protect your skin from the harmful rays of the sun by using an appropriate sunscreen and protective clothing.Apply a broad spectrum sunscreen that protects against both UVA and UVA rays and has a SPF of 30 or higher.
Wear a wide brim hat or visor that shades your face.

, Take steps to avoid applying any pressure to your nose for at least four weeks after your surgery. Your surgeon may request a longer period of time depending on the extent of the surgery.Do not wear glasses or sunglasses during this time as they put pressure on your nose.
If you must wear glasses then take steps to prevent any pressure from the glasses. One way is to tape the glasses to your forehead. Cheek rests are also available.

, Try to avoid wearing clothing that is pulled on over your head for at least four weeks, or longer if your surgeon recommends.Select shirts or blouses that button up along the front, or wear dresses that you can step into.
Avoid sweatshirts and sweaters for the same time frame.

, Continue your exercise regimen by make some adjustments if your routine involves strenuous activity that can put pressure on your nose. Even though you may not think about it, some forms of exercise that involve an up and down motion can cause the tissues in your nose to become damaged or fail to heal as intended.Avoid routines like running or jogging. Definitely avoid any activities or sports that could result in a blow to the face, such as soccer, football, and basketball.
Participate in only low impact exercises and avoid high impact regimens like aerobics.
Yoga and stretching are good choices, but avoid any positions that require you to bend over or put your head a low angle. This can cause extra pressure to the area and might interfere with healing.
Ask your doctor when you can resume your normal exercise routine.

, Follow the diet you began several weeks prior to your surgery, or establish a regular diet that includes a good balance of the recommended food groups.Continue to consume foods that are high in fiber such as fruits and vegetables, and maintain a low sodium diet until your doctor recommends otherwise.
Do not return to smoking if you were a smoker before your surgery. Also try to avoid second-hand smoke. Second-hand smoke can act as an irritant.

Know the risk factors for morning sickness.",How to Relieve Morning Sickness Naturally," Eating a small piece dry toast or a couple of crackers first thing in the morning can help to relieve nausea by making your stomach feel less empty.Dry crackers or toast have no strong smell or flavor, making them much less likely to trigger feelings of nausea.
Many women find it helpful to keep a packet of crackers beside your bed so you can nibble on a couple straight after waking up, before you get out of bed.;
, When you are constantly vomiting due to morning sickness, there is a high risk of becoming dehydrated. Thus, drinking more water is essential in order to replenish the lost fluid.


Aim to drink at least 8 glasses of water each day. If you find water too boring, try adding slices of lemon and lime or a few mint leaves to make the flavor more appealing.
You can also try drinking sodas, as the bicarbonate levels in soda help to neutralize acidity in the stomach, relieving nausea as a result. Don't drink too many sodas however, as aerated drinks can actually dehydrate you further. Try taking a few small sips throughout the day.

, Try to eat smaller, more frequent meals throughout the day, instead of eating three large meals. Eating too much food in one go will just make you feel sick.Always have a number of snacks easily at hand, so you can take a nibble whenever you feel nauseous. Things like a piece of fruit, a couple of crackers, a yogurt or a handful of nuts are all nutritious, easy-to-carry options.
At mealtimes, try placing your food on a smaller plate, this makes it look like your plate is full and tricks your brain into thinking that you're eating more than you actually are. As a result, you will feel satisfied without overeating or feeling nauseous.

, These food groups will give you and your baby plenty of beneficial nutrients, even if you only consume a small amount of them. Increase your intake of food items like peanut butter, apples, celery, nuts, crackers, cheese, yogurt, fish and white meat.


It's a particularly good idea to eat protein with dinner in the evening, as it releases energy slowly overnight, leaving you less weak and nauseous in the morning. Some additional protein-rich foods include pulses, eggs, soy milk and lean red meat.

, High fat foods and foods with a high salt content are best avoided when suffering from morning sickness, so try to cut them from your diet as much as possible.


Salt is a hydrophilic substance which means that it attracts water from the blood. As a result, consuming high quantities of salt can lead to dehydration and stimulate nausea and vomiting.
High fat foods should be avoided as they are difficult to digest. More acid is needed to break down fat, which leads to increased acidity in the stomach. Increased acidity can lead to heartburn, which may contribute to vomiting during pregnancy., Ginger has been used for thousands of years as a natural remedy for relieving morning sickness. It contains chemicals called as shogaols and gingerols that can relax the intestinal tract and prevent you from throwing up food.Prepare ginger tea. This is the easiest and fastest way to include ginger in your diet. Boil water and pour it into a cup. Add ½ teaspoon of powdered ginger spice. Stir to combine, then cover the cup and let it stand for ten minutes. Strain the powder and sip the tea slowly.
You can drink ginger tea as often as needed to relieve nausea. Instead of using powdered ginger spice, you can also use freshly grated ginger root to make tea, drink ginger ale, or suck on ginger flavored candies.

, Mint is known to suppress the gag reflex, which can help to relieve nausea and vomiting.


Chemically speaking, mint contains a high level of menthol. Menthol has a cooling, relaxing effect on receptors in the nose and tongue, which helps to numb the gag reflex.Every time you feel the urge to get sick, reach for a cup of mint tea. To prepare mint tea, boil a handful of mint leaves in a pot of water for 5 to 10 minutes. Strain the leaves and sip the tea throughout the tea whenever you feel nauseous.

, Bananas are full of potassium and high in natural sugars and calories. This makes them a good snack food for pregnant women, as repeated vomiting can lead to hypokalemia (low potassium levels) and weakness.


Eating a banana a day will help to replenish your body's potassium levels and give you a boost of energy when you're feeling tired.

, Lemons contain high quantities of vitamin C, which helps to counteract high acidity levels in the stomach. This reduces the nausea that causes morning sickness.


Keep in mind that the lemonade must be homemade — store bought lemonade will not be effective. This is due to the fact that vitamin C levels are highest in fresh lemons and will decline the longer the lemonade is stored.
You can make your own homemade lemonade by combining half a tablespoon of sugar, a pinch of salt and the juice from half a lemon in a glass of cold water. You can adjust the sugar and salt levels according to your own personal preference.

, Cloves contain a substance called eugenol which has a strong anti-nausea effect. However, clove has a very strong, pungent flavor, so this remedy is not for everyone.


If you don't mind the taste of cloves, you can pop one in your mouth and suck it for a while until the feelings of nausea subside.You can also chew the clove, if you so wish.
Aside from relieving nausea, clove is used in many dental preparations and is an effective treatment for many stomach ailments.

, Cumin contains a substance called cuminaldehyde which soothes the nausea, flatulence and stomach pains associated with indigestion. Cuminaldehyde activates enzymes that trigger the release of gastric juices that are necessary for digestion.


Ground cumin can be used in cooking, but you can also chew cumin seeds (also known as ""jeera"") to take advantage of cumin's digestion-related benefits.
For best results, take a pinch of jeera before every meal and eat it. This will aid digestion and help to prevent nausea.

, Sucking on an ice cube cools the tongue and numbs the gag reflex, which can help to prevent nausea and vomiting. It's also a great way to stay hydrated, especially during the hot summer months.


If you find normal ice cubes a little boring, try adding a little citrus or watermelon juice to the water to give it some extra flavor. You could also try making ice cubes from your favorite electrolyte energy drink, to give you an additional burst of energy.
Sucking on a popsicle provides the same benefit as the ice cubes, so always try to keep a stash in the freezer. Stick to naturally colored and flavored popsicles if possible, or make your own.

, Doing yoga everyday is a good way to relieve morning sickness, as it helps to relieve stress and take your mind off feelings of nausea. Some of the best poses for relieving morning sickness include:



Child’s pose: To do child's pose, kneel on the mat and sit back onto your heels. Your toes should point together and your knees should be spread about shoulder-width apart. Lean over so your belly is resting against your thighs, then stretch your arms out in front of you and place your palms on the mat. Rest your forehead against the mat. Hold the pose for 1 to 3 minutes, inhaling deeply throughout.

Seated forward bend: Sit on the mat with your legs extended in front of you and your feet together. Slowly bend forward at the waist, and try to rest your torso against your thighs. Stretch your arms forward, placing the palms of your hands on either side of your feet. Hold the pose for 1 to 3 minutes, inhaling deeply throughout.

Pranayam: Sit on the yoga mat with your legs crossed and your back straight. Rest the back of your hands on your knees and open your palms. Hold this position for 5 to 10 minutes, keeping your eyes closed and focusing on your breathing.

, Pregnant women often feel anxious during pregnancy, especially if it's their first time. Stress can make morning sickness worse and isn't healthy for you or the baby. Daily meditation is a great way to calm both your mind and body.


Meditation doesn't require any special equipment or knowledge, you just need to find a quiet space in your home where you can sit comfortably and clear your mind. Try to eliminate all distractions and simply focus on your breathing. Doing this for just 10 to 15 minutes each day can be hugely beneficial for your overall stress levels.
For more information on a wide variety of meditation techniques, see this article.

, Morning sickness can often be triggered by certain odors, as pregnancy makes you hypersensitive to smells. This hypersensitivity is linked to increased levels of estrogen during pregnancy. You can combat this sensitivity using aromatherapy — using pleasant fragrances to overpower the bad.


Lavender and thyme are two aromatic plants that contain a high level of linalool and linalyl acetate — substances that have a calming effect on the mind and body.As a result lavender and thyme are widely used in aromatherapy. Get your hands on some lavender and thyme essential oils and place a drop or two (mixed with water) into an oil diffuser. This will fill your home with a pleasant, calming fragrance.
Another useful aromatherapy technique is to squeeze some fresh lemon onto a handkerchief. You can then carry the handkerchief around and inhale the refreshing citrus-y aroma whenever you start to feel nauseous.
Keep in mind that smells are highly subjective, and what smells good to one woman may trigger nausea in another. As a result, it is important to identify which scents you like and which you find irritating. Once you know which smells trigger your morning sickness, you can do your best to avoid them. Some pregnant women are irritated by perfume, dirty laundry, raw meat products, alcohol, cigarette smoke, bitter vegetables, caffeinated drinks and others., Exercise is an important part of a healthy daily routine, even during pregnancy. Some women find that exercise helps to reduce the symptoms of morning sickness, while others find that it distracts them from the nausea.


Taking a brisk walk outside helps to balance your metabolism and stimulates a healthy appetite. Walking outdoors is also an excellent way of relieving mental stress. Just make sure to drink plenty of water during and after exercise, to avoid becoming dehydrated.
Another simple exercise involves lying on your back on the floor and raising your feet to a 30 degree angle. This helps to increase blood flow to the abdomen and relieve morning sickness. Keep in mind that this exercise should be done 5 to 10 times and no more, as it exerts pressure over the lower abdomen and uterus.

, Acupressure is a form of traditional therapy which can help to relieve morning sickness in pregnant women. It involves applying pressure to specific energy zones in the body (usually in the hands and feet), in order to release negative energies. Each energy zone is linked to the energy of a specific organ, so applying pressure to the correct zone can help to eliminate morning sickness from the stomach.
It is very important that you see a qualified, professional acupressurist. See your doctor for recommendations.

, The cause of morning sickness is not fully understood, but most experts agree that it is linked to hormonal imbalances in the body during pregnancy.


During pregnancy, the estrogen hormone increases drastically, in some cases by 100% during the first trimester alone. As a result, many experts believe that morning sickness may be the result of your body adjusting to these increased estrogen levels.. This explanation is plausible as women who use hormone replacement therapy or hormonal contraception - which increases the level of estrogen - experience the same symptoms.
Progesterone is another hormone that increases during pregnancy. This is a relaxant hormone that prevents the muscles of uterus from contracting too soon, thus helping to prevent premature childbirth. Though its main effect is on the uterus, it can also relax the stomach and intestine leading to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), commonly known as heartburn. As the stomach relaxes, its contents may flow back up the esophagus, resulting in morning sickness.
Morning sickness may also be linked to low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia). In pregnant women, the placenta consumes a lot of energy, depleting the body's stores of sugar. Hypoglycaemia can lead to vomiting.
Increased salivation may also lead to nausea and vomiting. When a pregnant woman sleeps, her salivary gland produces excessive bitter-tasting saliva, which may upset her stomach in the mornings.
Human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) is released by the placenta and the developing embryo. The HCG doesn't cause the morning sickness itself, but it can stimulates the production of excess estrogen, which can lead to vomiting.
Some experts suggest that pregnant women have increased sensitivity to smell, which overstimulates the nausea receptors of the brain and leads to vomiting.

, It is important to remember that a fetus is most vulnerable during the first trimester. This is because the fetal organs are just starting to develop — they have less resistance to toxins and even a small amount of a harmful chemical can lead to problems with the pregnancy.


As a result, morning sickness may be perceived as a way for women to protect their offspring from harmful substances. Hypersensitivity to smells and increased vomiting are a defense mechanism which prevents the pregnant woman from ingesting food that may potentially harm the baby.Statistics shows that pregnant women who don’t experience morning sickness will have an increased chance of experiencing miscarriage.

, Obviously, the most important factor that predisposes a woman to morning sickness is pregnancy. But beyond that, there are several other factors that can trigger morning sickness.


Morning sickness may be triggered by certain smells. These odors may not necessarily cause nausea or vomiting, but because of the increased nasal sensitivity of a pregnant woman, it may lead to morning sickness.
Travelling over a great distance may lead to motion sickness which can aggravate nausea and vomiting during pregnancy.
If a woman experienced morning sickness during her previous pregnancy, then there is a higher probability that morning sickness will occur again during her next pregnancy.
Being pregnant with twins or more leads to higher levels of progesterone, HCG and estrogen. All these hormones contribute to morning sickness.
If you used a hormonal contraceptive before pregnancy, you have an increased chance of experiencing this illness.

Seek immediate medical attention for serious symptoms.,
Call your doctor.,
Get a synovial fluid analysis.,
Ask about getting the fluid drained.,
Discuss arthroscopy.,
Consider a joint replacement.",How to Relieve Joint Fluid Pain3," Fluid buildup in your knees is not usually a cause for concern, but it can be serious if other symptoms are present. Seek immediate medical attention if you experience joint swelling along with serious symptoms such as:shortness of breath
chest pain

, If your joint swelling is ongoing, then your doctor may decide to do a synovial fluid analysis to determine the cause. For this procedure, your doctor will numb your joint with a local anesthetic and then draw out some of the fluid from your joint using a syringe. Then, the fluid will be sent to a lab for analysis.Your doctor may use the test to determine if you have certain conditions, such as gout, an infection, or bleeding from an injury.

, If other treatment methods have not worked for you, then your doctor may decide to drain some of the excess fluid from your joint to help relieve the pain.

Note if the cyst has become inflamed and irritated.,
Let your doctor examine the cyst.,
Allow your doctor to drain the cyst.,
Make sure the area around the removed cyst does not get infected.",How to Remove a Sebaceous Cyst1," Most sebaceous cysts are harmless and do not require treatment. But if the cyst becomes irritated or inflamed, you may consider going to your doctor so they can remove it for you safely.Check if there is a tiny blackhead in the center of the cyst. The cyst may also be red, inflamed, and tender.
You should also note a thick yellow fluid that comes out of the cyst when you press on it. The fluid may have a foul smell.;
, If you think the sebaceous cyst is infected, you should allow your doctor to examine it and avoid touching it or draining it on your own at home.


Trying to drain the cyst at home can increase your risk of having the cyst appear again, as you will not be able to remove the sac completely. Draining the sac on your own can also increase your risk of infection and scarring in the area around the cyst.

, There are a variety of foods that contain probiotics, but many studies have shown that yogurt is one of the best.Plus, it's a kid-friendly food that will go down easily.


When you're looking for yogurts that have probiotics, it's important to look for the Live Cultures seal. This means that there are live bacteria in the yogurt.
It's also recommended to get organic yogurt. This may be a little more expensive, but studies have shown there are higher levels of probiotics in this type of yogurt due to the processing methods.Serve kid's yogurt plain with some fruit, a drizzle of honey (if they're over two years old), mixed into a fruit smoothie or used to make a sweet dip for fruit.

, Kefir is another powerful source of many strains of helpful probiotics.It's a little less common than yogurt, but is equally beneficial.


Kefir is a fermented drink and has the consistency of runny yogurt.It's typically very tart, but many brands sell kefir that's flavored — like strawberry or blueberry kefir.
Some health professionals think kefir is even superior to yogurt since it may have up to 12 different strains of probiotics.Since kefir might be a little strong for your child's palate, you may want to consider making a smoothie with it. You can mix sweet fruits (like strawberries, pineapple or bananas) to reduce the tartness of the kefir. However, some children may like the kefir alone or the fruit kefir drinks.

, Many fermented and pickled vegetables contain a good amount of probiotics. An especially kid-friendly source of probiotics are pickles.


When you're looking to purchase pickles, choose a brand that is brined in salt and water — not vinegar. Vinegar-based pickles do not have probiotics. You may find salt-brined pickles in the refrigerated section of the grocery store.Serve pickles on your kid's sandwiches, alongside a sandwich or wrap or just encourage your child to crunch on them as a snack.
There are also many easy do-it-yourself recipes to make pickles with probiotics in your own home.

, A more unique source of probiotics is tempeh.This vegetarian protein source also delivers fiber and a boost of healthy bacteria.


Tempeh is made from fermented soybeans which are then pressed together into a solid block. It's more firm and dense compared to tofu and doesn't have a spongy or squishy texture.
Tempeh has little flavor and children may not like it plain. However, if you pan-fry tempeh or sauté it with a flavorful sauce, it'll blend great into your meal.
You can pan fry tempeh sticks and use them in a wrap in place of deli meat, you can crumble tempeh and sauté and use as a ground meat substitute or you can cube it up and stir-fry it with vegetables.

, Another soy-based source of probiotics is miso. Commonly used to make miso soup, this fermented soybean paste may be another great way to get in extra ""good bacteria.""Like tempeh, miso is also made from fermented soybeans. It's the fermentation of both of these products that results in their high probiotic content.
You may think your child won't eat miso - especially miso soup, however there are a large variety of ways to use miso paste without your child ever knowing.
Try adding miso to: mayonnaise for a savory twist on their sandwich, homemade salad dressings, homemade marinades, or in casseroles., If you have a picky eater or have difficulty getting in probiotic-rich foods every day, you may want to consider having your child take a probiotic supplement.


Most health professionals believe that probiotics in the form of food or supplements are safe for children. However, always talk to your child's pediatrician before giving her any over-the-counter supplement.Probiotic supplements may come in a tablet, pill or liquid form. Some brands come in chewable tablets and in single-serving packets which can be dissolved into food or liquids. Choose something that your child will tolerate and enjoy.
Also make sure your supplement has at least 1 billion CFUs or colony forming units. This has been shown to be a beneficial level of probiotics for children's GI systems., Like probiotics, prebiotics have been associated with improved gut health. Adding foods that contain prebiotics in addition to probiotics can help maximize the amount of good bacteria in your child's gut.


Prebiotics are indigestible food components that serve as the food for probiotics.They help promote the growth and proliferation of the good bacteria in your GI system.
Foods that contain prebiotics include: Jerusalem artichokes, dandelion greens, garlic, leeks, onions, asparagus, banana, wheat bran and wheat flour.
Some of theses foods aren't super ""kid-friendly"" and will most likely be better tolerated when they are cooked and tossed together in a meal.

, If you're interested in giving your child probiotics and managing your child's GI system, the first place to start is talking to your pediatrician.


These children's specialists will be able to give you a lot of good information on whether or not probiotics are safe or effective for your child.
Ask the pediatrician about any research or his opinion on whether or not probiotics are effective.
In addition, share with your pediatrician the ways in which you were considering adding probiotics to your child's diet. Ask if these are appropriate or safe.

, If you're increasing or starting to use probiotics with your child, you may be looking for some improvements in her health. You should monitor your child's overall health and response to probiotics to ensure they're effective and safe.


Consider keeping a journal or log of what your child ate and how much. Also track symptoms or reactions your child has to foods that contain probiotics.
If you're giving your child a probiotic supplement, make sure to note the brand, ingredients and how often you're giving it to your child.
Also note the progress or improvement in your child's health. If you do not notice a difference in several weeks, you may want to discontinue as both probiotic foods and supplements can be expensive.

, Although probiotics are generally considered safe for most people, even kids, not everyone or every child should take them.


It's generally considered safe for children — even infants. However, only give probiotics to infants who were full-term.Avoid probiotic use in premature infants, babies or children with an immune disorder or weakened immune system, those who are receiving any type of medical treatment that would cause a weakened immune system or those with any medical devices placed (like a catheter)., There is some research that suggests supplementing your child's diet with foods containing acidophilus or Lactobacillus supplements can cause adverse health effects. Be aware of:


Children with milk allergies or are lactose intolerant can react to foods or supplements with Lactobacillus acidophilus in them. There may be trace amounts of lactose or other milk compounds left over and can cause side effects.Also, some studies show that supplementing an infant's diet with Lactobacillus acidophilus prior to six months of age may increase the likelihood of that child developing a food allergy to milk., A common reason many parents start to use probiotics in children is to manage eczema or atopic dermatitis.Eczema is somewhat common in children. It's a skin condition that usually poses no significant harm to children, but presents as an itchy, red, scaly rash.Studies have shown that regular consumption of foods containing probiotics or probiotic supplements helped prevent eczema and the extent and severity of eczema in children already presenting with it., Another common health problem children face is diarrhea. Whether they ate something that made them sick or got a stomach bug from other kids at school, diarrhea is something most children will encounter at some point.


One of the most common causes of diarrhea in children is rotavirus-related diarrhea.Many children will also get diarrhea after taking an antibiotic. Probiotics may help this as well.
Using probiotic foods and supplements can help prevent diarrhea in addition to decreasing the total time the diarrhea is present and decrease symptoms., Infants and babies with colic can be challenging for parents. However, probiotics may also be beneficial to those babies who have been diagnosed with colic.


Colic is a frustrating condition that results in infants and babies crying for extended periods of time. It can cause babies to cry for over three hours daily on a regular basis; the cause is unknown.Studies have shown that infants with colic that have been treated with probiotics decreased the amount of time crying by over 50%., Like diarrhea, probiotics have also been shown to be beneficial in children that have chronic intestinal conditions like Crohn's Disease.Common intestinal conditions in children include Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and IBS. Many are thought to be autoimmune diseases that are only managed, not cured.
Studies have shown that kids who are treated with probiotics have decreased abdominal pain in addition to decreased bloating, gas, cramping and diarrhea., There has been recent research that seems to suggest that starting infants on probiotics may help prevent or reduce the risk for acquiring food allergies.Studies have shown that children with food allergies have an imbalance of beneficial and harmful bacteria in their GI systems.
Starting children on probiotics at infancy can help ensure the right type of beneficial bacteria populate their GI system."

Remain calm and comply with the officer.,
Tell the officer you aren't willing to take a field sobriety test.,
Explain your reasons.,
Understand that this may mean a trip to the station.",How to Report Physical Conditions That Interfere with a Field Sobriety Test1," Anytime you're pulled over, avoid making the situation confrontational from the start. Remind yourself that the officer is simply doing their job. Avoid saying or doing anything that makes the officer feel threatened.Generally, things will go more smoothly if you treat the officer with respect. If you have questions to ask, try to do so in a non-confrontational manner.
For example, you might say ""Excuse me, officer, but I was wondering if you could explain why you pulled me over?"" Avoid implying that the officer is picking on you, or insisting that you did nothing wrong.
If you don't understand the officer's answer, simply say you don't understand and ask for clarification. This is less antagonistic than saying something like ""That doesn't make any sense!""
You also want to caution anyone in your car to remain calm as well. Remind them not to make any sudden movements or act disrespectful.;
, The officer may ask you in such a way that makes you think you have no choice. However, you are within your rights to refuse to take a field sobriety test.If the officer asks you to step out of the car, you should comply with this request. However, if the officer indicates that they want you to perform field sobriety tests, you can say no.
Keep your refusal direct and respectful. For example, you might say ""I understand field sobriety tests are voluntary. I don't feel comfortable completing those exercises right now.""
The officer may phrase the question in such a way that you can simply say ""no."" If that's an option, that's all you need to say.

, Let the officer know of any physical conditions that you believe will interfere with the field sobriety test. If the officer is willing to make arrangements to eliminate the problem, you can choose whether to take the field sobriety test at that point.When you tell the officer you're not willing to take a field sobriety test, they may ask you why. This gives you the opportunity to explain yourself.
Be honest with your reasons. It can harm your case later if you say something that turns out to be untrue. For example, if you say you have an inner-ear infection that affects your balance when you don't, you appear dishonest and untrustworthy.
The officer may press you on why you believe the condition will interfere with the field sobriety test, or otherwise try to pressure you into taking the test. Remember that you are within your rights to refuse, regardless of what the officer says.
This also is true if the officer provides a way to eliminate the condition. For example, if you don't believe you can walk heel-to-toe in a straight line because you're wearing heels, and the officer says you can remove your shoes, you still can refuse. It's okay if you don't want to walk barefooted on the public street.

, If the officer is convinced that you are drinking and driving and you won't take a field sobriety test, the officer may decide to arrest you. Once at the police station, you will be given a blood test to measure your blood-alcohol level.Instead of field sobriety tests, the officer may decide to give you a breathalyzer. Or they may decide to arrest you and administer a blood test at the station.
Keep in mind that even before you're formally arrested, you have the right to remain silent. The officer may ask you questions to determine where you were before you were pulled over, or what you were doing.
You do not have to answer these questions – and shouldn't if you're worried the answers will incriminate you. For example, if you are returning with a bar where you went to celebrate a friend's birthday, don't tell the officer that.
Understand that you aren't being arrested for refusing to attempt a field sobriety test. You have the right to refuse. The officer must have some other reason (also known as ""probable cause"") to believe you are driving under the influence before they can arrest you.

Understand that swelling can be caused by any number of scenarios.,
Understand the other causes of swelling.,
Exercise your swollen fingers.,
Elevate your hands and fingers.,
Rub your swollen fingers.,
Wear compression gloves.,
Limit salt in your diet.,
Maintain a moderate temperature in your home or office.,
Take medications.",How to Reduce Swollen Fingers," Knowing the medical reasons behind the swelling will help you plan a treatment for your swelling.



Swelling caused by injury. Injury is one of the most common culprits. Liquids such as blood accumulate in the affected area, causing swelling. Treat an injury first by applying cold (this will constrict the blood vessels), then by applying heat(this will help flush out the fluids).
If your bruise or injury lasts longer than two weeks, symptoms get more severe or frequent, or signs of skin infection develop, talk to your doctor immediately.;
, These scenarios are also something to watch out for.



Swelling caused by allergic reaction. When your body encounters something that it's allergic to, it released histamines into your bloodstream.In order to reduce the swelling, you can take antihistamines. If you experience severe difficulty in breathing after an allergic reaction, consult a doctor immediately.

Swelling caused by obesity. Obesity causes the body's lymphatic system to slow down, resulting in edema in the hands and feet. Talk with a doctor or dietician to come up with a weight-loss plan if you believe your swelling may be the result of obesity.

Swelling caused by infection. Your hands might be experiencing carpal tunnel syndrome or cellulitis, for example. Some bacterial infections that affect the hands get into the blood stream and lymph nodes, so it's important to talk to your doctor if you suspect any infection.

, Move your fingers around pump excess fluid back to the heart. Motion causes blood flow to the area, which stimulates the pressure necessary to pump excess fluids away. Exercises may be as simple as typing at a keyboard, flexing your fingers or using your hands to get dressed or fix breakfast. Any movement of your fingers will reduce swelling.


If you don't have time for traditional exercise, think about a quick 15-minute walk once a day. Walking just 10-15 minutes is a great way to increase circulation throughout your body. Swing or move your hands up and down while you walk.
People who suffer from obesity are more prone to edema because the lymphatic system works slower. Swelling may diminish if the lymphatic system kicks in again. Exercising more often, planning out a healthy diet of fruits, vegetables and protein, and drinking more water may assist the body in getting the lymphatic system running to its full potential.

, Swelling can be caused by poor circulation or blood that stagnates in your hands. Elevating your hands will help any accumulated blood flow back down to the body.


Raise your swollen fingers above your heart for 30 minutes at least 3 or 4 times per day to treat severe edema. Doctors also recommend elevating your hands above your heart when sleeping.
Keep your hands and fingers elevated for a short period of time to alleviate minor swelling.
Try raising your hands up above your head, interlocking them, and bringing them down behind your head. Move your head back and create a little bit of resistance. After 30 seconds, release your hands, shake them out, and repeat process multiple times.

, Massage the tissues in the swollen fingers toward your heart. Use strong, firm rubbing motions. A hand massage will stimulate the muscles and blood flow to your fingers, which will help push out the excess fluid that causes your fingers to swell.


Consider getting a professional hand and foot massage. Hand and foot massages can be very affordable.
Give yourself a hand massage. Using the thumb and forefinger of one hand, clamp lightly but securely onto the opposite hand. Run your thumb and forefinger from the base of the palm to the end of a finger. Repeat for each finger, then switch hands.

, Compression gloves apply pressure to your hands and fingers, which deters the collection of excess fluids.

, Salt causes your body to retain extra water and fluids, which may affect your fingers. By limiting your salt intake, you reduce the chances of retaining extra fluids. If you feel food is too bland with less salt, use other seasonings to flavor your foods.

, A moderate temperature will encourage better circulation. Keep the temperature around you steady to reduce finger swelling that results from extreme temperature changes.


Studies show that hot showers, baths and compresses increase swelling on affected body parts, including fingers. Exposure to extremely cold temperatures may also increase swelling. If the swelling in your hands is caused by a bruise, moderate cold (such as an icepack wrapped in cloth) will reduce the swelling.

, Diuretics often reduce fluid retention in patients who have edema and swelling. With medication prescribed by your doctor, the swelling in your fingers may be relieved.

Start with seated neck tilts.,
Do chin to chest stretches.,
Try swinging arm stretch.,
Do a forward fold with a chest opening.,
Use a wall to do a standing neck stretch.,
Do cobra pose to stretch and strengthen your neck muscles.,
Try shoulder shrugs.",How to Reduce Neck Tension1," Neck tilts are a good way to start your neck stretching routine, as they will help to lengthen the larger muscles in your neck and relax your whole body. Lengthening and stretching the small muscles in your neck can also prevent tension headaches.Sit in a comfortable cross-legged position on an exercise mat or a soft surface. You can use props like a yoga block or a pillow and sit on them to make the seated position more comfortable.
Inhale and tilt your head to the right side. Extend and elongate your neck towards the space to your right, rather than try to bring your ear to your shoulder. You should feel a stretch on your left shoulder and the left side of your neck. Hold this position for three breaths.
As you exhale, raise your neck and look forward. Then, inhale as you tilt your head to the left side. Hold this position for three breaths.
You can repeat this exercise two to three times on each side. You can also add some resistance by placing your hand against your head and gently applying pressure to your head as you tilt your head to one side. If you are tilting your head to the right side, for example, you would use your left hand to apply light pressure on the left side of your head. Do not pull or tug on your neck and only apply light, gentle pressure on your head.;
, Open up your neck muscles with simple but effective chin to chest stretches.Sit in a comfortable cross legged position with any props like a pillow or a block to help tip your pelvis forward. Inhale and slowly lower your chin towards your chest. Imagine you are holding an egg between your chin and chest and you do not want to drop it.
Hold this stretch for two to three breaths. You should feel your neck muscles and your shoulder muscles lengthening.
Inhale as you lift your head and return to the starting position. Repeat this exercise two to three times, holding for two to three breathes at a time.

, This simple standing stretch will get your torso and arms moving and help to release any tension in your neck and shoulders.Begin in a standing pose with your feet hip width apart and your arms down by your sides. Start to swing your arms from side to side. Use your torso and your shoulders to turn your body gently from side to side, letting your arms also swing side to side. Swing your arms and body for six to ten breaths.
You can also make your hands into fists and swing your arms so your fists land just about each hip. Repeat this for six to ten breaths.

, This standing pose is great for releasing tension in your neck and shoulders.Stand with your legs two to three feet apart on a mat. Turn your feet in so your toes are turned inward and your heels are turned slightly outward. Clasp your hands behind your back so your fingers intertwined and your palms are as close together as possible. Inhale as you lift your chest to the ceiling, with your neck facing upward.
Exhale as you slowly bend forward between your legs, bending at your hips and not your lower back. Let your clasped hands raise up towards the ceiling and allow gravity to slowly let them fall over your head.
Hold this position for six to eight breaths. Allow your head to hang heavy and continue to clasp your hands tightly together. You should feel a stretch on your neck and shoulder muscles.

, You can use the corner of a wall to help stretch your neck muscles and relieve any tension you are holding in this area.Start by standing about two feet back from the corner of the wall, facing towards the corner. Keep your feet together and place equal weight in both feet.
Place your forearms on each wall, with your elbows just below the height of your shoulders. Inhale and lean in as far as you can without feeling any pain. You should feel a stretch on the front of your shoulders and your chest.
Hold the stretch for about six to eight breaths. You can repeat this stretch three to five times a day.

, Once you have warmed up your neck muscles with several opening stretches, you can try a cobra pose to strengthen your shoulder muscles, and your neck and upper back muscles. This pose can help improve your posture and your overall spine health. It is recommended that you stretch out tense neck muscles first before doing cobra pose.Begin by lying face down on a mat, with your forehead flat on the mat or resting on a thin towel for support. Your arms should be at your sides, with your palms flat on the mat. Place your tongue on the roof of your mouth, as this will help to stabilize your neck muscles.
Inhale and squeeze your shoulder blades together as you lift your hands and arms, letting them hover a few inches above the mat. Lift your forehead about an inch off the mat with your gaze straight ahead and down.
Hold this position for six to eight breaths, making sure your head is facing downward and you are putting weight into your legs and pressing your toes down on the mat.
Repeat this pose again two to three times. Rest between each pose with one side of your head flat on the mat.

, Shoulder shrugs work the upper shoulder and neck muscles. Sit in a chair or stand with your feet flat and shoulder width apart. Let your arms hang at your sides as you raise your shoulders up as if you are trying to touch your ears with your shoulders. Hold this position for 10 seconds.Repeat three to four times per day.

Put witch hazel on the cyst.,
Apply apple cider vinegar to help dry out the cyst.,
Use dry burdock root to draw out the proteins in the cyst.,
Apply chamomile tea to the cyst.,
Use bloodroot on the cyst.,
Apply a warm compress on the cyst.",How to Remove a Sebaceous Cyst2," Certain essential oils have anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties, which can reduce the swelling of the cyst and lower the risk of infection, though this has not yet been medically proven.You can use essential oils directly on the cyst or mixed with castor oil to dilute the essential oil. If you decide to use castor oil, use three parts essential oil to seven parts castor oil. Tea tree oil, turmeric oil, garlic oil, and frankincense oil can all help to reduce the size of the cyst.
Apply a small amount of the essential oils to the cyst four times a day with a cotton ball or a Q-tip. Cover the cyst with a small bandage once you have applied the oil. If the cyst does not reduce in size within one to two weeks or is still inflamed and painful, contact your doctor.

, Astringent herbs like aloe vera can be used to “pull out” the protein keratin, sebum, and other fluids in the cyst.After applying the aloe vera, rinse the area with warm water. Do this three to four times a day. You can also apply castor oil in the same manner, repeating the application three to four times a day.

, Use a cotton ball or a Q-tip to apply it directly to the cyst, repeating the application three to four times a day., If you are sensitive to apple cider vinegar, you can dilute it with equal parts water. Apply it three to four times a day., Combine ½ teaspoons of dried burdock root with 1 tablespoon honey and apply the mixture directly to the cyst, three to four times a day., Chamomile has been known to promote healing. You can soak a bag of chamomile tea and then apply the warm bag directly to the cyst three to four times a day., Bloodroot is used in Native American medicine to treat skin disorders, including cysts. Mix ⅛ teaspoon bloodroot powder with 2 tablespoons castor oil and apply it to the cyst with a Q-tip.Only use a small amount of bloodroot on skin with no breaks or cuts. Do not swallow any bloodroot or use it around your eyes, mouth, or genital area.

, Use a clean washcloth soaked in warm water on the cyst. Apply the warm compress at least four times a day for 10 minutes at a time.


You can also soak the washcloth in chamomile tea, ½ cup water and ½ cup chamomile tea steeped for 10 minutes, and apply it to the cyst.
Alternatively, you can soak the washcloth in diluted apple cider vinegar, with equal amounts of apple cider vinegar boiled in water, and apply it to the cyst.

Evaluate the evidence against you.,
Line up expert witnesses.,
Negotiate with the prosecutor.,
Consider completing any required programs in advance.,
Be open to pleading guilty to a lesser charge.",How to Report Physical Conditions That Interfere with a Field Sobriety Test2," If you were charged with a DUI based solely on a failed field sobriety test, the physical conditions that interfered with that test may carry more weight. However, your case may be more challenging if the failed field sobriety test is supported by additional evidence of your intoxication.After you're charged, you have a right to any evidence that the prosecutor intends to use against you. This includes police reports or any statements made by the arresting officer.
You can use this evidence to uncover weaknesses in the prosecution's case. If there is very little evidence that you had been drinking, you may be able to convince the prosecuting attorney to drop the charges against you.
For example, suppose you failed a field sobriety test, but you have a neurological condition that makes it difficult for you to complete many of the tests, regardless of whether you've been drinking.
The officer pulled you over after your car swerved. However, you were swerving to avoid hitting a kitten in the road. The officer did not observe any of the common traits of drunkenness: your eyes were clear, you weren't slurring your speech, and you didn't smell of alcohol.
In that case, the prosecuting attorney may be more amenable to believing your story and offering you the opportunity to plead guilty to a lesser offense.

, If you personally have a physical or medical condition that you believe interfered with the field sobriety test, testimony from your doctor or another medical professional can help solidify your case.Once you have a medical professional who is prepared to testify that the field sobriety test results cannot be trusted in your case due to your physical or medical condition, the prosecution's case weakens.
Some medical conditions, such as acid reflux or diabetes, also can influence the results of breathalyzer tests. If the officer gave you a breathalyzer after you failed the field sobriety test, these factors may come into play.
Keep in mind that not only do you need experts to testify regarding your condition, they also must be able to explain how that condition would interfere with the field sobriety test.
Generally, it's important for your witnesses also to be able to explain that despite the fact you were unable to pass the field sobriety test, your condition did not interfere with your ability to operate your car safely.

, At any time prior to trial, you can discuss the charges against you with the prosecutor. This negotiation is commonly referred to as plea bargaining, because it generally involves you agreeing to plead guilty to a lesser charge.Typically you'll have an attorney in a criminal case, but there's no reason you can't negotiate with the prosecutor on your own. However, you'll generally come out better having an attorney on your side to conduct the negotiations.
If you have significant evidence that you can use to challenge the field sobriety tests, the prosecutor may decide it's not worth it to take the case to trial – particularly if there is no other evidence of your intoxication.
However, don't take it for granted that you can get your charges dismissed, regardless of how strong your evidence is. Having DUI charges dismissed is incredibly challenging, even if it's your first ever brush with the law.

, There may be driver safety or responsibility classes that are required in your jurisdiction for anyone convicted of either DUI or other serious moving violations.The prosecuting attorney may even tell you about these programs, or require that you complete them as a condition of reducing or dismissing the charges against you.
You also may be required to be evaluated by a substance abuse professional. You probably want to talk to someone anyway if you were drinking and driving, or if you have problems with alcohol and need help and support.
Keep in mind that taking these classes or getting an evaluation typically will end up costing you several hundred dollars. However, that's still a lot less than you could pay if you were convicted of drunk driving.

, If there is scant evidence of your intoxication apart from questionable results on a field sobriety test, the prosecutor may be more willing to work with you. However, you probably still will face other charges for your irresponsible behavior while operating a motor vehicle.Keep in mind that even if you're able to get the DUI charge dismissed, any other charges regarding the way you were driving usually stand. This means you may end up having to plead guilty to those other charges, even if you have a decent defense.
Typically, a prosecuting attorney may be willing to allow you to plead guilty to reckless driving if the evidence against you is particularly weak.
Reckless driving carries its own stiff penalties, but generally is not as bad as having a DUI on your record.
However, many prosecutors are willing to risk a not-guilty verdict at trial rather than plead down a DUI charge. This is particularly true if you were driving in a particularly unsafe manner, were involved in a traffic accident, or endangered the physical safety of others.

Hire a private criminal defense attorney.,
Cross-examine the prosecution's witnesses.,
Call your own witnesses.,
Be prepared to take the stand yourself.,
Emphasize the burden of proof.",How to Report Physical Conditions That Interfere with a Field Sobriety Test3," When you are charged with a crime, you're entitled to an attorney. You may be appointed a public defender if you have little income or assets. However, a private attorney typically is worth the cost if you plan to challenge the results of a field sobriety test.Keep in mind that public defenders carry heavy case loads and may not be able to commit the time and energy to your case that would be necessary to successfully demonstrate physical conditions that interfered with the field sobriety test.
You typically can find an attorney referral program offered through your state or local bar association to help you identify attorneys best suited to represent you.
Some of these programs can be found on the bar association's website. You'll have to answer a few questions to be matched with potential attorneys.
Research an attorney thoroughly before you decide to hire them. Make sure they have a good reputation and experience working in the city or county where you've been charged.
Most criminal defense attorneys offer free initial consultations, which can help you evaluate an attorney and decide whether they're right for you. Ask plenty of questions to determine whether the attorney understands your goals for the case and is willing to fight for you.

, The prosecutor typically will call the officer who arrested you to testify at trial. Since field sobriety tests rely on subjective observations of the officer at the scene, careful cross-examination can expose weaknesses in the officer's testimony.You might ask the police officer about the weather conditions when you performed the field sobriety tests.
For example, if high winds were blowing dust in your eyes, this could have caused your eyes to be bloodshot as well as decreased your ability to smoothly follow the officer's finger with your eyes in one field sobriety test.
If you mentioned any conditions at the scene, and the officer convinced you to take the field sobriety tests anyway, you can bring this up on cross-examination. Even though the officer said they would take that condition into account, they may not have or may not have known how to do so.
Officers generally are trained not to administer certain tests, such as the ""one leg stand,"" to people over the age of 65, or who are more than 50 pounds overweight.
These conditions can limit a person's ability to successfully complete those tests. If either of those conditions apply to you, question the officer on their training and why the officer gave you those tests despite knowing they were problematic.

, If there were passengers in your car when you were pulled over, their observations may contrast with the officer's. You also may want to call expert witnesses if you are arguing that the results of the field sobriety test were skewed by a physical or medical condition you have.Your own witnesses can help establish physical conditions that interfered with the field sobriety tests, as well as explain why those conditions could result in your inability to successfully complete the tests.
Physical conditions don't necessarily have to relate to you personally – they could be conditions at the scene. In these cases, anyone else who was present can support your story that those conditions were to blame for your failed field sobriety test.
Keep in mind that any witnesses you call also can be cross-examined by the prosecuting attorney.

, When you are charged with a crime, you always have the right to remain silent. However, if you're challenging the results of a field sobriety test because of interference by physical conditions, it may be helpful to describe those conditions yourself.Your testimony may be necessary if conversation at the scene between you and the officer is at issue, or if you were unable to successfully complete the field sobriety test due to temporary conditions at the scene.
If you don't have any additional eyewitnesses, however, your testimony might not be advisable. In that situation, it would essentially be your word against the police officer's, and the jury will almost always side with the police officer.
Your attorney will discuss with you the pros and cons of testifying yourself. Your attorney may tell you what they think you should do, but remember that this is always your choice and your choice alone.

, When challenging the prosecution's evidence, you don't have to prove that your story is true. You only have to introduce a reasonable doubt that you committed the crime with which you were charged.It can be helpful to continually remind the jury of this burden. You are innocent until proven guilty. If even one jury has a single reasonable doubt that you were driving drunk, they cannot vote to convict you.
Because of this burden, you can even introduce various potential problems with the field sobriety test that might seem to contradict each other – what lawyers call ""arguing in the alternative.""
You're allowed to do this because you don't have to prove that one particular story is true, just show that the prosecution has not effectively proven that their story is true.

Take a hot bath.",How to Reduce Neck Tension2," Massage can help you to work out and release any tension in your neck muscles, especially if you tend to feel tension in the same spot on your neck. These trigger points are tight knots of muscle fiber that are stressed or strained.To give yourself a neck massage, start by using your thumb and forefinger to gently press on the muscles that line your neck and shoulder area, also known as the trapezius muscle, which stretches from the base of your skull down to the middle of your back and over your shoulder. You may feel multiple trigger points on your trapezius muscle. These trigger points will feel rope like and when you apply light pressure, you may feel discomfort spread throughout the muscle area.
Use your thumb and forefinger or your knuckles to gently rub and knead out your strained neck muscles. If there is a coworker, friend, or partner nearby, you may ask them to help you rub and knead out the trigger points on your trapezius muscles.
You can also get a professional massage done on your neck and shoulder muscles. Going for monthly massages can help to reduce neck tension and pain.

, You can also use a foam roller to massage out your trigger points and release any neck tension. Foam rollers can be found at most exercise supply stores. Look for a full length, six inch diameter foam roll.


Place the foam roll on the ground or on an exercise mat. Lie down on it lengthwise, with your upper back on the foam roll. You can place your hands on your hips or on either side of your body.
Keeping your torso parallel to the ground, roll your upper back and scapular muscles sideways against the foam roller. You should start to feel tension releasing in any sore trigger points.
Roll at least 20 times on each side of your body to release neck and shoulder tension. You can use the foam roller on a daily basis to help manage any muscle pain or tightness.

, Heat can help to reduce pain and muscle spasms on your neck. Wrap the heat pack in a towel and hold it to your neck for 20 minutes at a time.You can also apply a cold pack wrapped in a towel on your neck as cold temperatures can also offer pain relief.

, A long, relaxing soak in hot water can help to sooth any tense muscles in your neck and shoulders. Try to lay down on your back in the bath so your neck and shoulders can soak and relax in the hot water.You can also take a hot shower but make sure you stand in the hot water long enough for your neck muscles to warm up and relax. Try sitting on a small stool while letting the shower run down the back of your neck.
You can perform your gentle neck stretches while sitting or standing in the shower. This allows you to stretch more while letting the hot shower warm up your muscles.

Sleep on a low, firm pillow.,
Adjust your posture when you are sitting for long periods of time.,
Drink lots of water throughout the day.,
Do at least 150 minutes of exercise a week.,
Take pain medication to help alleviate the pain.",How to Reduce Neck Tension3," Sleeping on too many pillows can cause your neck to bend unnaturally or at an awkward position that can cause neck tension. Try to sleep on only one to two pillows or get a cervical pillow, which are contoured to support your head and neck. These pillows also keep your neck aligned with your spine.The best sleeping position for reduced neck tension is on your back, with your entire spine resting comfortably on the bed. If you prefer to sleep on one side or on your stomach, your pillow should be no higher than 4 – 6 inches off the bed.

, Neck tension is often caused by sitting in one position for long periods of time, usually when working on a computer or driving in a car for several hours at a time. Adjusting your posture in these stationary positions can help to reduce neck tension and improve your spinal health.When sitting at a computer, try to adjust your posture so your alignment is correct and you are not putting excessive stress on your neck muscles. Move your computer screen so it is at eye level on your desk. Test the setup of your computer by sitting in your office chair. Make sure your gaze is directly in the center of your computer screen.
You should also try to keep your head in the center of your computer screen, rather than drifting forward over your shoulders or to one side. You can also use a hands-free device, like a headset, if you talk on the phone throughout the day and do not want to have to hold the phone between your ear and your shoulder.
If you are looking at any notebook or notes while typing at your computer, you can use a paper holder next to your computer screen. This will help you avoid keeping your head turned and down to one side while typing.
Take breaks throughout the work day and move around every 30 minutes so your neck does not tense up or get stuck in one position.

, The spinal discs that sit between the vertebrae of your spine contain mostly water. Sipping water throughout the day will ensure your body stays hydrated and your spinal discs remain healthy and fluid. Try to drink at least five to eight glasses of water a day., Getting your body moving through exercise at least once a day can help to alleviate tension in your muscles and strengthen your muscles so they are less likely to tighten up. If you are worried about injuring your neck with intense exercise, try light exercise like a gentle yoga class, swimming, or jogging.Never put undue stress on your neck if it is stressed or tense. Avoid contact sports if you are experiencing neck tension and neck pain, as well as more intense aerobics classes.

, If your neck tension is causing discomfort that cannot be stretched out, you can take regular doses of pain medication like ibuprofen or paracetamol to control the pain.If the neck tension does not alleviate in several days or weeks, despite the use of painkillers and neck stretches, you should see your doctor. Your doctor will examine your neck and ask you questions about your daily routine to determine if your neck tension is the result of a more serious medical issue.

Take steps to reduce your blood pressure.Elevated blood pressure puts a lot of strain on the kidneys, and since persistent proteinuria (elevated protein in the urine) is almost always linked to a problem in the kidneys, reducing your blood pressure can help the problem significantly.,
Opt for a blood pressure medication.Essentially everyone who is diagnosed with a level of kidney disease or kidney disfunction (which are the primary reasons for persistently elevated protein in the urine) receives a blood pressure medication from their doctor.,
Ask your doctor about other medical treatments.For instance, if you have an underlying autoimmune disease causing kidney problems (and hence protein in your urine), you may need medications to suppress your immune system.,
Diagnose the cause.,
Determine which type of ""proteinuria"" (elevated protein in the urine) you are experiencing.There are three types of proteinuria, and the good news is that two out of the three require no treatment and usually resolve all on their own, with time.,
Evaluate any transient stresses you may be experiencing.As previously mentioned, if you are currently ill with a fever, exercising more than usual, or suffering from other acute stressors in your life, the protein levels in your urine may be elevated transiently as a result of this stress.,
Request repeat urine tests.It is key to obtain repeat urine tests.,
Get blood tests.Additional diagnostic testing that your doctor may perform includes blood tests, particularly if he or she suspects that you may have underlying kidney disease or other health problems.,
Get a kidney biopsy.,
Be aware that protein in the urine during pregnancy is another matter.",How to Reduce Protein in Urine," Lifestyle strategies to reduce your blood pressure include:


Decreasing the salt in your diet. To do so, avoid excess table salt on foods prepared at home. Perhaps more importantly, avoid eating out too frequently, or consuming too many processed foods, as these are known to be high in salt (significantly more so, on average, than foods prepared at home).
Cutting back on cholesterol. Cholesterol build-up contributes to plaques forming in your arteries, which in turn leads to an increased blood pressure. Ask your doctor for blood tests to measure your fat and cholesterol levels to see if this is an area of your diet that could use improvement.;
, Specifically, the ideal one for doctors to prescribe is an ""ACE inhibitor"" (an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor). Examples include Ramipril, Captopril, and Lisinopril. The benefit of this specific class of blood pressure medication is that it has additional benefit (and a ""protective effect"") for your kidneys.


Ask your doctor about receiving a prescription for this medication, if you are not taking it already.
You may need more than one blood pressure medication in more severe cases of kidney disease.

, If your kidney troubles (and proteinuria) are a complications of diabetes, you may need medications such as Metformin or Insulin to obtain better daily control of your blood sugar levels. There are many potential diagnoses that could lead to kidney trouble and resulting proteinuria, so speak with your doctor to come up with the best medical management for your specific case.

, It is important to understand that they only way to reduce (or treat) protein in your urine is by diagnosing the underlying cause.This is because protein in the urine is not a diagnosis in itself; rather, it is a symptom indicating that something else is going on. It is only in the diagnosing and treating of that ""something else"" that the elevated protein level itself can be best addressed and dealt with.

, The third type, however, requires a more comprehensive medical examination to determine the underlying cause. The three types are:



Transient proteinuria. This is when a urine test reveals elevated protein on one reading, but the level diminishes on its own and ultimately returns to normal with subsequent readings.Transient proteinuria is normally related to acute stresses such as an illness causing a fever, or more exercise than usual (such as training for a marathon). Once the stress passes, or your body adapts to it, your protein levels should also return to normal.

Orthostatic proteinuria. This is when the abnormal protein levels are related to postural changes (standing versus sitting versus lying down).It is uncommon, and more likely to be present in adolescents; if present, it does not require treatment, and it almost always resolves itself by adulthood.

Persistent proteinuria. This is when the protein levels in your urine remain elevated with repeat testing.It is indicative of an underlying problem such as kidney disease, diabetes, autoimmune disease, or another medical condition. It will require a series of tests for diagnostic purposes, as well as medical treatment.

, The key here is to see your doctor again a few days later for a repeat urine test (and a repeat measurement), at which point he or she can confirm that your protein levels have diminished and/or hopefully returned to normal. If you are experiencing ""transient proteinuria,"" the great news is that there is nothing you need to do to treat it, and your levels will return to normal on their own within a few days to a couple weeks.


Note that if you are experiencing an ""acute stressor"" (such as fever, exercise, or something else), you should still see your doctor for repeat urine tests to confirm that nothing more serious is going on.

, This is because it is important to obtain a series of measurements of the protein in your urine, to see how it is progressing and whether or not it is improving on its own. Your doctor may offer you a urine test to do in the washroom in his or her clinic, or he or she may ask you to take it home and to return it to the lab once you have collected the urine sample. Note that if you store your urine at home, it needs to be kept cool in the refrigerator until you are able to deliver it to the lab for formal analysis.

, If your doctor orders blood tests, he or she will likely be measuring the BUN (blood urea nitrogen) and the Creatinine.Both of these are kidney function tests, providing your doctor with valuable information about the health of your kidneys.


Your doctor may also order other blood tests such as HbA1c (a diabetes test), or autoimmune antibodies if he or she suspects an underlying autoimmune disease.
It will all depend on your medical history, and the medical conditions that your doctor thinks you are most at risk of having.

, In some cases, a kidney biopsy is also required as a further investigation to determine the cause of the protein in your urine.This is more rare; however, it may be needed if your doctor cannot otherwise determine the cause.

, If you are currently pregnant and have elevated protein levels, it may be due to a condition called preeclampsia. Check out How to Deal With Pre-Eclampsia for more information on preeclampsia and elevated protein levels in your urine during pregnancy.

However, new research shows that lactic acid (which operates as a temporary fuel source during intense physical activity) washes out of the system within an hour of the end of a workout, so it cannot be responsible for the pain felt days later.


The latest theory suggests that this muscle pain -- also known as delayed onset muscle soreness or DOMS -- is the result of damage to the muscle cells during intense exercise. This causes inflammation, swelling and tenderness as the muscles repair themselves.In order to reduce muscle soreness after a workout, it is necessary to do a proper warm up before exercising. This wakes up the muscles and prepares them for physical activity. It is also important to avoid pushing yourself past your physical limit and to build up your workouts gradually instead.;
, On the other hand, built-up lactic acid is responsible for the burning sensation you experience while pushing yourself hard during a workout.


Usually, the body uses oxygen to produce energy in the body. However, when you push yourself hard during a workout, your body requires energy faster than your body can produce it using aerobic methods.
When this happens, your body uses anaerobic methods to produce energy, as it can do this much faster than with aerobic methods. Lactic acid - or lactate - is a by-product of these anaerobic energy production methods.
Your body can continue to produce energy anaerobically for up to three minutes. During this time, levels of lactic acid in your muscles begin to increase rapidly, which leads to the burning sensation you associate with intense physical activity.
After 3 minutes, the lactic acid begins to slow down the muscles, warning your body that it is close to its physical limit. In this way it operates as a defense mechanism, protecting you from injury and fatigue.
Even though small quantities of lactic acid are necessary and even good for your body in certain circumstances, it is still necessary to prevent lactic acid levels from building up too quickly. If you don't, you will find it hard to work out comfortably or to the best of your ability.
Reducing lactic acid build up -- though it won't prevent DOMS - will help you to work out harder for longer, which is essential for any good athlete., Lactic acid is water soluble, so the more hydrated you are, the less likely you are to feel a burn while you workout and cause lactic acid build up.


Drink plenty of fluids while you work out. By the time you notice you are thirsty during a workout, you may already be dehydrated.
Drink 8 to 16 oz. (236.6 ml to 473 ml) of water before you workout, then drink 8 oz. (236.6 ml) of water for every 20 minutes you workout.

, The cause of the burning sensation you feel in your muscles while exercising is twofold: it is partly due to the build up of lactic acid, but it is also due to a lack of oxygen.


You can ameliorate this by paying close attention to your breathing while you exercise. Be sure to breathe deeply in and out, at an even pace. Try breathing in through your nose and out through your mouth.
This will help to deliver oxygen to your muscles and stop the production of lactic acid., The more physically fit you are, the less glucose your body will need to burn and there will be less acid build up.


You should try to work out several times a week, but make sure to take at least one or two rest days to allow your muscles to recover.
Increase the intensity of your workouts gradually. Develop a workout plan to add minutes or repetitions slowly to your routine - this will gradually raise the level at which your body starts to produce lactic acid.

, Weightlifting is an activity that tends to promote lactic acid build up because it requires more oxygen than our bodies can deliver.


Although we have been told to ""feel the burn,"" a build up of lactic acid may also lead to micro-tears that can cause trauma in the muscles and leave you sore for days.
Be sure to increase the weight and repetitions gradually to keep healthy levels of lactic acid in the body.

, The burning sensation you feel during intense exercise is the body's defense mechanism trying to prevent overexertion.


If you are doing aerobic activities, like running, walking fast, biking or using an elliptical or stair stepper, slow your speed. If you are doing weights, lower the number of repetitions or reduce the size of the weight.
As you catch your breath, more oxygen will be delivered to your muscles and release the lactic acid.

, Since lactic acid disperses 30 minutes to an hour after your workout, stretching helps to release lactic acid, alleviating any burning sensations or muscle cramps you might be experiencing.


Stretch your muscles lightly follow any intense exercise, and also use your fingertips to massage the area gently.This will also decrease any micro-trauma that may be responsible for soreness in the days following a workout.

, Rest after your workout, but lead an active life. Muscles need activity as well as oxygen and water to stay healthy. If you feel a burn in your muscles occasionally, there is no cause for alarm; lactic acid in small amounts is not damaging to your body and may even have some beneficial effects on your metabolism.

, The mineral magnesium is essential for proper energy production within the body. Healthy magnesium levels will help the body to deliver energy to the muscles while exercising, thus limiting the build up of lactic acid. Therefore, you should make an effort to increase your daily magnesium intake, preferably through your diet.


Vegetables like swiss chard, spinach, collard greens, turnip greens and green beans, legumes like navy beans, pinto beans, kidney beans and lima beans and seeds such as pumpkin, sesame and sunflower seeds are all excellent sources of magnesium. Tofu - especially nigari tofu - is particularly rich in magnesium.
It is also possible to increase magnesium intake through supplements, however, with a healthy diet rich in the food sources described above, this should not be necessary., A healthy intake of foods rich in fatty acids helps the body to break down glucose, a process which is essential for normal energy production. This can help to limit the body's need for lactic acid during a tough workout and keep you going for longer.


Get essential fatty acids from cold water fish like salmon, tuna and mackerel, from nuts and seeds like walnuts and flaxseed and from plant oils such as corn oil, sunflower oil and soybean oil.Fatty acids also work to reduce inflammation, which helps to lessen muscle soreness in the days following a tough workout.

, Baking soda is an alkaline substance, so when taken internally it can help to neutralize the lactic acid that builds up in the muscles.


This can help you to work out harder for longer, as your muscles will not start to burn as quickly.
For the correct quantity, mix 0.3g of baking soda for every kilogram of body weight into 12 oz of cold water. Add a little lemon juice to improve the flavor, if you like.

, B vitamins are useful in transporting glucose around the body, which helps to fuel the muscles during a workout, thus reducing the need for lactic acid.


Foods that contain high quantities of B vitamins include leafy green vegetables, cereals, peas and beans, along with protein-rich foods such as fish, beef, poultry, eggs and dairy products.Foods high in B vitamins also help to replenish the body with other nutrients that are lost during intense exercise.

Ask your doctor about helpful medications.",How to Reduce Heart Palpitations," Some people experience heart palpitations due to physical overexertion or being too active;however, an increased heart rate from exercise or anxiety (called tachycardia) is not the same as palpitations. Both can happen at the same time, although palpitations are defined best as unusual heart beats, not just fast heart beats.


If your palpitations seem to be sometimes triggered by exercise, then stop what you're doing and rest for five to 10 minutes and catch your breath.
Alternatively, reduce your exertions or change your exercise to something less strenuous. Walk instead of jogging, for example. Lift smaller weights. Gently tread water in the pool instead of doing strokes.

Resting heart rates vary between people, but it's typically between 60 and 100 beats per minute.Palpitations can occur above, below or within the normal heart beat range.;
, Moderate-to-high levels of stress and anxiety are relatively common triggers for heart palpitations due to the release of too much ""stress hormones"" into the bloodstream.Thus, you may be able to prevent or reduce your palpitations by managing how you react or respond to stressful situations. Stress-relieving techniques like yoga, tai chi, deep breathing, visualization, meditation, biofeedback and aromatherapy are all helpful for promoting relaxation and better heart health.Ask at your local gym, community center, church or health clinic about joining a yoga or tai chi class.
Taking deep breaths can naturally lower your heart rate and reduce the occurrence of heart palpitations, especially if you practice positive visualizations or guided imagery.Buy some relaxing aromatherapy candles (lavender scented, for example) and light them in the evenings prior to going to bed.
Don't forget to get enough sleep — at least eight hours per night, although some people need a little more. A chronic lack of sleep can lead to anxiety and heart palpitations.
Remove yourself from stressful situations, such as arguments. Quit focusing on financial problems. Stop watching scary movies or shows.

, There are a number of substances that affect your central nervous system (CNS) and can trigger heart palpitations, including alcohol, caffeine, nicotine, illicit drugs (such as cocaine and amphetamines) and some over-the-counter medications (particularly cold and cough medicines).Thus, if you're having periodic heart palpitations, consider what you're putting into your body on a regular basis, because it could very likely be the cause.



Cut back on caffeine. Rich sources include coffee, black and green teas, most soda pop (especially colas), energy drinks and chocolate.

Stop smoking. Nicotine from cigarette smoking can increase your resting heart rate up to 15 beats/min and increase blood pressure up to 10mm Hg.Stop binge drinking. Alcohol is actually a CNS depressant instead of a stimulant, but binge drinking often increases heart rate and chronic alcoholism tends to cause fluctuations (from too high to too low).Always check the ingredients of over-the-counter medications. Some cold and allergy remedies contain decongestants (such as pseudoephedrine), which can precipitate palpitations., Vagal maneuvers are simple actions that you can do at home to affect your vagus nerve, which is the primary one that regulates your heart rate.Vagal maneuvers can slow your heart rate down and stop palpitations within seconds if done correctly. The Valsalva technique involves holding your breath and bearing down as if you're having a bowel movement for about 15– 20 seconds — it increases your intrathoracic pressure and stimulates the vagus nerve.


The Valsalva technique can change the rhythm of electrical impulses in your heart, help your heart rate return to normal and reduce palpitations.
The Valsalva maneuver shouldn't be done if you have heart disease or are advanced in age, as it may increase the risk of stroke.

, The diving reflex gets activated when your head or face gets cold for more than a few seconds — your heart rate slows down to reduce blood flow in an attempt to survive, which is helpful when submerged in cold water.To trigger this survival reflex, place very cold water or an ice pack against your face for about 10 seconds. Your heart rate and palpitations should reduce pretty quickly.


Dip your face or submerge your head in cold water. Put a wet face cloth in the freezer for 30 minutes then press it against your face.
Alternatively, drinking a glass of very cold water will cool the hard palate of your upper mouth and also mildly trigger the diving reflex.
Vagal maneuvers are simple and generally quite safe to do, but they should be done as soon as you realize you're experiencing palpitations for best results.
Do not attempt vagal maneuvers while standing — they can sometimes cause dizziness and fainting.

, You can also try coughing forcefully (or clearing your throat) multiple times in efforts to move your diaphragm, increase intra-thoracic pressure, and stimulate your vagus nerve. In essence, coughing creates the same physiological effects as bearing down (the Valsalva technique), but some people may find it easier to perform.When coughing, it must be forceful enough and sustained — a single, light cough won't likely trigger a vagal response.
Make sure to completely swallow any food you're eating or beverages you're drinking in order to prevent the risk of choking.
If you're unsure, ask your doctor for a demonstration of vagal maneuvers.

, Although heart palpitations are not considered a serious condition and seldom require treatment, sometimes they can be caused by heart disease.If you're experiencing regular palpitations for more than a few days or periodic palpitations for more than a few months, make an appointment with your doctor to get your heart checked out.


Your doctor will give you a physical exam, check your heart rate and listen to your heart with a stethoscope.
Your doctor will likely order an EKG (electrocardiogram) to check your heart's electrical activity.
Even if your EKG results are normal, you still can have a medical condition that's causing palpitations.You may get a referral to a heart specialist (cardiologist) and be told to wear a Holter or event monitor, which records your heart’s electrical activity for up to 48 hours
You may also get an echocardiography (ultrasound image of your heart) and/or a stress test (monitored intense exercise) to try and find the cause of your palpitations.

, Some medications, particularly when they are combined with others, can trigger a racing heart (tachycardia) and/or palpitations. For example, anti-arrhythmic drugs (used to treat abnormal heart rhythms), digitalis, asthma medications, thyroid drugs, steroid therapy and most cold/cough remedies commonly trigger faster heart rates.Ask your doctor if your prescription medication(s) could trigger palpitations as an unwanted side effect.


It's virtually impossible to predict how more than two drugs (taken concurrently) may interact with each other in your body, so read the list of side effects very carefully.
If you suspect a drug is triggering your palpitations, don't stop taking it ""cold turkey"" without the supervision of your doctor — it may cause you worse symptoms.
It's better to wean yourself off a drug and then switch to another with similar actions.

, Although most cases of palpitations are harmless and either go away on their own or stop when the trigger is found, sometimes medication may be needed.Potential causes of palpitations (and tachycardia) that require medicine include: cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, myocarditis and heart valve disease.Anti-arrhythmic medications (amiodarone, flecainide, propafenone, dofetilide, ibutilide, quinidine, disopyramide, lidocaine, procainamide, sotalol, amiodarone) quickly reduce heart rates, especially if they are given via injection.
Other medications that may be prescribed (and often used along with anti-arrhythmics) include calcium channel blockers (diltiazem, verapami) and beta blockers (metoprolol, esmolol, atenolol).
People with atrial fibrillation (the most common type of arrhythmia) may be treated with blood-thinning medicines to prevent blood clots, such as: warfarin (Coumadin), dabigatran, heparin or aspirin.

Prepare for your recovery by arranging a ride home from the hospital after the surgery. Ask a friend, family member, or roommate to pick you up. You can then head right home to recovery fully from the tonsillectomy.
, Stay hydrated by having lots of water after the operation. Have eight to ten glasses of lukewarm or cool, filtered water. Keep a glass of water by your bed or couch and carry a water bottle with you if you are moving around your house.Avoid hot liquids such as hot chocolate, coffee, or tea for the first week. Hot liquids can irritate your throat.

, Bland foods that are soft and easy to swallow are the best options post-surgery. Have applesauce, vegetable or chicken broth, and pudding. You can also have soup, such as a blended vegetable soup. Go for foods that will provide nutrients and energy, without irritating your throat.Avoid acidic, spicy, and crunchy foods, as they can cause pain and bleeding.
If you are in a lot of pain after the tonsillectomy, you may need to arrange for someone to help you prepare food for you for the first several days. Ask a friend, partner, or roommate to help you.

, Stay in bed during the first several days after the tonsillectomy. Avoid strenuous activities like running and bike riding for at least two weeks post surgery. Try not to return to work for the first week and rest in bed or on the couch instead.You can usually return to normal activity, such as work, after you can eat a normal diet, sleep through the night, and do not need to have pain medication.
Your doctor can also tell you when you are well enough to return to normal activity.

Look for other ways to interact with animals if you can't find a program.",How to Reduce Homesickness with Pet Therapy1," A professional referral might help you to find pet therapists in your area. If you're interested in pet therapy, doctors and therapists may know of programs in your area, but they also might not. It depends on the area and availability of this type of therapy. The hospital in your area might have a pet therapy program in place that is available to patients, and this could be helpful if you are feeling homesick while in the hospital. They may be able to schedule regular meetings with a pet therapist in the area.Say something to your doctor such as, ""I'm feeling really homesick and I've read pet therapy can help. Do you know of any programs in this area?"";
, There are hundreds of associations that register dogs for pet therapy. Get in touch with an association near you. They may be able to point you in the direction of registered pet therapist.Associations include Alliance of Therapy Dogs, Love on a Leash, and American Therapy Pets.
The American Kennel Club website has an extensive list of pet therapy certification programs. This is a good place to begin searching for a program to meet your needs.

, Universities often provide pet therapy for students, especially new students still adjusting to the college transition. Ask at the counseling center or look for fliers around campus advertising pet therapy. You may be entitled to free pet therapy as a student., While pet therapy is becoming increasingly popular, it is still not widely used. It may be difficult to find a pet therapist in your area. If you can't find a pet therapist, interacting with animals in other ways may help with homesickness. See if you can volunteer at an animal shelter, for example, or spend time with a friend who has pets.


If you live in a building that allows animals, consider fostering a dog or cat from your local animal shelter. You would care for this animal in your home until it finds a full-time owner.Keep in mind spending time with animals is not the same as pet therapy, which is a specific therapy program where interactions are supervised by a trained therapist. Simply interacting with animals may not have the same therapeutic effects.

Viruses and infections. If we have a cold, our body will automatically raise its temperature to kill all viruses and bacteria.

Too much exercise. If we exercise too much, our body temperature will raise and we will start sweating a lot.Sweating is a body’s natural way of cooling down.

Taking certain medication. Our body temperature can rise as a side-affect of some medication we are currently using. There are many drugs that cause elevated body temperature.

Illness. Certain diseases can be responsible for high body temperature.

Improper cooling. Our body temperature can rise if we do not wear appropriate clothing or if we stand in the sun too much.

Dehydration. If we do not drink enough water, our body will eventually become dehydrated so you won’t be able to sweat. If you can’t sweat, your body will not be able to cool itself down and your body heat will increase.;
,



Excessive sweating. We sweat because our body is trying to cool itself down that way. If we sweat a lot, that means that our body temperature is higher than normal. This is most common during or after exercise.

Cramps. Cramps are a result of body being dehydrated. When the body can’t produce any more sweat to cool down, you start to get dehydrated. One of the most common symptoms of dehydration are cramps.

Headache. Headache is another symptom or dehydration. This is why when you have a fever, you can also experience mild to severe headaches.

Weakness. When your temperature becomes higher than usual, you could have pain in your muscles and joint and you could feel weakness in your body.

, Drinking water is the best solution for high body temperature. Water will enable your body to produce more sweat which will eventually cool you down. Remember that fruits and vegetables also contain water so they are a healthy way of reducing body heat.

, There are plenty of alternatives at your disposal. The dosages are as follows:Tetracycline is give at 500 mg tablet every 6 hours for 15 days
Erythromycin is given at 8 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg every 6 hours for 15 days
Doxycycline is given at 100 mg tablet every 12 hours for 15 days
Azithromycin is given at 30 mg/kg as a single dose per mouth to a maximum dose of 2 grams

, Skin lesions frequently ulcerate and thus become prone to infection. Infected ulcers lead to more destruction of tissue and scarring. So try your best to remain neat and clean. Open ulcers also shed organisms of yaws disease that can infect other persons in contact.


Keep the ulcers and skin lesions dry as much as possible. Wet surfaces tend to get infected easily.
Use loose and comfortable clothes to allow adequate ventilation. Tight clothes can impede blood supply to the affected area which delays healing.
Only use mild soaps. Soap is an irritant and any irritation delays healing. This is why you should use soap as little as possible. If possible, use liquid bath soap which is less irritating.

, Recovery from any illness needs an extra supply of nutrients. Protein is most important in healing a wound and to spur on the formation of new tissue. Consume protein rich foods like milk, meat, eggs, etc.


Vitamin C is particularly important for collagen tissue formation which helps in healing ulcers and other wounds. Lack of vitamin C may lead to bizarre healing that does not look natural. Eat vitamin C rich foods like lemon, peppers, guavas, berries, tomatoes, etc.

, There are a few things found in nature that may help your case. Consider the following:


Use katuk leaf locally. It is an excellent herbal remedy to expedite ulcer healing. Rub the pulps on the affected area twice daily to get optimum result.
Make a decoction of kale roots. It has high vitamin C content and other natural ingredients that promote wound healing. Take the decoction twice daily to get best result.
Use turmeric and nutmeg. This mixture is a strong herbal tonic for yaws disease. Blend turmeric and nutmeg powder with coconut oil and apply the paste on the sores twice daily.

, Since yaws are easily transmitted through skin contact, it is best to let the people that live in your household get tested for yaws as well as take the treatment if they are infected.


Treated areas which are previously endemic for yaws should be reexamined within 6 months and at intervals there after so that missed cases and their contacts can be treated.

, There is 100% cure rate among yaws patients in the early stages of this disease. Nevertheless, treatment cannot reverse or change the destructive or damaged changes in the late or tertiary stage of yaws. Here are the specifics:


Yaws lesions become non-contagious within 24 hours from the start of treatment.Joint pains resolve in 25 hours to 48 hours of treatment.
Complete healing of the initial and secondary lesions occur within two weeks to four weeks from start of treatment.

, It begins by the organism entering the body through a skin defect such as a bite site, abrasion or scratch. After about 3 weeks a reddish, painless and itchy small swelling develops at the entry site. The primary lesion heals spontaneously after 3-6 months.


Yaws has an incubation period of 9 days to 90 days followed by the appearance of this primary papule, called the mother yaws.The swelling then ulcerates with a honey-brown crust formation. The ulcer may enlarge in size to about 2–5 centimeter (0.8–2.0 in). The crust sloughs out to expose a reddish base. The discharge from the ulcer is rich in organisms rendering the patient highly infectious.

, There is a gap of 6-16 weeks between the primary and secondary stages. During this period the organisms spread via the blood to different parts of the body.


There are skin lesions similar to primary yaws but they are smaller in size (maximum 2cm). They tend to develop around the mouth, nose, axilla and anus. These lesions also ulcerate and discharge infectious fluid. They heal spontaneously within 6 months.
There may be painful swelling of bone surfaces particularly hand and foot bones.

, After the secondary lesions heal, the patient becomes non-infectious and symptom free. There are no skin or bony lesions. This stage may last for the rest of the life. However, there may be recurrence of the skin problems at an interval of up to 5 years., Destructive lesions may develop after 5-15 years of latency. In this stage skin, bones, nerves and eyes may be affected. Skin lesions begin as painless, enlarging and firm swelling that ultimately ulcerate.Large ulcers may join with one another to form an elongated ulcer. When the ulcer heals, massive fibrous tissue forms that contract the skin. This may lead to crippling deformities and ugly appearance of the affected area.
Bony lesions are known as osteitis, periostitis and osteomyelitis. The end result is bone destruction with development of deformity. Nasal bone destruction may cause perforation of the nose and palate. This stage is not contagious and occurs in 10% of untreated yaws patients.

Have pain medication.,
Take antibiotics, if necessary.,
Get prescription pain medication from your doctor.",How to Recover from a Tonsillectomy2," Take over the counter pain medication to help ease any discomfort. Do not take aspirin, as this can increase your risk of bleeding. Instead, have NSAIDs (Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs) like Tylenol or Ibuprofen.Always follow the dosage instructions on the label. Do not take more than recommended.
Have pain medication with a meal or food to help your body digest it properly.

, If you are at risk of infection, your doctor may give you antibiotics to take as part of your recovery. Take them according to your doctor’s instructions.You cannot have alcohol when you are on antibiotics.
You may want to take probiotics along with the antibiotics to help your body recover.

, If your pain is severe, your doctor may give you prescription pain medication. This is not usually done unless your tonsillectomy is causing you major pain, or you have other health issues that require prescription pain medication.If the pain is severe and does not go away with pain medication, you should see your doctor for a check up. Extreme pain may be a sign that your tonsillectomy is not healing properly.

"
"
Go to the doctor if you notice any excessive bleeding.,
See your doctor if you have a high fever.,
Go to the doctor if you experience dehydration.,
See your doctor if you have breathing issues.",How to Recover from a Tonsillectomy3," If you notice bright red spots of blood in your saliva or coming from your nose, go to the emergency room right away. Speak to your doctor about the issue. You may need surgery to stop the bleeding.Small specks of dark blood from your nose or in your saliva is normal. Bright blood in big spots or specks is a cause for concern.

, If you have a fever that is 102 °F (39 °C) or higher, go see your doctor. A high fever is usually a sign of infection and requires immediate treatment., Signs of dehydration include headache, dizziness, lightheadedness, thirst, weakness, and reduced urination. If you notice you are feeling dehydrated, speak to your doctor., It is normal to snore or having noisy breathing during the first week of recovery. But if you experience difficulty breathing, go see your doctor."

Schedule regular sessions.,
Talk to the therapist about interacting with the animal.,
Encourage friends and family members to join you.",How to Reduce Homesickness with Pet Therapy2," As with any type of therapy, pet therapy works best if you have regular sessions. Once you find a pet therapist, look over your schedule and see what times you can meet with a therapist regularly. Make sure you get in regular sessions with a pet therapist to gain benefits from pet therapy.Your therapist should be able to guide you here. Depending on your level of homesickness, they will recommend how often you should come in and how long your sessions should be.
Many people start therapy and then stop attending when they feel better. Make sure to keep up with attendance until your therapist decides you have successfully completed a therapy program. The duration of pet therapy programs vary, but some may last as long as six to eight weeks., Pet therapy is not just playing with a dog or cat for a set period of time. The therapist will want you to interact with the animal in specific ways to combat homesickness. Make sure to listen to the therapist and follow their rules regarding having contact with the animal.This is also important because you want to strive for positive interactions with an animal. If you interact with an animal poorly, it may reject you. If you're rejected by a therapy animal, this can worsen homesickness.
Never touch the animal without their consent. The pet therapist will explain how to communicate with the animal and gain their consent to pet them.

, Family members and friends often report they feel better when participating in pet therapy with a loved one. This is usually something that occurs if you're homesick due to a hospital stay. Have friends and family members join you on the days you interact with a therapy pet. This may help them deal with their own anxiety and loneliness about you staying in a hospital.Make sure you check with the therapist. Some therapists may have rules about other people attending pet therapy sessions.
Also, keep in mind that you and your family can likely get the same benefit of a shared pet therapy experience by telling them about your experience.

See other people.,
Learn to embrace alone time.,
Appreciate a new environment.,
See a therapist if homesickness is unmanageable.",How to Reduce Homesickness with Pet Therapy3," Make an effort to go out. Isolating yourself will make homesickness worse. In addition to pet therapy, make the effort to meet new people.You can try using websites like MeetUp to find new people. This will direct you to groups you can attend based around a particular interest.
If you're in college, try joining a club. Campuses usually have hundreds of organizations to choose from.
Be sure to contact family in friends on a regular basis. Set aside times when you can have long conversations with them on the phone, or using FaceTime or Skype. Avoid just having text exchanges with them.

, When you first move to a new area, you may not know many people. Try to take advantage of alone time. Use to learn a new skill, take time to read, or do something you enjoy to relax.Look into activities you can only do alone. For example, reading is usually a solitary experience. Try taking up reading as a hobby.
Use alone time as a means for self improvement. Teach yourself a new skill, like knitting or cooking.
Work on changing the way you talk about alone time, even to yourself. Try to talk about it as something positive and related to personal growth instead of something sad.

, Being in a new place can cause homesickness. Instead of seeing a new environment as a burden, try to embrace new people, things, and experiences. If you immerse yourself in new experiences, this will help distract you from feelings of homesickness.


Explore your new area. Look into local attractions, like museums, and explore local bars, coffee shops, and restaurants.
Make an effort to leave your home at least once a day and go exploring your new area.
Try keeping a journal about all of the new things you learn about you area to help build your appreciation and excitement for it.

, If you're in college, the drop out risk can increase if you're very homesick.This is why it's important to manage feelings of homesickness. See if you can find a regular therapist if pet therapy is not effectively treating your homesickness.


You can find a therapist through your insurance provider. You can also check with your school's counseling center. You may be entitled to free counseling as a student.

Increase your intake of antioxidants.,
Avoid certain types of unhealthy fats, which produce inflammatory chemicals in the body.,
Eat foods that are a good source of omega-3 fatty acids, including fish and walnuts.,
Control your consumption of carbohydrates.,
Avoid processed foods, which are packed with a lot of bad chemicals and ingredients.",How to Reduce Inflammation in the Body With Proper Nutrition," Antioxidants are natural substances that protect your body from free radicals, which are ""rogue"" (bad) molecules which damage cells. As a result, antioxidants can help reduce inflammation.It is recommended to eat a moderate amount of vegetables and fruits, many of which are high in antioxidants.
There are many online calculators that can calculate the amount of fruit and vegetables you require, based on your age, height, weight, and gender.;
, Specifically, trans fats.


Read nutrition labels to assure you are these types of fats..
Trans fats are found in partially hydrogenated fats most often found in snack foods, fried foods and baked goods.
Saturated fats are found most commonly in oils and red meats, but evidence shows that they are not harmful.
Avoid excessive consumption of omega-6 fatty acids.

,


You can also take fish oil supplements.
Fish oil supplements, usually made from seal blubber, salmon, halibut, whale blubber, tuna, mackerel, cod liver and herring, may be combined with vitamin A, B1, B2, B3, C, D and/or E.
Research shows that omega 3-fatty acids reduce inflammation and may lower the risk of diseases such as cancer and heart disease.
Fish oil supplement daily intake should be based on the amount of EPA and DHA; a common amount of omega-3 fatty acids in a fish oil capsule is .18 g (170-560 mg) of Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and .072 g (72-310 mg) of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).
The American Heart Association recommends healthy adults with no history of heart disease eat fish at least two times per week. It's recommended that adults with coronary heart disease take 1 gram daily of EPA and DHA omega-3 fatty acid supplement (fish oil). Adults with high cholesterol should take 2 to 4 grams daily of EPA and DHA.

, Carbohydrates are not necessarily bad for you if consumed in moderate amounts.


Carbs such as white rice or white bread should be avoided because they spike blood sugar, which then cause inflammatory chemicals to be released. Inflammation may impair blood sugar regulation, which is worsened when refined carbohydrates are consumed. The same chain reaction also happens when carbs are overeaten.
Instead, eat less, but higher quality whole grains.
Read packaging on your breads and pastas to find which items are made of whole grains, rather than refined grains.

,


Consumption of processed foods that have additives may increase certain health risks, and in processing the foods, some of the nutritional value is often lost.
These foods are usually high in sugar, salt, trans-fats, and calories.

Be aware that you are a precious person.,
Take care to avoid telling yourself that you deserved the illness or that you brought it upon yourself; in recovery, there is no point berating yourself.,
Take charge of your own life again.,
Visualize good thoughts that make you feel-good!,
Enjoy easy living as a rule now, not as an exception.,
Seek contentment.,
Hug a tree with both hands.,
Read a good book.,
Exercise your mind and body.,
Do some slow exercises to expel the negativity from the body.,
Exercise regularly without fail.,
Find new ways around old problems that added to your illness.,
Be here now.,
Change your mindset where others are concerned.,
Visualize yourself staying well and healthy.,
Laugh often.",How to Recover from Sickness Mindfully," Sometimes illness can cause you to feel that the whole world is against you and that you don't matter much. This isn't at all true. You matter a great deal and it is vital to remind yourself of this fact.;
, Instead, realize that it has happened and that you now have an opportunity to move on in health again.


You can certainly learn lessons from prior to your illness, such as ditching fast food and replacing it with healthy and nutritious foods instead, and so forth. Improve your diet to match your body's needs and makeup.
You may find fasting helpful. It's not for everyone but some people enjoy it.

, During an illness, it is often the case that many others direct your life, such as doctors, carers, family members and even visiting do-gooders. In recovery, you can restore your sense of self by taking charge of your own recovery process and self-care.


Get plentiful sleep. Sufficient sleep isn't something to exchange for other activities in life. Sleep underpins all of your other strengths and keeps you healthy.

, Sit under colored light panes with the sun streaming rays through them while setting down. The colors red, blue and green help to release stress if used at least once a week. Even a soft lamp with colored light can be used.

, The resulting calmness and newness of being in you will stimulate feelings of coping and contentment.

, What sorts of activities bring you a feeling of contentedness? There are many possibilities, such as meditation, yoga, walking in the woods, swimming laps, reading fairy tales, people watching, spotting shapes in clouds, taking trips or making things. Whatever brings you a deep-seated source of contentment is worth putting more effort into, to keep your spiritual side in better shape.

, A full embrace will release all your negativity that you don't need. Let the tree be a source of strength for you. Stand using the soles of your bare feet on the roots, pushing your toes into the ground. Absorb the Earth-energy along with the tree's life-force by visualizing that you are an extension of the tree and you are drawing all the good things your body and mind need to heal, from the depths of the Earth, coming up from the roots, trunk and your own limbs to you. Imagine the 'heart of the tree', now pressed to your heart, beating as one. Try it, you may find it extremely relaxing.

, Choose easy reads when retiring to bed. Even children's fairy-tales could be suitable, or legends.

, Sit quietly in a place that makes you feel peaceful and happy. Close your eyes or keep them open as you please, breathe slow inhale. Hold in the air for a while, feel full and slowly exhale. Make the exhalation long and slow. Imagine the air as a purifier that you breathe in, cleansing your insides wholly and expelling all negativity out through your nostrils. Keep the mouth closed. Do this for about 30 minutes, once a day. Sit in the rays of the early morning sun, facing it for at least half an hour daily.

, Here is a range of self-healing and calming exercises to try:


Stand up and stretch up your hands to the sky. Extend your whole body upwards on the soles of your feet slowly rising on the toes––breathe, come down, hands down and exhale. When the muscles stretch a bit and you feel good, that is the proper way to continue the exercise.
Then do the same with your legs––stretch out on the ground and sprawl like a cat stretching its limbs. Enjoy the stretch and muscle release. Curl your toes in as tight as you can, breathe, hold, release.
Then each muscle of the body from the head to the toes––rigid, breathe-in, release, breathe out,the whole exercise of crown, forehead, eyes, cheeks, lips, neck, shoulders, back, chest/breast/abdomen, rep-organs, hips, seat of the pants, thighs, legs and angles till the toes should take a good one hour and sleep will be peaceful and refreshing.

, Perhaps in the early morning or in the evening. Going out in the open near the seashore or on a hill or in the park will give you the right ambiance.

, Were you always busy and ever in demand prior to your illness? Now may be the time to find ways to be less busy, more focused and less needy of the validation of being the ""go-to"" person. It may also be the time to seek new ways of sharing your abilities, talents and skills with the world, so perhaps a transition is in order, to something you feel suits you more now.

, If you were constantly focused on the past and the future before your illness, try concentrating on the now instead. Being in the present can help you to stay mindful of what really matters, and reduces your stress about what could have been or what could be. What matters is now.

, Let go of all grudges you may be holding against the world. Let them be and you'll be free. By letting go, you'll feel lighter and let go of all resentments that may have contributed to feeling worse internally. Embrace others with more love and understanding. Treat everyone with respect and wish all people well. Treat family with respect and gentleness.

, Treat yourself kindly and be thoughtful of your needs. In turn, it'll be easier to treat others more kindly too. All of these feeds into mindful well-being and good health, as you create virtuous circles of kindness and caring around you. Having a healthy mindset can keep you well, and visualizing this as your normal self is a positive step into ongoing good health.


Dream of being healthy and alive and well, along with other great things that manifest in your life, your health will be regained totally!

, Find the funny side of things in life and resurrect your sense of humor. It's good to laugh at life and the silly things it brings. Use a positive, fun-filled outlook to help you to wake up daily to the wondrous world you live in.

Identify the early signs of tetanus.,
Watch for progressing symptoms.,
Be aware of the complications.",How to Recognize Tetanus (Lockjaw)1," First, you'll feel a headache and a muscular stiffness in the jaw. It will be difficult to open and close your mouth. This is why the condition is commonly known as ""lockjaw."" Symptoms usually set in about eight days after infection, although the onset has been known to range from three days to three weeks.A shorter incubation period signals a more heavily infected wound. Also, tetanus-infected wounds take longer to incubate when they are father from the central nervous system. Seek urgent treatment if you experience tetanus symptoms within fewer than eight days of exposure.
On their own, a headache and a slightly stiff jaw should not terrify you. This could mean a lot of things. However, it wouldn't hurt to check with a doctor if you're worried.;
, As tetanus worsens, you'll experience a stiff neck, and you'll have trouble swallowing. Other symptoms may include:


Painful hardening of the abdominal muscles
Spasms in the jaw, chest, and abdomen. These spasms can cause painful, hyper-extended back arching, or opisthotonos.
Sweating and fever
Irregular breathing and heartbeat

, Advanced cases of tetanus can severely impair your breathing with spasms in your throat and vocal cords – and these spasms can cause fractures and muscle tears. Muscular stiffness may cause the spine and other long bones to fracture. You may experience high blood pressure and an irregular heartbeat. Untreated tetanus can cause pneumonia, blood clots in the lungs, and even a coma. Despite the innovations of modern treatment, 10-30% of tetanus patients die from the condition.The mortality rate is highest in unvaccinated people and people over 60 years old. Your chances might be better if you're vaccinated, you have a strong immune system, and you're relatively young. This does not mean that you shouldn't be worried!

"
"
See a doctor.,
Get an immediate dose of antitoxin.,
Ask your doctor about antibacterial drugs.,
Know what to do in a severe case.,
Get the vaccine once you recover.",How to Recognize Tetanus (Lockjaw)2," If you think you might have tetanus, admit yourself to a hospital as soon as possible. In most cases, you will need to be hospitalized to treat a tetanus infection – especially if it is severe., If possible, get treated with a prophylactic dose of human tetanus immune globulin (TIG) (or equine antitoxin).This should begin to halt the spread of tetanus through your system.


You do not need to wait for severe symptoms to seek treatment. If you have not been vaccinated and you think that you've been exposed to tetanus bacteria: consider getting the antitoxin.

, Penicillin, chloramphenicol, and other antimicrobial agents are commonly used to treat tetanus.You may also be given drugs to stabilize your muscle spasms.

, In very severe tetanus infections, drug treatment might be coupled with tissue debridement: the surgical removal of dead, damaged, or infected tissue.You should only go this route if it is recommended by a licensed and trusted physician. Be absolutely certain that the infection has spread too far to treat otherwise.

, Be aware that even after you've recovered from tetanus, you can still get reinfected at any point. Get the vaccine as soon as possible after the symptoms disappear. This will reduce the risk of lockjaw coming back. Continue to re-up with booster shots every ten years (at least) to keep yourself protected.

"
"
Know how tetanus spreads.,
Be careful when traveling.,
Get vaccinated.",How to Recognize Tetanus (Lockjaw)3," The Clostridium tetani bacteria enter the body through cuts and broken skin.C. tetani lives in soil, dust, and animal feces. When these bacteria enter a deep flesh wound, the spores may produce a powerful toxin, tetanospasmin, which actively impairs your motor neurons – the nerves that control your muscles. There is an incubation period of 3-21 days before symptoms begin to appear.


The incubation period varies according to the distance the infected wound is from the central nervous system. For instance: an infected cut on the finger will have a longer incubation period than a cut on the neck.
Be quick to treat deep, penetrating wounds. The bigger and more severe the injury, the easier it will be for C. tetani to enter your body., Tetanus infections occur all over the world. However, they are most common in hot, wet climates where the soil is rich with bacteria. Tetanus usually does not spread from one person to another. Nonetheless: be careful what you touch when you are walking around with an open cut or wound. If you are traveling in the developing world, you may not have access to the same caliber of tetanus treatment as you would in your home country.

, Ask your doctor about the ""Dtap"" booster vaccine for tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis. You can usually prevent infection through proper immunization with the tetanus vaccine. This is how tetanus has been largely eradicated from the developed world.


In the United States, nearly all modern cases of tetanus occur in adults who were not vaccinated as children, or who have not received a vaccination in the past ten years."

In the United States, all newborns are required to be screened for sickle cell disease. This is because early treatment is very beneficial to patients.It is also possible to do prenatal screening for sickle cell disease by testing fetal tissues that are collected by chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis.;
, Swelling of the hands and feet, often called hand-foot disease, is often one of the first symptoms of sickle cell disease in babies. It occurs because the sickle-shaped blood cells are blocking the flow of blood, and it can be very painful.If you or your baby experience hand-foot disease, see a doctor for treatment right away.

, Sickle cell disease can cause the skin and whites of the eyes to develop a yellowish tint known as jaundice. Skin may also become abnormally pale. See a doctor or go to the hospital if you or your baby has these symptoms.
Jaundice is a result of the red blood cells getting broken down after they sickle, and the breakdown product of hemoglobin (called bilirubin) is a pigment that builds up in tissues of the body causing them to get yellow.

, People with sickle cell disease often experience ""crises"" or sudden episodes of pain. This happens when a blood cell becomes lodged in a blood vessel, and most frequently occurs in the chest, abdomen, and joints.Crises are different for everyone; some people experience them rarely, while others have many crises each year. Some require hospitalization because their crises are severe, while others are less severe.
Some people experience crises with no specific triggers, but for many people, crises can be brought on by stress, dehydration, altitude change, or temperature change and often by viral infection such as common flu.
Some people with SCD also suffer from chronic pain, which may need to be managed with pain medications., Many people who have sickle cell disease also have anemia because their body has a shortage of red blood cells, which are needed to supply oxygen to the body. While mild to moderate anemia is common, severe anemia can also develop suddenly and can be life-threatening, so see a doctor if your symptoms suddenly get worse.Symptoms of anemia include fatigue, paleness, dizziness, and shortness of breath.
Babies who are suffering from severe anemia may seem especially sluggish and uninterested in feeding.

, Sickle cell disease can cause both fatigue and pain, so babies who are suffering from the disease may appear fussier than normal. Unfortunately, babies are not able to communicate their symptoms with us, but if you notice any unusual behavior, talk to your doctor about it as soon as possible,, Children with sickle cell disease may grow and develop at a slower rate than children who do not have the disease. This is because oxygen is needed for growth, and people with sickle cell disease have fewer red blood cells to transport oxygen around the body. If your child seems to be growing slower than his peers or reaches puberty later, this may be due to sickle cell disease., People with sickle cell disease, particularly infants and children, are at a higher risk for infections, and often from organisms that people with sickle cell disease do not typically get. Fever is often the first sign of a bacterial infection.


See a doctor right away if you have sickle cell disease and have a fever of 101°F (38.3°C) or higher.Common infections can be life-threatening to people with sickle cell disease, so treat them seriously.You can prevent infections by washing your hands regularly, avoiding potentially contaminated food, and getting vaccinated against common infections like the flu and pneumonia., Acute chest syndrome is a serious medical condition that can affect people with sickle cell disease. Its symptoms are similar to those of pneumonia, including coughing, chest pain, labored breathing, and fever.This is a life-threatening medical condition that requires immediate hospitalization. Treatment may include antibiotics, oxygen therapy, blood transfusions, and other medications.

, An aplastic crisis occurs in patients with sickle cell disease when the bone marrow begins to produce fewer red blood cells, usually due to an infection. This can result in severe acute anemia, which is extremely serious.Symptoms include paleness, extreme tiredness, and a rapid pulse. If you notice these symptoms, seek immediate medical treatment.

, Splenic sequestration is a complication of sickle cell disease that occurs when a large number of sickle cells get trapped in the spleen, causing it to suddenly enlarge. Symptoms include pale lips, sudden weakness, severe thirst, fast breathing, abdominal pain on the left side of body, and increased heart rate.This condition is life-threatening, so treatment at a hospital is necessary. Treatment usually includes a blood transfusion.
The spleen will be noticeably enlarged. If you or your child has sickle cell disease, you should regularly check the upper left part of the belly, just under the rib cage, for any signs of swelling. If you notice swelling, seek medical treatment right away., Strokes happen when the blood flow to the brain is restricted, so they are much more common in people who have sickle cell disease than in those who do not have the disease. Strokes can be debilitating and life-threatening, so it is important to call 911 as soon as you recognize the symptoms of a stroke, either in yourself or in a loved one.Common signs of a stroke include difficulty talking, weakness on one side of the body, confusion, headache, and loss of balance.
Silent strokes are typically asymptomatic, although they may still cause injury to the brain. If you or your child has problems learning, making decisions, or staying organized, it may be due to silents strokes, so see a doctor for testing., Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) are conditions caused by blood clots that become lodged in the blood vessels. Both are very serious, so seek medical treatment right away if you experience symptoms of either.Symptoms of deep vein thrombosis include swelling and pain in the leg.
Symptoms of pulmonary embolism include shortness of breath, rapid heartbeat, coughing up blood, and dizziness., Vision problems are fairly common in people with sickle cell disease because sickle-shaped cells can damage blood vessels in the retina. If you start experiencing a change in your vision, see an eye doctor as soon as possible.Have your eyes tested once a year to check for damage caused by sickle cell disease.

, Some people with sickle cell disease, typically men, develop ulcers, or open sores, on the lower halves of their legs.Most often, ulcers can be treated at home with antibiotic ointment. Elevating the legs may also help.
You may not need medical treatment for every ulcer, but you should see a doctor if you develop them frequently or if they do not heal. Skin grafts may be necessary in severe cases.

, There are a variety of heart problems that can be caused by sickle cell disease. The cells can damage the blood vessels to the heart, which can interfere with its ability to function normally. Enlarged heart and pulmonary hypertension are also common heart conditions in people with sickle cell disease.Your doctor should monitor you for heart problems. Be sure to always report any symptoms you have, including fatigue, shortness of breath, and chest pain.
People who have had multiple blood transfusions are at an increased risk of developing heart problems due to the possibility of an iron overload.

, Liver damage can occur if sickle cells get trapped in the liver tissue. Liver problems can also be caused by iron overload, which is a risk of blood transfusions.Symptoms of severe liver problems include jaundice, fatigue, itching, and abdominal pain.Liver complications in patients with sickle cell disease often occur suddenly.

, Sickle cell disease often causes the kidneys to have difficulty concentrating urine. The disease can also lead to kidney failure.Common symptoms include frequent urination, incontinence, bed wetting, and blood in the urine.

, People with sickle cell disease are prone to lung problems because the blood vessels that supply blood to the lungs can be damaged, which makes it difficult for the heart to supply them with oxygen-rich blood. This often leads to a conditions called pulmonary hypertension, an increase in pressure in the blood vessels in the lungs, which can be very serious.Fatigue and shortness of breath are the most common symptoms of pulmonary hypertension. Another common symptom is swelling in the legs, which is caused by backup of the right side of the heart, secondary to the lung hypertension.

, Gallstones are a common complication of sickle cell disease because the disease causes a substance called bilirubin to get stuck in the gallbladder, which causes stones to form (in those who do not have SCA, gallstones are usually caused by an accumulation of fat). People who get gallstones may have them recur after they have been removed by doctors.The most common symptoms of gallstones are nausea, vomiting, and pain in the upper right section of the belly.
In serious cases, the gallbladder may need to be removed to manage symptoms.

, Sickle cell disease sometimes attacks the body's joints, including the shoulders, knees, elbows, and hips. This results in pain whenever the joint is moved.In severe cases, patients may need joint replacement surgery in order to regain function.

, Male patients with sickle cell disease sometimes experience priapism, which is a painful, prolonged erection of the penis. This sometimes goes away on its own, but sometimes requires medical treatment.Get medical attention if an episode of priapism lasts for longer than four hours. If left untreated, it may lead to impotence.

Don’t mistake symptoms for flu.,
Take your temperature.,
Be alert to eye pain or headache.,
Take note of any achiness.,
Take seriously any feelings of queasiness.,
Pay attention to changes in your coloring.,
Watch for abdominal pain.,
Beware of any signs of rash.",How to Recognize Leptospirosis Symptoms1," Symptoms of leptospirosis can vary and can look like symptoms associated with other infections or illnesses. If you develop flu-like symptoms suddenly, don’t assume it is flu if there is the possibility of exposure.Leptospirosis generally presents with flu-like symptoms including fever, myalgia, rigor, and headache.;
, A high fever and chills can indicate infection because your body is trying to fight off the infection. If you feel excessively warm suddenly, or have chills, take your temperature and call your doctor., Some people experience symptoms of light sensitivity and headache with this kind of infection. If you develop a painful reaction to light or intense headaches along with other symptoms, get medical attention., Muscle aches are a common symptom of infection too. Because muscle aches are symptoms of fever or flu as well as leptospirosis, review your recent activities before deciding these are merely flu symptoms., You may feel nausea with or without vomiting or diarrhea. Let your doctor know about any sudden stomach problems., Jaundice may appear later as the infection progresses, and can indicate serious liver problems. Jaundice will typically appear 4-5 days after exposure, so review activities during that time period to assess exposure risks., Pain in the right upper abdominal area is a symptom of second phase infection. Often leptospirosis can develop into chronic renal disease. If you develop pain in this area, see a doctor right away., Sudden rash that is dark red to purple in color is symptomatic of infection. A rash that is concentrated on the lower body or palette of the mouth is specifically associated with this kind of infection."

It’s normal to experience cramps for a few days before and during your period, but if these cramps are so painful that they interfere with your life, schedule an appointment with your primary care physician or gynecologist.


For many women with endometriosis, these cramps get progressively worse over time.;
, Some women with endometriosis experience pain in the lower back, abdomen, and pelvic area throughout the month, not just during their menstrual cycles.


If you are dealing with chronic pain, see a doctor as soon as possible. Whether your pain is caused by endometriosis or another condition, you need to get a diagnosis and formulate a treatment plan.

, Persistent pain during sexual intercourse is not normal. Make an appointment with your physician to discuss the issue, as it could be a sign of endometriosis or another serious condition.

, If you experience pain when you urinate or defecate, you need to see a doctor. Endometriosis can sometimes produce these symptoms, especially if they seem to get worse around your menstrual period.

, Women with endometriosis sometimes experience very heavy periods (this is called menorrhagia) or bleeding between their menstrual periods (this is known as menometrorrhagia). If you experience abnormal bleeding during or between your periods, schedule an appointment with your primary care physician or gynecologist.


It can be difficult to know whether your heavy periods are within the normal range or qualify as menorrhagia. In general, if you need to use a new sanitary pad or tampon every hour for several hours in a row, if you bleed for more than a week, or if you pass very large blood clots with your menstrual flow, you may have menorrhagia. This may be accompanied by symptoms of anemia, such as fatigue and shortness of breath.

, If you notice that you are experiencing diarrhea, constipation, bloating, or nausea more often than usual, see your doctor. Endometriosis can cause these problems, especially around the time of your menstrual period.

, If you have been having regular, unprotected sexual intercourse for a year and have not been able to get pregnant, talk to your doctor about scheduling a fertility check. You should be examined for conditions that can interfere with your fertility, including endometriosis.

, A symptom chart allows you to view the overall symptom patterns you are experiencing, and can help you to compare those symptoms to other symptoms you have had over the last couple of months.

, Take a long sheet of paper (letter size) or tape together two A4 sized sheets of paper. Put the sheet diagonally on a table. Now draw a row of blocks corresponding to your cycle.


For example if you have a cycle of 28 days, draw a row of 28 blocks. Mark each block with numbers staring from 1 to 28 (if you have a cycle of 28 days).

, For most women, the main symptoms to monitor are bleeding during period, pain, bowel movements, sleep pattern and general feelings of well being; this is a total of five symptoms that you will monitor.


Draw five additional rows under the main row (if you want to monitor five symptoms). Each row will be used for a particular symptom. For example, the 2nd row is for pain, 3rd row is for bowel movement etc. Now the chart will have 28 columns and 6 rows. For each column, the top block will indicate the ‘day of cycle’ and the remaining 5 blocks will indicate 5 different symptoms.
Write the symptom at the left of each row. For example, write ‘pain’ at the left of 2nd row, ‘bowel movement’ at the left of 3rd row etc.

, At the end of each day of your cycle, fill in the corresponding column. Use a different color for each symptom. For example, use a red pencil for bleeding, yellow for bowel movement, blue for pain, green for well being and brown for sleep pattern. Use different shades according to the severity of each symptom.


Bleeding: Color the block completely if you have normal or heavy bleeding. Color in half or one-fourth the block if you have mild bleeding or spotting.
Bowel movement: Leave the block empty if you do not have a bowel movement. Color in partially or fully if you have incomplete or complete bowel movements, respectively.
Pain: Color in the block partially or fully according to the severity of the pain.
Sleep pattern: If you have a sound night of sleep, color in the whole block. For light sleep or bad sleep, color in only half the block. Leave the block empty if you did not sleep at all. Notice that you will have to fill today’s sleep in the next day. For example, you will fill the sleep pattern of the 10th day on the 11th day. Thus you will fill all blocks except that sleep on the 10th day.
Well being- Color in the whole block if you feel very well all the day. Color in partially according to the severity of your bad feeling.

, It may be an unusual event such as vomiting, abdominal fullness, headache or an appointment with your doctor.

, It may be convenient to keep the chart near your bed so that you can remember to fill it in before sleeping.


You can fix the chart on the bedroom wall or keep it on the wardrobe or closet along with the box of pencils.

, Store the chart for each month carefully and organize them serially. You can now compare the symptoms of different months simply by looking at the charts. It will be easy for you to assess whether the condition is improving or worsening, based on the color patterns you have before you.


You may also take the charts to your doctor for a quick review that will help you to design your treatment plan.

, You should take any of the above symptoms especially seriously if you have any of the risk factors for endometriosis. The first of these is having no children.

, It’s considered normal to have menstrual periods ranging in length from two to seven days. If, however, your periods tend to be on the longer side of that healthy range, you may have an increased risk for endometriosis.

, Normal menstrual cycles can range anywhere from 21 to 35 days. If yours are on the shorter side (27 days or fewer), though, you may be more likely to develop endometriosis.

, If you have a mother, aunt, sister, or other female relative with endometriosis, you are more likely to develop the condition yourself.

, If you have uterine abnormalities or a history of pelvic infections, or if you have a health condition that prevents normal menstruation, your risk of endometriosis is higher.

, If you have any of the symptoms above, make an appointment with your primary care physician or gynecologist. Describe your symptoms completely, and mention any relevant risk factors.

, Your doctor will perform a routine pelvic exam to check for any palpable abnormalities, including cysts and scars.

, Ultrasound examinations use high-frequency sound waves to create images of the inside of your body. Although an ultrasound cannot diagnose endometriosis definitely, it has reveal the presence of cysts or other problems associated with the condition.


Ultrasounds can be either abdominal (done with a transducer held over your abdomen) or transvaginal (done with a narrow transducer inserted into your vagina). In order to get a full view of your reproductive organs, your doctor may order both.

, In order to confirm the presence of endometriosis, your doctor may suggest a laparoscopy: a surgical procedure in which a laparoscope (a small medical instrument for viewing the inside of the body) is inserted through an abdominal incision. At the same time, a biopsy may be done so that samples of your tissue can be examined.


Laparoscopies are done under general anesthesia, and they carry the risks of any such surgical procedure. Therefore, if your symptoms are mild, your doctor may suggest that you try various treatments before submitting to surgery.

, If your doctor thinks you have endometriosis, discuss the extent of the condition. Decide together what tests need to be done, and work together to formulate a treatment plan.

Determine your risk of exposure.,
Be aware of activities that put you at risk.,
Don’t rely on symptoms alone.,
Contact your doctor if you relapse.,
Be alert to signs of second stage infection.",How to Recognize Leptospirosis Symptoms2," There are certain environments that increase your chance of exposure to leptospirosis. Factors like climate and land use can make conditions more favorable to the bacteria that cause this infection, so knowing where and when to be alert to those conditions can reduce your chance of infection.The bacteria that cause leptospirosis are found in temperate or tropical zones.
Water is one of the most common places of contamination and infection.
Urine from infected animals is also a common source. Both domestic and wild animals can be infected. These include, but are not limited to, cattle, pigs, horses, dogs and rats.

, Certain hobbies and professions carry a higher risk of exposure to infection. Know which environments can lead to exposure.Athletes who participate in outdoor sports like kayaking and rafting have an increased risk of exposure.Campers who swim or wade in contaminated water can be infected.
Drinking water from contaminated streams or rivers while hiking or camping can be a source of infection.
People who work in professions or industries involving animals have higher risks for infection. Veterinarians, dairy farmers, as well as workers in the fishing industry and slaughterhouse facilities all face the possibility of infection.
There has also been an increase in infection rates among urban children in recent years.

, If you have been exposed, you may or may not exhibit symptoms of infection, so talk to your doctor about activities that may have put you at risk for infection. Depending on your history and what symptoms you do have, your doctor will decide which tests to do and if treatment should be started.Symptoms are typically nonspecific so tests are needed to confirm infection.
Signs of infection are similar to symptoms of other illnesses. If there’s reason to suspect you have been exposed and you develop flu-like symptoms, see your doctor.
Some people are asymptomatic and may not be affected by the infection. You should see your doctor regardless of how you are feeling if you think you have been exposed.

, For many people, one treatment will be enough to cure them of the infection. Some people may seem to get better without having sought treatment at all initially. However, the leptospirosis infection may not actually have been cured.A more serious form of infection may occur after a seeming recovery, usually about a week after the first range of symptoms have cleared up.
For people with a more severe form of infection, symptoms occur in 2 stages.
The first stage of the initial illness will be the milder form, with flu-like symptoms.
The second stage will typically be more severe and last longer than the first stage.

, The second stage of leptospirosis infection, called Weil’s disease, is much more severe and can have long term health impacts, or even lead to death.This second stage can develop after the infection seems to be gone.
The second stage can also overlap with the first stage of infection.
At this stage, bacterial infection can cause serious damage to the kidneys or liver, even leading to chronic kidney disease or liver failure with jaundice.
The bacteria can invade the lungs, posing a serious threat to respiratory health. Severe pulmonary disease, characterized as pulmonary hemorrhage, is a serious complication of leptospirosis. ARDS or acute respiratory distress syndrome is also a complication of leptospirosis.
Signs of lung infection are having a persistent cough, shortness of breath, and coughing up blood due to bleeding in the lungs.
Infection can also spread to the heart, causing an enlarged heart, myocarditis, or cardiac arrhythmia.
Other complications may include rhabomyolysis and uveitis.

Take your overall health into consideration.,
Start treatment quickly.,
Contact your doctor if symptoms return.,
Take prescribed antibiotics as directed.,
Discuss possible hospital care with your doctor.",How to Recognize Leptospirosis Symptoms3," Many people can recover spontaneously, although it usually will take longer to recover without treatment. You should take into consideration any pre-existing conditions that can increase possible damage to your long term health.Pregnant women with leptospirosis infection have a higher infant mortality rate.
Unborn babies can become infected in utero.
Heart conditions, respiratory problems, or liver or kidney damage may be worsened if the infection develops into the second stage.

, For most people, the symptoms of leptospirosis will be mild, and the recovery period fairly short. However, should your infection develop into the second stage, symptoms could have major health impacts or even be life-threatening. Treatment can protect you from the more severe stage of infection.With treatment, infection and symptoms may last for a few days or for 3 weeks or longer.
Without treatment recovery may take several months.
Some people may be completely recovered after the initial infection, but some may not. Your doctor should monitor you during recovery, and for any return of infection symptoms.

, You may need to extend or change your course of antibiotic treatment if the infection is not responding to the medication., Antibiotics like doxycycline or azithromycin may be prescribed for milder, first phase infections.Doxycycline should not be used in the pregnant patient, this can cause liver problems and affect the development of the teeth in the unborn infant.

, For severe cases of infection and second phase infection, treatment may include hospital care for intravenous antibiotics (penicillin, doxycycline, ceftriaxone, and cefotaxime) and rehydration treatments as well as antibiotics in pill or liquid forms."

Be alert to possible infection.,
Be aware of your pet’s level of risk.,
Talk to a veterinarian.,
Seek treatment if your pet is infected.,
Know what to expect.,
Contact a veterinarian if your pet is not making progress.",How to Recognize Leptospirosis Symptoms4," Symptoms in pets can be nonspecific and vary greatly, and some pets won’t exhibit symptoms at all. If your pet has been exposed to contaminated areas or other animals infected with leptospirosis, consider having it checked even if there are no symptoms., Younger animals are more vulnerable to serious long term damage to organs or even death. Dogs seem to be more susceptible to becoming infected than other household pets., If you suspect your pet may have been exposed and you see any of the following symptoms, you should contact a veterinarian immediately.Fever.
Vomiting.
Abdominal pain.
Diarrhea.
Refusal to eat.
Severe weakness and depression.
Stiffness.
Severe muscle weakness.

, Getting your pet on antibiotics in the early stages of the infection is very important. Antibiotics will help your pet recover more quickly, lessen any damage to internal organs, and shorten the length of time during which you are at risk for infection., Because of the possibility of permanent damage to your pet’s health, as well as your risk of becoming infected through contact with your pet, ask your veterinarian for advice and information about what to do while the infection persists.Typically, the infection will be active for between 5 to 14 days. For some animals however, the infection can last for just a few days or for as long as several months.
While your pet is infected, there is a risk of the infection spreading to you and anyone else caring for the pet.
With normal daily activities like grooming, petting, walking and playing the risk for transmission is typically low.
There is a risk for becoming infected through direct or indirect contact with urine, blood, or tissues.

, Also contact the veterinarian if your pet is experiencing problems due to symptoms from infection. Your pet may need dialysis and hydration therapy to recover.

In addition to fever, look for loss of appetite at meal times, which is typical of most viral infections.


The time between viral contact and the start of symptoms (known as the incubation period) is typically between three to seven days.Young, pre-school kids are most often affected, although teens and adults do come down with HFMD occasionally.
The most common time of year for HFMD outbreaks is in the summer and early autumn.;
, Although a fever is often the first sign of HFMD, after about one to two days of higher temperatures painful sores usually develop in the throat (causing a moderate-to-severe sore throat) and elsewhere in the mouth.The red sores are fairly small (2 or 3 mm in diameter) and quickly develop into blisters (vesicles), then they pop and become ulcers (the most painful stage). In addition to the throat, the most common areas for HFMD sores to appear are the tongue, gums and inner cheeks.Blisters/ulcers from HFMD can be difficult to distinguish from canker and herpes sores. The main differences are canker sores rarely affect the throat and gums, whereas herpes sores almost always appear on the outer lips.
The discomfort created by the throat and mouth sores make it painful to eat, which may further reduce appetite.

, If the throat and mouth sores are indicative of HFMD (and not cankers, herpes or some other viral infection), then a rash will invariably develop on the hands and feet within an additional one to two days.The small red blisters characteristically appear on the palms of both hands and the soles of both feet. Less commonly, the blisters can also appear on the knees, buttocks, genitals and elbows.


In addition to the small blisters, HFMD causes the skin on the hands and feet to appear like a rash, although it's not usually itchy — unlike chicken pox, which is another type of infection that HFMD often mimics.
Fingernail and toenail loss can occur with HFMD, particularly in children, within about two to four weeks of coming down with the condition.

, Other symptoms commonly associated with HFMD (and most other viral and bacterial infections) are dull/achy headaches and malaise — a general unwell and tired feeling.These symptoms and the ones mentioned above usually last for between five to seven days. In the vast majority of cases the infection is self-limiting and doesn't require medical attention.


With malaise, children may not want to get out of bed in the morning, or play during the afternoon or stay up much past dinner time.
Headaches are difficult to detect in young children who can't communicate well, so look for reduced attention span, unexplained crying, head holding (with their hands) and avoidance of loud sounds and/or well-lit areas of the house.
Nausea/vomiting is not common with HFMD (and many other viruses that affect the throat and mouth), but it is characteristic of bacterial infections and food poisoning.
Not everyone gets all of these symptoms (especially adults who have more mature immune systems to fight the infection), but non-symptomatic people can still pass the virus on to others.

, HFMD is not serious in most cases, so letting it run its course (about a week) is the best way of gaining natural immunity and preventing future infections. As such, be patient and keep well hydrated, which is good advice for any viral infection, but particularly important for HFMD because of the pain associated with swallowing. Fevers and nights sweats cause your body to lose more water than normal, so start with drinking eight 8-ounce glasses per day to rehydrate yourself and keep your mucous membranes of your mouth/throat moist.


Consider buying some mouthwash, oral spray or lozenges from the pharmacy that contain compounds that numb or dull a sore throat.They can be effective to reduce pain and make it easier to consume liquids and soups.
You may also want to encourage hydration by offering something cold that might soothe the throat, like a sugar-free popsicle.
Common signs of dehydration include: dry skin and mucous membranes, sunken-looking eyes, reduced urination, dark-colored urine, irritability, confusion and weight loss., There's no specific treatment for HFMD in terms of medication, in part because the infection is not serious and usually clears up on its own within a week to 10 days;however, over-the-counter medications such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) can help reduce a fever, and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) can reduce inflammation and pain associated with blisters and ulcers. Remember that aspirin is never a good idea for young children and ibuprofen may not be either, so ask your doctor.


A mild-to-moderate fever is beneficial to fight viral infections as noted above, but temperatures of 103°F (39.4 °C)or greater in children should likely be managed with medication.
Drugs called antivirals are recommended for infections within people who have a high risk of complications due to weak immune systems. Antivirals kill viruses or prevent them from reproducing in the body. In rare cases, antivirals may be prescribed for HFMD, such as acyclovir (Zovirax), valacyclovir (Valtrex) or famciclovir.
Note that valacyclovir and famciclovir medications are only approved for use in adults, not kids.

, Colloidal silver (also called atomic or ionic silver) is a liquid preparation containing small clusters of electrically charged silver particles. The medical literature reveals that colloidal silver has powerful antiviral properties and can kill a wide-variety of viruses, although there is no quality research demonstrating its effect on HFMD as of yet.Even still, considering its relative safety, lack of side effects and affordability, it might be worth a shot for treating HFMD.


The effectiveness of colloidal silver against viruses depends on size (particles should be less than 10 nm in diameter) and purity (no salts or protein in the solution).Colloidal silver can be made at home with some specific supplies, or purchased from most health food and supplement stores.
Try gargling with colloidal silver to help relieve throat and mouth sores, and spray some on your hands and feet to prevent outbreaks of blisters.
Silver solutions are usually considered non-toxic even in high concentrations, but protein-based solutions made by some pharmaceutical companies can increase the risk of argyria — skin discoloration due to silver compounds getting trapped there.

, HFMD is mild-to-moderately infectious and is spread by contact (usually via the mouth) with an infected person's: nasal secretions, throat mucous, saliva (including droplets sprayed from coughing and sneezing), fluid from blisters and feces (poop).Therefore, if you see anyone (especially young children) looking ill and complaining or exhibiting the above mentioned symptoms, avoid them until they are recovered.


You may have to keep your child out of preschool or elementary school for a week to either prevent getting HFMD or spreading it to others.
Teach your child to notify adults if they feel ill or see symptoms such as red spots or rashes on the skin of other children.

, Because HFMD is contagious and transmitted through touch and body fluids, keep your hands (or those of your children) disinfected.Always wash hands with soap and water, especially after using the toilet and changing diapers. Try not to touch your mouth with your hands, especially after you've touched someone else. Avoid sharing eating utensils or cups/glasses with people with HFMD or other viral infections.


Regularly disinfecting countertops, tables, chairs, toys and other surfaces which are commonly touched is a good preventative approach.
Disinfect your hands (and your children's hands) multiple times per day with regular soap, and don't go overboard on the hand sanitizer because it can promote the growth of ""super bugs"" that are resistant to medications.
Natural disinfectants appropriate for household use include white vinegar, lemon juice, salt water, diluted bleach and hydrogen peroxide.

, With any type of infection, true prevention depends on the strong and healthy functioning of your immune system. Your immune system is comprised of specialized cells that search and destroy potential pathogens such as viruses, but when the system is weak, disease-causing microorganisms grow and spread virtually unchecked. As such, it's not surprising that those most at risk for infections, including HFMD, are young children and the immunocompromised.Therefore, focus on boosting your immune system in order to stay healthy and be able to fight off HFMD successfully.


Getting more sleep (and better quality sleeps), eating more fresh fruit and veggies, cutting down on refined sugars (soda pop, candy), reducing your alcohol intake, quitting smoking, practicing good hygiene and exercising regularly are all proven ways to keep your immune system strong.Dietary supplements that can boost immunity include: vitamin C, vitamin D, zinc, echinacea and olive leaf extract.
Vitamin C and olive leaf extract also have antiviral properties, which may also help to prevent or fight off HFMD.

Do not ignore the chest pain (angina).,
Pay attention to your breathing.,
Check up the heart beat.,
Do not neglect the feeling of nausea.,
Do not disregard the feeling of weakness.,
Do not ignore sweating.",How to Recognize Heart Disease Symptoms," This is the most common heart disease symptom and one that is more commonly found in men. Such chest pain usually occurs when the heart muscle isn’t getting as much oxygen-rich blood as it needs. It usually feels like pressure, pain, or burning in the chest. It can sometimes be confused with heartburn or indigestion. Quite often, this pain radiates into the jaw, left arm, and the left shoulder blade. Sometimes pain in the chest is caused by the intercostal nerve inflammation and not heart disease. To distinguish the two, you simply need to push on the ribs. If the pain gets more acute, heart disease is not the problem.;
, Shortness of breath is more common in women, but can also be experienced by men. Individuals who feel a shortness of breath while at rest or with minimal physical activity may be suffering from a pulmonary condition, heart failure or even a heart attack (making shortness of breath appear at the slightest physical activity all of a sudden).

, Fast or irregular heart beat can indicate arrhythmia, heart failure, or a heart attack, especially when it is accompanied by other heart disease symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, and weakness.

, Nausea is a common symptom of a heart attack and heart failure. Heart failure causes abdominal swelling which affects the appetite and causes people to want to throw up.

, Weakness is a common symptom of a heart attack, especially in women. It can be felt at the time of the heart attack as well as days or weeks leading up to the attack. Fatigue may also be a symptom of heart failure.

, Unexplained sweating is often a sign of a heart attack.

Note initial ""flu-like"" symptoms.,
Watch for a rash about five days after initial symptoms appear.,
Be aware that hemorrhagic symptoms will begin around the fifth day.,
Watch for jaundice after day five as well.,
Watch out for severe weight loss.,
Watch for delirium around the same time.,
Understand Marburg’s deadliness.,
Watch out if you live in or visit areas where Marburg originated.,
Avoid contact with a Marburg victim, dead or alive.,
Be careful if you are a healthcare worker in high-risk areas.,
Remember that Marburg’s incubation period is 5 to 10 days long.,
Get to a hospital immediately if you or someone you know starts showing symptoms.,
Do not try to care for a Marburg sufferer at home.",How to Recognize Marburg Hemorrhagic Fever Symptoms," The first symptoms of Marburg can include severe headache, chills, fever, and joint or muscle pain.These ""flu-like"" symptoms appear in many other illnesses that aren’t as deadly. But if you or someone you know was recently in an area where Marburg occurs naturally and begins showing these symptoms, seek medical attention immediately.;
, This rash will be maculopapular, or characterized by flat red areas on the skin covered in bumps. The rash is usually located on the chest, back, and stomach, and may come and go quickly., Hemorrhagic symptoms include bleeding from bodily orifices as well as internal bleeding. Blood may also begin to fail to clot, which prevents the body’s wound healing process from functioning normally., Jaundice is a yellow or green pigmentation of the skin caused by high levels of bilirubin, which is a compound that helps break down waste in the human body. Though it has many causes, if it appears after the rash it is almost certainly Marburg. Look for discoloration in the whites of the eyes and in nail beds,, Severe weight loss also occurs after day five of the onset of symptoms. The degree of weight loss can vary by patient. But any rapid weight loss is probably due to Marburg., Delirium is a classic symptom of late-stage Marburg virus. The virus infects the central nervous system and causes victims to act increasingly confused with out of character behavior. Victims may also slip into a coma around this time., Death from organ failure and massive hemorrhaging usually occurs 6 to 9 days after the initial onset of symptoms.There is no effective treatment, cure, or vaccine for Marburg hemorrhagic fever.


The disease’s fatality rate ranges from 23% to 90%., Though the virus got its name from an outbreak in Marburg, Germany in 1967, it does not come from Europe. Rather, it is African in origin.


Though rare, Marburg cases have been reported in Uganda, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Angola, South Africa, Kenya, and Zimbabwe.Marburg virus occurs naturally in cave-dwelling African fruit bats. Be careful if you visit caves in any country where Marburg cases have been reported. The bats do not show symptoms. While the bat-to-human transmission route is unknown, exposure to infected bat feces or aerosols like bat urine are the most likely reason for infection.Avoid contact with monkeys in a country with reported Marburg cases. Monkeys can also spread the disease., Many Marburg cases in humans happen as a result of human-to-human contact. Exposure to blood, secretions, or organs of infected people is Marburg’s means of transmission between humans.If you are caring for a Marburg victim, don’t come into direct contact with their blood or other secretions.
If the victim is located in an area where bodies are washed before burial, take special care to not touch the victim directly, since Marburg can be transmitted even after death.

, Healthcare workers are at high risk of contracting Marburg if they see many victims per day. Getting stuck with a hypodermic needle with the virus on it can lead to particularly swift and severe infection.Remember to use barrier nursing techniques such as consistent use of latex gloves, impermeable gowns, and respirators to protect yourself. Isolating infected individuals is also a good idea.

, Any infectious disease will have an incubation period during which the sufferer shows no symptoms. Marburg’s incubation period lasts 5 to 10 days on average. So if you or someone you know who is at risk for the virus begins showing symptoms after that time, it might be Marburg. , The only way for Marburg sufferers to receive any kind of treatment is through intensive supportive care. This usually entails continuously replenishing lost fluids, electrolytes, and blood through intravenous drips. It also means treating any secondary infections as they occur.

, It is impossible to conduct intensive supportive care at home. So if you or someone you know is suffering from Marburg, seek immediate medical attention.

Check to see if your TSH reading is in the normal range.The first thyroid test that is generally taken by physicians is the TSH.,
Interpret the possible meanings of a high TSH reading.TSH tells the thyroid to produce more T4 and T3, which are the hormones released from the thyroid (at the command of TSH) to act throughout the body.,
Look out for signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism.In addition to a high TSH reading, hypothyroidism also presents with many clinical indications.,
Evaluate the possible meaning of a very low TSH reading.On the other hand, if you have a very low TSH reading, it may be your body's response for your pituitary to produce less TSH due to an excess of thyroid hormone in the body (T3 and T4).,
Take note of signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism.Hyperthyroidism presents with many clinical indications, in addition to a low TSH reading.,
Use your TSH value to monitor ongoing thyroid treatment.If you have been diagnosed with a thyroid disorder and are receiving ongoing treatment for it, your doctor will likely advise that you receive regular TSH tests to check in on and confirm the effectiveness of your treatment.,
Check to see if your T4 reading is in the normal range.T4 is the most commonly measured hormone that is produced directly by the thyroid gland, and is subsequently released to circulate throughout the body.,
Interpret your T4 value in relationship to your TSH value.If your TSH value is abnormally high (indicative of possible hypothyroidism), a low T4 would support the diagnosis of hypothyroidism.,
Assess the T3 value in cases of possible hyperthyroidism.T3 is another hormone produced by the thyroid gland, but generally in significantly lesser quantities than T4.,
Include your doctor.,
Interpret thyroid antibody testing to differentiate between various types of thyroid diseases.If you have been diagnosed with a thyroid disorder, your doctor will likely order a series of other thyroid investigations in order to more thoroughly investigate and confirm your diagnosis.,
Have your calcitonin measured.A calcitonin test may be performed to further investigate thyroid problems.,
Receive an ultrasound, a biopsy, or an iodine test to confirm certain thyroid diagnoses.While blood tests can provide physicians with valuable information to detect and diagnose thyroid problems, there are cases where more extensive investigations are required to determine exactly what is going on.",How to Read Thyroid Test Results," TSH stands for ""Thyroid Stimulating Hormone,"" which is created by the pituitary gland and stimulates the thyroid to create and release hormones T4 and T3.


TSH can be thought of as the metaphorical ""engine"" of the thyroid gland, in that it determines the amount of thyroid hormone that is synthesized and then released from the thyroid into the body.
A normal value for TSH is between 0.4 – 4.0 mIU/L.If your TSH is in this range, that is a good sign; however, a normal TSH value does not completely rule out thyroid problems. TSH values on the high end of normal can indicate potential thyroid problems that are evolving.
Most thyroid problems require two or more tests to detect and diagnose, given the complex interplay of the various hormones that contribute to thyroid function.
Your doctor may order more tests, even if your TSH is normal, if he still suspects that you may have a thyroid problem.;
, If your thyroid is underactive, then it is not releasing enough much T4 and T3, and so your pituitary gland will release more TSH to try and compensate.


Thus, a high TSH may be a sign of hypothyroidism (a condition in which your thyroid gland is producing insufficient amounts of hormones).
You will need further testing, however, to further investigate and to confirm such a diagnosis.

, Tell your doctor if you are experiencing any of the following signs or symptoms, which may be suspicious for hypothyroidism:


Increased cold sensitivity
Fatigue
Unexplained weight gain
Unusually dry skin
Constipation
Muscle aches and stiffness
Joint pain and swelling
Depression and/or other mood changes
A slower than normal heart rate
Thinning hair
Changes to your menstrual cycle
Slowed thinking or speaking

, As such, a low TSH may be an indication of hyperthyroidism (excess production of thyroid hormone).


Again, further blood tests will be required to confirm such a diagnosis.
A TSH reading alone can point your physician down a certain path, but in itself it is usually not diagnostic.

, Tell your doctor if you are experiencing any of the following signs or symptoms that may be indicative of hyperthyroidism:


A faster than normal heart rate
Unexplained weight loss
Increased appetite
Sweating
A tremor, often in your hands
Anxiety, irritability, and/or other mood changes
Fatigue
More frequent bowel movements
An enlarged thyroid gland (which can be felt in your neck, and is called a ""goiter"")
Trouble sleeping
Eyes that bulge or protrude more than they normally do (this sign is present in a certain type of hyperthyroidism called Grave's disease — specifically, the eye abnormality is called ""Grave's ophthalmopathy"")

, Ongoing monitoring can also ensure that your TSH level is within the target range.


The treatment for hypothyroid and hyperthyroid conditions are very different.
The target range for thyroid treatment is normally a TSH between 0.4.–4.0 mIU/L, although this may vary depending upon the type of thyroid disorder you have.
You will likely receive more frequent monitoring at the start of your treatment, until you settle into a routine where your TSH becomes quite consistent (at which point less frequent monitoring may be appropriate, usually about once every 12 months).

, The normal range for free T4 is between 0.8 – 2.8 ng/dL.


The exact numbers may vary depending on the lab and the specific form of test that is performed.
However, most laboratory results have, next to your reading, a designated normal range so that you can easily see whether your T4 is low, normal, or elevated.

, On the other hand, if your TSH value is abnormally low (indicative of possible hyperthyroidism), a high T4 would support the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism.


As previously mentioned, the results are best interpreted in conjunction with the TSH value and under the guidance of the medical professional.

, T4 is the main thyroid hormone used in the diagnosis of thyroid conditions. There are certain cases of hyperthyroidism, however, when the T3 becomes significantly elevated and the T4 remains normal (in certain disease states), and this is when the T3 measurement becomes particularly important.


If the T4 is normal but the TSH is low, a high T3 can confirm the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism.
While the T3 can provide valuable information in diagnosing hyperthyroidism, it does not help to diagnose hypothyroidism.
Free T3 is normally between 2.3–4.2 pg/mL in adults over 18 years old.
Again, the exact numbers may vary depending on the lab and the specific form of test that is performed. Most laboratory results have, next to your reading, a designated normal range so that you can easily see whether your T3 is low, normal, or elevated.

, The beauty of our medical system is that patients do not have to interpret their own results. Your doctor will order tests and interpret your results. She can provide a diagnosis and begin a treatment plan, which likely will include a combination of medication and lifestyle changes. Having a general working knowledge of the results and what they mean can help you understand the disorder and help understand the treatment for the condition.


Ordering your own tests can be very dangerous and often lead to misguided treatment. You would not try to fix an engine if you did not have training — this is no different.

, Antibody testing is commonly performed, and may lead to important clues as to what is going on with your thyroid.


Thyroid antibody testing can help to differentiate between types of thyroiditis and also autoimmune conditions of the thyroid.
TPO (thyroid peroxidase antibody) may be elevated in autoimmune thyroid conditions such as Grave's Disease or Hashimoto's Thyroiditis.
TG (thyroglobulin antibody) may also be elevated in Grave's Disease or Hashimoto's Thyroiditis.
TSHR (TSH receptor antibodies) may be elevated in Grave's Disease.

, Calcitonin may be elevated in cases of thyroid cancer (which may be the underlying cause behind various forms of thyroid dysfunction). The calcitonin value may also be high in cases of C-cell hyperplasia, which is another form of abnormal growth of cells in the thyroid gland.

, Your physician will let you know if he or she recommends further testing, such as a thyroid ultrasound, a biopsy, or an iodine test.


A thyroid ultrasound may be used to identify thyroid nodules. If any nodules are found, the ultrasound can provide insight as to whether they are solid or cystic (fluid-filled) nodules, both of which are require different modes of treatment. Ultrasound can also be used to monitor any growth or changes to the nodules over time.
A thyroid biopsy can take a sample of a suspicious nodule and rule in or rule out the possibility of cancer.
An iodine uptake scan can measure which areas of the thyroid are appropriately active (i.e. functional). It can also identify which areas are inactive (non-functional) or hyperactive (excessively functional).

Know the causes of laryngitis.,
Recognize the early symptoms.,
Be aware of risk factors.",How to Quickly Get Rid of Laryngitis1," Laryngitis is typically caused by a viral infection such as a cold or bronchitis, and it tends to go away by itself in adults.


In children, however, laryngitis can cause complications that may lead to croup, a respiratory condition.
In some cases, a bacterial or fungal infection causes laryngitis.
Exposure to a chemical irritant can also lead to laryngitis.;
, To help get rid of laryngitis quickly, you need to be able to recognize the symptoms as soon as possible. People suffering from laryngitis usually experience:Hoarseness of voice
A swollen, sore, or itchy throat
Dry cough
Difficulty swallowing

, The following risk factors contribute to the likelihood of developing laryngitis:Upper respiratory tract infections such as cold and diseases that inflame the voice box or larynx.
Excessive use of the vocal chords. Laryngitis is common in people whose profession requires them to talk, yell, or sing frequently.
Allergies that cause throat inflammation.
Acid reflux, which can irritate the vocal chords.
The use of corticosteroid medication to treat asthma can cause throat irritation and inflammation.
Smoking, which irritates and inflames the vocal chords.

"

Take over-the counter pain relievers such as ibuprofen, aspirin, or paracetamol.,
Avoid decongestants.,
Take antibiotics your doctor prescribes.,
Talk with your doctor about corticosteroid medication.,
Identify and treat the underlying causes of laryngitis.",How to Quickly Get Rid of Laryngitis2," These medicines will help quickly relieve throat pain and control fever.These pain relievers often come in either pill or liquid form.
Follow your doctor’s instructions regarding the dosage or the directions listed on the bottle.
You can also ask a pharmacist about the best medication to relieve your symptoms, or for questions about how to take this medicine.

, Decongestants dry out your throat and might make your laryngitis worse. If you want to recover quickly, avoid these medications., In cases where the laryngitis is caused by a bacterial infection, the doctor can prescribe an antibiotic, which often provides fast relief.Don’t take antibiotics you may have around the house without consulting a doctor.
In most cases of laryngitis, which are caused by a virus, antibiotics will not provide relief.
Your doctor might give you an injection of antibiotics to accelerate the healing process.

, If you have a bad case of laryngitis, but need your voice back to normal as soon as possible to give a presentation, make a speech, or sing, you can ask your doctor about whether corticosteroid medication might be a good option. These medicines can offer fast relief of inflammation caused by laryngitis.Corticosteroids are usually only prescribed in severe cases or urgent situations.

, To quickly and effectively treat laryngitis that is not caused by a virus or a bacterial infection, it’s important to identify the underlying cause and take medicine that will treat that condition.


Over the counter acid reflux medicine may relieve laryngitis caused by acid reflux or GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease).
If your laryngitis seems to be allergy-related, take allergy medication.
If you are unsure about the cause of your laryngitis, it’s a good idea to work with a medical professional who can best diagnose and recommend a treatment plan for your symptoms.

Rest the vocal chords.,
Stay hydrated and keep your throat moist.,
Gargle.,
Avoid irritants such as smoke.,
Inhale steam or use air humidifiers.,
Try herbal remedies.",How to Quickly Get Rid of Laryngitis3," If you want to recover quickly, rest your vocal chords as much as possible. Talking can strain the muscles, which aggravates inflammation.Do not whisper. Contrary to popular belief, whispering doubles the stress on the larynx.
Speak softly or write down what you have to say.

, For a speedy recovery from laryngitis, it's important to remain hydrated and keep your throat moist to relieve irritation. Drink lots of liquids and try sucking on lozenges or chewing gum.When the throat is particularly sore, warm fluids can be soothing. Try drinking lukewarm water, soup, or warm tea with honey.
Avoid caffeine and alcohol, which can actually increase dryness and irritation.
Sucking lozenges and chewing gum help increase the production of saliva, which will relieve throat irritation.

, Gargling—holding lukewarm water in the mouth, tilting the head back and using the muscles in the throat to make an “ahhhh” sound—can also quickly ease some of your symptoms. To experience the most benefit and recover from your laryngitis quickly, gargle several times a day for several minutes at a time.Try gargling with warm water and ½ teaspoon of salt dissolved in the water to increase saliva production, promote healing, and relieve your symptoms faster.
You can also gargle with a tablet of Aspirin dissolved in a glass of lukewarm water for pain relief. It is important to avoid swallowing the aspirin, and this mixture should not be given to children under the age of 16 to avoid the risk of choking.
Some people recommend gargling mouthwash, since it is supposed to kill germs and bacteria in your mouth.
Another gargling home remedy people is to try is a mixture of equal parts water and vinegar, which is thought to kill bacteria and fungi that may cause laryngitis.

, Smoke contributes to further inflammation of the larynx, as it will irritate and dry out the throat.Laryngitis sufferers are encouraged to quit smoking and avoid staying around smokers.

, Moist air can help lubricate the throat’s airways and decrease inflammation, so try inhaling steam or using an air humidifier to alleviate your laryngitis.Turn on the hot water in the shower so there is plenty of steam, and spend 15 to 20 minutes inhaling the steam.
You can also try inhaling the steam over a bowl of hot water. It often helps to put a towel over your head so the steam does not dissipate as quickly.

, Herbs have long been used to treat sore throat and other symptoms related to laryngitis, but they can cause side effects, especially when they interact with other supplements or medications. While it’s best to talk with a health care professional about whether or not it is safe to use herbs to treat your laryngitis, there is a list below of some of the herbs thought to provide relief from laryngitis.Eucalyptus can soothe an irritated throat. Use fresh leaves to drink as a tea or use as a gargle. Do not drink eucalyptus oil as it is poisonous.
Peppermint is similar to eucalyptus and can help treat common colds and sore throats. Do not use peppermint or menthol with infants and do not take peppermint oil by mouth.
Licorice is used as a treatment for sore throat. However, consult with your doctor before eating licorice especially if you are taking medications such as aspirin or warfarin. This may affect people who are pregnant, have high blood pressure, or who have heart, liver or kidney disease.
Slippery elm is thought to relieve throat irritation since it contains mucilage that coats the throat, but scientific evidence for this herbal remedy is limited. To test it on your laryngitis symptoms, mix 1 teaspoon of the powdered extract in a cup of warm water and sip slowly. Try to hold the mixture in your mouth for as long as possible before swallowing. Slippery elm might also impact the way your body absorbs medication, so talk with a healthcare expert and avoid taking other medication with slippery elm. You should also avoid this herb if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.

See a doctor.,
Report your symptoms to your doctor.,
Get tested.It is important to get tested to ensure that you have LCM.,
Consider your exposure to mice.",How to Recognize and Treat Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis (LCM)1," Because many of the symptoms associated with LCM occur in many other illnesses, it is important to see a doctor so that they can identify your specific condition. Even if it’s not LCM, the combination of so many symptoms indicates that you need some sort of medical treatment. Be sure to tell the doctor about any exposure to mice, areas contaminated with mouse droppings, pets such as hamsters, or any work you did with laboratory mice.


Even if you seem to be recovering, see a doctor anyway. Sometimes people infected with LCM seem to recover before relapsing into the second, more severe phase of the illness.Your doctor will prescribe a specific course of treatment based on your condition.
Even with medical help, recovery may take several months;however, recovery outlook is excellent, as less than 1% of cases end in death.;
, The symptoms of LCM can be caused by a number of different diseases and disorders. Let your doctor know about any problems you have been having with your health. The most common symptoms of LCM include:


Fever
Malaise and fatigue
Headaches
Nausea and vomiting
A lack of appetite
Aches and pains in the chest, jaw, and testicles, There are several tests that can confirm or rule out the presence of LCM.


Your doctor may test your white blood cell count and platelet count.If the doctor finds these counts are low, you might have LCM.
You might also get your blood tested for liver enzyme levels. These enzymes, if slightly elevated, could indicate LCM.
Another test that can help determine if LCM is present is the spinal tap. This procedure involves inserting a needle into your spinal canal to collect cerebrospinal fluid. Examining the fluid, a doctor can look for a decrease in glucose levels that could indicate LCM.

, Symptoms such as the above can be caused by many different disorders, not just LCM. If you have been exposed to mice, mouse droppings, or areas contaminated by mouse saliva, urine and stool, you may have particular reason to suspect LCM.

"
"
Call for emergency medical care if your symptoms worsen.,
Get checked for meningitis.,
Find out if it could be encephalitis.,
Monitor for hydrocephalus.",How to Recognize and Treat Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis (LCM)2," Be aware that after a few days of recovery, you may relapse into the second phase of LCM. This second phase can be more dangerous. If you are experiencing a stiff neck, high fever, confusion, problems with mobility, or paralysis, get immediate medical attention., Meningitis is inflammation of tissues that surround the brain. It is characterized by many of the same symptoms that you experienced in the first phase of LCM. These symptoms include fever, headache, a stiff neck, fever, malaise, and vomiting; however, these symptoms might become worse as the illness moves into the second stage. Additional symptoms of meningitis may include confusion and a rash., Encephalitis is the inflammation of the brain. Like meningitis, it can cause flu-like symptoms, headaches, and pain through the body. It can also lead to confusion or disordered thinking, hallucinations, and perception of smells that aren’t present. Other symptoms include problems with movement, poor coordination, and paralysis.Stiffness in the neck, vomiting, sensitivity to light may also be present.


If meningitis and encephalitis occur together, you have a condition known as meningoencephalitis.This is not an uncommon development in severe cases of LCM.

, Hydrocephalus is an increase in the pressure of the cerebrospinal fluid between the brain and skull. It may cause difficulty controlling motor skills such as walking or moving the hands. It might also result in urinary incontinence, blurred vision, drowsiness and a lack of energy, or general irritability."
"
Get medication.Depending on the severity of your case, your doctor might prescribe medication.,
Get a shunt.,
Protect at-risk individuals.",How to Recognize and Treat Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis (LCM)3," Corticosteroids and other anti-inflammatory medicines are the most common medications for LCM. They do not kill the LCM virus, but they sometimes help with symptoms and some of the more serious consequences, such as encephalitis.


Common corticosteroids include prednisone and methylprednisolone.Ribavirin has been studied as a treatment for LCM, but the results are mixed, and there are side effects.
Always use medications as directed.

, If your LCM has developed into hydrocephalus, you’ll need to get a shunt. A shunt or shunt system is a surgical device that diverts cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the brain or spine to another part of the body, usually the abdomen, but sometimes the lung or heart.Shunts may need to be replaced if they fail or become obstructed.
Potential side-effects of shunts include infection, over draining (removing too much CSF from the brain or spine), and under draining (not removing enough CSF from the brain or spine). You’ll likely need to make frequent follow-up trips to the doctor to ensure your shunt system is operating properly.

, Anyone can catch LCM. Pregnant women are at special risk because the infection can spread to the fetus and cause severe problems. Everyone should take special care to keep mice and other rodents away. Use mousetraps and block up potential points of entry into your house by mice and rats. For instance, plaster over any cracks in the walls where rodents may have access.


""Keep food in sealed containers. Clean areas contaminated with mouse saliva, urine or droppings carefully, using a face mask or covering, gloves, and disinfectant.
Laboratory workers who handle or are surrounded by mice and rodents in their work are also at higher risk for LCM than the average individual.Maintain excellent hygiene and follow laboratory protocols to ensure you do not contract the disease. Re-test rodents periodically to ensure that they do not have LCM.

Wash your hands regularly.,
Do not share drinks, straws, or utensils.,
Cover your mouth when you cough and sneeze.,
Take care with food during pregnancy.,
Learn when you're most at risk.,
Check with your doctor about vaccinations.,
Watch for signs and symptoms of infection.,
Seek medical treatment immediately for an infection.,
Ask about antibiotics if you have close contact with an infected person.,
Drink in moderation.,
Eat a healthy diet.,
Exercise regularly.,
Get enough sleep.",How to Protect Yourself From Meningitis," The best way to prevent meningitis is to make personal hygiene a priority. Wash your hands throughout the day. You should wash your hands after using the bathroom, before and after eating food, before and after preparing food, and after handling animals, sneezing or coughing, and interacting with a sick person.Strive to wash your hands for about 20 seconds. It can help to hum the ""Happy Birthday"" song twice to keep track of time.
Wash your hands completely. Do not neglect the backs of your hands, beneath your fingernails, and between your fingers.
Make sure to rinse your hands under warm water and dry them with a towel.;
, Meningitis can be spread through the saliva of a sick person. Therefore, practice basic personal hygiene. Never share drinks, straws, or utensils with others. This is especially important if the person in question is sick., Make sure to cover both your mouth and nose. This can limit the amount of germs in the air. You may want to carry a handkerchief or tissue if you sneeze or cough frequently.Remember to wash your hands after sneezing or coughing.

, You can be infected with listeriosis when pregnant, which is a bacteria that can cause meningitis. This can affect your health, and the health of your baby. Listeriosis can be caused by eating contaminated food.Make sure to cook all meats, including things like deli meats and hot dogs, up to 165 F (74 C).
Check labels when purchasing cheeses. Do not buy any cheeses made from unpasteurized milk.

, Babies are at an increased risk for meningitis as they're too young for vaccination. However, people of any age group can develop meningitis. If you live among a large group of people, you're at greater risk. Take extra precautions if you live in a community setting, like a college., Some forms of meningitis are preventable with certain immunizations. Check your medical records to see when and if you received a vaccination for meningitis. If you need a vaccination, make an appointment to receive one as soon as possible.The haemophilus influenzae type B vaccine is usually recommended to young children. However, if you have a disease that compromises your immune system, talk to your doctor. He or she may feel you would also benefit from receiving this vaccine.

, Meningitis can be serious and even fatal if left untreated. Make sure you're vigilant about symptoms, especially if there is a meningitis outbreak in your area. Symptoms include the following:Nausea.
Vomiting.
Increased sensitivity to light.
Confusion.
Neck stiffness.

, Late symptoms of meningitis can include seizures and a coma. Therefore, it's vital to seek treatment as soon as symptoms develop. Meningitis can be fatal without prompt treatment.If you have an infant, symptoms may be difficult to recognize. Infants with a meningitis infection may vomit, be irritable, and appear slow and inactive. If you notice any of these symptoms in your infant, take your baby to the doctor right away.

, If you're caring for someone infected with meningitis, you may want to take antibiotics to prevent an infection. Antibiotics may also be recommended if you're living with someone at an increased risk of a meningitis infection. Talk to your doctor about trying antibiotics if you live with or care for someone with a meningitis infection or someone who may develop one., Alcohol can lower the body's immune system, limiting your ability to fight off infections like meningitis. Therefore, it's a good idea to refrain from drinking most days. When you do drink, do so in moderation.Moderation is defined as up to one drink a day for women and up to two drinks a day for men.
Binge drinking can lower your immune system. This is drinking more than five drinks for men and more than four drinks for women in a two hour period.
You should stick to having one or two drinks each day, if that. If you do not currently consume alcohol, do not start.

, Having a healthier overall diet can boost your immune system. There are many supplements and special diets meant to boost immunity, but research on their effectiveness is limited. For best results, stick to a basic healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains over any fad diets or dietary supplements.Eat a wide variety of fresh, frozen, and canned fruits and vegetables. You should try to add some fruits and veggies to your plate at every meal. Look for ways to add fruits and vegetables to a meal. For example, add some spinach to a mac and cheese recipe.
Look for ways to prepare your food in healthier ways. Grill your chicken rather than frying it. Swap out dry, high-fiber beans for meat in a recipe.
Always choose whole grains over white bread, pasta, and rice. They have more nutrients and are more likely to leave you with a healthy immune system.

, Regular physical activity has an excellent effect on your immune system. Try to get in some physical activity every day. If you've been sedentary for a long time, discuss lifestyle changes with a doctor.Choose a form of physical activity you like, as you'll be more likely to stick to it. For example, say you hate running. Don't try doing a daily jog. Instead, opt to go swimming at your gym a few nights a week.
If you have a busy schedule, try to fit your workout into your established routine. For example, start walking or biking to work instead of driving.

, A poor sleep schedule can have a negative impact on your immune system. If you're looking to boost your immune system, fighting off a potential meningitis infection, work on prioritizing sleep.Stick to a sleep schedule. If you go to bed and wake up at the same time each day, including weekends, your body will adapt to a natural rhythm. This will make it easier to fall asleep at night and wake up in the morning.
Practice a bedtime ritual that relaxes you, like reading a book or taking a warm shower. Avoid electronics, however, as the blue light emitted from laptop and phone screens can make sleep difficult.
Avoid napping, especially in the afternoon, as this can make it hard to sleep at night.

Monitor the duration and locations of your pain.,
Test your own pain resilience.,
Pay attention to the amount and quality of your sleep.,
Watch for “fibro fog”.,
Watch out for simple physical signs of fibromyalgia too.",How to Recognize Fibromyalgia Symptoms1," Fibromyalgia is characterized by widespread, chronic pain in multiple areas of the body. If you have been experiencing pain in multiple parts of your body for over three months, it may be associated with fibromyalgia.Pain from fibromyalgia will occur on both sides of your body, as well as above and below your waist.
Pain is the primary symptom of fibromyalgia. It can exist as deep muscular pain, soreness, stiffness, burning or throbbing.
Muscle stiffness usually presents upon awakening and usually decreases in severity throughout the day.
There are 18 “tender points” important in the diagnosis of fibromyalgia.;
, You can check yourself for fibromyalgia-like pain symptoms by pressing with the equivalent force of nine pounds of pressure on different spots on your body.To press with nine pounds of force, push a bit harder than you would to open most interior doors, but not quite as hard as you would to open most exterior doors.The spots you should check include:

The front and back of your neck.
The front of your chest, at the second rib.
The back of your neck.
The back of your shoulders near the arms, and the areas covering your shoulder blades.
Your elbows.
Both sides of your bottom.
The rear parts of your hips.
Your knees.



, Fatigue is an extremely common symptom associated with fibromyalgia. If you are frequently tired despite spending sufficient time at rest, the quality of your sleep may be affected by pain you’re enduring while you’re asleep.Do you commonly wake up tired? If so, this may indicate an inability to stay asleep associated with pain from fibromyalgia.
Difficulty falling asleep, awakening during the night, and feeling exhausted upon waking are common symptoms for people who have fibromyalgia. Try and get enough rest so that you feel able to take on your day.

, Another common symptom associated with fibromyalgia is an inability to concentrate. Other similar cognitive difficulties, such as difficulty paying attention or concentrating on simple tasks, may be the result of fibromyalgia.Be wary of any type of psychological distress that occurs in tandem with increasing and widespread physical pain.
Watch out for depression and anxiety. Talk to your doctor if you are feeling depressed or anxious. Medication is available to treat these conditions.

, There are some symptoms of fibromyalgia that may seem innocuous, but are worth watching out for. In particular, watch out for:Inexplicable stiffness in the morning.
Tingling and numbness in your hands and feet.
Particularly painful menstrual periods.

Address specific sleep conditions.,
Take care of your head!,
Note other non-defining symptoms associated with fibromyalgia.,
Recognize common demographic characteristics.",How to Recognize Fibromyalgia Symptoms2," Many patients with fibromyalgia have other sleep disorders that are independent conditions and can be addressed accordingly.See a sleep specialist to determine whether you have restless legs syndrome or sleep apnea.
Deal with other sources of nighttime discomfort or disturbances to help cope with the fatigue associated with fibromyalgia or fibromyalgia-like symptoms.

, Almost everyone endures headaches from time to time, but those who suffer from fibromyalgia may get headaches – and even migraines – with particular regularity.Talk to a health care professional about frequent headaches. They may be able to help you identify whether you’re suffering from tension headaches or temporomandibular joint issues (commonly referred to as TMJ).
Address specific types of headaches according to the associated recommended treatments.
More than half of a patients with fibromyalgia have headaches. These headaches include tension and migraine headaches. Fibromyalgia is correlated with an increased frequency of headaches.

, Aside from those symptoms that are used to help diagnose fibromyalgia, there are other conditions that are commonly experienced by those who suffer from fibromyalgia.If any of the following occur, be sure to mention them to your doctor:


Irritable bowel syndrome, commonly referred to as IBS.
Sensitivity to temperature changes.
Inexplicable weight gain loss.
Feelings of weakness, or struggles with balance.
Hearing and vision problems.
The onset of previously absent allergic reactions, and sensitivity to chemicals.
Heart palpitations, heartburn, and low blood pressure.
Interstitial cystitis or painful bladder symptoms
Facial and jaw pain and tenderness caused by TMJ

, Although anyone can get fibromyalgia, the condition is most commonly observed in women of childbearing age. It is important to note that men, as well as the elderly and even children can suffer from fibromyalgia as well.Note that a malfunction in the central nervous system is the main determinant of fibromyalgia, and that stress and other psycho-behavioral factors are significant factors in the advent of fibromyalgia.
If coping with depression of anxiety, see a mental health professional to help you address any sources of mental, emotional, and physical discomfort.
Addressing mental health issues will potentially reduce the symptoms of fibromyalgia!

See a doctor.,
Exclude other potential causes.,
Rule out small-fiber polyneuropathy in particular.",How to Recognize Fibromyalgia Symptoms3," Believe it or not, it often takes some patients - even with the help of doctor - up to five years to recognize that they have fibromyalgia. This is because so many of the symptoms mimic other health issues. Getting a proper diagnosis as early as possible, however, will help you better be able to address the condition.Increased understanding of fibromyalgia has led to steadily improving methods of recognizing and treating the condition.
Your doctor will be most capable of helping you determine the best approach to countering any symptoms you may be enduring.

, Along with the help of your doctor, make sure no other common health issues may be causing your symptoms.Rule out rheumatic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis. These types of diseases all begin with generalized aches and pains, but will require different treatment than fibromyalgia.
Address any mental health problems. Depression and anxiety can often lead to physical symptoms such as aches and pains that are hard to diagnose as well.
Rule out neurological disorders too. The numbness and tingling that you may associate with fibromyalgia may actually be caused by other serious issues, such as multiple sclerosis.

, While fibromyalgia has no definitive cause and is hard to treat, a disease called small-fiber polyneuropathy (SFPN) is a specific medical condition that is easily misunderstood as fibromyalgia.Some patients who have been formally diagnosed with fibromyalgia have been found to actually be suffering from this disease, which causes damage to the nerves within the skin.

Learn about adjustment disorder.,
Know the types of situations that can cause adjustment disorder.,
Be aware that anyone can have adjustment disorder.,
Know that the prognosis for adjustment disorder is good.,
Look for symptoms that resemble those of depression.,
Look for signs of anxiety.,
Be alert for signs of social withdrawal.,
Notice uncharacteristic behaviors.,
Pay attention to physical symptoms.,
Consider the time frame of adjustment disorder.,
Understand the difference between adjustment disorder and PTSD.,
Distinguish between adjustment disorder and depression.,
Distinguish between adjustment disorder and anxiety.",How to Recognize Adjustment Disorder," Adjustment disorder is a pattern of emotional or behavioral disturbance that occurs after a stressful event. Someone with adjustment disorder may experience depressive symptoms and anxiety. They may also have difficulty functioning in their career or personal life.While it’s normal to have some emotional difficulties or problems adjusting after a stressful event, people with adjustment disorder react significantly more strongly to these events than most others would.
To diagnose adjustment disorder over normal stress, there are some symptoms to lookout for. Symptoms of adjustment disorder include anxiety, poor work or school performance, relationship problems, sadness, thoughts of suicide, excessive worrying, and trouble sleeping.;
, Almost any major life change can trigger the onset of adjustment disorder. A few common causes include divorce, relocating to an unfamiliar area, losing a job, or having a baby.Adjustment disorder can be triggered by both positive and negative events.
Emotional problems following the death of a loved one are typically classified as bereavement instead of adjustment disorder., Adjustment disorder affects both men and women. Adults and children from all backgrounds and cultures may experience adjustment disorder at some point in life.Young people and people living in stressful situations, such as illness or abuse, may be at increased risk for developing the disorder.

, Most of the time, adjustment disorder goes away by itself within six months. The majority of people with the disorder adapt to their new circumstances and become better able to cope with the demands of their life.Even though adjustment disorder typically goes away by itself, it’s still a good idea for someone with the condition to seek counseling. Counseling can speed up the recovery process and help people learn new ways to cope with stress.
Less than six months is called Acute Adjustment Disorder, while more than six months of the condition is referred to as Chronic Adjustment Disorder.

, Someone with adjustment disorder may seem to be in a funk constantly. Adjustment disorder can cause low mood, irritability, frequent crying spells, and loss of interest in activities that were once enjoyable.Adjustment disorder is sometimes called “situational depression.” Unlike major depression, situational depression is caused by life events and usually goes away after the stressor is removed or the person adapts to their new circumstances.

, Adjustment disorder is a stress-based condition, so it produces many of the same symptoms as anxiety disorders including nervousness, jitteriness, and hopelessness. Someone who develops high levels of anxiety or often seems tense or on edge after experiencing a stressful event may be suffering from adjustment disorder., One warning sign for adjustment disorder is spending less time with friends and family. Someone with adjustment disorder may have a hard time meeting social responsibilities, or they may simply lose interest in spending time with others.Missing work, school, or other appointments can also be an indicator of adjustment disorder.

, Some people with adjustment disorder start acting inappropriately or without regard for others. Fighting, vandalizing property, driving carelessly, and other reckless behavior may be signs of adjustment disorder, especially if the person has never acted that way before.Children with adjustment disorder may be more likely than adults are to get into fights or otherwise act out inappropriately.

, Like many other mental health disorders, adjustment disorder can cause physical aches and pains. Heart palpitations, headaches, digestive problems, and sleep problems can all be linked to the condition., Adjustment disorder usually develops within three months following a stressful event. Most of the time, the condition goes away within six months of the event. If symptoms persist longer than six months, consider whether a different condition could be to blame.Major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder can both be mistaken for adjustment disorder.

, Adjustment disorder and PTSD both develop in response to stressful events. However, adjustment disorder can be caused by any type of stressful event, while PTSD develops in response to life-threatening situations. Adjustment disorder typically does not cause flashbacks, while PTSD does. PTSD also does not go away by itself., Adjustment disorder and depression share many similarities, and adjustment disorder is even called situational depression sometimes. However, unlike major depression, adjustment disorder is caused by a specific event, and it usually resolves itself within six months. If adjustment disorder does not go away by itself, consider whether you might actually be dealing with depression.Untreated adjustment disorder can also turn into major depression, especially if the stressor is ongoing rather than a one-time event.

, Many people with adjustment disorder feel anxious and tense. To tell the difference, consider whether the anxiety has been present for a long time, or whether it has developed recently in response to a certain stimulus. Anxiety that can be traced back to a particular event is probably a symptom of adjustment disorder."

Talk to your doctor about whether regular screenings are right for you.",How to Know if You Have H. Pylori," An H. Pylori infection can cause peptic ulcers in your stomach and lower intestine. As H. Pylori rarely causes symptoms in and of itself, a peptic ulcer can alert you to a potential infection. If you have a peptic ulcer, you may display some of the following symptoms:You may have a dull pain in your stomach that does not go away. Pain will usually come two to three hours after eating.
The pain will come and go for several weeks, and may sometimes happen in the middle of the night when your stomach is empty.
The pain may go away temporarily when you take medications like antacids and other over-the-counter pain medications.;
, You may experience nausea if you have an H. Pylori infection.Pay attention to your body and notice of any nausea you experience.You may vomit when you experience nausea. With an H. Pylori infection, your vomit may include blood. You may also notice a substance that resembles coffee grounds.
Nausea can be caused by a wide variety of factors, such as motion sickness, the flu, eating or drinking something that did not sit well with you, or morning sickness during pregnancy. If your nausea is persistent, and you do not have any obvious cause, it may be related to an H. Pylori infection.

, A loss of appetite can also be a symptom of an H. Pylori infection. You may not be interested in food or eating. This may come in conjunction with the feelings of nausea and indigestion associated with the disease.If you're having a loss of appetite, which is accompanied by unexplained weight loss, you may want to talk to a doctor. Loss of appetite is a common symptom of many diseases, including some cancers.See your doctor to rule out any serious conditions if you're experiencing a loss of appetite.

, You may experience some odd changes in your body when you have an H. Pylori infection. Take note of any sudden changes and see a doctor for evaluation.It's not uncommon for the abdomen to be bloated slightly during an H. Pylori infection.
You may also notice your stools have become increasingly black and tarry.
Sometimes, people with an H. Pylori infection will experience frequent bouts of the hiccups.

, As symptoms are rare, and easily mistaken for other conditions, think about your risk factors. If you have a lot of risk factors for an H. Pylori infection, symptoms like stomach cramps may be cause for concern.If you live in crowded conditions, such as a small home with many people, this increases your risk of infection.
If you don't have regular access to clean water, you may also have an increased risk of infection.
If you live in a developing country, or have recently visited one, this also increases your risk for infection.
If you're living with someone who you know has H. Pylori, this means you're more likely to have the infection yourself.

, H. Pylori is not usually a medical emergency; however, some symptoms can become serious. If you experience any of the following, seek immediate medical attention:Difficulty swallowing
Severe abdominal pain
Bloody stools
Bloody vomit

, Talk to your doctor about your symptoms and why you think you may have H. Pylori and see if she agrees that a test is necessary. People who should be tested for H. Pylori include those with certain gastric tumors, active peptic ulcer disease, or history of peptic ulcer disease. People who are under the age of 55 who have dyspepsia may be candidates for treatment.

, Though this is not the most accurate test for H. Pylori, it is not as invasive as some other options. During this test, you swallow a substance that contains a waste product called urea. Urea breaks down proteins in the stomach. If an infection is present, the urea will be converted to carbon dioxide which can be detected in the breath.You will need to prepare for a breath test for about two weeks. Your doctor will advise you to stop taking any over-the-counter or prescription medication you're using to treat H. Pylori.
You will swallow the urea in the doctor's office. After 10 minutes, you'll be asked to exhale and the doctor will test your breath for carbon dioxide.

, Your doctor may want to test your stool for traces of H. Pylori. This is usually done after treatment to confirm H. Pylori has been eradicated and you no longer have an infection.Your doctor may order a stool test after a positive breath test and subsequent treatment.
Listen to your doctor's instructions carefully in regards on how to collect and store your stools. Collection methods vary by hospital.
There is also a rapid stool antigen test for H.Pylori. Talk with your doctor about this option — it may not be available everywhere.

, A blood test can also be used to check for H. Pylori; however, this test may not be as accurate as a breath test. It can only test whether your body currently contains H. Pylori antibodies. It cannot tell if you are presently infected.Your doctor may order a blood test for a variety of reasons. She may want to confirm an infection. If your doctor orders a blood test, trust that your doctor knows what's best for you. It's a simple procedure that should not take long.
Other methods that are not as commonly utilized include PCR chain reaction, salivary assays, urinary assays, and C13-urea blood test.

, A biopsy is the most accurate way to test for H. Pylori. In a biopsy, a small tissue sample is taken from your stomach. You'll have to have an endoscopy, a somewhat invasive medical procedure, conducted at the hospital to remove the sample.During an endoscopy, a small tube will be inserted into your mouth and then fed into your stomach. In addition to removing a tissue sample, your doctor will check for inflammation.While the most accurate means to diagnose H. Pylori, your doctor will not call for this procedure unless an endoscopy is necessary for other reasons. Your doctor may want to conduct an endoscopy if you have a peptic ulcer or are at risk for stomach cancer.

, After an infection is diagnosed, your doctor will recommend you take a variety of drugs to suppress stomach acid. Triple antibiotic therapy is the first line treatment for H. Pylori. The regimen most commonly employed for first line treatment include a proton pump inhibitor and two antibiotics for coverage against the bacteria. Treatment should last 14 days. Your doctor will recommend which particular drugs are best for you based on your medical history and current condition.Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are a range of drugs that stop acid production in the stomach. Your doctor may prescribe these drugs if excessive stomach acid is causing you pain.
Histamine (H-2) blockers can also block acid production by stopping the production of a substance called histamine. Histamine can trigger acid production in the stomach.
Bismuth subsalicylate, sold commercially as Pepto-Bismol, can coat stomach ulcers and can reduce pain.
Follow your doctor's instructions carefully in regards to which drugs he recommends. If you are on any existing medication, make sure to ask whether your current meds will interact with medication used to treat H. Pylori.

, Your doctor will want to make sure treatment of your H. Pylori was successful. He or she will probably want to do another round of testing about four weeks after your treatment. In the event treatment was unsuccessful, you may undergo a second round of treatment and be prescribed antibiotics. Usually the second round of testing includes upper endoscopy, fecal antigen test, or urease breath test for confirmation of eradication.

, You may want to be regularly screened for H. Pylori if you have a high risk of stomach cancer. An H. Pylori infection may increase your risk of developing stomach cancer. Discuss your concerns with your doctor and she will decide if regular screening for H. Pylori is right for you."

Diagnose pinworms.,
Visit the doctor.,
Treat the pinworms with medicine.",How to Kill Pinworm Eggs1," One of the easiest ways to diagnose a pinworm infection is to use the tape test. Take a piece of clear cellophane tape and wrap it around your fingers with the sticky side out. As soon as your child wakes up, firmly press the sticky tape on the skin around the anus. The eggs will stick to the tape.Keep the tape and put it immediately into a sealed baggie. Remember, the tape is infectious and can spread eggs to other people.
Make sure you perform the tape test before your child uses the toilet or bathes. Some physicians recommend the tape test three mornings in a row, but chances are good that one test will be enough.;
, Even if you see eggs on the tape, take your child or the infected person to the doctor. A doctor can verify that the infection is pinworms and not something else. Bring the tape with you to show your child’s doctor.The doctor can place the tape under a microscope to determine if there are pinworm eggs on the tape.

, Pinworm infections can be treated with two doses of medicine. The first batch of medicine is given when the pinworms are discovered. The second one is repeated two weeks later. This is to make sure all the adults that have hatched since the first dose are killed, because the medicine is ineffective in killing pinworm eggs.Everyone in the household should be treated at the same time.
Common medications used are mebendazole, pyrantel pamoate, and albendazole. Pyrantel pamoate is available as an over-the-counter medication. The others are available as prescriptions. Discuss with your doctor which medicine he suggests that is right for your infection.

Keep fit and healthy.,
Keep away from hospitals where possible.,
Stay away from other places where the potential for spread of a superbug is high.,
Practice standard hygiene.,
Know how to spot the symptoms of succumbing to a superbug infection.,
Avoid medical tourism.,
Head for healthy bolt holes.",How to Protect Yourself During a Superbug Outbreak," This is always your number one path of resistance against any superbug. The primary aim is to keep out of hospital where you are most likely to come into contact with superbugs. So it makes good sense to stay as healthy as you can. To this end:



Eat healthily - get adequate nutrition, avoid sugar, trans fats, too many processed foods, and fast food
Exercise regularly - it doesn't have to be painful but it does have to be regular and active. Go for a walk every day, ride your bike, dance daily in your own living room.

Get plenty of sleep every night.
Avoid being a couch potato most of your time - find a variety of ways to unwind after a hard day, from crafts to writing for wikiHow.
Avoid over-consumption of alcohol and drugs.
Keep your distance from people who are unwell - try to stay away from people who have colds and flus. If they come to work, pressure them to go home.;
, If you are healthy, unless you work in a hospital, stay away from them. This is most important where your own health is not optimal but you don't need actual medical attention – a weakened immune system coupled with hospital visits could leave you more exposed to superbugs. If you have no choice but to go to a hospital, consider the following:


Use their hand washing facilities and keep your hands thoroughly cleaned at all times.
Read How reduce the risk of hospital spread infections.
Don't wander around the hospital. Stay to the areas you need to be in (such as visitor's room, emergency entrance area, your own bed ward, etc.).
If you're a patient, try to get some time outside every day if possible. Fresh air is important.
If you are staff, from cleaner to doctor, follow all hospital procedures in place to protect you from illness.

, The following places can serve as breeding grounds for superbugs, either because of the high concentration of people, or because of a combination of poor hygiene habits and environmental factors such as humidity, etc.:


Swimming pools, change rooms, spas, saunas

Gyms
Schools, daycare centers (where an outbreak is confirmed)
Places dealing with beauty or body fashion, such as day spas, tattoo parlors, nail salons, etc.

, There are many personal practices that you can ensure are performed to a high standard of hygiene, including:


Not sharing any products used on your body, including cosmetics, deodorants, toothbrushes, hair brushes, even clothing and shoes.
Keep your hands washed regularly before and after meals, after being outside, after handling publicly shared goods, etc. Normal soap is fine - there is no evidence that commercial products with antibacterial elements are any more beneficial than standard washing products.Keep any wounds you have well covered. Use Band-Aids®, bandages, etc., to cover open wounds and scratches.
Cover your mouth and nose when you cough and sneeze. Dispose of used tissues, etc., immediately, or wash handkerchiefs at a high temperature.
Change your bedding regularly. Wash all bedding in high temperatures.
Don't go to public places like pools and bathhouses if you have any open sores, wounds, warts, etc.

, Be prepared to get yourself to a doctor quickly if you notice anything unusual or you feel bad. Symptoms of a superbug infection will vary, dependent on what microorganism is involved but warning signs might include:


Fever
Pain

Diarrhea, severe, cramps
Feeling really terrible, not at all yourself
Heat, swelling, tenderness in parts of your body.

, Medical tourism is the act of shopping around the world for the best price for medical procedures. The problem is that the standards of a country with cheaper medical options may not be as high as your home country and you can expose yourself to local bug resistance, and then bring it home with you., If you, or your family, are especially susceptible to a superbug breakout for any reason, you might want to consider a temporary move to somewhere else if your city or town has a major problem. Keep in mind the need for good medical care wherever you head to.

Understand the limitations of natural remedies.,
Use garlic.,
Try turmeric.,
Drink wormwood tea.",How to Kill Pinworm Eggs2," It is important to note that these alternative remedies are not backed by scientific evidence — evidence that they work is anecdotal, or based on personal experience and word of mouth. Without scientific studies to prove they are effective, there is no way to know if alternative treatments are helpful at all in treating pinworm.

If you want to try an alternative method, talk to your doctor first. These alternative methods should still be undertaken in combination with medication from your doctor, and should not considered to be medical therapies by themselves.

, Garlic is thought to be a good home remedy to help get rid of pinworms.First, eat lots of fresh garlic. The garlic may help reduce and kill the pinworms when you have a bowel movement. You can also make a garlic paste to apply around the anal area. The garlic may kill the eggs and the oil will help soothe the itching.


To make the paste, crush two to three cloves of fresh garlic. Add a few teaspoons of castor oil or mineral oil. Make sure you add enough to get a paste-like consistency. You can also make a paste by adding garlic to petroleum jelly.
Make sure to discuss home remedies with your doctor before using them.

, Turmeric has been shown in lab studies to kill parasites, though researchers are unsure if it kills parasites in humans; however, spicy foods, such as turmeric, are thought to be an effective cure against pinworms. Take 300 mg of turmeric in the form of a capsule three times a day.You may also consider making a tea with turmeric. Steep one teaspoon of turmeric in one cup of hot water for five to 10 minutes. Drink two to four cups.
Don't take turmeric if you use blood thinners because it increases the risk of bleeding.

, The wormwood herb has been traditionally used to help expel worms from the digestive tract. Add a three to four drops of wormwood tincture to a cup of warm water. Have your child drink one cup a day. Adults can drink two cups a day.


Talk to your doctor before using wormwood.
Don't take wormwood if you take anti-seizure medication. If you are allergic to ragweed, you may also be allergic to wormwood."
"
Wash your hands.,
Shower in the morning.,
Keep underwear and linens clean.",How to Kill Pinworm Eggs3," Everyone in the house needs to wash their hands often. You should especially wash your hands after doing a tape test or after coming in contact with your infected child. Wash your hands before you eat or put your hands in your mouth. Make sure to wash your hands thoroughly with lots of soap.Start by wetting your hands. Lather your hands well. Make sure you get the soap between your fingers and around your fingernails.
Use a soft brush to scrub under the fingernails — eggs can get lodged under fingernails, especially if the patient has been scratching.
After washing, rinse well with warm water. Then dry your hands thoroughly.
Keep fingernails short and clipped to prevent irritation and decrease the possibility of spread.

, When you or your child has pinworms, you should shower after waking up. Pinworms lay eggs at night, so the anal area will have thousands of eggs on it. These eggs can be spread to others, or they can hatch. As soon as you or your child wakes up, remove the contaminated clothing and take a shower.Take a shower instead of a bath. Bathing carries the risk of the eggs getting into the water and then on the body or in the mouth, which can lead to reinfection.

, Since the pinworms lay eggs on the anus, you need to make sure that the infected person changes her underwear every day. Don’t put the soiled underwear in the hamper with other clothes. Keep the infected person’s underwear separate to reduce the risk of spreading any pinworms or pinworm eggs.Wash all clothes, bed sheets, and towels in the hottest water available. If you don’t want to wash them every day, keep them in a sealed plastic bag until you wash them. Rinse all the clothes at least twice.
Make sure no one reuses towels during this time to help reduce the risk of spreading the eggs.
Consider using disposable gloves when handling potentially infected material.
Don’t shake any of the contaminated clothing or linens before they have been properly washed. This can cause the eggs to travel and spread, which may lead to reinfection.

Learn how pinworms are contracted.,
Identify the risk factors.,
Recognize the signs symptoms of pinworms.",How to Kill Pinworm Eggs4," Pinworms are contracted when you eat food, touch anything, or touch anyone infected with pinworm eggs and then put your fingers into your mouth. Once the eggs enter the intestines, they mature and hatch in your intestine. Female pinworms exit your intestines from your anus and lay their eggs on nearby skin.Adult pinworms are white and less than an inch long, or about the length of a staple. They migrate at night to the anus and lay their eggs there. They can lay up to 10,000 eggs.It only takes a few hours for the pinworm eggs to hatch and become capable of causing infection.
Pinworm eggs can survive for up to two weeks on clothing, bedding, food, and other surfaces. Pinworm eggs can survive for two weeks on pet fur, but only humans can be infected.

, Children under the age of 18 are at the highest risk for pinworms. It has been estimated that 10 to 40% of all children have had pinworms at one time or another.Young children are at the highest risk for pinworm infection, along with their household members and caretakers.Children can unknowingly spread pinworms within their household. If your child has pinworms, you should treat everyone in the household because there is a high risk that the child unknowingly spread the infection.
Children can also spread pinworms at school or in daycare centers.

, Unfortunately, most of the time a pinworm infection is asymptomatic, so the infected person has no idea he is infected. If the person does show signs and symptoms of an infection, the main sign of pinworm infection is itching around the anus. This especially occurs at night when the females are laying the eggs and the eggs are hatching. The itching can be severe, and your child may be very uncomfortable. Other symptoms may include urinary tract infections and sleep loss.Infection can occur if the patient scratches very hard and opens the skin.
You can diagnose pinworm infections at home using a tape test, but you still should have your child seen by his or her physician.

Consider whether or not you are between the ages of 40 and 60.,
Find out if you have diabetes.,
Know which conditions increase your risk of developing trigger finger.,
Be aware that women are more likely to suffer from trigger finger.,
See your doctor.,
Be detailed and factual during your visit.,
Know that x-rays or any elaborate laboratory test are not required to diagnose trigger finger.",How to Know if You Have Trigger Finger," The most common symptom is pain experienced at the base of the finger or over the palm when trying to extend the finger. There is pain during extension or flexing of the finger because the tendon can no longer easily slide back out of the tendon sheath due to inflammation.


If the inflamed portion of the tendon breaks free of its sheath, it may feel as if your finger is being dislocated.Typically, the dominant hand is more likely to be affected by the disorder. In particular, the thumb, middle, and ring fingers. Also be aware that more than one finger can be affected at a time.;
, When the affected finger is moved or extended, a “popping” or snapping sound (similar to the sound of cracked knuckles) can be heard. This occurs because the inflamed tendon is being pulled through a tendon sheath that is too narrow. It will happen when you straighten it and when you bend it., Generally, stiffness will be worse in the morning. It is not clear why stiffness gets worse in the early hours of the day, but some suspect that this may be due to lack of cortisol (a hormone) at night to counteract substances that cause inflammation.This is similar to ""gelling"" which occurs in hip and knee arthritis — inflammatory fluid builds up as you are not using the inflamed area at night and takes time in the morning to decrease that fluid.


Generally, this stiffness will lessen as the finger is used throughout the day., You may find a bump, or have swelling at the base of the affected finger or in the palm, this happens because the swelling causes the tendon to become bunched up into a hard knot.The bump may also move when you move your finger because the tendon also moves when you move your finger., As the inflammation worsens, the finger will be unable to fully extend, which ultimately requires you to use the other hand to straighten the finger. In severe cases, the finger cannot be extended even with assistance.


In some cases, it may abruptly pop straight from time to time, even when you are not trying to straighten it., You may also find a nodule there that's tender. This is actually a knot in the lining of your tendon. It will be on the palm side at the base of the affected finger., This is an indication of infection, which is something you definitely don't want to wait around and see what happens with. Most trigger finger cases clear up on their own with adequate rest, and are not a cause for great concern.However, infections can be very dangerous, even deadly if not treated quickly and properly.


Dupuytren's contracture is another disorder that often gets mistaken for trigger finger, though it is not the same. With this disorder, the connective tissues thicken and shorten. That being said, it can occur in conjunction with trigger finger., If the trigger finger is caused by infection of the synovium (lubricating membrane lining the joint), the infection may spread and cause osteomyelitis. Osteomyelitis is an infection of the bone where symptoms such as pain, fever, chills and swelling manifest.


This is one of the main reasons seeing a doctor is advised, even if you're just experiencing mild joint pain. Although most cases of trigger finger go away, it is better to be safe than sorry.
If you have recently had surgery, are an alcoholic, use steroids regularly, have sickle cell disease or rheumatoid arthritis, you should visit your doctor immediately as all these are risk factors for osteomyelitis., People with occupations or hobbies that require routine, repetitive finger movements, such as operating machines or power tools and playing musical instruments may be at higher risk of developing trigger finger.Constant grasping with forceful use of the finger to any object for an extended time can cause this condition due to repetitive trauma to the digits of the finger. Farmers, musicians, and even smokers (flicking the lighter) are at higher risk., Those most likely to develop trigger finger will be between 40 and 60 years old. This is perhaps because those who are older have spent considerably more time using their hands, and have likely sustained more damage over time than younger people.

, Those with diabetes are at a greater risk of developing trigger finger. The elevated levels of glucose present in diabetes patients may change the balance of proteins in the body, which stiffens collagen (connective tissues in the body) thereby leading to the stiffening of tendons in the fingers.The longer you have diabetes, the more likely you are to suffer from trigger finger. If you have diabetes and develop trigger finger, it can be indicative of other diabetic complications., Consider other diseases such as gout, amyloidosis, thyroid problems, carpal tunnel syndrome, Dupuytren’s Contracture, De Quervain’s disease. Any of these diseases increases your risk of developing trigger finger. If you suffer from one or more, be conscientious of any symptoms of oncoming trigger finger.


A recent study also found that most people with rheumatoid arthritis have swollen tendons, and may be at greater risk for developing trigger finger., Although it is not clear why, women tend to develop trigger finger more often than men., A simple medical history and physical exam of the affected finger must be performed in order to diagnose trigger finger. Your doctor will look for bumps or swollen spots in the affected area.Your doctor will also likely search for the classic “popping and locking” that occurs in those suffering from trigger finger., Because trigger finger has a number of causes that are often unclear or questionable, it's wise to be as thorough and detailed as possible about your medical and family history. Even if you don't think it's related or important, it could be important for diagnosis and treatment.


It is important that only factual information be given to the health care providers to ensure that a proper treatment plan can be developed. Patients are encouraged to answer questions in the most detailed way possible, and should not to hesitate to ask questions regarding possible treatment.

, It is only necessary for patients with history of inflammatory disease or trauma. In most cases, your doctor will rely on your symptoms, which is all the more reason to be honest and factual."

Examine your level of fatigue.,
Determine whether you feel weak or dizzy.,
See a doctor immediately if you have severe symptoms.",How to Know if You Are Anemic1," This is the most common symptom of all types of anemia. To figure out whether your fatigue may be related to anemia, rather than being the result of a few nights with too little sleep, think about the following questions. If your answer is yes, you might have anemia.Do you feel tired when you wake up in the morning, and throughout the rest of the day?
Do you have trouble concentrating and doing well at work or school, because you are so tired?
Do you lack the energy to accomplish basic tasks and chores, or does doing these activities seem to wipe you out?;
, Fatigue can be related to a lot of different conditions, but when it comes along with weakness and dizziness, anemia is certainly something to consider. If you often have to take a seat because you feel too weak or dizzy to stand, you should get tested for anemia., Left untreated, anemia can lead to life-threatening conditions.It's important to make an appointment with your doctor if you experience any of these less common symptoms:


Numbness or coldness in your feet
Pale skin
Rapid or irregular heartbeat
Shortness of breath
Chest pain
Very cold extremities regardless of temperature

"
"
Explain your medical history to your doctor.,
Get a CBC blood test.",How to Know if You Are Anemic2," Since anemia shares symptoms with many other conditions, your doctor may need to ask a lot of questions to determine which course of action to take. Talk to your doctor about the symptoms you are experiencing and give him or her information about your diet, lifestyle and family health history.

, Once your doctor has determined that you may have anemia, this test will be administered to determine the shape and count of your red blood cells.


If the lab results are positive for anemia, they will also tell the doctor which type of anemia you have.
Your doctor will work with you to prescribe treatment, which varies according to the type of anemia you have.Treatment for nutritional anemia is changes to diet, vitamin and iron and supplements or vitamin B-12 injections. Early acquired or genetic anemia may require red blood cell transfusions or hormone injections.

Ask your doctor about anemia caused by blood diseases.",How to Know if You Are Anemic3," This is the most common type of anemia, and it can sometimes be corrected by increasing your intake of iron. You may have IDA if you have experienced the following:


A heavy menstrual flow (iron is lost through the menstrual blood).
A severe injury during which you sustained a lot of blood loss.
Surgery that led to the loss of blood.
Ulcers or colon cancer.
A diet low in iron.

, This type of anemia results from having too little vitamin B12 in the body. B12 is necessary for the body to produce new blood cells and keep the nervous system healthy. You may have this type of anemia if the following is true:


You have an autoimmune disorder or intestinal problems that cause you to be unable to absorb vitamin B12 efficiently.
You don't have enough vitamin B12 in your diet. Since this vitamin is highly concentrated in foods that come from animals, vegetarians and vegans may have trouble getting enough B12.

, In some cases, anemia is caused by an underlying disease that affects the body's ability to create enough red blood cells to keep the body healthy. To determine whether this may be the case, discuss this with your doctor and undergo the appropriate tests.


Diseases that affect the kidneys can lower the body's ability to create red blood cells.
Anemias caused by inherited blood diseases include sickle cell anemia and thalassemia, and a plastic anemia, among others. Some people carry a predisposition for these anemias if one or both of their parents had the condition.
Acquired anemia is caused by exposure to toxins, viruses, chemicals or drugs that prevent the body from making healthy red blood cells.

Wash your hands often and well.,
Teach kids to wash their hands often and well.,
Demonstrate proper cough and sneeze practices.,
Keep fingers and shared objects out of mouths and noses.,
Take care with what you share.,
Clean toys, shared objects, and common surfaces regularly.,
Keep symptomatic kids home from school or other gatherings.,
Don’t let your guard down once symptoms subside.,
Know what HFMD is and how it spreads.,
Watch for telltale signs of infection.,
Treat symptoms as recommended.",How to Protect Kids from Hand Foot and Mouth Disease," HFMD spreads through contact with bodily secretions, and primarily through fecal contamination (or touching contaminated poop). If you wash your hands properly and regularly, you will significantly reduce your odds of acquiring or transmitting the virus.Adults usually have built up an immunity to HFMD and rarely display symptoms. They can, however, still spread the virus to children. Washing your hands after using the bathroom, sneezing or coughing, or changing a diaper, as well as when they are dirty or come in contact with potentially contaminated surfaces, can stop you from spreading a virus you probably don’t even know you have.When washing your hands:Use soap and warm water.
Lather and rub for at least 20 seconds.
Make sure to clean the wrists, between fingers, and under the tips of fingernails.
Rinse with clean water and dry with a clean towel.

;
, For their health and safety, make proper handwashing one of the first tasks you teach a child. Establish good habits from the start and you will reduce their odds of acquiring or spreading a host of illnesses, including HFMD.Wash kids’ hands for them until they can do it properly themselves, and supervise their washing afterward when possible.
Repeatedly emphasize the importance of proper handwashing after using the bathroom.
For a wide range of handwashing resources, including instructions, tips, videos, and activities, visit this CDC webpage. Also, this handout offers kid-friendly games and activities to incorporate into proper handwashing instruction.
In addition, keep your kid's nails trimmed and clean. Make sure you scrub underneath them and consider using a soft brush to make they are thoroughly cleaned. If you work around children or in health care, you should keep your nails short and clean as well.

, Fecal contamination on hands is the primary culprit in spreading HFMD, but nose and mouth secretions can also spread the virus as well. Teach kids to cough, sneeze, and blow their noses in the most hygienic manner and you can significantly curtail the spread of HFMD and a host of other illnesses.Teach kids to cough or sneeze into their sleeves or elbows, or a clean tissue, not into their hands. Emphasize the importance of handwashing after coughing, sneezing, or nose-blowing.
Create stories, songs, and games as teaching tools and reminders. Small children in particular will require regular reminders and demonstrations. Make sure you practice the proper techniques yourself — they are watching!, Any parent of a small child can tell you how tough it can be to stop kids from picking their noses, sucking their thumbs, or sticking any number of items in either their noses or mouths. The issue is bigger than these practices being “gross,” however — they can spread illnesses like HFMD.Of course, especially if you’re dealing with small children, you can only expect so much success in this area. Kids will be kids, and will put things in their mouths and noses that shouldn’t go there. This is why regular, thorough handwashing is so important. Teach it, practice it, and expect it. It is your best defense against HFMD.

, HFMD lives in the digestive tract and can spread by way of various bodily fluids, but fecal contamination is the primary contamination method. Unfortunately (and rather disgustingly), virtually any shared object can be contaminated with fecal matter; therefore, be very cautious when it comes to sharing everyday objects.Don’t share — and tell kids not to share — food, cups, utensils, toothbrushes, towels, or clothes (especially socks or shoes).Teach kids that sharing is good, but only when clean, germ-free items are shared.

, Cleaning can seem like a never-ending task when dealing with one or more kids, but keeping common objects and surfaces clean and disinfected will significantly reduce the likelihood of HFMD — especially when paired with regular handwashing.Especially in a school, preschool, or daycare setting, make sure toys are cleaned regularly. Clean common surfaces with soap and water, and disinfect with chlorine bleach diluted with water., If you know or even just suspect that a child has HFMD, keep him out of school and away from large gatherings of children. HFMD spreads most readily when the infected person is symptomatic.If your child has symptoms or a confirmed case of HFMD, keep him home and inform the child’s school. The school should have a protocol in place for informing other parents and disinfecting the classroom.

, The symptomatic period of HFMD may last for only three to five days, or more often for seven to 10 days; however, even after symptoms subside, the infected person may still be able to spread HFMD for several days or even a few weeks.Keep up a heightened cleanliness and hygiene regimen for at least several days after symptoms disappear. A child without symptoms can probably return to school (depending upon school policy), but make sure she understands the importance of being extra-certain to wash hands, cover coughs and sneezes, use tissues, and avoid sharing food or items that contact the nose or mouth., Hand Foot and Mouth Disease is the clinical symptoms that occur when someone is infected for the first time with coxsackievirus. It resides in the digestive tract of an infected person and is spread by contact with bodily fluids and waste products (especially fecal matter) or surfaces contaminated by them.HFMD occurs most frequently in children under the age of five, primarily due to their propensity for less-than-hygienic practices (nose-picking, putting shared toys in their mouths, not washing adequately after using the bathroom, etc.). By adulthood, most people have built up an immunity to HFMD, but can still pass it along.

, As indicated by its name, HFMD symptoms usually appear on/in the hands, feet, and mouth. The most common symptom is painful blisters that can appear in the throat and throughout the mouth. Often, but not as commonly as the mouth blisters, rashes in the form of red spots or blisters may appear on the palms of the hands and/or the soles of the feet. These symptoms usually come and go within the span of about five to 10 days.Beyond the pain caused by the mouth blisters, HFMD can also sometimes cause general aches, a mild to moderate fever, irritability, sleeplessness, drooling, and a decreased desire to eat and drink — although many of these symptoms are also related to the mouth pain.

, There is no cure for HFMD, nor any vaccine to prevent it. At present, treatment focuses on symptom management and “waiting it out.” Thankfully, although it can be painful and very bothersome, HFMD rarely causes serious health problems. Very rarely it can lead to conditions like viral meningitis or encephalitis, however.If you suspect HFMD, take the child to the doctor for a confirmation. The physician may recommend acetaminophen or ibuprofen for pain relief, as well as lots of fluids and a steady supply of throat-soothing foods like ice pops and ice cream (to the joy of many kids suffering through the mouth blisters!).
Hand and foot rashes should regularly be cleaned gently but thoroughly, and the doctor may recommend a special pain-relieving mouth rinse for the sores there. For the most part, though, you simply have to play a waiting game until symptoms subside.
Prevention is definitely the best treatment for HFMD, and that starts with regular handwashing and continues with other hygienic practices.

Eat the right vegetables and fruits.,
Cut out processed and refined foods.,
Avoid alcohol and tobacco products.,
Find sources of iodine.,
Increase your selenium intake.,
Take vitamin A supplements.,
Get more aerobic exercise.",How to Keep a Healthy Thyroid1," Eating fresh vegetables and fruits will help you maintain thyroid and overall health. You should also eat vegetables and fruits high in antioxidants, such bell pepper, cherries, tomatoes, blueberries, and squash. However, when you are working toward thyroid health, you need to know which kind of thyroid issue you suffer from because some vegetables can be more harmful than helpful.


For example, if you suffer from hypothyroidism, you should avoid anything in the cabbage family, such as kale, spinach, brussels sprouts, broccoli, and cabbage. These foods interfere with thyroid function.If you are taking certain medications for thyroid health, you should also avoid soy beans until you talk to your doctor.;
, Processed and refined foods are not good for thyroid health. White breads, pastas, sugar, cookies, cakes, fast foods, and prepackaged foods are all processed and bad for your thyroid health. Instead, make meals with fresh ingredients and use as little premade or processed components as possible.


Try switching out certain prepackaged things for fresh ingredients. For example, don't eat instant oatmeal in the morning. Instead, use steel-cut oatmeal and add nuts and spices to it. Avoid canned vegetables and make them fresh. These small steps will help you cut down on processed foods and help your thyroid health., Caffeine and alcohol can impact the health of your thyroid. If you have hyperthyroidism, you should ask your doctor before using caffeinated beverages like soft drinks, coffee and tea. However, you should always ask your doctor before you increase your caffeine intake, no matter what kind of thyroid condition you have., Since you need iodine to combat thyroid problems, you need to make sure you get enough of it in your diet. Iodine is eaten in dietary forms of iodine by eating foods grown in soil with the appropriate iodine content, such as mushrooms, onions, and garlic. You can also get iodine naturally by eating meat from organic grass-fed animals. Some animal feed adds in potassium iodate, which also adds iodine to the meat you eat. Table salt is also a source of iodine because it has been supplemented with it.


You may suffer from a lack of iodine, or iodine deficiency, when you don't eat enough table salt because this is the primary source of iodine you get on a daily basis. This can occur in diets comprised of foods that are not cooked at home., The amount of selenium you get through supplementation has an impact on your thyroid health. The link between selenium deficiency was only recently established in the 1990’s in relation to Graves disease, an autoimmune thyroid disease. Selenium supplementation provided a quicker return to healthy thyroid states than other methods.Incorporate more foods that contain high selenium levels, such as brazil nuts, tuna, shrimp, oysters, liver chicken, and turkey., Taking vitamin A as supplements has been found to regulate thyroid metabolism and was associated with decreased thyroid hormone levels in obese and non-obese patients studied. A dosage of 25,000 IU a day is recommended to maintain healthy thyroid function.You can also incorporate more vitamin A into your diet with foods such as sweet potatoes, carrots, and squash., Intense aerobic activity has been shown to help with higher levels of circulating thyroid hormones. Aerobic exercise is any exercise which increases your target heart rate for a period of 30 minutes. Incorporate more exercises, such as jogging, running, dancing, cycling and aerobics. You should work out for 30 minutes a day at least five times a week. Your target heart rate is calculated by subtracting your age from 220 and multiplying by 0.7.


For example, if you are 35 years old, your target heart rate is 220-35 = 185, then 185x0.7 = 129.5."

See your doctor.,
Learn about thyroid conditions.,
Recognize symptoms of hyperthyroidism.,
Learn the causes of hyperthyroidism.,
Recognize the symptoms of hypothyroidism.,
Consider the causes of hypothyroidism.,
Get a diagnosis if you think you might have hypothyroidism.,
Know the side effects of hypothyroidism.",How to Keep a Healthy Thyroid2," If you suspect that you have a thyroid problem, then the first thing you should do is see your primary care physician for a physical exam and tests. Your doctor can easily determine if you have a thyroid problem by interviewing you, performing a physical exam, and ordering some simple blood tests.

Depending on your symptoms, lab tests may include a Thyroid stimulating hormone concentration (TSH test), Total thyroxine (T4 test), Total triiodothyronine (T3 Test), an/or a Free T4 Concentration test.
Depending on the results of your bloodwork, you may also have to have imaging, such as an ultrasound or CT scan., There are two common problems that can affect the thyroid. The thyroid can be overactive and overproduce the thyroid hormone, which is called hyperthyroidism. The thyroid can also be underactive and produce insufficient amounts of the thyroid hormone, which is called hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism is second only to diabetes as the most common endocrine disorder.


Both conditions can cause a goiter, which is the enlargement of the thyroid in an effort to increase and manufacture thyroid hormone. A goiter presents as a glandular swelling that can be detected as a swelling in the neck. It is only considered a symptom, not a medical disorder in and of itself., Hyperthyroidism causes an increase in metabolic activity. Symptoms of hyperthyroidism include:


Heat intolerance
Tachycardia or rapid heart rate
Weight loss
Sweating
Goiters, The most common causes of hyperthyroidism are Grave’s disease, a toxic thyroid adenoma, a toxic multinodular goiter, lymphocytic thyroiditis, heart medications such as amiodarone, or a primary pituitary disorder.


A thyroid storm is a rare cause and at the extreme end of the spectrum of hyperthyroidism. In this condition, the patient exhibits symptoms such as increased heart rate, vomiting, fever, diarrhea, dehydration, and altered mental status., Every cell in the body requires thyroid hormones and without them, signs of decreased metabolism are present. The symptoms of hypothyroidism are:


Weight gain
Depression
Dry skin
Memory Impairment
Poor concentration
Constipation
Hair thinning or loss
Joint pains
Goiters
Cold intolerance, Hypothyroidism is most commonly caused by an autoimmune destruction of the gland or by Hashimoto’s disease, which is a condition where the immune system attacks the thyroid gland. Hypothyroidism may also be caused by primary glandular insufficiency for unknown reasons, iodine deficiency, pregnancy, congenital disorders, or issues with the pituitary gland.Hypothyroidism can also result from lithium or iodine containing drugs. Talk to your doctor about getting regular tests to monitor your thyroid if you take any of these types of drugs.

, Most often, hypothyroidism is diagnosed by simple blood tests, such as the TSH test and thyroid hormone test. Generally, once you go to the doctor with the common symptoms of hypothyroidism, your doctor will run blood tests to check your hormone levels.


You may want to ask for a test if you are at higher risk of hypothyroidism. Doctors may also suggest it themselves if you are an older woman or if you are pregnant or want to become pregnant., In hypothyroidism, the body has a number of compensatory mechanisms which keep it functioning despite decreased hormone levels. In the event of sickness, such as infection, the body can increase its metabolic rate and the levels may overwhelm the body, causing coma. A severely low thyroid can even result in a myxedema coma, which is an extreme manifestation of hypothyroidism."
"
Take synthetic hormones for hypothyroidism.,
Ask about radioactive iodine for hyperthyroidism.,
Take other medications for hyperthyroidism.,
Consider surgery for hyperthyroidism.",How to Keep a Healthy Thyroid3," Since the only concern with hypothyroidism is hormone productions, the only medication used for hypothyroidism is synthetic hormones. When the thyroid gland is not producing enough of any hormone, it must be supplemented. This can be supplemented with a synthetic thyroid hormone such as Synthroid, in doses ranging from 50 micrograms to 300 micrograms. Your doctor will use blood tests to determine your specific dose. Your doctor will start you on a lower dose. between 50 to 100 micrograms daily and recheck the blood tests four to six weeks after starting the medication, looking for changes in your hormone levels.


Your doctor will also take into account your clinical symptoms, such as weight gain, energy level, fatigue, concentration, depression, or other symptoms of decreased metabolism. If your levels are not to the point of hypothyroidism yet, your doctor may still prescribe a low dose of synthetic hormone to help level out the symptoms.In addition to synthetic hormones, your doctor may prescribe Armour Thyroid, which is actual bovine desiccated thyroid gland to help regulate yours. Starting dose is commonly 60 mg daily, and continued until blood tests indicate a response., Radioactive iodine is used to destroy any active nodules in your thyroid in order to stop their uncontrolled production of the thyroid hormone. Radioactive Iodine therapy involves injection of radionuclide tagged iodine into a vein. The iodine is taken up by the thyroid gland, which absorbs the radioactive iodine. The radiation destroys the cells that comprise these active nodules that are producing excessive thyroid hormone, which causes the gland to shrink and symptoms to disappear within three to six months.


A single dose of this medication is successful in 80% of cases. Pregnant women should not have this procedure.

, Your doctor may prescribe you anti-thyroid medications such as methimazole when radioactive iodine is not permitted, such as with pregnant women or children. These medications prevent your thyroid from producing excess levels of the thyroid hormone and start helping symptoms in six to 12 weeks. Methimazole is prescribed at 15 to 30 mg per daily.


Treatment of a thyroid storm is treated with beta-blockers, as well as hydration and sedatives. Beta blockers are also prescribed if you have increased heart rate as a result of your hyperthyroidism., Your doctor may suggest surgery with thyroidectomy as the treatment of choice if you did not respond to medication or cannot take the medication, if you are pregnant, or are a child. This procedure is also done in cases for those with large goiters that are unsightly or compressing the trachea.


This surgery consists of the removal of the gland. If you have this surgery, you will have to have lifelong treatment to replace your thyroid hormone since you no longer have a gland to produce it.Another option is a subtotal thyroidectomy. A surgeon will remove up to 90 percent of your thyroid gland under general anaesthetic. The remaining tissue may still produce enough thyroid hormone to mean replacement treatments are never required or not required for many years. You should monitor your general health for signs of change to your hormone health if you have a subtotal thyroidectomy.

Secure the cannula with an appropriate dressing.,
Inspect and clean the cannula.,
Recatheterize, if necessary.,
Clean up after the procedure.",How to Insert a Cannula," Cannulation requires some basic preparation and precaution. You will need to protect yourself from contact with a patient's body fluids and you need to protect the patient from injury or infection. In order to do this you will need:Non-sterile gloves
Tourniquet
Antiseptic solution or alcohol wipes
Local anesthetic solution (optional)
Syringe with needle of appropriate gauge
Venous access device
Transparent dressing
Paper tape
Sharps container;
, In general, the larger gauge needle you use, the higher the maximum flow rate of the fluid entering into the vein. Larger sized needles actually have a smaller number, so a 14 gauge is large, while a 22 gauge is small. Choose a size that can easily fulfill the purpose of the procedure but is not oversized.The smallest needles are used in children. The largest are used for rapid blood transfusion.

, Get informed consent from the patient before you begin the procedure. This is usually done verbally. This builds up a rapport with the patient and allows for a less traumatic experience.


Introduce yourself to your patient.
Verify your patient’s identity before starting any procedures.
Explain the procedure to the patient and answer any questions they may have.
Also take a quick history, primarily to exclude any allergy or sensitivity that the patient may have. This is particularly true for latex allergy. Should an allergy to latex be confirmed, then the tourniquet, gloves, and the cannula must be latex-free.

, All medical professionals should follow thorough and proper hygiene practices before coming into contact with a patient. It is important to keep the risk of the patient getting infection to a minimum while inserting a cannula by washing your hands thoroughly and putting on gloves. , Using gloves will not only protect your patient, but will also protect you from exposure to bodily fluids and potentially infectious material. A single pair of non-sterile gloves will probably be sufficient for this task.Depending on your facility’s requirements, you may also wish to wear protective eyewear when inserting or removing an IV catheter., In most cases, the patient’s non-dominant arm is preferable. The tourniquet should be placed on the arm just above the cannulation site. Tighten it appropriately, so that the patient's veins are highlighted.Other methods for locating a good vein include:Tapping on the vein to make it dilate.
Asking the patient to open and close their fist.
Using gravity to highlight the vein by holding the patient’s arm down.
Applying mild heat to the site of the vein.
If you have a difficult time finding a good vein on the arm you have selected, inspect the opposite arm. In some cases (e.g. if the patient has diabetes or a history of IV drug abuse), you may need to use an ultrasound to help you locate a good vein., Using an alcohol wipe or antiseptic solution, clear away pathogens on the skin around the vein used for cannulation. Apply the antiseptic to the site with friction for 30-60 seconds, and then allow the site to air dry for up to one minute. This will help prevent the risk of infection and reduce stinging.If the area is really covered in hair, you may need to shave it. This will help you to identify the vein, get a clear aim at it, and it will help when cleaning the area.

, The correct angle will depend on the size of the device and the depth of the vein.If you are trying to access a small, superficial vein, you should use a small catheter (with a gauge of 22-24) and insert at an angle of 10°-25°.
For a deeper vein, use a larger catheter and insert at an angle of 30°-45°.
Make sure you insert the needle bevel up (with its eye is facing upwards). This means that the point of the needle is down against the skin.

, Hold the cannula in the front of its wings with your pointer and middle finger and in the back with your thumb. Advance it slowly into the skin until blood enters the base of the cannula. This is called a flashback, and it signals that you have entered a vein.Once flashback occurs, reduce the angle of the needle to avoid puncturing the posterior wall of the vein.

, The needle should now be held stationary while the plastic component of the cannula is advanced another 2-3 mm into the vein.The goal is to get the plastic sheath into the vein, and keep it there, while the needle is removed.Keep advancing the plastic component of the cannula until the plastic tube is fully inserted. The ""hub"" of the plastic component will hit the skin when it is all the way in.

, Remove the tourniquet from the patient's arm. Remove the needle from the base of the cannula, leaving the plastic component in sight. Allow blood to flow into the base of the cannula, so there is less risk of air going into the vein if something is injected through the cannula, called an air embolism.Then cap the cannula or attach test tubes or other supplies.

, If you are unable to catheterize a vein successfully, never attempt to reinsert the needle. This could result in fragmentation of the catheter and embolism in the patient., If the cannula needs to stay in the vein, you will need to secure it. Using transparent dressing and tape, or a specialized dressing that comes with the cannula, secure the venous access device to the skin. Attach the cannula to the skin so that it is comfortable for the patient but stays in place in the vein. You may need to tape attachments to the skin as well, for example a tube leading to another attachment point.


Place a label over the transparent dressing with the date, time, and any other information required by your facility.
If you are simply using the cannula to get several samples of blood, for example, extensive securing is not required. However, you do need to be sure that it stays in place long enough to get your sample, so you may want to tape it down a bit.

, First, pull back on the syringe to withdraw a little blood. This will confirm that the cannula is still in place inside the vein.Then flush the cannula with a flushing solution, usually normal saline or heparin. This will assure that the site is clean and will check for adequate positioning within the vein.To flush the cannula you will need 5-10ml of saline in a syringe. This may come in a pre-filled syringe or you may need to fill it yourself. Flush the cannula by attaching the syringe of saline onto the cannula port, inject the saline into the port, detach the syringe, and then close the port.If you are returning to put an injection into a cannula, flush the it with saline solution again. This will assure that the cannula is still in place.

, If you do not observe blood in the flashback chamber when you inspect the cannula, you will need to recatheterize the vein. If there is no flashback, this may mean that the catheter has punctured the posterior wall of the vein. It can also occur in patients with severe hypotension (low blood pressure).Withdraw the device until it is just below skin level, and attempt to recatheterize.
If swelling develops at the site, remove the device and release the tourniquet. Apply direct pressure to the site for 5 minutes.

, Dispose of the needle in a sharps container to reduce the risk of a needle stick. Dispose of any other waste appropriately.Document the procedure in the appropriate set of notes.
If removing the cannula, place a piece of gauze on the injection site and keep it in place with medical tape or a bandage. This will assure that the patient is not bleeding after the procedure.

Undergo surgery.",How to Know if You Have Hyperhidrosis," Sweating is a completely normal process and an important way your body maintains a consistent temperature. However, if you find that you sweat much more often than seems appropriate, you may have hyperhidrosis.Hyperhidrosis causes sweating in the absence of physical activity or stress.
Sweating when your body is not actively trying to regulate your body temperature is the number one symptom of hyperhidrosis.;
, A common sign that a person suffers from hyperhidrosis is when excessive sweating begins to cause problems in your everyday life. Many people with hyperhidrosis struggle with the issue on a daily basis.If you find yourself needing to change your clothes throughout the day in order to hide your excessive sweating, you may suffer from hyperhidrosis.
Having to do things like stuffing napkins under your arms or excusing yourself to the bathroom to wipe off excess sweat in comfortable environments is not common and may be a sign of hyperhidrosis.

, Primary hyperhidrosis is excess sweating that exists independently from any other medical condition. If your body simply sweats to excess, you likely have primary hyperhidrosis. Secondary hyperhidrosis occurs when your body is sweating excessively as a result of, or as a symptom of, another medical condition.Primary hyperhidrosis often affects certain areas of the body that are referred to as “focal points” like armpits or hands.
Secondary hyperhidrosis is often more generalized. A common example of secondary hyperhidrosis is excessive night sweating from your entire body.

, It is important to determine if you are suffering from primary or secondary hyperhidrosis in order to effectively treat the condition. You should make an appointment with your doctor to discuss your circumstances, but there are some questions you can ask yourself to help you identify which form of hyperhidrosis you seem to be suffering. If you meet any two of the following criteria, you likely have primary hyperhidrosis. If not, your sweating issues are likely secondary in nature.Your sweating is fairly symmetrical (you sweat the same from each side of your body).
You experience at least one episode of excessive sweating per week.
Your excess sweating impairs your regular activities.
Your issues with excess sweating began before the age of 25.
Primary hyperhidrosis runs in your family.
You do not have excessive sweat issues when you are sleeping.

, If you are taking an inventory of your excessive sweating symptoms and you notice some common warning signs of a significant medical issue, seek medical attention as quickly as you can.Seek medical attention if you have a fever that reaches 104 °F (40 °C) or higher.
If you experience shortness of breath, lightheadedness, or chest pain, seek treatment immediately.

, Even if your symptoms match the criteria for primary hyperhidrosis, you doctor will likely want to conduct a blood test to check for other medical conditions or medications that could be causing your problems. Even if you do have primary hyperhidrosis, it’s possible that a medical condition or medication is exacerbating your condition.A blood test can help determine if there is another medical condition or medication in your body that is causing or worsening your hyperhidrosis.
Urine tests can also help identify toxins in your body that are known causes for hyperhidrosis.

, If you are taking a prescription medication as treatment for a different condition, you should check to see if hyperhidrosis or excessive sweating is a common side effect of the medication.An extensive list of medications that are known to cause secondary hyperhidrosis can be found here: http://www.sweathelp.org/pdf/drugs_2009.pdf

Ask your doctor if excessive sweating is a common side effect of any medication you have been taking.

, It may be possible that you have already been diagnosed with a medical condition that can cause secondary hyperhidrosis. There are a number of ailments that could cause excessive sweating. If you are being treated for any kind of medical condition, ask your doctor is hyperhidrosis is a possible symptom of your illness.There are many medical conditions that may cause someone to sweat excessively. If you are suffering from one of these ailments, your treatment options will likely be different than if you suffer only from excessive sweating.
An extensive list of medical conditions that can cause hyperhidrosis can be found here: http://www.sweathelp.org/pdf/Diseases_2009.pdf


, Your doctor will likely conduct a series of sweat tests to identify the extent of your hyperhidrosis and the parts of your body that are most effected by the condition. Primary hyperhidrosis often affects only certain parts of your body, so it’s important to identify the areas that are most in need of treatment.An iodine-starch test is conducted by applying a layer of iodine to your body, followed by a dusting of a starch powder. You are then encouraged to exercise or enter a sauna to begin sweating. Areas of excess sweating will allow the iodine to mix with the starch and create different shades of colors based on the severity of your sweating.
A thermoregulatory sweat test (TST) is conducted in a climate controlled room by changing the temperature and humidity levels and allowing your doctor to view your body’s response to environmental fluctuations., Your doctor may also ask you to keep a log of your sweating issues over a period of time so they can better appreciate the extent of your problem and determine an appropriate course of treatment. Keeping a journal can help make sure you don’t forget important elements of your experience if your next appointment isn’t for a little while. Keep track of the following things in your sweat journal:The location of your excess sweating: is it localized to certain areas, general sweating over your entire body, or different at different times?
The time you sweat excessively: do you find that your excess sweat only occurs while doing certain things or at certain times of day? Make note of whether or not you sweat more during the day than at night, for instance.
Things that trigger your excessive sweating: does stress or anxiety make your sweating worsen? Are there things you tend to be around when sweating becomes an issue? This information can help determine a treatment plan.
Any other symptoms: make sure to make note of anything else that relates to your sweat issues so the doctor can take all of your symptoms into account.

, Minor hyperhidrosis can often be treated using over the counter antiperspirant deodorants. Deodorants that say “antiperspirant” on the label are engineered to prevent your body from producing sweat and can be effective if your sweating issues are manageable.Antiperspirant deodorants contain aluminum based compounds that temporarily block sweat producing pores, reducing the amount of sweat that leaves your skin.
Most antiperspirants also help manage the smell created by bacteria in your sweat, reducing issues with body odor.

, Feet are a common focal point for people with primary hyperhidrosis, and the excess sweating on your feet can cause both odor and medical complications for your feet.Try using shoes and socks made from natural materials, as they will not seal the moisture into your foot and will allow your feet to breath.
Rotate your shoes so they have a chance to dry between times you wear them to prevent fungal infections like athlete’s foot.
Change your socks periodically throughout the day if you find that you have sweat through them.
Try wearing socks made out of merino wool or polypro that such moisture away from the feet., Excessive sweating can lead to social anxiety caused by visible sweat stains and concerns over body odor. If your hyperhidrosis is affected by your stress or anxiety levels, this can make the problem worse. Exercising good hygiene habits can help reduce your stress, thereby possibly reducing your symptoms.Bathe daily to prevent body odor from becoming an issue.
Make sure to dry yourself completely after you bathe.
Use and antibacterial soap to control control the bugs that inhabit your sweaty skin and cause odor. Make sure that you dry off completely before you put on antiperspirant.Wear light fitting clothing fitting clothing including cotton and silk. If you are exercising make sure that you bring extra clothes. Avoid wearing heavy clothes that trap sweat., If you are currently taking a medication that is known to cause hyperhidrosis in some patients as a side effect, there may be alternate medications your doctor can prescribe instead. Make an appointment with your doctor to discuss changes to your prescriptions to reduce or prevent excessive sweating.Many anti-depressant and anti-anxiety drugs have been known to cause secondary hyperhidrosis. Your doctor may be able to prescribe a different drug that works in a similar fashion but won’t create excessive sweating issues.
It’s important to discuss changes to your prescription medication with your doctor. Do not stop taking a prescribed medication without meeting with your doctor first.

, If you have identified your hyperhidrosis to be a secondary issue caused by a different medical condition, you may be able to relieve your excess sweating simply by treating the primary condition effectively.Some illnesses that cause hyperhidrosis are easily treatable. Treatment can alleviate your excess sweat as well as other symptoms caused by the primary illness.
You may need to utilize hyperhidrosis specific treatments in conjunction with other treatments in order to alleviate your symptoms.

, If antiperspirants from the store are not enough to limit the amount of sweat your body produces, your doctor may give you a prescription strength antiperspirant. This form of antiperspirant usually contains a large amount of aluminum chloride.Prescription antiperspirant is usually a more effective treatment for secondary hyperhidrosis and is applied before bed for night sweating.
The intervals between application can be gradually increased once a response is noted. Once weekly therapy is typically need for maintenance therapy.Prescription antiperspirants can cause skin irritation. If you experience irritated skin using it, wash it off your body and apply hydrocortisone cream to ease the irritation. Then make an appointment with your doctor to discuss possible alternative methods.

, There are medications designed specifically to stifle your body’s production of sweat. Using these medications can be dangerous, as sweat production is an important means of regulating your body’s temperature. If you are prescribed these medications, it’s important that you pay attention to your body temperature and avoid getting overheated.Possibly side effects of medications that block communications to your sweat glands can be blurred vision or dry mouth.
Common medications of this type, such as Hypercare and Drysol, work most effectively for primary hyperhidrosis that affect focal points like the face.
Other medications used for the systemic treatment of excessive sweating include anticholinergics. These medications are used after other measures like iontophoresis and botox injections are infective. These medication do not come without significant side effect profiles so it is important to discuss these effects with your doctor.

, This is the process of applying an electrical current to the area of hyperhidrosis, and has been shown to be effective in clinical trials. It is especially used in palmar and plantar hyperhidrosis. During this treatment you will place your hands for feet in water for 20-30 minutes, while a low electrical current is passing through the water. Data from randomized trials have shown improvement in approximately 85 percent of patient with palmar and plantar hyperhidrosis. Further it is safe and simple to perform. Caution, however, should be taken in those who are pregnant or have pacemakers., Botulinum toxin type A (Botox) is commonly thought of as a means to smooth out skin wrinkles, but it can also be used to block the nerves that trigger sweating. Like medications that block these nerves, botox injections can prevent your sweat glands from receiving the message to begin producing sweat.Botox injections are commonly used for focal points like the armpit, and as such tend to be used for primary hyperhidrosis.
Side effects include soreness at the injection site or flu-like symptoms that include being tired and feeling weak.

, In some serious cases of either primary or secondary hyperhidrosis, your doctor may feel that surgery is necessary to stifle your body’s sweat production. These procedures sever the link between sweat nerves and your sweat glands so your sweat glands do not receive the message to produce sweat from your brain.Sympathectomy is a minimally invasive surgery in which doctors literally cut the connection between the nerves that signal to your sweat glands to sweat excessively. This is permanent procedure and used primarily for excessive sweating of the palms or face.
Excessive under-arm sweating is treated surgically by actually removing the sweat glands under your arms.
Discuss any surgical options with your doctor to see if they are right for you.

Ask your doctor about over-the-counter pain medications.",How to Increase Platelets," The first step to understanding and treating any medical disorder (thrombocytopenia included) is to visit the doctor's office. In addition to accurately diagnosing your disease, medical professionals can also help you decide on a treatment plan that suits your needs. If your doctor believes you have low platelet levels, s/he will most likely recommend you for blood tests and a physical exam to determine your platelet level.


Even if you're sure that you have a low platelet count, it's highly advised that you seek the professional opinion of a doctor before proceeding with a treatment plan. Some of thrombocytopenia's symptoms aren't unique to the disorder. In addition, sometimes low platelet levels do not give any external symptoms.;
, A normal platelet range is 150,000 to 450,000 platelets per microliter of blood. Platelet levels below this range do not necessarily lead to noticeable symptoms.However, even patients without symptoms can respond to treatment, showing increased platelet production. In many cases, though, thrombocytopenia can be accompanied by a wide variety of symptoms. Because platelets are involved in blood clot formation, many of the symptoms of a low platelet count are caused by the body's inability to to control bleeding. Common symptoms of thrombocytopenia are:Prolonged bleeding from minor cuts and scrapes or after surgery, etc.
Nosebleeds
Bleeding mouth or gums (especially after brushing teeth)
Extremely heavy menstrual bleeding
Blood in urine or stool
Unexplained bruises or small, red spots on the skin called petechiae.

, Thrombocytopenia does not have one single cause. It can have a variety of natural and artificial origins. It can even be the result of a more serious disease. Because of this, it's especially important to investigate cases of thrombocytopenia with your doctor to determine the cause. Here are some of the most common causes of thrombocytopenia:Inherited (genetic) disorders
Bone marrow disease (leukemia, etc.) or disfunction
Enlarged/poorly functioning spleen
Side-effect of a medication or treatment you are currently taking (radiation, etc.)
Autoimmune disease (lupus, arthritis, AIDS, ITP, etc.)
Bacterial infection in the blood
Pregnancy and childbirth (though in these cases thrombocytopenia is usually mild)
TTP (thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura), a rare condition where the body's platelets are used up when many small clots form throughout the body

, Because thrombocytopenia has numerous possible causes, the treatment plan your doctor assigns you will vary based on the root cause of your low platelet count. Sometimes, treatment plans are relatively simple - if your doctor determines your thrombocytopenia is a side-effect of a medicine you're taking, you may only need to discontinue or change your medication.


Note that in the cases of some powerful anti-coagulants like heparin, platelet count may not increase when you stop taking the medication.You may need to take additional medications to recover.

, Doctors may prescribe certain medicines that boost platelet production to combat thrombocytopenia. These medicines, including eltrombopag and romiplostim, come in a variety of forms - they may be given as pills or injections.They may also be given in conjunction with one of the many other treatment options for thrombocytopenia, depending on its specific cause.

, Steroids can reduce the function of the body's immune system. Because of this, they are useful for treating thrombocytopenia is caused by an autoimmune disorder - a disorder wherein the body's immune system mistakenly attacks the body itself rather than foreign pathogens. Since steroids weaken the immune system, they can ease the effects of an autoimmune-related case of thrombocytopenia. However, a weakened immune system is at a greater risk of infection, so additional treatments may be necessary to offset this new risk.


Note that the steroids that doctors would prescribe in this case (such as prednisone) are different from the ones used illegally by athletes to boost physical performance.
In more extreme cases of autoimmune thrombocytopenia, a doctor may prescribe intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) or antibodies to further slow the body's immune response., In rarer blood disorders associated with thrombocytopenia (like TTP and Hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS)), doctors may recommend a procedure involving the treatment of a patient's blood plasma. Plasma is the portion of the blood that contains, among other things, autoantibodies, the malfunctioning components of the immune system that result in autoimmune diseases. Because of this, treating or replacing a patient's plasma can be effective in treating both blood disorders and autoimmune diseases. Plasma exchange and plasmapheresis are related but distinct procedures used to treat a patient's blood plasma.


In plasma exchange, the patient's blood is separated into blood cells and plasma. The plasma is discarded and replaced with plasma from a donor, a saline solution, or albumin. This is done gradually so as not to remove too much of the patient's blood at any one time.
In plasmapheresis, after being separated from the blood cells, the patient's plasma is treated, then returned to the patient., Thrombocytopenia cases that are especially resistant may require a surgery called a splenectomy where a doctor removes the spleen from the body. Though the function of the spleen isn't 100% understood, scientists do know that it functions as a filter for the blood, removing old red blood cells and platelets from the blood stream. In some cases, the spleen becomes enlarged and removes more platelets from the bloodstream than normal, leading to thrombocytopenia. A splenectomy surgery can remedy this; however, doctors will generally try more conservative treatment options first, as there is no way to undo a splenectomy.


On average, splenectomies are successful about 66 percent of the time.However, over time, it is possible for thrombocytopenia to return.
People under the age of 40 who undergo a splenectomy have a better chance of increasing their platelet count.Following a splenectomy, platelet counts often become abnormally high, leading to a condition called thrombocytosis.In severe and/or prolonged cases, this can cause its own set of problems.

, If you have fewer than 50,000 platelets per microliter of blood and are suffering from active bleeding or hemorrhaging, a doctor may recommend a platelet or blood transfusion to reduce bleeding. Alternatively, if you have fewer than 50,000 platelets per microliter of blood and are not actively bleeding but must undergo surgery, your doctor may also prescribe a transfusion. In either case, the doctor inserts an IV into a blood vessel and healthy blood or platelets are fed directly into the bloodstream.


Doctors may prescribe a transfusion even when you are not currently bleeding and not scheduled for surgery. However, this is usually reserved for patients with fewer than 10,000 platelets per microliter of blood., Not every case of thrombocytopenia warrants treatment. For instance, if your platelet count is low because you're pregnant, you may simply choose to wait until after the baby is delivered to see if your platelet count increases. Mild cases of thrombocytopenia may not even result in noticeable symptoms - you may not even suffer from increased bleeding. In cases like these, when the condition is likely to improve in the near future or when your life is not impacted in any way, your doctor may recommend a very conservative (or non-existent) treatment plan.

, Vitamin B12 and folic acid are two nutrients necessary for the healthy production of a variety of blood elements, including platelets.Because the body can't store very much of these nutrients, it's important to ensure you consume these nutrients frequently. To boost your body's supply of B12 and folic acid, take dietary supplements that contain these nutrients or eat foods high in these vitamins.


Foods such a spinach, citrus fruits, kiwis, and dried beans are high in folate, while eggs, milk, cheese, liver, and mutton are high in vitamin B12.

, Alcohol interferes with normal platelet production and function. The immediate effect of alcohol consumption (in normal users) is to decrease platelet response within 10 to 20 minutes of ingestion.However, in severe alcoholics, platelet function is actually markedly increased, which can lead to separate health issues.In either case, reduction of alcohol use can help return platelet function to normal.

, If you suffer from clinically low platelet levels, you will want to avoid bleeding, which can be difficult to stop and can result in potentially dangerous complications. This may mean that you should avoid contact sports, woodworking, construction work, or other physical activities where the chance of injury is relatively high.

, Some common, commercially available medicines, especially ones containing aspirinor ibuprofen, can inhibit platelet production and function. For instance, aspirin reduces the ability of platelets to bind to each other by blocking the function of certain crucial protein structures on the platelets, inhibiting blood clot formation.In these cases, your doctor may recommend you cease taking these medicines or may recommend a suitable alternative.

Dopamine is a chemical in the brain that is closely associated with libido., Massages can be a great bonding experience and can prime your significant other for an erotic experience. Establish a sensuous atmosphere to improve the experience. Try turning off the lights and lighting some candles. Play some music. Keep some oils near you for lubrication during the massage.
Cut your fingernails before the massage to avoid scratching up your partner., A study has shown that scents from perfumes and candles can help increase sex drive. Because a variety of factors were involved, it is difficult to say definitively which were most effective. However preliminary results suggest some scents that might be more effective than others.


The study suggested that effective smell profiles included pumpkin pie, licorice, donuts, lavender, oriental spice, cola, and various mixtures of these scents."

If that sounds like too much for you, there is always the date night classic: watching a horror movie together., Working out activates testosterone production and low testosterone is one of the more important causes of a low sex drive. It can also help to treat some of the major physical causes for low sex drive.


For optimal testosterone benefit from weightlifting, work major muscle groups with compound exercises, like bench presses, squats, or barbell curls. After an hour your body will begin producing cortisol which counteracts testosterone. Therefore, you should keep your routines under 60 minutes.
Cardio will not only increase testosterone but also help with some of the conditions which make it physiologically difficult to get an erection, including high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and obesity.Yoga is sometimes believed to be particularly effective at increasing sex drive. Proponents argue that it has all the benefits of the other routines, but also increases blood flow to the pelvic area and treats anxiety.

, Oysters, chocolate, figs, chili peppers, tomatoes, broccoli, pomegranate juice, avocado and eggs have all been rumored to help put you in the mood.

Ask a doctor about testosterone.",How to Increase Sex Drive in Men4," This can be the hardest step. Professionals indicate that men are typically afraid to talk to doctors about their health problems. They shouldn't be; low libido is, according to Doron Stember, MD, ""a medical condition.""While low libido or erectile dysfunction (ED) might seem like a personal issue, they are medical conditions. Both can be symptoms of serious underlying health issues and failing to disclose them could hinder the diagnosis of any illnesses you might suffer from.
Remember that your condition is neither rare nor embarrassing. Twenty percent of all men have almost no interest in sex and half of all men over 40 experience some form of erectile dysfunction.When talking to your doctor indicate whether you still have desire but cannot get an erection of if you do not have any desire.

Being aware of your risk can help you recognize and treat it effectively.Middle-aged people are most likely to suffer from Achilles tendinitis.Physical factors such as flat arches, obesity, and tight calf muscles can put more strain on your Achilles tendon and cause tendinitis.Running in worn out shoes can also increase your risk.Environmental factors such as cold weather or running on hilly terrain can increase your risk.Medical conditions including diabetes and high-blood pressure make your risk of developing Achilles tendinitis higher.Taking medications such as the antibiotic fluoroquinolone may increase your risk.;
, Achilles tendinitis has many different symptoms that can range from mild to severe. Identifying potential symptoms that you have can help you get effective treatment as soon as possible.You may experience pain and stiffness along your Achilles tendon in the morning.You may experience pain along the Achilles tendon or back of your heel that becomes more severe with activity.You may experience severe pain along your tendon or heel the day following exercise or strenuous activity.You may experience persistent swelling that increases throughout the day and with activity.You may notice that your Achilles tendon thickens.You may notice a bone spur, which is a bony projection that comes off of your heel., Swelling and other irregular growths can indicate Achilles tendinitis. Gently feeling your heel area with your hand can help identify any irregularities.Gently touch along your Achilles tendon and heel to feel for any swelling or thickening of the tendon.Use your fingers to feel for any bony spurs at the lower part of the tendon, which is located at the back of your heel.If you notice any of these symptoms, you may want to consult your doctor., Pay attention to your body for any pain that is present along your Achilles tendon or in the heel area or if you are experiencing problems moving this region. These symptoms can indicate Achilles tendinitis and should be treated to prevent further pain.You can have pain that is mild to severe. Some points may be more tender than others depending on the exact location of the tendinitis.You may have a limited range of motion in your ankle area, including a decreased ability to flex your foot., If you discover any of the signs or symptoms of Achilles tendinitis or are experiencing severe pain in your ankle, tendon, or heel area, see your doctor. Achilles tendinitis is very common and very treatable, and getting a medical diagnosis early can help you get proper treatment.You can see your regular doctor or visit an orthopedist or podiatrist, both of whom have specializations in treating disorders such as Achilles tendinitis.Your doctor will conduct a physical exam to check for signs of Achilles tendinitis and will also likely ask for a health history, including factors such as what type of activities you do., Your doctor will check for signs or signs of Achilles tendinitis once you’ve described your symptoms. Your doctor may be able to diagnose Achilles tendinitis with a simple examination instead of ordering more in-depth tests.Your doctor may check for swelling along the tendon or at the back of your heel.She may check for thickening or increase in the size of your Achilles tendon.Your doctor may look or feel for bony spurs towards the base of your tendon.Your doctor may feel along your tendon and ask you what the point of maximum tenderness is.Your doctor may also test the range of motion in your ankle. In particular, she’ll see if you have a decreased ability to flex your foot., If your doctor suspects that you have Achilles tendinitis, he may order tests after conducting your physical exam. These tests can help confirm a diagnosis and help your doctor formulate a treatment plan., Your doctor may not be able to diagnose Achilles tendinitis through a simple examination with her hands. She may order an x-ray or MRI to ensure your symptoms are a result of Achilles tendinitis.X-rays and MRIs make images of the inside of your leg and heel and can make it easier for your doctor to identify not only if you have Achilles tendinitis, but also exactly where the problem area(s) of the condition are on your leg. This can help her better formulate a treatment plan.Your doctor may order an x-ray, which will require you to sit still while a technician makes images of your leg and heel. This can help better see the bones of your foot and leg and may show bone spurs, or the thickening or calcification of your tendon.Your doctor may order an MRI, which will require you to lie inside of a large scanner for a few minutes. An MRI can show how severe the damage is to your tendon and help assess the type of treatment needed.Be aware that an MRI is not necessary to diagnose Achilles tendinitis and may only be used for severe cases., Your doctor may prescribe a course of treatment for a diagnosed case of Achilles tendinitis based on the severity of your case. There are different options that range from pain relievers and immobility to surgery, though most cases of Achilles tendinitis don’t require surgical treatments.Be aware that even with early treatment for pain, it may last for more than three months. If you waited for several months before seeing a doctor, it may take six months for you to notice that treatment methods are working., Your doctor may prescribe resting your body or switching activities. Immobility and doing lower-impact activities can help heal your tendinitis.If you do high-impact activities such as running, your doctor may suggest switching to lower-impact options. You can try biking, walking, or swimming to stay active while giving your Achilles tendon a rest.Your doctor may also suggest that you rest the area completely for a while., Use an ice pack on the painful area of your tendon. This can help reduce swelling and relieve pain.Always wrap an ice pack in a towel or cloth — do not apply it directly to your skin.
You can use an ice pack as often as necessary for 20 minutes at a time.If it is too cold or your skin gets numb, remove the pack., Consume pain relievers as necessary or as instructed by your doctor. These medications may help alleviate pain and possible swelling.Take over-the-counter pain relievers such as ibuprofen, naproxen sodium or acetaminophen.Ibuprofen and naproxen sodium may also help alleviate some of the swelling., If your Achilles tendinitis is severe, your doctor may prescribe additional, more involved treatments such as injections, surgery, or physical therapy. These can provide some pain relief and heal the condition.Physical therapy, which may include strengthening and stretching exercises, may help heal your Achilles tendinitis.If your tendinitis is especially severe, your doctor may consider cortisone injections. Be aware this isn’t a common treatment and could rupture your Achilles tendon.Certain supportive shoes and orthotic devices such as heel lifts or a walking boot may help relieve pain and heal the condition.If your Achilles tendinitis doesn’t heal after six months of nonsurgical treatment, your doctor and you should consider surgery such as gastrocnemius recession or debridement and repair to fully treat the condition."

Look out for sudden, intense chest pain.Sudden intense chest pain can occur in a number of serious medical conditions, including heart attacks, certain acute lung problems, and also in aortic dissection.,
Watch for chest pain that radiates to your back.One of the ""red flag"" (key) symptoms that leads doctors to suspect an aortic dissection is if your chest pain radiates through to your back.,
Take note if the pain spreads to other areas.While the pain of an aortic dissection often initially radiates from your chest into your back, after a while it may begin to spread elsewhere in your body (as the aortic dissection becomes worse).,
Notice if you feel faint, lightheaded, or dizzy.Because an aortic dissection can lead to decreased blood circulating through your body (as the flow of blood is impeded to the rest of the body by the dissection), it can lead to feeling faint, lightheaded, and/or dizzy.,
Evaluate your pulse.Because of the deceased circulation that occurs in an aortic dissection, you may also notice that your pulse becomes more rapid and weaker, typically first on the left arm.,
Observe for shortness of breath.This occurs particularly when lying down.,
Watch for pale, sweaty skin.Pale skin, heavy sweating, and a feeling of anxiety and doom are common in aortic dissection.,
Go to the Emergency Room immediately.As previously mentioned, an aortic dissection is a life-threatening condition that needs immediate medical attention and treatment.,
Have your blood pressure measured in both arms.One of the key signs of a possible aortic dissection is having a significant difference in blood pressure between one of your arms and the other.,
Receive blood tests.Another thing that will happen when you arrive in the Emergency Room is that you will be given blood tests.,
Get an electrocardiogram and/or ongoing cardiac monitoring.,
Opt for medical imaging.The only definitive way to diagnose an aortic dissection is via an imaging test such as a CT scan or MRA (magnetic resonance angiogram).,
Ask your doctor for medications to control your symptoms.If you are indeed diagnosed with an aortic dissection, you will be given medications (such as narcotics like Morphine) for pain control.,
Have surgery if needed.If you are experiencing an aortic dissection, you may need emergency surgery to save your life.",How to Identify Aortic Dissection Symptoms," If you are experiencing severe chest pain, go to your local Emergency Room immediately.


It may be a sign of an aortic dissection, which is a life-threatening condition that needs immediate emergency medical attention.
Even if it is not an aortic dissection, severe chest pain may be another medical emergency (such as a heart attack or a blood clot in your lung, among other things) so it is key to receive professional medical attention immediately.
Ask a friend or family member to drive you straight to the Emergency Room, or call 911 to have an ambulance bring you there.;
, It is most often felt as an intense ""ripping"" sensation, and frequently correlates to aortic dissection.


However, imaging tests will need to be done to confirm the diagnosis of aortic dissection.
Aortic dissection cannot be diagnosed on pain symptoms alone.

, It may radiate to your shoulder(s), your neck, your jaw, and down your arms and legs as the condition progresses.


It is important to tell your doctor and the triage nurse, when you get to the Emergency Room, how the pain began and how it has progressed since its onset.
Characterizing the pain in as much detail as possible is very helpful to your doctor in diagnosing aortic dissection.

, This is because your decreased flow through the aorta means that you may be getting less blood flow to your brain, which is responsible for the onset of these symptoms.

, You can evaluate your pulse by placing two fingers on your wrist, between your thumb and first finger.


A normal heart rate is between 60 to 100 beats per minute. If your pulse exceeds 100 beats per minute, it is elevated and may be one of the symptoms of an aortic dissection.
For more information on how to check your pulse, click here.


, If you are experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, go to the Emergency Room immediately as it may be a symptom of aortic dissection or many other serious medical problems.

, This is because your body can sense that you are losing blood through the tear in your aorta, and the decreased blood flow triggers your sympathetic nervous system (your ""fight or flight"" response) to kick in. You may also become nauseous, and/or vomit.

, A delay in going into the Emergency Room (if you are having symptoms suspicious of an aortic dissection), could quite literally cost you your life. Call 911 for an ambulance to transport you there if needed.

, When you arrive in the Emergency Department, one of the first things your doctor will measure is your blood pressure (in both arms), in order to assess your risk for having an aortic dissection.

, The purpose is to rule out other conditions such as a heart attack (which can be detected by measuring troponin levels in your blood), or a pulmonary embolism (which can be assessed for by measuring D-dimer levels in your blood). In some cases the aortic dissection can weaken the arterial wall, leading to rupture of the artery and blood loss that will manifest as an acute blood loss anemia.


There are no definitive blood tests that ""rule in"" an aortic dissection.
However, if other conditions (such as a heart attack or a pulmonary embolism) are ruled out, it means that the likelihood that you are having an aortic dissection becomes comparatively higher.

, When you arrive in the Emergency Room, the doctors will also hook you up immediately to cardiac monitoring. They will set you up to receive an ECG - an electrocardiogram, which is sensitive enough to look for ischemia to the heart.


Ongoing cardiac monitoring is basically a way to continually keep tabs on your vital signs (such as your heart rate) as well as providing continual ECG tracings of your heart rhythm.
Cardiac monitoring and/or an ECG can provide information as to the stress on your heart and cardiovascular system, and can further help to rule out other conditions such as a heart attack or pulmonary embolism.

, A TEE (transesophageal echocardiogram - which is basically an ultrasound probe that is inserted into your esophagus to provide the clearest view of the heart and surrounding structures) may also be used to aid in diagnosis.


In some cases, an angiography may be performed.For this procedure, a dye is injected into your heart's blood vessels and X-rays are taken to reveal details about your blood vessels., You will likely also be given medications to control your blood pressure, as this helps to keep the damage from the aortic dissection minimized as much as possible.

, It depends upon the type and extent of your dissection. Some types can be controlled with medications alone; however, some require immediate surgical intervention to prevent a life-threatening bleed.


The doctors in the Emergency Room will be able to tell you which category you fall into.
If surgery is needed, you may be sent straight to an OR (operating room) without needing to wait due to the urgent nature of the procedure.

"
Take care of yourself, albeit secretly.,
Be very hygenic to avoid getting your family members sick.,
Avoid people as much as possible.,
Avoid coughing, sneezing, or sniffling in front of family members.,
Avoid touching people, or rather letting them touch you if you have a fever.,
Don't talk very much and take efforts to save your voice.,
Be cautious when you should be, depending on your symptoms.",How to Hide Being Sick1," Get as much rest as you can, drink a lot of fluids, and don't work too hard or eat something that would make you feel sick. Taking care of yourself is the best way to both get better fast and not appear as sick to other people, but make sure family members don't see you doing things you don't normally do in order to make yourself better.


When getting extra rest, don't make it obvious. Don't announce to everyone that you are going to bed early, and don't mention taking naps if you don't normally.
If eating makes you feel sick, don't eat much but don't specifically say you aren't hungry or anything about not eating. Instead of pre-making excuses, assume no one will notice or ask.
Don't force yourself to be more active than you should be in order to not raise suspicion. Make non-sickness-related excuses in order to get out of participating in family activities, going out with the family, etc. You may be tempted to fight through it, but this will make you sicker and will probably result in people discovering you're sick.;
, This is purely kindness; if your family members don't know you're sick, they are not going to take any extra precautions and as a result you need to. For example, just because a family member says they don't care about sharing a cup, don't let them drink off yours to avoid raising suspicion or because it doesn't really affect you. That is rude, and your family member will be upset if they get sick later and find out you were sick.


Wash your hands excessively. Before touching anything anyone else in the house might touch, wash your hands. Wash them before eating, etc. If you think your family will notice, wash them in a bathroom sink or somewhere they won't hear.
Don't do chores or work that may cause your family members to be exposed to your germs. If it's your responsibility to cook a meal or set the table, etc., find a non-sickness-related excuse in order to not do it. Your family may be annoyed, but know you're doing it for them. If you truly can't get out of something, wash your hands excessively and if you are blamed for making other people sick later, remind them you tried not to.

, This does sound sad, but the truth is that the more time you spend with people or in the open areas of your house, the more time others will have to notice you are ill. Until you're feeling better, it's usually a good idea to spend all the time you can in your room alone. This is also good for your health, as hours of quiet reading are more restful than playing games in a hectic living room.


If your family notices you're not spending much time with them, the best option is to deny it or say you weren't aware. If this doesn't work, come up with a non-sickness-related excuse. This isn't too difficult, as something as simple as a lot of homework explains alone time easily.

, These are usually the most obvious signs of being sick, so avoid doing them in front of people. This may seem impossible, but there are some tricks that may help you:


If you need to sniffle in order to avoid awkward incidents with running noses, space it out as far as you can. When you don't wait anymore, a great trick is to say you are thirsty, go into the kitchen, turn on the faucet, sniffle, and then turn off the faucet. The sound of the faucet hides the sound of you sniffling and you can easily explain using the faucet, even frequently–just say it's one of those days where you're really thirsty.
Suppress sneezes as much as you can. This is not too hard, although you may make a funny face while doing it. Just look away from people when you're about to sneeze and fight it. If you don't want to or can't suppress it, just sneeze. Perfectly healthy people sneeze, the key to hiding sneezes is to hide at least some so people don't think you are sneezing more than makes sense.
While hiding coughing is the hardest, it can be done. Suppress your cough if it's possible, provided it is and is not extremely uncomfortable. If you have a bad cough, it is definitely a good idea to hide from people as much as you can, because this is the hardest symptom to hide. One trick to concealing a cough that isn't too bad is to keep water or another beverage near you (though this doesn't work well with the anti-sniffling technique) and take a sip whenever you feel the urge to cough. This will help you suppress your cough, and if you cough anyway, you can say you choked on the beverage.

, Don't be over-the-top about this; most people will not feel the temperature of your skin from a quick high-five or hug but will notice you jumping away from them. However, avoid letting people touch your direct skin, particularly that of your face. Even someone holding your hand could notice a higher body temperature.


Regulate your resistance to touch as compared to your fever. If it's only a degree or two high, people are not going to feel the difference very well. However, if you have a temperature of 103 °F (39 °C), you will feel very hot and shouldn't let people touch or even almost touch your skin (you should also see a doctor if the temperature is over about 103 °F (39 °C)).
Be aware of chills/hot flashes. As fevers can cause you to have chills or hot flashes, you might want to wear something your family will find odd, like a coat when it's hot outside. Be aware of this and try to fight your chills/hot flashes so you can make your fever less obvious; you may not think so, but family members do notice extra coats and parents will regularly associate them immediately with illness. Obviously, wear what you want to when you're alone.

, For example, in the case of Laryngitis, Laryngitis is something you can't really hide, but it is something you can prevent. When you realize you're sick, stop talking as much, especially if you have a cough. You may not think you'll get laryngitis, but it's always a good idea to be safe. If you get laryngitis anyway, here are some tricks to make it less obvious:


Temporarily cure laryngitis by eating soup. Chicken soup works best, but if you're a vegetarian, other kinds of soup will work. While eating a lot of soup may look weird, it can be a good idea to regularly eat it while you have laryngitis in order to keep your voice working.
Take note of how coughing relates to your laryngitis. Sometimes coughing once will take your voice away, but coughing again will bring it back sounding normal. You often will just know if your voice is going to work or not depending on how your throat feels, so try clearing your throat or coughing if you don't think it's going to work. Don't speak if you just coughed and think your voice is going to sound odd.
Don't voluntarily start conversations, and especially do not start fights. Your voice may be working in the short term, but if you've had problems with it, it may start glitching as you talk more. Yelling is a quick way to absolutely kill it, so don't talk about anything that might anger someone and warrant an argument. You will hate losing and thus might strain your voice trying to make yourself understood or heard.

, For example, if you think you might throw up, be ready to go to the bathroom or have a bowl with you (secretly). Doing something like vomiting on the floor will instantly give you away and be awkward.


If you are a girl, you can makeup to hide the ""sick look"" you may have, like extra pale skin or dark circles. Family members, particularly parents, will notice and comment on this. If they do, explain it away with tiredness and pretend you are annoyed or offended they commented on your appearance.

Keep to yourself as much as you can.,
Minimize/hide your symptoms.,
Be realistic about who you don't want to know you're sick.,
Be realistic about attending work/school.",How to Hide Being Sick2," This step works a lot like at home, except it is not as firm. Don't make yourself sit alone or ignore your friends, just don't go out of your way to initiate conversations, like with new people. If you can choose to work alone or in a group, choose to be alone when you can. This seems more depressing in writing; when you're feeling tired and lousy in a busy place, you will want to minimize the amount of times you have to communicate and pay attention to conversations.

, You can utilize some of the home techniques for hiding your symptoms, and/or use other techniques. Using over-the-counter medications for relief is often a good idea when you're trying to be out functioning in the world while sick.


Specifically minimize or hide the symptoms that will be obvious. Friends and strangers are not family members, and are not living with you. You will usually be okay being less active or wearing something too warm/cool, etc. However, you will want to hide symptoms like coughing, sniffling, and laryngitis. These are easily noticeable and can be annoying.
If it's impossible to hide a symptom–like a cough–in your work or school environment, focus on making it less bothersome or obvious. Generally, doing your best to hide the symptom will make it less of a problem, even if you can't completely hide it. As long as you make it visible to the people around you that you are working hard to control the symptom(s), they probably won't be bothered too much. Just don't assume that because you can't hide a symptom, there's no reason to make it somewhat better.

, It's probably more important to you that family member and friends are in the dark, because they are the ones that will tell you to take it easy or treat you differently. Strangers or people you barely know will not care very much about your sickness, so you don't really need to exhaust yourself hiding it from them; let them know you're sick if it's obvious anyway, and then just take care of yourself and make your symptoms less unbearable to everyone.


Even friends wll not treat you the same way that family members will when they find out you're sick. You may want to hide it from them, or you may not care if anyone at work/school knows about your sickness and only maintain that family members don't.
Sickness is not as easy to hide out in the world as it is at home, so sometimes everyone knows you're not well anyway. Pretending you are well will not change that and will just seem silly. Keep this in mind when deciding who to hide your sickness from.

, This tip may seem counter-intuitive if you are reading this article to find out how to hide your sickness so that you can still go to work or school, but it is necessary. People stay home when they're sick for a reason; you may be able to brave the world when sick, but you also may not. If you are hiding your sickness for other reasons, decide if your reasons are worth being miserable all day while out of the house. Some key indicators that you probably should stay home are:


Fever, particularly over 103 °F (39 °C).
Throwing up, particularly within the last 24 hours.
A terrible and frequent cough that would disrupt everyone and would prevent you from doing what you do normally.
Having a job that requires physical labor, or having PE at school that involves heavier exercise.

Get to the emergency room.,
Undergo treatment.,
Begin healing in the hospital.,
Take any medications prescribed to you.,
Rest, but make sure you stay active.,
Sleep in a recliner for the first few days.,
Be careful with your clothing and padding options.,
Do not smoke.,
Avoid sudden changes in air pressure.,
Do not drive until you have healed completely.,
Watch for recurrences.",How to Heal from a Collapsed Lung," Go to the doctor or emergency room immediately if you experience sudden chest pain, or any other symptoms of a collapsed lung like difficulty breathing, nasal flaring, chest tightness, and easy fatigue.


If there was any blunt trauma to your chest, a doctor should be seen if shortness of breath and chest pain occurs, or if you cough up any blood.A collapsed lung can be caused by a variety of factors. Most often, it is the result of trauma to the chest or ribcage. It can also be caused by air pressure changes and certain pre-existing medical conditions like asthma, cystic fibrosis, and tuberculosis.Call 911 for immediate medical services if there is any significant chest pain or shortness of breath.
A collapsed lung can deteriorate rapidly, so the sooner you seek medical care the better.You will undergo tests when you get to the ER, a doctor will perform a variety of tests to diagnose a collapsed lung. The doctor will examine your chest, listening with an stethoscope. He or she will also check your blood pressure, which will likely be low as a result of a collapsed lung, and look for symptoms like blueness of the skin.A definitive diagnosis is usually made with an x-ray.;
, Your doctor will decide what treatment is best for you based on the type and severity of a collapsed lung.


Your doctor might recommend observation and bed rest as treatment if the collapsed lung is mild and can heal on its own. This usually takes about one to two weeks of observation, rest, and doctor's appointments.If the lung collapse is severe, a needle and chest tube will be needed to remove the air. A needle, attached to a syringe, is inserted in the chest cavity. The excess air is pulled out by a doctor, much like a syringe is used to draw blood.Then, a tube will be placed into the chest cavity to keep the lung re-inflated for a few days.
If a chest tube and needle treatment fails to work, your doctor might recommend surgery as a treatment option. In most cases, surgery is relatively non-invasive and can be performed via small incisions. A tiny fiber-optic camera will be passed through these incisions, allowing the doctors to see what they're doing as they insert narrow, long-handled surgical tools into the body. The surgeon will look for openings in the lungs that caused the leak and seal them closed. In some cases, a portion of diseased lung tissue will need to be removed.
Treatment time varies and depends on the severity of a collapsed lung, but be prepared for an extended hospital stay. Chest tubes sometimes need to stay in place for a few days before removal. In the case of surgery, most people will need to stay in the hospital for five to seven days after surgery., While you're in hospital care, the healing process will begin while you wait to go home. The nurses and doctors will help you with your care.


In the hospital, you will be asked to do a lot of breathing exercises, as well as sitting up and walking to build strength in your lung.If you went through surgery, you will also receive shots to prevent blood clots and may have to wear special stockings on your feet and legs to prevent clotting.Your doctor will explain to you what to do in terms of at-home care, medications, and returning to work. Listen closely and, if you have any questions, ask. You want to make sure you understand what's best for you and your body to heal fully.

, Depending on the severity of your symptoms, your medical history, and any allergies you might have, your doctor may prescribe pain medications to be taken during the first few weeks after your treatment.


Try to stay ahead of pain. Take meds when you begin to feel pain as it's easier to stop severe pain before it starts than deal with after it has begun.The first 48 to 72 hours will be the worst in terms of pain. Pain and discomfort will diminish but full recovery can take several weeks even after severe symptoms pass. Have patience and use meds as needed., Bed rest is not necessary with a collapsed lung. You should rest while sitting up, and do very light, low-impact activities, such as walking.It will be one to two weeks before you fully recover from a collapsed lung, so make sure you plan to be laid up for this timeframe.
Do not push yourself to resume regular activities too quickly, as this can trigger another collapse. Make sure your breathing is normal and pain has passed before you engage in household chores, high-impact exercise, and other physically strenuous activities., Breathing will be difficult in the aftermath of a collapsed lung, and how you sleep can help make breathing easier.


Sleeping in a recliner, moved to a somewhat upright position, results in less downward pressure on your chest cavity and lungs.
Recliner sleep also makes getting up and lying down more comfortable. Movement can be painful after a collapsed lung, and this is easier on your body.A pillow on the affected side can make the chair more comfortable while sleeping.

, It's important to avoid putting undue pressure on your ribcage after a collapsed lung. People are often tempted to put padding on the area to ease pain, but this must be done correctly to avoid causing harm.


To lessen symptoms, you can try holding a pillow against the chest wall. This eases the pain of each breath.Do not tape your ribs or chest. This can impair respiration and worsen the situation.Wear loose-fitting clothing for the first few days. If you wear a bra, wear a sports bra or a bra larger than your regular size., If you are a smoker, inhaling smoke of any kind during the recovery period can cause stress on your lungs, which you want to avoid during the healing process.


Cease smoking completely until symptoms pass. Talk to your doctor about options such as the nicotine patch or pills to help you cope without cigarettes.
As smoking can increase the risk of another lung collapse, it would be best to consider quitting altogether. You can talk to your doctor about quitting and find support groups in your area., Air pressure changes cause stress on the lungs and make re-collapsed more likely, and therefore should be avoided during recovery.


Avoid flying. If you must travel, go by car, train, or bus. If this is not possible, it might be best to postpone a trip for a later date, when you have the okay from your doctor.
Avoid high altitude areas. Tall buildings, mountains, and hiking should be avoided until recovery is complete.
Refrain from swimming underwater, and scuba diving especially, during your recovery., Reaction time is often slowed after a collapsed lung due to pain and any medications, as well as the effect surgery and other treatments have on the body. Make sure your pain is gone and reaction times are normal before getting behind the wheel. If you are unsure when it is safe to drive again, consult your doctor., There is, in general, no long-term effect on your health once the collapsed lung has healed. However, having a collapsed lung once increases the likelihood of it happening again.


Up to 50% of people have a collapsed lung again, usually occurring within a few months of the first one. Be aware of any symptoms you're having during this time.If you think you're experiencing the symptoms of a collapsed lung again, seek immediate medical intervention.
Breathing might feel strange at first after a collapsed lung. Some discomfort or a pulling sensation in the chest can occur for a few months after treatment. This is normal and is not usually a sign of another collapse."

Let your child get out of the car and lie down.,
Open the window to get some fresh air into the car.,
Move your child so that he is sitting towards the front of the car.,
Elevate your child’s seat.,
Distract your child by playing games or talking to him.,
Try to drive as smoothly as possible.,
Carry an extra set of clothes if your child is prone to carsickness.,
Give your child dimenhydrinate.,
Seek medical help if your child is still experiencing motion sickness long after he has gotten out of the car.,
Know what symptoms to look for if your child can’t express himself.",How to Help a Carsick Child1," If your child is feeling very carsick, take the nearest exit and pull over (where it is safe to do so) and allow your child to get out of the car. Have your child lie down; some people find that lying down can help them to stop feeling carsick.


If your child vomits, give your child plenty of cold water after his nausea has passed.





;
, Rolling down the window and letting some fresh air in may help your child to feel refreshed. Having the wind blow on his face may also help your child to stop thinking about how ill he feels.


In addition to opening the window, you should avoid wearing cologne, smoking or carrying food with a strong odor while driving if you have a child who gets carsick easily. These items can make the air feel stuffy, which in turn can make your child feel more sick.







, If your child is carsick and sitting in the back of the car, move your child up to the middle section of the car, or the front of the car if he is old enough to sit up front. Cars are more unstable in the back, which means that when you take a turn, anyone sitting in the back of the car will be more affected by the turn.


In addition to this exaggerated movement of the back of the car, sitting in the far back may reduce your child’s interaction with the rest of the family. When your child has nothing to distract him, he may feel carsick more easily.
Do not let your child sit backwards or sideways; he should sit facing the direction that the car is moving in.

, When your child sits up higher, he can see out of the car’s window more easily. Looking out the window, especially if the window is rolled down a little bit, can help to distract your child from his illness.


Have your child look out the window rather than giving your child a book to read as a distraction. Reading in the car can lead to car sickness very quickly. Staring down at a page while the car is in motion can overload your child’s senses, in turn making him feel more sick.







, If you cannot stop to let your child rest for a moment, try to distract your child from how sick he is feeling. You can distract your child in a variety of ways. Some of these ways include:

Playing eye-spy with your child, or other games where he has to look out the window. Another idea is to have your child count the number of animals, birds, or trees that he sees.






Talking to your child and asking him questions. Ask him questions about what he likes, or tell him about what you are all going to do when you get to your destination.






Play your child’s favorite music and have him sing along.







, If your child is only moderately carsick, do everything that you can to drive smoothly so that he does not become more carsick.


Try to take turns slowly, and avoid potholes and bumps when you can.

, If your child tends to get sick and vomit, try to be prepared for this by keeping an extra set of clothes for your child in your car. Changing into a fresh set of clothes after he vomits can help to make your child feel more comfortable.


You should also carry wet wipes or a towel, and bags for your child to throw up into.







, This drug is used to treat the symptoms of motion sickness. It can be given to children who are two years old or older. Read the label for the proper dosage. The usual dosage is:

2 to 6 year olds: Give your child 12.5 to 25 mg of dimenhydrinate by mouth every 6 to 8 hours. Do not exceed 75 mg in 24 hours.6 to 12 year olds: Give your child 25 to 50 mg by mouth every 6 to 8 hours. Do not give your child more than 150 mg in 24 hours.Children 12 years old and above: Give your child 25 to 100 mg every 4 to 6 hours. Do not exceed 400 mg a day., If your child is no longer in the car, and has not been in the car for several hours, but is still showing symptoms of motion sickness, you should seek medical help.In particular, if your child is having difficulty seeing, hearing, talking, walking, or has an extreme headache, you should seek medical help right away. Your child might have an underlying condition that is causing these symptoms.







, Very young children might have a hard time expressing what they are feeling. If your child is prone to car sickness, look for the following symptoms:


Pale skin.
Yawning frequently.
Sweating excessively.
Irritable or restless behaviors.

"
"
Understand how car sickness develops.,
Encourage your child to look out the window.,
Plan to drive at night.,
Avoid feeding your child food that could upset his stomach.,
Give your child dramamine before you start your journey.,
Give your child benadryl if he is six years old or older.",How to Help a Carsick Child2," When your body is in motion, different parts of your body will send different messages to your brain. If you look down at a book, or simply do not look out the window, parts of your body will send the message to your brain that you are moving forward, while your eyes will send the message that you are reading and being still. This can cause feelings of car sickness. Symptoms of fatigue include:


Dizziness.






Upset stomach.






Vomiting.
Loss of appetite.
Nausea.

, When your child looks out the window, all of his different body parts will send the same message to his brain: that he is travelling forward. This will make him less likely to feel carsick.


Looking out the window can also help to keep your child distracted from any oncoming feelings of car sickness.

, If possible, save the longer car trips for nighttime. When you drive at night, your child is more likely to fall asleep, which means that he will not develop car sickness.

, When on a long car trip, try to avoid feeding your child greasy or spicy foods, both of which could upset his stomach. Instead, pack light, healthy dinners for longer car rides, rather than stopping at greasy fast food places.


If you are only going on a short car ride, try to avoid feeding your child right before getting into the car. Being really full can make your child more likely to become carsick.

, If your child frequently gets very carsick, consider giving him dramamine to make the journey easier. This drug can be given to kids that are two years old or older. It is an anti-nausea medication that can help your child’s body to fight off any potential feelings of car sickness. Give your child this medication can hour before getting into the car.


Children who are 2 to 6 years old: Give your child 12.5 mg every six hours. Do not exceed 75 mg in a 24 hour period of time.Children who are 6 to 12 years old: Give your child 12.5 to 25 mg after every 6 hours. Do not exceed 150 mg in a 24 hour period of time.Children 12 years or older: Give your child 50 to 100 mg every six hours. Do not exceed 400 mg in a 24 hour period of time., Benadryl (diphenhydramine ) can be given to children who are six years old and older. It is an antihistamine that can help your child’s body to fight off feelings of nausea. It also has a drowsy effect, which can help your child to fall asleep in the car. Give your child this medication one hour before starting on your journey. This medication is given to your child based on his weight. Give:


¾ teaspoon to a child who weighs 20 to 24 kilograms.1 teaspoon to a child who weighs 25 to 37 kilograms.11/2 teaspoon to a child who weighs 38 to 49 kilograms.2 teaspoons to a child who weighs more than 50 kilograms."

In addition, your doctor may prescribe antibiotics for the first few days after surgery to minimize the risk of any infections developing.


Make sure you understand how and when to take your medications, and read all labels carefully. Pain medication, in particular, can be dangerous and addictive if not used with appropriate caution.;
, If you were taking any other medications but stopped prior to your surgery, ask your doctor before beginning to take them again. If you plan to take any other medications or supplements, the same rule applies: talk to your doctor first. You want to make sure that these drugs will not interact with your prescribed pain medications. Double-check before assuming that a particular medication is safe.

, Common side effects of pain medications include constipation, nausea, dizziness, and drowsiness. Contact your doctor if these side effects are severe and persistent, or if you experience more alarming symptoms, like itching, rashes, swelling, or difficulty breathing – these could be signs of an allergic reaction.

, Know what to avoid when taking your medication. For example, most narcotic analgesics cause drowsiness, so you shouldn’t drive or operate machinery while taking them. Similarly, you should avoid drinking alcohol or smoking cigarettes while you are taking medication.

, In the days following your surgery, you should monitor your temperature. A fever is a sign of post-operative infection, which could be dangerous, so call your doctor if your temperature exceeds 101 °F (38 °C).

, If you are in a lot of pain, even when taking your prescribed medication, or if you notice a lot of swelling around your incision, call your doctor. There may be no problem – different people react differently to surgery – but it’s important to err on the side of caution during the post-operative period.

, If your incision starts to bleed more heavily, or if the area around it begins to get redder, call your doctor. These symptoms could be signs of an infection or other problem.

, Pus or a bad-smelling discharge from your incision is a strong indication that there’s an infection present. Contact your doctor immediately.

, Cold therapy (also called cryotherapy) can reduce your pain and inflammation, making you more comfortable and shortening your recovery time. However, people with certain conditions should not use cold therapy, so always discuss it with your doctor first.


Some examples of contraindications of cold therapy include cold intolerance, cold urticaria, cryoglobulinemia, Raynaud disease, and a history of pyoderma gangrenosum. If you have any of these conditions, you should probably not use cold therapy.

, Your doctor will let you know how frequently you should use cold therapy, and for how long. Typically, post-operative patients use cold therapy during the first 48 hours after surgery, or sometimes for the whole first week, for about 20 minutes at a time.


Cold therapy can also be useful after the immediate post-operative period, following physical therapy or exercise. Ask your doctor about this possibility as well.

, Cold therapy can come in the form of ice packs, gel packs, or motorized devices with wrap pads. Whichever you use, apply it outside your dressing, not directly to the skin.

, Immediately after surgery, limit your diet to clear liquids. Ask your doctor when it will be safe for you to expand your diet to include solid foods.

, Research suggests that the consumption of omega-3 fatty acids assists in post-injury collagen formation and control of inflammation.


Good sources of omega-3 fatty acids include herring, salmon, sardines, mackerel, lake trout, and albacore tuna. You can also take supplements.

,


Good sources of Vitamin C include citrus fruits, berries, bell peppers, and dark green leafy vegetables. Good sources of vitamin E include wheat germ, sunflower seeds, and nuts. You can also get both in supplement form.

, Starting a few days after surgery, elevate the leg with the ACL injury above the level of your heart. Elevation will help reduce your swelling.


Using pillows to elevate your leg is fine, but don’t put the pillows directly under your knee; this can limit your range of motion.

, For the first few days or weeks after surgery, you may find that you need crutches in order to move around effectively. Don’t push yourself too hard: use the crutches if you need them.

, Once your dressing is removed, you can shower, but do not immerse your knee until your doctor says it’s okay to do so.

, Depending on your schedule and the kind of job you have, your time away from work or school will vary. In general, someone with a desk job may need only a couple of weeks off; people with more strenuous jobs will need months. Talk to your doctor about your specific circumstances, and make a plan.

, After surgery, you will likely have physical therapy (see below). For the first few months after surgery, do not do strenuous activity outside of this physical therapy. As always, check with your doctor about your particular circumstances and how much activity you can allow yourself.

, In general, you should not drive until you are no longer taking pain medication and no longer relying on crutches to get around. You should also have good control of your knee. Typically, this takes at least a week or two.

, Your doctor and physical therapist will give you specific instructions for exercises to do during the post-operative period. Follow these instructions as carefully as possible, as they will help you regain your full range of motion.

, After two weeks, your physical therapy should increase in intensity. You may begin placing more emphasis on strengthening, balance ,and proprioceptive (related to reaction movements) exercises. Physical therapy should continue to get more and more demanding over the next few months.

, Rehabilitation can take six months to a year or more. Each individual’s progress will be different, so ask your doctor before you return to sports or any other strenuous activity outside of physical therapy.

Simply avoiding spicy food, junk food and fatty food will give you a healthier digestive system that is less prone to problems. Opt for more whole grains, leafy green vegetables, fruits, and lean meats.


Adding fibers and cereal food to your diet will aid in softening your stool and make your bowel movements easier.
Try noticing what types of food you are allergic to or that upset your stomach. Remember that it’s not always a stiff rule — each person is different.
Fatty waste can increase the possibilities of blocking the fistula tunnel and thus can induce the formation of perianal abscess, the major cause of pain in people suffering from fistulas.;
, It is recommended to drink one and a half liters of water a day unless your doctor says otherwise. Stop drinking alcohol and soda; instead consume larger amounts of water and fruit juice. This will help prevent any possible occurrence of constipation, which puts pressure on your fistula.


Excess water will make waste softer and will help clean the intestines; this is why if you drink excess amounts of water you will feel the need to enter the toilet more often.
Water also prevents the intestines from getting blocked especially in patients suffering of some digestive diseases like crohn’s disease, toxic megacolon, etc. In patients with fistula, water will make pus more watery and thus decreases the possibility of abscess formation.

, If your work forces you to sit down for many hours, avoid putting extra pressure on your back, butt, and legs, especially if you have an anal fistula. This could be done by sitting on a pillow or a “donut pillow” instead of the regular chair.


Keep this mentality in mind for anything; your comfort is imperative. Try to avoid situations where you can foresee being uncomfortable or bring a pillow or other aid with you.

, If your fistula is resulting in unfortunate leakage down there, wearing soft, absorbent pads will make you not to worry about the leakage of any blood, pus or fluids out from your fistula, as pads will act as absorbent surfaces.


Adult diapers work, too, they're just a little bulkier and more stigmatized. Pads are thinner and much easier to deal with.

, Make sure to wash yourself after each bowel movement or going to the toilet. Avoiding any bacteria remaining on your skin is the first step to avoiding an infection. This goes double in public restrooms and when you're experiencing leakage.


If you’re outside and can’t do this, always keep wipes with you to be used instead until you can get home. Your hands experience have the most exposure to germs and therefore must stay clean.
Change your underwear at least one time daily. Change towels each time you bathe, too. Both of these prevent the spread of germs and growth of bacteria which can reduce perianal irritation and thus will help in eliminating the annoying symptoms people with fistula suffer from.

, Ibuprofen, a non-steroid anti-inflammatory (NSAID), is the painkiller of choice to be used for treating fistula pain. Anorectal fistulas are often accompanied by pain that is constant, throbbing and that worsens severely when sitting down. To deal with this, talk to your doctor about what the right dosage is for you.


Pathologically, pain is a complication of fistula tunnel blockage. A blocked tunnel will fill up instead of draining pus out — a process that will lead eventually to the formation of an abscess, or a sack of pus near the skin surface.
Pain also can be accompanied with an irritating sensation of the perianal skin because of the pus drain.

, Maintaining a healthy diet and eating food rich in omega-3s, omega-6s, and vitamin C, like fish, olive oil and citrus fruits will help strengthen the immune system and decrease the levels of inflammation you may suffer due to a fistula. You may also take a supplement if your doctor feels it's wise.


Exercise, drinking lots of water, sleeping well, and staying hygienic are also great strides you can make toward a healthier you. And if you have any bad habits — like smoking — consider this a reason to quit.

, If your condition allows for simple, gentle exercising such as slow walking, do so for your health and to aid in eliminating stress. Being stressed can affect your general mood and can trigger problems and irritate your stomach. This then affects your digestive system and your dietary habits on the whole, which creates a vicious cycle.


Always stop and catch your breath for a while if you feel any pain or inability to continue. This is your body telling you it cannot handle the exertion you're putting it under.
Ask your doctor for any kinds of light sports or exercises that you can do. Even at home, yoga is advised by many doctors to clarify your mind, removing stress, and fighting depression. It also enhances your mood and health in general.

, Diagnosis is by visual examination. A sigmoidoscopy must always follow the visual examination to rule out Crohn's disease. However, to know the ins and outs of your case, your doctor will conduct one or more of the following tests, too:



Computerized Tomography (CT scan). Especially in patients with Crohn’s disease, a CT scan indicates the inflammatory stage before the possible formation of a fistula, in addition to showing the cavities of abscess to determine if surgical care is needed.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). This a helpful method to determine any enteric fistulas by revealing any inflammatory changes or accumulation of fluids in the fistula tube.

Fistulography. This is an X-ray method in which a contrast media is injected at the external site of a fistula to clarify the fistula path and how deep it is through the tissues which will help in choosing the treatment.

Ultrasonography. This combined with physical examination can be used to identify any presence of abscess or fluid accumulation that may reside in the fistula tube.

Cystoscopy. This is useful for the “enterovesical fistula” that connects the intestine with the bladder.

Microbiological tests. To indicate any sign of infection, especially in the presence of abscess, a urine culture may be required in case of colovesical fistulas.

, The most common treatment of fistulas is surgical care, which is called “fistulotomy."" This process will remove the fistula and any pus or fluid gathering in it. Fistulotomy is effective in more than 85% of casesIn fistulotomy for rectal fistulas, a procedure called endorectal flap will be used. This is where the surrounding healthy tissues get put inside the fistula cavity to ensure the prevention of its blockage by feces in case of a recurrent infection.
A seton stitch (passing a cord into the fistula in order to keep it closed during the drainage) is also reported to be used in fistulotomy. This, however, usually takes multiple visits to your doctor until recovery and eventually the stitches fall out. There is a ""Cutting Seton Treatment"" known as ""Kshar Sutra Therapy"" which is found to be very effective in all kind of Simple and Complicated Anal Fistula. Although, it takes a few months for full recovery but chances of recurrence after Kshar Sutra Therapy are negligible.

, Fistulas between the esophagus and trachea-bronchial tree are considered life threatening and require immediate and ongoing treatment. If left untreated they can induce chronic lung abscesses and deadly pneumonia. Treatment is provided by a number of medical procedures such as:



Esophageal dilation. However, this is losing popularity because it rarely lasts more than a few days.

Flexible-metal mesh stents. These are the most effective in maintaining esophageal patency and structure.

Plastic coated mesh stents. These can also be used to occlude trachea-esophageal fistulas; some are powered with a valve that prevents reflux when the fistula is located near the esophageal sphincter.

, It’s incredibly important that you follow up with your doctor post-surgery, especially if you have a chronic inflammatory disease such as Crohn’s disease. In these cases, fistulas are just a side effect and the actual cause needs to be addressed.


There are other issues that are related directly to intestinal fistulas that the affected patient must follow up on and be aware of, too. They must avoid sepsis by treating any signs of infections, such as inflammations in the tissues surrounding the fistula, control the drainage of the fistula and keep good care of the skin to maintain the nearby tissues in a healthy state.
Adequate nutrition can be reached by administrating total parenteral nutrition (an IV drip) that is highly recommended for high output fistulas. This will prevent any chance of malnutrition.

, The use of antibiotics may help in minimizing the chances of forming any infections at the fistula site, especially for the enteric kinds. Elevated levels of white blood cells indicates the presence of an infection that may need to be cured with a suitable antibiotic.


Antibiotics should not be taken spontaneously unless your doctor feels the need to prescribe it; this is because the majority of patients having fistulas suffer from underlying colonic disorders/diseases, some of which are induced by irresponsible antibiotic usage.
Antibiotics should only be considered to treat fistula infection and to clear symptoms such as extreme pain with or without abscess, skin irritation “redness,"" and an ongoing high temperature for more than 24 hours.
Fistulas can be treated initially with a compound treatment of metronidazole and ciprofloxacin or vancomycin. Metronidazole will be 250-500mg every 8 hours; Vancomycin is 125-250 mg every 6 hours, or three times daily one hour after eating.

, Most cases are related to chronic inflammatory diseases such as Crohn's disease and tuberculosis. Others may result from diverticulitis, tumors, or chronic trauma. A surgery or an injury can lead to the production of a fistula, too, as in the case of biliary or arteriovenous fistulas.


Recto-vaginal fistulas may be secondary to Crohn's disease, obstetric injuries due to birth, radiation therapy or cancer.
Fistulas in children or infants are mostly congenital affecting boys more than girls.

, Any fistula generally comes accompanied by these symptoms:


Constant discharge (pus)
Pain (related to infection)
One or more openings
Bleeding
Pain in the abdomen
Diarrhea
Loss of appetite
Weight loss
Nausea and vomiting

, A fistula, by definition, is a tube-like tunnel with two openings: one primary opening leading to another exterior opening called the secondary opening. Many types of fistulas are known, but 90% of all fistulas are anorectal fistulas.Physically, they can take on the following forms:



Blind Fistula: A link between two surfaces; one end is closed and the other is opened. This can turn into a complete fistula if untreated.

Incomplete Fistula: A link has only one external opening.

Complete Fistula: A link between an internal opening and external opening.

Horseshoe Fistula: A link in a U shape, between two external openings around the anus.

, Unfortunately, a fistula's symptoms isn't where the problem stops — it can also lead to its own complications. They are the following:


Secretions that produce inflammation around the anal area
Crohn's disease
Tumors of the anal canal
Radial Fungus disease
Chlamydia infection
Exposure to severe trauma
Cracks around the anal area
Infections of the digestive tract

Because of this, it is highly advised that you clean the anus well after using the toilet, observe the rules of public safety and personal hygiene, and use wipes after using the toilet and throw away after each use.

Of course, certain situations necessitate speaking. Limiting the use of your vocal chords can help to speed up the healing process, so try not to speak at all.


Whispering is a no-no. It's unnatural and actually puts more strain on your vocal folds.
Keep a pad and paper with you to write down what you need to relay to others. This might actually be quite fun!;
, Gargling hydrates your throat, softens your vocal chords and speeds the process of restoring your voice. There are over-the-counter mouthwashes you may select to gargle that can also help kill bacteria in your throat that may be causing your voice loss.









If you zap a cup of water in the microwave, make sure the water isn't too hot -- the last thing you want is to literally scorch the lining of your throat.

, Your voice is ultimately part of your body, so if you want to warm up your voice, warm up your entire being. Yoga is a great way to become aware of your body and start cuing your diaphragm to action. If you're not super sick, it's a good way to get loose (if you are super sick, you might want to stay in bed!).









Here's a good exercise to get your diaphragm working: Sit on the floor with your knees bent. Make sure they're slightly apart. Place your hands on the knees and, with arms stretched out straight, inhale deeply through your nose. Exhale strongly through your mouth. Bring your hands to your knees and press them firmly, spreading your fingers wide apart. Look up, stretch the tongue out and vocalize a lion’s roar – a loud, open “ahhh” sound. Make sure this sound is coming from your diaphragm and not your throat!, It's all about hydration, really. If you can have water in and around you, you'll be well-off. If a hot, steamy shower isn't up your alley at the moment, bring a pot of water to a boil and place your head over it. Throw a towel on top of your head to keep the steam swirling around your sinus cavity.









Stay in that position for a few minutes. You should start to feel your sinuses clearing (if you have a cold, of course). Repeat this as often as you'd like.

, If it hasn't already been drilled into you years ago, smoking is absolutely terrible for all aspects of your health, including your voice. Talk about drying out your esophagus! You might as well be charring your vocal folds.









Just in case you were wondering, quitting smoking is cheaper, is better for those around you, cuts your risk of heart disease and lung and bladder cancer, and makes all levels of exercise much, much easier.

, If you simply sang karaoke a few too many times last night, you probably don't have too much to worry about in the scheme of things. However, if you woke up one day a week ago and haven't spoken since, that's cause for alarm. Visit your doctor to see what's going on.









Generally speaking, anything more than a few days warrants a doctor's visit. It's always better to be cautious than stubborn. And if it's accompanied with other symptoms (coughing, fever, etc.) definitely pay him/her a visit.

, Keep your body well-hydrated while restoring your voice. Increasing your fluid intake helps your throat produce a healthy amount of moisture and restores voice functions. Moisture is key to getting your voice back.









What's the opposite of water? Alcohol. It drys out your throat and leaves your entire body dehydrated. If you want to get your voice back anytime soon, you'll need to avoid it.

, Acidic foods and beverages such as tea, citrus fruit and chocolate do not have any direct, positive effect on the vocal chords but do promote acid reflux (a very bad thing). Acid reflux can worsen the inflammation and exacerbate voice loss. The best way to rid of foreign substances and bacteria which may be prolonging the voice loss is to drink plenty of clean water.









You heard right: tea is acidic and acidic things are bad for the lining of your esophagus.The people that swear by it probably swear by it because it makes them feel better. It's rather soothing, but it doesn't necessarily help the actual problem.

, Alright, since you're probably not only going to be drinking water, whatever you do drink, keep it warm. You don't want it too cold or too hot -- both have adverse affects on the lining of your throat. And if you are drinking tea (let's face it, you probably are), honey is okay.









Curious about milk? Dairy products will coat your throat. This can be soothing, but it just covers up the problem and it will return shortly. If you're performing, be sure not to consume dairy in the hours before your performance.

, There are at least a half a dozen products out there that claim to have some magical effect on voices. Emergen-C, Friar's Balsam, slippery elm, and Lemsip are just four products that claim to get the voice going again. If you're hard up for a magical answer, one of these may work for you.









But just for the record, water, water, water, water and vocal rest is really the best solution. Don't depend on these for a miracle.

, A change in weather or a dry environment can irritate the throat. Because of this, providing moisture can help soothe this irritation. The use of cough drops or other lozenges are effective ways to keep your throat lubricated.









Even chewing gum can help a dry mouth. The more you stay lubricated and hydrated, the better off you'll be.

, Especially if a dry environment is the cause of the vocal irritation, this can also help resolve this issue. It's similar to throwing your head over a steaming pot of water, but more like the pot of water is circulating throughout the entire room.








, Often losing your voice is a symptom of a larger problem. If you have a cough, cold or sore throat, address that instead of just your lost voice. You'll find that your voice will come back when you get on antibiotics, start filling up on vitamin C, feed that cold, or starve that fever.

Stop scratching.",How to Get Rid of Pinworms1," Pinworms have a lifespan of about six weeks, so to clear up pinworm infection without medication and prevent re-infection, you and your family will have to take great care with personal hygiene and cleanliness for at least this long.Pinworms are highly contagious, so everyone in the household should participate.
Even if you passed the parasite to someone else, it is possible to become re-infected.;
, Wash your hands frequently with soap and warm water to help prevent the spread of pinworms.


Be especially diligent about washing your hands thoroughly after using the bathroom or changing diapers.
It’s also essential that you teach your children about the importance of washing their hands, and make sure they follow through because children often unknowingly spread the infection.

, Pinworm eggs can get lodged under fingernails when you scratch, so cut nails short and scrub them to reduce the likelihood that this will occur.Cutting nails might also keep you from engaging in bad habits such as nail biting, which increase the risk of pinworm infection.

, Pinworm eggs can get on your clothes and bedding, especially as you sleep, which makes it vital that you wash these items daily in hot water and laundry detergent. Underwear, pajamas, pants, towels, and washcloths should be washed daily for the duration of the infestation.
Bedding should also be washed daily unless an anti-parasite medication is taken, at which point it only needs to be washed on the first day of treatment and every three days or so after that.
Dry all items in a heated dryer. Heat is more effective at killing pinworms than other methods of drying.
Be careful not to share towels or washcloths so you do not spread the infection.

, Take a hot shower at least once a day while the infestation continues. Use body wash or soap as you wash as opposed to merely rinsing yourself with water.Pay special attention to the skin around the anus so that you scrub away any pinworm eggs.
Shower in the morning so you can wash away more pinworm eggs left behind during the night.
Showers are better than baths because they reduce the risk of spreading pinworm eggs to other parts of your body. Pinworm eggs that are washed off into bathwater can find their way to your mouth or other areas of the body.

, Cleaning potentially contaminated surfaces is important because pinworm eggs can stick to things you touch such as clothing, toys, dishes, and furniture. The eggs can also survive two to three weeks outside the body.Toilet seats should be cleaned daily.
Clean and disinfect counters and other surfaces regularly.
Clean and disinfect your child’s toys.
Store toothbrushes in a cabinet and rinse them with warm water before use.

, Even though pinworms usually cause an irritating itch, you should avoid scratching around the anus because you might get the pinworm eggs on your hands or fingers and transmit the infection to other people.Scratching affected areas may cause the pinworm eggs to get trapped under your nails.
Wear gloves or socks over your hands at night to prevent yourself from scratching in your sleep.
Cut your nails short. This way, even if you do scratch by accident, it is less likely that the pinworm eggs will get lodged beneath the nail.

Take care of yourself.",How to Help a Loved One Recover from a Stroke," While each person will experience different effects from a stroke, hemiparesis (or weakness) of the whole side or just the arm or leg is a common result of a stroke. In addition, problems with balance and coordination are common, too. Thus, adjustments may need to be made to ensure that your loved one (who may now have mobility difficulties) can easily access her house. When attempting to make your house stroke-survivor-friendly, consider the following suggestions:


Move the person’s bed to the ground floor so that she can avoid having to use the stairs, where falls are more likely to occur.
Clear a path to all essential rooms (including bedroom, bathroom, and kitchen).Less clutter will mean that your loved one is less likely to fall. This includes removing area rugs.
Install a seat in the shower to allow her to sit while bathing. Additionally, install handrails to assist with getting in and out of the tub and/or shower as well as by toilet to help her get up and down if needed.
Make a bedpan readily available at her bedside. Encourage use of this commode, especially if the person feels off-balance or disoriented as this can avoid falls which could further injure the patient.
If stairs cannot be avoided, install handrails around the stairs to assist your loved one move up and down.The person's physical therapist should be working with the person to re-learn how to navigate her environment, including going up and down stairs.;
, A new deficiency in mobility is one of the most common issues faced by stroke survivors. A person who was once very mobile and independent may be reduced to slow, unsteady walking or even be largely bed-bound after a stroke. Expect your loved one to require some assistance moving around for at least a period of time after a stroke.


Assistive devices can be used to better facilitate mobility. Family members can consult a physical therapist in order to find out which assistive devices would best suit the stroke survivor. These devices could include a wheelchair, walker, or cane depending on the severity of mobility issues.Support and encourage your loved one in his attempts to be mobile. Celebrate any reduction in dependence on assistive devices.

, Falls and accidents after a stroke are, unfortunately, very common.Make your loved one’s safety a priority to avoid any unnecessary side effects or complications that are related to, but not a direct result of, her stroke.


Put up rails around the stroke survivor’s bed and lower the level of the bed as necessary. The rails should be up at night to prevent any falls due to imbalance or disorientation, and the bed can be lowered to avoid the need to “climb” into bed.
If something that is frequently used (for example, pots and pans) are located somewhere that is hard to access (like in a high cabinet), move them. Make commonly used items in locations that are easy for your loved one to access.
Be present to assist with tree trimming, snow shoveling, house painting, or any other activities that put your loved one at an increased risk for an accident after her stroke.

, Dysphagia is the medical term that means a person is experiencing difficulty swallowing. After a stroke, eating or drinking can become difficult because the muscles of chewing and swallowing can be weakened (this is particularly true immediately after a stroke).Thus, it is important to help your loved one adapt to new habits of eating and drinking to ensure he is getting adequate nutrition.


After a stroke, it is common to have a nasogastric feeding tube in the early stages;however, in especially severe cases, a feeding tube will be a permanent requirement in order for the stroke survivor to receive the necessary nutrients.
If the stroke survivor is feeding through percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube — a tube used for feeding that is inserted directly in the stomach- make sure that the tube is intact, functioning properly, and protected from infection and from pulling by the patient.
Your loved one will need to undergo a test called a swallowing study, which will allow his doctor to assess his ability to swallow food. Speech therapy and x-rays are used to help the doctor determine when it is safe for the patient to move from liquids to thick, soft foods.
When your loved one is able to eat without assistance of a medical device, feed him thick, soft food. Stroke survivors who are starting to feed orally must start with this type of food to prevent aspiration pneumonia. There are liquid thickeners in the market that can help make soup and juice thicker. You can also use items in your kitchen like gelatin, cornmeal, and oats.
Keep your loved one upright while eating in order to prevent aspiration pneumonia, which occurs when food is inhaled into the lungs. Because his muscles involved with swallowing are weak, his position for eating is even more important. This will ensure mealtimes are safe and remain a fun part of the day.

, A stroke may change the control your loved one has over her bladder and bowels.This can create safety problems (for example, infections or sores) and can also be a sore subject or one that causes great embarrassment. As a caretaker, it is important to recognize if these issues are occurring and address them with your loved one in order to help her on the road to recovery.


For stroke survivors that are unable to use a commode or go to the bathroom, adult diapers may be used. These can be found in almost any drug store or grocery store. Encourage your loved one to wear one if necessary until she regains control of her bodily functions.
You will need to assist your loved one by making sure the diaper is changed immediately after each time she voids or has a bowel movement. Otherwise she may experience skin breakdown and sores and potential infection in the area.

, Most stroke survivors have certain levels of communication impairment, at least temporarily. The severity of the stroke may determine how severe the communication impairment is. Some stroke patients might not be able to express themselves correctly, while others might not be able to understand what is being said.Due to paralysis, some stroke survivors might not be able to say words properly, though the cognitive aspect of their communication is functioning. It is important to help your loved one deal with communication issues.


Before considering speech impairment, make sure that the stroke survivor does not have any hearing difficulty. This can also be a cause of communication difficulty and often can be corrected with the use of a hearing aid.
Learn about the different types of communication issues. For example, recognize if your loved one is suffering from aphasia (where the individual can think clearly, but has trouble getting her messages in and out) or apraxia (where the individual has difficulty putting speech sounds together in the correct way).Use short words and nonverbal communication such as hand gestures, nodding or shaking, pointing, or even showing objects. The patient should not be asked too many questions at once and should be given ample time to respond to any communication. Accept any form of communication as valid.Visual aids can be used for communication — this includes charts, alphabet boards, electronic media, objects and pictures. This can help your loved one overcome the frustration associated with not being able to communicate effectively.

, Establishing a daily routine can make impairments such as communication less frustrating. If the stroke survivor knows the routine for the day, he anticipates the activities and the family anticipates his needs. This can relieve stress for both the patient and those caring for him.

, First, strokes can result in personality changes that can negatively affect relationships.Second, strokes can result in post-stroke mood disorders, including depression, anxiety, and pseudo-bulbar affect (PBA).As a caregiver, it is important to be vigilant and take notice of any emotional changes in your loved one.


Depression strikes between one- and two-thirds of stroke survivors, while PBA affects approximately one-quarter to one-half of survivors.Get treatment for your loved one if necessary. Medication and counseling have benefitted many stroke survivors and is often covered by insurance., After your loved one is released from the hospital, it will be up to you to know the medications and therapies needed by the stroke survivor. This is an important role, and one that should not be taken lightly. It will greatly benefit your loved one’s health if you help her maintain a schedule for medicine and therapy.


List all medications and times when the patient will take them. Make sure your loved one does not run out of any necessary medicine. Planning ahead is very important to avoid delays in therapy.
Understand the side effects of any medications prescribed to your loved one.Be on the lookout for any of these side effects.
Discuss the administration of your loved one’s medicines with her doctor. Recognize if the medicine should be administered orally or if it should be crushed in food. Know if it should be taken with food or on an empty stomach.
Adherence to doctor’s appointments should also be followed to ensure that any problems that may occur during rehabilitation are managed early. This will help to prevent complications of delayed treatment. You will likely need to remind your loved one of the appointment and arrange a ride for them to the clinic.
Make keeping track of your loved one’s medication and therapy easy on yourself by writing notes or setting alarms on your phone. Look for apps designed to remind you when to administer medication and utilize planners and calendars that are prominently displayed.
Forgive yourself if you make a mistake. If you are late giving a pill or going to a therapy session, don't beat yourself up. Feeling guilty will not benefit your loved one nor yourself.

, It's wise to attend at least one therapy session in order to become better acquainted with exercises and activities that the stroke survivor must practice at home. While the therapist is performing the exercise with the stroke survivor, try also doing it with him.


Having the therapist present while learning the exercises is helpful. The therapist can correct or help you improve how you help the stroke survivor during therapy exercises.

, Knowing the goal of rehabilitation (that is, the expected outcome or outcomes) will help you better understand the time frame of rehabilitation and the progress that is being made. It can also help you push the patient further in performing her therapy exercises.


Encourage your loved one not to quit on her therapy goals. Rehabilitation after a stroke can be very difficult, and it is important that you encourage your loved one to keep striving toward her goals.
Often times, gains in abilities can take up to six months to one year after a stroke. It is very important to partake in therapy routinely to continue to progress forward.
Recognize any improvements and address non-improvement too. If your loved one is not improving after a long time in rehabilitation, speak with the doctor or therapist about adjusting the therapy regimen.

, There are several situations during your loved one’s rehab where you may need to make a special trip to the doctor. Especially during rehabilitation, when your loved one is pushing his body to recover from a serious brain injury, it is important to keep a vigilant eye on his health.


Do not ignore any falls.Falls are quite common during rehabilitation. The falls can cause further damage to the patient and worsen the condition. The patient should be taken to the hospital for a medical checkup in the case of a fall so that all serious medical issues can be ruled out.
Remember that your loved one is at an increased risk of suffering from another stroke within a year of his first stroke.Know the warning signs of a stroke and know who to call if you see your loved one experiencing any of these warning signs, including:Face drooping
Arm weakness
Speech difficulty
Sudden numbness in the face, arm, or leg, especially on one side of the body
Sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes
Sudden trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance
Sudden, severe headache with no known cause



, Try to keep listening to what the stroke survivor is saying even if her speech is distorted or she is mumbling. Recognize that she wants to communicate, but is unable, and this is as frustrating to her as it is to you. Talk to her, even if she is unable to respond.Although communication might be frustrating at first, it is important that family members reinforce it. This often results in better rehabilitation of the stroke survivor. Your positive attitude and patience can help your stroke survivor get better faster.

, A patient recovering from a stroke may need months or years of rehabilitation. Stroke victims may be taught to relearn old things again; however, they may never get back to exactly how they were before the stroke. Stroke survivors may be depressed, in denial, or may feel helpless, overwhelmed and fearful. Because of this, families of stroke survivors play a very important role in the recuperating period.


It is important to make the stroke survivor feel that he is not alone. In the immediate aftermath of his stroke, a stroke survivor may worry about his job, how he is going to take care of himself (or who will take care of him), and how he can rehabilitate quickly (and if he will ever be “normal” again).
Talk to your loved one about his emotions. Ask him how he feels, and maintain a positive attitude regardless of the situation.

, Families involving themselves in the rehabilitation of their loved one serve as strong and steadfast source of support. Understand the impairments that have resulted from your loved one’s stroke and discuss the potential for recovery with your loved one’s doctors. Understanding a bit about the recovery process can make you feel more empathetic and enable you to be a better source of support to your stroke survivor.


Accompany your loved one to her therapy sessions. Participate as much as you can, provide smiles and verbal encouragement whenever possible. This is a great way to show your loved one that you are interested and invested in her recovery.
At the same time, remember that this is her therapy and she needs to have decision making abilities and as much control as she can. Do not become the dictator of your loved one's life or treatment — ask her what she wants and give her as much autonomy as possible.

, After a stroke, the stroke survivor may feel helpless — do your best to empower him. He may be incontinent, having trouble communicating, and have difficulty walking — all things that we take for granted in our day to day lives. Provide help when you can (and when it is necessary), but encourage and support independence — whether it is a few steps without a walker, the willingness to answer a phone call, or an attempt to write a note. As the safety of your loved one is top priority, there are some things you must consider:


Assess the stroke survivor (or ask a doctor or therapist for assistance) in order to better understand which activities he can and cannot do (or which ones he should not do). Being able to make this distinction will help you determine for which activities you can encourage independence without exposing your loved one to any unnecessary risk.
Encourage the stroke survivor to practice activities learned during rehabilitation sessions. Do these activities with the stroke survivor until he can do it alone.
Support the stroke survivor’s choice of rehabilitation. If the stroke survivor wants to rehab at home, as outpatient, or in the hospital, let him make this decision as independently as possible. When decision making skills are exercised by the stroke survivor, the family and the rehabilitation team has a better idea what the stroke survivor wants. There is a higher chance to encourage independence and see signs of healing in a stroke survivor if he is an agent in his own care.

,, Any family member who is actively involved in the care of the patient should also take care of herself. This means you should take a break from caregiving by asking another family member to take care of your loved one for a short while.In order to be helpful to your loved one, you need to stay healthy and happy, too.


Keep your own life in balance. Do this by eating right, exercising daily, sleeping enough, and doing any activities you enjoyed before your loved one’s stroke."

Purchase an over-the-counter pinworm medicine.,
Ask your doctor for a prescription anti-parasite medication.,
Request anti-itch cream.,
Prepare to take a repeat treatment.Your doctor may recommend taking a second round of medication two weeks after the conclusion of the first round.Pinworm symptoms may fade or disappear within the first week of treatment, but these medications only kill adult worms.,
Observe good hygiene.",How to Get Rid of Pinworms2," Look for an oral medication containing pyrantel pamoate. This medicine paralyzes the nervous system of pinworms, forcing them to exit the body in one's stool. Follow label instructions to determine the dosing amount and frequency.
This medication should not be used if you have liver problems, are pregnant, or are breastfeeding.
Pyrantel pamoate can interact with other medications and supplements so it’s a good idea to ask a doctor or pharmacist if this medicine is safe for you to use before taking it.

, Individuals with pinworm infestation are often treated with an anti-parasite medication that quickly wipes out adult pinworms.


The two most common anti-parasite medications used to treat pinworm infestations are albendazole and mebendazole. Both of these drugs prevent worms from absorbing sugar, thereby causing them to lose energy and die.These drugs may cause mild gastrointestinal upset, including stomach pain and nausea.More severe side effects include sore throat, fever, unusual bleeding or bruising, shortness of breath, and fatigue. If any unusual side effects appear, stop use and contact your doctor.Your doctor may advise against these prescription treatments for patients who are pregnant or under the age of two years.

, Ask your doctor for their recommendation on an anti-itch cream safe for use near the anus. You may receive an over-the-counter or prescription cream.Even though the anti-parasite medication will be enough to kill the pinworms, you may still experience itching after the initial round of medication. This can be both uncomfortable and problematic, since eggs may remain in the system even after all matured pinworms have died off. Scratching can spread these eggs, making the matter worse.

, A second round or ""repeat"" treatment kills any pinworms that hatch from eggs that were not destroyed by the initial treatment.

, Although pinworm medication is effective, it's imperative that you and your family observe good hygiene practices to reduce the risk of re-infection and transmission of pinworms. Follow the guidelines in Method 1 to prevent re-infection from occurring and to reduce the risk of transmitting pinworms to other people.

Take your loved one to see a doctor.,
Encourage your loved one to see a psychiatrist.,
Suggest cognitive behavioral therapy.",How to Help Loved Ones with Pain Disorder1," People who have pain disorder may frequent the doctor’s office and request tests to find the cause of their pain. Your loved one may make an appointment any time she has a new or recurring symptom. Do not try to stop your loved one from going to see the doctor because this might upset him or her. Instead, offer to take your loved one and be as supportive as possible.


If your loved one’s doctor has made a diagnosis of pain disorder, then try to help your loved one understand what that means. For example, you could say something like, “The pain that you are having is real, but it is not from a physical cause. That is why the doctors have not been able to treat it. You will have to go to a different type of doctor to find a treatment that works.”
Your loved one may still need to have regular appointments with a primary care physician to keep track of his or her progress and to get medication to treat symptoms.;
, The pain associated with pain disorder is not linked with any identifiable cause. People with pain disorder often go through extensive testing to find the cause of their pain, but there is not a medical cause. That is why doctors may refer patients with pain disorder to a mental health professional, such as a psychiatrist.A psychiatrist is a medical doctor who specializes in psychiatric disorders, so he or she may perform more tests to look for a cause to the pain. A psychiatrist may also prescribe medications to help with anxiety and depression.To encourage your loved one to see a psychiatrist, try saying something like, “Since your pain is not linked to a physical cause, it might be necessary to see a different kind of doctor to get the help you need. Would you be willing to let me make an appointment with a psychiatrist for you?”

, In addition to seeking the help of a psychiatrist, people who have pain disorder can also benefit from working with a therapist. A therapist can help your loved one overcome fears and anxiety about pain that has no medical cause. Talking with a therapist may also help to relieve some of your loved one’s pain.To encourage your loved one to see a therapist, try saying something like, “I’ve read that cognitive behavioral therapy can be really helpful for pain disorder. Would you like me to set up an appointment with a therapist for you?”

Rest your legs.,
Ice your shins for 20 minutes three to four times per day.,
Use a compression stocking or elastic wrap.,
Elevate your shins.,
Take an over the counter anti-inflammatory medication.",How to Get Rid of Shin Splints Fast1," Stop running or training for a few days. The continuation of your routine will make symptoms worse, so take it as a sign that you need some rest. Shin splints are caused by straining and overworking the muscles and tendons in your legs.
A few days of rest will be necessary to begin to reduce pain and strain.
Avoid straining your legs even during regular activity.;
, Choose ice over heat whenever treating shin splints.Ice will reduce pain and swelling associated with shin splints.
Don't apply ice or cold packs directly to the skin.
Put a towel around ice or ice packs before using.

, These devices help increase circulation in the area and speed recovery.Compression bandages can help to reduce swelling and add additional support to an injured area.
Don't wrap your bandage too tightly. While compression can help reduce swelling, a wrap or bandage that is too tight can cut off circulation to the tissue.
If you feel numbness or tingling in the area below the wrap, loosen it.

, Sit or lay down with your legs above your heart.Try to elevate your shins any time you apply ice.
Any time you are sitting for a longer period, it can help to elevate your shins.
Keeping your shin above your heart, especially while lying down, can help to reduce swelling and inflammation.

, Inflammation in your shins and other muscles is common, so take anti-inflammatories for a few days.Anti-inflammatory medications include ibuprofen, naproxen, and aspirin.
Take the medication according to package directions: usually every four to six hours for ibuprofen or every 12 hours for naproxen.
Don't exceed the maximum dosage listed on the bottle in a 24 hour period.

Call poison control.,
Go to the emergency room.,
Get medical treatment.",How to Handle Caffeine Overdose1," This is especially important if you realize you've taken a medication high in caffeine or eaten or drank something high in caffeine. Foods that are high in caffeine include things like chocolate, and beverages like tea and coffee also tend to be high in caffeine.If you have symptoms like difficulty breathing, call poison control right away to figure out how to handle the problem.The National Poison Control Center (1-800-222-1222) in the United States can be reached at any time of day. It does not cost money to call and you can call even if it's not a medical emergency.
Explain to the person on the phone your exact symptoms and what you ingested that caused an overdose. You will also be asked your age, weight, physical condition, time you took the caffeine, and amount.Ask for instructions on how to proceed. You may be advised to force yourself to vomit or to use other medications to treat your symptoms. However, do not force yourself to vomit unless instructed to do so by a professional.;
, If you're experiencing intense symptoms, like dizziness, confusion, an irregular heartbeat, or difficulty breathing, go to the ER right away. Do not try to drive yourself. Call 911. In rare cases, caffeine overdoses can be fatal. Intense overdoses should be treated by medical professionals.If you ate or drank something unusual that caused the overdose, bring the container with you to the emergency room.

, At the ER, you will be given medical treatment depending on your symptoms, current health, amount of caffeine you ingested, and other factors. Talk over your symptoms with your doctor to figure out the right course of treatment for you.You may be given activated charcoal tablets to treat an overdose. Laxatives may be used to get the caffeine out of your system. If your breathing is very bad, you may need breathing support.
You may also need certain tests, like chest x-rays.
For more mild cases of caffeine overdoses, you may only need medication to treat the symptoms until they pass.

Stay out of the heat.,
Wear loose, ""breathable"" clothing.,
Avoid hard physical activity.,
Use soothing powder to dry the skin.,
Bathe frequently and let your skin air dry.,
Give the skin a chance to get fresh air every day.",How to Get Rid of Heat Rash1," As its name suggests, one of the main causes of heat rash is exposure to hot weather that encourages sweating. The less you sweat, the less sweat will build up behind your blocked pores and the less irritated your rash will be. Thus, the more time you can spend out of hot weather, the better.If you have access to it, spending time in an air-conditioned area is a very good idea. Not only does air conditioning make the air cooler — it also makes it much less humid.This is a big help when it comes to fighting heat rash, as high humidity keeps sweat from evaporating, worsening heat rash.;
, If you're suffering from heat rash, it's wise to wear clothes that exposes your skin to fresh air. This gives the sweat and moisture on the skin a chance to evaporate and prevents moisture from building up around the rash like it would with tight clothing.


It's not just about the clothes you wear — it's also about what they're made of. Fabrics like cotton and more breathable, jersey-like exercise weaves tend to be best, while sheer artificial fabrics like nylon and polyester are least breathable.
If you're in hot weather, you may not want to wear clothes that outright expose your skin (like shorts, tank tops, etc.) These garments run the risk of sunburn, which will just make your skin more irritated and vulnerable to damage. Apply sunscreen generously or stick to loose but skin-covering clothes.

, Exercise raises your body temperature and makes you sweat — exactly what you don't want when you have a heat rash. Though physical activity is great for long-term health, in the short term, it can keep a heat rash from healing and even make it worse. Take the opportunity to avoid intense physical activities while you're waiting for your rash to get better, especially if you would be doing them in hot, humid environments. This includes:


Sports
Hiking
Running
Weightlifting/calisthenics
...and so on.

, Sometimes, especially in hot and humid climates, it can be difficult to keep heat rash-affected skin completely dry, even if you avoid exercise. In these cases, try applying a small amount of talcum powder, baby powder, or corn starch (in a pinch) to the affected area. These powders absorb moisture, keeping the skin dry.This can be a big help if, for whatever reason, you can't follow all of the directions above.


Don't use scented or perfumed powders, which can irritate rash-affected skin. You also will not want to apply any sort of powder to open wounds, as this can lead to infection.

, Keeping the skin clean is important when you have virtually any kind of rash. Dirt, grime, and bacteria can all make a heat rash worse by starting an infection, but regular bathing (at least once per day while you have a rash) can help keep your skin free of these contaminants. When you do bathe, don't use a towel on the rash-affected skin. Instead, let it gradually air dry.Towels can irritate the skin further and transfer infection-causing bacteria on to it.

, When you have a heat rash, remember — you don't have to wear the same clothes all day. If your work or other responsibilities keep you from wearing the sorts of breathable clothes that are best for heat rash, take them off when you get a chance to rest. This isn't an ideal situation, but giving the skin a chance to breathe some of the time is better than never giving it a chance to breathe at all.


For example, let's say you're in a hot, humid jungle and you have heat rash on your foot. However, your work requires you to wear thick rubber boots. In this case, you might try switching to a loose pair of sandals at the end of each day after your cool-off shower. Exposing your heat rash to fresh air as often as possible will only help your situation.

Hydrate right after a workout.,
Eat a balanced meal shortly after exercising.",How to Get Rid of Soreness," The combination of hot and cold water can help alleviate pain in your muscles, particularly if the pain was caused by a strenuous workout. Take a quick five-minute shower, and alternate between 20 seconds of cold water and 10 seconds of hot water.This may be uncomfortable at first, but try to tough it out as it may ease muscle soreness.
If you really can't stand alternating between hot and cold, try taking a warm bath with Epsom salts to relieve the pain.;
, This stands for rest, ice, compression, and elevation. This is usually helpful for sore limbs versus something like a sore neck or back. If you're sore from, say, a strenuous workout, the R.I.C.E method may help.Rest your sore muscles. Try to take it easy until soreness passes.
Ice the area. Place an ice pack wrapped in a towel over the sore area on your body. Leave it on for about 20 minutes. Leave it off for 20 minutes, then repeat.
Compress the area with a compression bandage, which you can purchase at a drugstore, to ease swelling in the area.
Elevate the sore body part above your heart to alleviate pain. If you have sore legs, for instance, lie down and prop your legs up on pillows so that they are higher than your heart.

, A gentle massage can help alleviate soreness. Gently use your fingers to massage the area that hurts. This can help loosen up the muscles and reduce pain. If the pain gets worse, however, stop massaging.If it's within your budget, a professional massage can be a fun way to treat yourself and reduce soreness.

, You can purchase a foam roller at a sporting goods store, online, or at some drug stores. It's a cylinder-shaped hard object that you roll over sore areas on the body to alleviate pain. It's most effective when used right after a workout., Take something like ibuprofen if you're feeling sore. Over-the-counter pain medication can reduce soreness by reducing inflammation in the muscles.Make sure to follow the directions on the bottle for dosage.
If you're on any existing medications, check with your doctor or pharmacist before taking over-the-counter painkillers.

, You may need to see a doctor under some conditions. Soreness is not usually a major medical concern; however, in the following cases, medical intervention is advised.If you think your soreness was caused by a rash or tick bite, see a doctor.
If you have signs of infection, such as redness or swelling, see a doctor.
Muscle pain that's possibly related to a new medication should be evaluated by a doctor.
If your pain does not improve with self-care, see a doctor.

, Focus on the muscles you worked the hardest, but make sure to include neck and back stretches. This may help alleviate muscle soreness, especially soreness potentially caused by a strenuous workout.Always stretch after a workout, when muscles are warmed up. Do not do static stretches before workouts — this doesn't prevent soreness and can actually hurt your performance. Warm up with dynamic stretches, which should be similar to your workout, just at a lower intensity. (If you are going to be running, warm up with walking, for example.), Doing low-impact exercise the day after hard workouts will help improve circulation and reduce muscle soreness. Lightly working out the sore areas can help alleviate pain, but do not try to do anything extreme if you're feeling sore. For example, say your legs are sore. Try walking or jogging lightly for 30 to 90 minutes the first day of recovery in place of a run. This gives the sore area a chance to move, but does not overexert it.

, Light aerobic activities can actually help alleviate soreness in the neck and shoulders. Activities like swimming, jumping jacks, and other light motions that engage the muscles in your neck and back can help lessen pain in these areas., If you suspect your soreness is caused by an underlying medical condition, or if you experience muscle pain in your legs that comes and goes with walking and is relieved by rest, you should see your primary care doctor. This can be a sign of poor circulation or other conditions. You do not want to risk harming your body when it's in a compromised state. Instead, seek out the advice of a medical doctor to figure out how to best treat your soreness., If you're prone to frequent bouts of soreness, try to figure out why soreness occurs. You may have to alter certain behaviors to prevent soreness in the future. Think about what occurs before you begin feeling sore.The cause may sometimes be obvious. Soreness after a strenuous workout, for example, is likely caused by exercise. In this case, you may be able to prevent soreness by warming up, cooling down, and stretching.
However, it also may be something you're doing. If you work in an office, sitting for too long can cause soreness. This is especially true if you have poor posture. You can try to stand and walk more throughout the day, and make an effort to sit up straighter.

, Being hydrated is beneficial for your overall health and it also can help to prevent injuries. In addition, a lack of water before, during, and after workouts can cause soreness. Make sure to drink water roughly 15 minutes into a workout. If your workouts are particularly strenuous, you should consider a solution that contains electrolytes, such as Gatorade., Waiting too long to eat after a workout can make soreness worse. Try to eat a balanced meal that contains lean protein, carbohydrates, fruits, and vegetables within one to two hours after a workout."

You can do this frequently throughout the day.If you're using an ice pack, place a cloth between the ice pack and your exposed skin.Applying ice directly to the skin can damage your tissue.

, After soaking and drying the hemorrhoid, apply a small amount of aloe vera gel, or anti-itch lotion.Look for something containing petroleum jelly, mineral oil, shark liver oil and phenylephrine. The phenylephrine acts as a decongestant and helps shrink the hemorrhoid. You can also use Aloe Vera gel to soothe hemorrhoids.If the hemorrhoids are very painful or uncomfortable, apply a bit of baby teething gel to the area. Teething gels contain a local antiseptic that can reduce pain and discomfort.
Avoid using steroid creams because they can damage the delicate tissue around a hemorrhoid.

, Take a cotton pad and soak it in witch hazel. Place it on the hemorrhoid after you have a bowel movement. Repeat this as often as you need to, at least four or five times a day. Alternatively, place it on a pad in your underwear for longer lasting relief.Witch hazel can relieve itching, discomfort, irritation, and burning caused by hemorrhoids. It may also reduce swelling., Slowly add fiber to your diet, increasing in small increments since it may cause gas or bloating. While everyone needs a different amount of fiber based on calories consumed, try to get 25 grams (0.88 oz) of fiber a day if you're a female or 30 grams (1.1 oz) of fiber a day if you're a male. Fiber will soften your stools, making them easier to pass.Different fibers have different effects on your body, so aim to include more wheat bran fibers and other cereals, which are the fibers that affect stool softness.Fiber supplements can reduce hemorrhoid bleeding, irritation, and inflammation.If you feel bloated or gassy, you may be eating too much fiber.
You can increase your fiber by choosing whole grains, fruits with the peel or rind, leafy greens, beans, and legumes.You may also be able to get fiber in yogurt that contains active cultures and probiotics., Choose more nutritious, smaller meals and eat throughout the day. This will give your digestive system a chance to process the food and give your body the nutrition it needs to heal the hemorrhoid. Drink plenty of water throughout the day.


Fluid keeps your stools softer making them easier to pass., Choose low-impact exercises like swimming, dancing, yoga, and walking, but avoid activities that can cause straining, such as weight-lifting. Low-impact activities have an anti-inflammatory effect on your body, which can help relieve hemorrhoid symptoms.It also keeps your body systems healthy and your bowels moving.


Try pelvic floor exercises.Exercise also reduces pressure on your veins which may be contributing to hemorrhoid pain., It may be helpful to purchase a foam cushion or a doughnut cushion to sit on. This can help relieve some of the pressure. Avoid sitting directly on hard surfaces.


Direct pressure on the hemorrhoid can increase swelling and even cause new hemorrhoids., If it's possible, try to use the bathroom without interruptions at the same time every day. If you pass bowel movements regularly, it will reduce your need to strain.Regular bowel movements are a great indicator of overall good health.


Don't strain or push too hard. Let gravity help, but allow your bowels to do most of the work. If nothing happens, wait an hour or so and try again.
It may also help to place your feet on a small stool so that your knees are higher than your hips., Passing stools regularly is important when you have hemorrhoids. Avoid straining since this commonly causes hemorrhoids. Instead, choose a bulk laxative or stool softener to temporarily use. Bulk laxatives can soften your stools and reduce the pressure needed to pass the stool which will help the hemorrhoid start to shrink. While your stools should be regular because of the fiber in your diet, you can choose one of the following laxatives:Bulk laxatives: These contain fiber (usually psyllium) to increase the mass or weight of the stool, helping it move through the bowels.
Stool softeners: These soften the stools by adding moisture which should make them easier to pass. Most stool softeners contain docusate, which is what adds the moisture to soften the stool.
Lubricant laxatives: These lubricate the walls of the intestines and rectum, making the stool pass easier. Most lubricant laxatives contain mineral oil. They are usually safe when taken for short periods of time, but are not recommended for long-term use.
Avoid stimulant laxatives that include senna, cascara, aloe, or bisacodyl. They work by irritating the interior of the bowel, which is not helpful when you have hemorrhoids.

, The most common symptom of external hemorrhoids is bleeding and discomfort during a bowel movement. You may first notice external hemorrhoids when you clean yourself after using the restroom. A hemorrhoid will be a tender swelling around your anus often about the size and shape of a grape when it first appears. It can also be itchy and painful. Commonly, people notice blood on the toilet paper or in the toilet bowl.If you're unsure if you have internal or external hemorrhoids, consider what you can feel. You won’t usually feel internal hemorrhoids, but they can bulge through the anal opening. Typically internal hemorrhoids have few symptoms other than bleeding with bowel movements.

, Most external hemorrhoids go away or at least shrink within two to three days. If you still have hemorrhoids after three to five days, call your physician. You should also contact your doctor if the area is painful or bleeds. Your doctor can diagnose internal or external hemorrhoids by doing a rectal exam.If rectal bleeding is not caused by a hemorrhoid, your doctor will probably recommend a more extensive test called a sigmoidoscopy or a colonoscopy because one of the symptoms of colon cancer is rectal bleeding., If your hemorrhoids don't respond to basic home care or resolve on their own, your doctor may recommend a minimally invasive surgery. The most common approaches include:Ligation: A rubber band is tied around the base of the hemorrhoid to cut off blood flow.
Injection (sclerotherapy): A chemical solution designed to shrink the hemorrhoid is injected.
Cauterization: The hemorrhoid is burned away.
Hemorrhoidectomy: The hemorrhoid is surgically removed in this outpatient procedure (although it sometimes requires an overnight hospital stay).

Regardless of your preferred method, it is necessary to wash the irrigation device after each use and leave it open to air dry. You can flush each day routinely and may do it twice a day when you have an active infection.


To use a Neti Pot:

Dissolve a teaspoon of sea salt in 2 cups of warm water. The salt will help dissolve the mucus that is blocking the communicating path between the sinus and the nasal cavity.
Standing over a sink, fill the Neti Pot with one cup of water and place the tip of the spout into one nostril.
Tilt your head to the side and allow the water to run out through the opposite nostril. Careful not to tilt your head back and up or the water will reroute down your throat.
Refill the Neti Pot and repeat with the other nostril. Repeat 2 times each day. However, remember not to use this remedy for more than 2 weeks, as you can damage your nasal mucosa.;
, Some people find that inhaling steam can be very soothing in the management of acute sinusitis. One way to use steam treatment is to fill a bowl with steamy hot water. Then lean over the bowl in a comfortable position and drape a towel over the bowl and your head to keep the steam in. Relax and breathe in the steam for about ten minutes at a time. You can repeat this several times a day. Be careful not to scald your face by touching the water.


You can even run the shower and sit in the bathroom and breathe deeply. The steam vapors will help in reducing the congestion and swelling of the nasal passages.

, Place a warm, wet towel on your face to help in relieving some of the heaviness from your sinuses. If the area is heated, blood flow will increase, and the fluid inside the sinus cavity can be more easily drained.


Tiger warmer is one of the most commonly used remedies for sinus problems in Chinese medicine. The tiger warmer is a device used for heating an affected area. Use this Chinese device as often as you wish to help get rid of your sinus problems.

, The primary benefits of oregano are due to its carvacrol and rosmarinic acid content. Both compounds are natural decongestants and histamine reducers that can have direct, positive benefits on the respiratory tract and nasal passage airflow. Oregano can be used for cooking in dried as well as fresh form. A few drops of oregano oil in milk and juice can be taken each day for health benefits, too.


The volatile oils in oregano, namely Thymol and carvacol, have shown to inhibit growth of bacteria like staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa.These two types of bacteria are common culprits when it comes to sinus infections.

, The antiseptic properties of eucalyptus can help shrink the swollen tissues lining your nasal passages and sinuses. Eucalyptus is a common ingredient in cough lozenges and syrups and its effectiveness is due to a compound called cineole. You can also pour a few drops of oil in hot water and inhale the steam for relief from your sinus infection.


Cineole has numerous health benefits – it’s an expectorant, can ease a cough, fights congestion, and soothes irritated sinus passages. Eucalyptus oil has anti-inflammatory, anti-viral and anti-bacterial properties.Eucalyptus oil vapor acts as a decongestant when it is inhaled and hence, can be used in treatment of sinusitis as well.

, The grapefruit seed extract is a powerful antibiotic and is used to inhibit microbes, parasites, bacteria and viruses.It is also a very good anti-fungal and hence can be used in sinusitis that can be of any origin. Grapefruit seed extract is available in pill, powder and liquid form.The recommended dose of grapefruit seed extract for general health promoting purposes is 10 to 20 drops of liquid or 200 mg of powder or pills, three times daily. There are no serious adverse side effects reported from grapefruit seed extract, however it may interact with certain medications such as statin (blood thinning) drugs, so talk to your doctor before taking it.

, Thyme produces thymol, the powerful antiseptic oil which is classified as naturally antibiotic and anti-fungal.Thyme tea has the power to chase away and eliminate bacteria and viruses so whether your infection is based on either, it may work.


To help fight infection in your nose, sinuses and lungs, inhale thyme vapors. Bring a pot of water to a vigorous boil, then turn off the burner. Place a few drops of thyme oil in pot of steaming water, and wait for 5-10 minutes, or until the steam isn’t too hot. Cover your head with a towel, and inhale the vapors. However, be careful not to expose your skin to steam that is too hot.

, Thanks to a powerful compound found in turmeric known as curcumin, turmeric can heal the sinus cavity and clear the airways. Its ability to treat sinus infections is just one of its many benefits. Turmeric possesses anti-inflammatory properties, making it a great natural cure for sinus infection.Add a dash of turmeric to add some zest to your savory dishes. What's more, you can gargle it, too. Just a dash in a cup of hot water, stirred and dissolved, will do the trick.

, Horseradish contains volatile oils, notably mustard, which have anti-bacterial properties due to the presence of allyl isothiocyanate.Because of this, it can be used in cases of sinusitis caused by bacterial infection. Add it to your favorite dishes or use it as a dip to reap its benefits.


Horseradish encourages your body to get rid of mucus. One way a sinus infection starts is with the accumulation of thick mucus in the sinuses, which lays out the welcome mat for bacteria. Stagnant mucus is the perfect breeding ground for bacteria to multiply and cause a painful infection. Horseradish can help thin and move out older, thicker mucus accumulations; thin, watery mucus is easier to eliminate.

, Smoking, alcohol, and stress all can wreak havoc on your sinuses. Alcohol consumption can cause swelling of nasal and sinus membranes thereby resulting in sinus infection, smog can cause irritation in the sinus lining, which in turn results in poor drainage of mucus, and chronic stress affects your immune system opening the door for bad habits to lead to infections in your upper respiratory system. To stay healthy, cut them all out of your lifestyle.


To quit drinking and quit smoking, take it one step at a time. You don't want to tackle all of life's issues on top of going cold turkey. Baby steps will make it easier to quit and easier to stay on track.
When it comes to fighting stress, consider yoga, meditation, and deep breathing exercises. Just 15 minutes a day spent slowing down can work wonders on the rest of your entire day.

, Sinus infections are bad, but sleeping with a sinus infection is even worse. Here's a few things you can do to make the nights easier:Keep your room moistened as it helps to drain sinuses. Use a humidifier if need be.
Attach electrostatic filters to your air conditioning and heating equipment to eliminate allergens in the air.
Avoid extreme temperatures. While extreme dampness can make room for bacteria to thrive, a dry environment will trigger a prolonged sinus irritation.
Prop up your head while you sleep. Since mucus accumulates in the sinuses while the head is down at night, it is best to have your head propped up.

, Practically speaking, several poses are invaluable for relieving sinus pressure – namely, standing poses:


Sarvangasana (shoulder stand) and Ardha Halasana (Supported Half Plow Pose) are done on several rolled mats arranged from the shoulders to the elbows. These two poses should be held for some time to receive the full benefits. The sinuses may remain blocked at first; but after some time in the poses, as you relax, the sinuses usually open up, bringing relief.
Eka Pada Sarvangasana (Plow Pose with one leg up and one down) is also particularly good. The inversions act as a natural flushing mechanism for the blocked sinuses. The blood circulates with tremendous force into the stagnated areas, clearing away the secretions to clear the passageways and restore free breathing.
Other asanas like Child’s Pose (Balasana), Downward Facing Dog (Adho Mukha Svanasana) Standing Forward Fold (Uttanasana) and Rabbit Pose (Sasangasana) are also helpful in sinusitis. Practice Headstands only after the disorder is alleviated. At that point, regular practice of inversions helps keep the sinuses and respiratory tract healthy.

, Apple cider vinegar is thought to thin and eliminate mucus, making it easier for your body to get rid of. It possesses antimicrobial properties, which aid in killing bacteria.


At the first sign of infection combine 1-2 teaspoons of raw, unfiltered apple cider vinegar in 6 ounces of water, a teaspoon of raw honey or Stevia to sweeten and drink 3 times a day for 5 days.

, Peppermint, and peppermint oil, contains menthol – a soothing ingredient thought to relax the smooth muscles of the respiratory tract and promote free breathing. Many people use therapeutic chest balms and other inhalants that contain menthol to help break up congestion. Take a few drops of peppermint oil and olive oil. Mix them well and apply over the affected areas. Massage the oil in gently to alleviate your pain.


Menthol also acts as an expectorant providing temporary quick relief from nasal congestion and sinus pain. Peppermint is believed to have anti-bacterial, anti-viral and anti-inflammatory properties that purportedly make it so effective.

, Cayenne pepper is thought to break and flush the mucus out of your sinus cavities. It has capsaicin, a stimulant that promotes proper functioning of nasal passages. Dab a few pinches of this pepper powder in the affected nostril to reap its benefits. It's best to apply it before going to bed to make sleep easier to come by.


You can add it to your food, too, if your stomach and sinuses can tolerate spicy foods. However, it's more effective if it's directly in your nostrils.

, The anti-fungal and anti-bacterial properties of onion can aid in treating sinus infection as they put up a fight against bacteria and parasites. There are two ways to utilize its power:


Cut an onion into medium sized pieces and put them in a bowl. Inhale the smell from the onion until your eyes start watering and your nose starts running. This helps to flush out the mucus thereby relieving you of the infection.
Chop some onion to be boiled. Once boiling, take it off the stove. Let it cool down a bit and then inhale the vapor for a few minutes. You'll notice mucus starting to come out from your inner nostrils.

, The anti-viral and anti-fungal properties of garlic can help in treating sinusitis. Certain active components in garlic give it its pungent smell, which is particularly effective. Inhaling the odor may help to fight bacteria and fungi, which can cause sinus infections. Scordinin, a compound in garlic, is believed to enhance your body's immune power, which helps to keep infections in check.


Crush three cloves of garlic and add them to boiled water. Inhale the steam until you start feeling relief. The steam opens blocked sinuses and drains mucus. Do it twice or thrice a day for quicker results.

, Gingerol, an active component of ginger, is thought to help treat sinus infections. It acts as a decongestant and by warming up the nasal passage it can clear your blocked sinuses. Ginger tea is a good substitute if you don't have the raw variety on hand.


Crush an inch of ginger and add it to a cup of water. Keep the flame low and allow it to boil until the water size reduces by half. Filter it, add half spoon of honey to it and drink it for relief. You can have it twice a day until you are relieved of the condition.

, Probiotics are substances which can keep harmful bacteria under control.Probiotics are found in foods like pickles, yogurt, unpasteurized miso, and kimchi. Include these foods in your diet to help get the infection causing bacteria under control.


Pickles can be eaten as a side dish with a steak, for example. They're a very convenient food to pop in as a snack when you're on the go, too.
Eating a cup of yogurt with biscuits in the morning can make a great nutritious breakfast and will provide you the necessary amount of probiotics to fight off future infections.

, It stimulates the body into having a faster response to pathogens such as the bacteria causing your sinus infection. The best way in which you can get a fair amount of vitamin D is through sun exposure. A walk outside on a sunny day will do the trick.


Vitamin D isn't really found in food. You can take a supplement, but you may wish to talk to your doctor before doing so. Supplements aren't appropriate for everyone.

, If the cells suffer less damage, the body can fight infection a lot easier. Berries (all kinds), beans, kiwi, acai, apples, and pecans are all great sources of antioxidants.A great antioxidant is vitamin C. It's found in a lot of foods, like citrus fruits, lemons and peppers. It’s easy to incorporate these foods in your diet, too. You can use the juice from a lemon by adding it to your salad, for example, or add a bit of pepper to your soups, stews, or even sandwiches.

, Foods that are sources of vitamin A strengthen the immune system and prevent the onset of respiratory disorders. The best sources of vitamin A are generally found in vegetables, which are good for the rest of your health, too.The best vegetables for sinusitis include:Green leafy vegetables
Carrots
Beets
Spinach

, Some people may have a food allergy or food sensitivity that causes excess mucus production, or might even compromise their immune function, leaving them more susceptible to infectious agents. Could this be you? If you're unsure, an elimination diet is a good way to test yourself for food sensitivities.


With this method, you deliberately eliminate specific foods to see if your health improves when you don't eat those foods. After a specific period of avoidance (typically 7-14 days), you reintroduce the suspected food into your diet and see what symptoms, if any, you experience. If your sinusitis is an effect of allergy, you should be able to identify the allergen in this manner and get rid of it forever.

, It's important to be able to recognize a sinus infection versus other respiratory ailments. You likely have a sinus infection if you see the following symptoms:



Facial pain. When the sinuses become infected, their inner lining will start to swell and become inflamed. This will exercise pressure on the surrounding tissues, causing pain.

Nasal discharge. A discolored or thick inflammatory fluid may leak from your nose. The sinus has a communication path with the nasal cavity, so any fluid that is building up inside the sinus will drain itself through the nose.

Nasal stuffiness. Excess fluid from the sinuses draining through your nose will block the airways, causing stuffiness and difficulty in breathing.

Loss of smell. Because the airways are blocked with inflammatory fluid, fragrance molecules cannot reach the olfactory cells (specially designed cells, which send information regarding smell to the brain). This situation causes loss of smell.

, If you know what caused this ailment, you may be able to avoid it in the future. Here are the common causes of sinusitis:Viruses. The beginning of a sinus infection can be as common as a cold. A cold is usually caused by a virus, so an antibiotic treatment will have no effect. When suffering from a virus induced cold, the nasal tissue will swell due to inflammation and the communication between the sinus and the airways will be stopped. The sinus will be sealed, and mucus will start to build up inside. This is a great environment for viruses to multiply and cause an infection.

Allergies. An allergic reaction causes inflammation of the airways. When the nasal tissue becomes inflamed, sinus draining will be ceased, and mucus will accumulate inside the sinus, creating a great environment for infection.

Bacteria. Bacteria are another cause for infection. Studies show that bacteria rarely start a sinus infection, but they can complicate an existing condition or create any secondary infections.

Polyps. Polyps are benign growths that develop from sinus or nose tissue. They can block the sinuses and prevent proper drainage.

Fungi. One of the most common causes for sinus infection is fungi.This type of infection is common amongst people with a weak immune system. If your body’s defense mechanism is crippled, fungi can easily grow. The sinuses are perfect environments where fungi can thrive.

Anatomy. Having an abnormal airway passage can block the sinus openings, preventing proper mucus drainage. The mucus in the sinuses can then become contaminated with a bacterium or virus. The most common abnormality associated with a sinus infection and sinusitis is a deviated septum (the center section of your nose is shifted to either the left or the right side).

, In case your sinus infection doesn't go away naturally, you may wish to turn to medication. Here are your options:Antibiotics. Antibiotic treatment is necessary when a sinus infection is caused by a bacterium. One of the most common antibiotics used for treating bacterial sinus infections is amoxicillin. A dose consisting of 250 to 500 milligrams should be administered 3 times a day (once every 8 hours), for about a week or a week and a half. You can also administrate a larger dose, consisting of 500 to 875 milligrams a day, administered two times a day (once every 12 hours), for the same time period.Steroid nasal spray or drops. This type of medicine is usually prescribed in cases where your sinus infection is caused by an allergy. Steroid sprays reduce inflammation and swelling. The sinuses will be drained and the infection will be easily treated. A common type of steroid nasal spray is fluticasone propionate. You will start with an initial dose of 200 micrograms per day. You can administer the dose as 2 sprays in each nostril, every day. If the symptoms are diminished, you can reduce the dosage to 100 micrograms.

Confirm the diagnosis of a Bartholin cyst.If you have noticed a lump that is painful on one side of your vaginal opening, it may very well be a Bartholin cyst.,
Have Sitz baths several times each day.One of the mainstays of treatment for Bartholin cysts are regular Sitz baths.,
See your doctor if your Bartholin cyst does not resolve on its own.,
Take medication to ease the pain.While you are waiting for your Bartholin cyst to be treated and/or to heal, you may wish to consider pain medications to ease any discomfort you are experiencing in the area.,
Opt for surgical drainage.The most effective way to get rid of a persistent Bartholin cyst is via surgical drainage.,
Take antibiotics.If your Bartholin cyst appears to be infected, your doctor will prescribe you antibiotics following surgical drainage.,
Ask your doctor about ""marsupialization."",
Have your Bartholin gland completely removed.If you have a particularly bad cyst, or have had recurrent cysts, one of the ""last resort"" treatments is to have your Bartholin gland completely removed surgically, or removed via a laser procedure.,
Note that there is no known way to prevent a Bartholin cyst.While many people have asked if there are strategies to prevent (or reduce the risk of) a Bartholin cyst developing in the first place, doctors say that there are no known strategies for prevention.,
Continue with regular Sitz baths.After surgical drainage or a marsupialization procedure, it is key to continue with regular Sitz baths during the healing phase.,
Refrain from sexual intercourse until your catheter is removed.You may have a catheter for four to six weeks to keep your Bartholin cyst open and to prevent further fluid accumulation, following surgical drainage.,
Continue with pain medications as needed.You may use over-the-counter pain medications, such as Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) or Acetaminophen (Tylenol) as needed.",How to Get Rid of a Bartholin Cyst," You may experience pain while sitting or during sexual intercourse, or sometimes no pain at all, only swelling. If you suspect that you may have a Bartholin cyst, it is important to see your family doctor for a pelvic exam to confirm the diagnosis.


In addition to a pelvic exam, your doctor will likely test for STIs (sexually transmitted infections).
This is because, if you have an STI in conjunction with your Bartholin cyst, you are at higher risk of having your cyst become infected (and you will likely be given antibiotic treatment — more on this later).
If you are over 40 years old, your cyst may also be biopsied to rule out the possibility of cancer of the female reproductive system.;
, A Sitz bath is when you fill the bathtub with just enough water to cover your buttocks and vagina when you sit down in the water. The water does not need to be any deeper than that, although it can be, if you would like. (This depends on personal preference, and whether you are aiming to make the bath an enjoyable experience, or simply one of convenience.)


You should have a Sitz bath at least 3 to 4 times per day.
The purpose of regular Sitz baths is to keep the area around the Bartholin cyst clean, to reduce pain and/or discomfort in the area, and also to increase the chances of the cyst naturally draining itself.

, If your Bartholin cyst does not naturally drain itself and resolve with Sitz baths after several days, you may want to see your doctor to discuss the possibility of surgical drainage. The reason that it is important to discuss treatment options sooner rather than later is that, if the cyst does not resolve, it may become infected and form what is called an ""abscess.""This is more complicated to treat than a simple cyst, so it is best to be proactive.


If you are under 40 and you the cyst is asymptomatic (no pain, fever, etc.), then often no medical intervention is necessary.
If you notice signs of a fever alongside your Bartholin cyst, see your doctor for treatment.
To prevent your cyst from becoming infected, use condoms during sex, particularly if you are unsure whether your partner has an STI; however, it is not necessary to refrain from sex., You can purchase over-the-counter pain medications at your local pharmacy or drugstore. Some common choices include:


Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) 400 – 600 mg every four to six hours as needed.
Acetaminophen (Tylenol) 500 mg every four to six hours as needed.

, You can see your family doctor, who may do it themselves (if they are experienced with the procedure). Alternatively, they may refer you on to another physician to have the procedure performed.


Most cases of incision and drainage are outpatient procedures done in the doctor's office and only require local anesthetic.
An incision (opening) will be made in your cyst, allowing any fluid inside to drain out.
A catheter (tube) may be placed into the cyst for up to six weeks following the procedure. This is usually only done for cases of recurrent Bartholin cysts.
The purpose of the catheter is to keep the cyst open, so that any further fluid that accumulates can drain out immediately.
Keeping the cyst open prevents fluid buildup and, as such, allows the cyst to naturally heal.

, It is important to complete the full course of antibiotics, and to not miss taking any of the pills, as missing pills will lessen the effectiveness of the antibiotics.


Also, if you test positive for any STIs, you will receive antibiotics whether or not your cyst is currently infected.
The purpose to prevent an infection, as testing positive for STIs heightens your risk that your cyst may subsequently become infected.

, If your Bartholin cyst recurs, you can speak to your physician about a procedure called marsupialization. This is when the cyst is surgically drained, and then stitches are placed on either side of the cyst to hold it open following the procedure.This opening is permanent, and serves to prevent recurrences of the Bartholin cyst.
You will likely have a catheter (tube) in for a few days following the surgical procedure; however, after that, the catheter can be removed because the stitches will be strong enough to keep the incision open.

, Both of these are simple procedures that do not require an overnight hospital stay.

, Doctors do recommend that you begin treatment — either home treatment or medical treatment — as quickly as possible once you notice a cyst developing.

, Again, this is to ensure that the area remains clean, and to maximize healing while minimizing the risk of infection.


Sitz baths are advised beginning one to two days following the surgical procedure.

, For as long as the catheter remains in, it is key to refrain from sexual intercourse.


Abstaining from sex for that time period will also help to prevent your cyst from becoming infected.
After marsupialization, even though there is no catheter, you will be advised to refrain from sex for four weeks following the procedure to ensure full healing.

, Alternatively, if your pain is more severe, you may ask your doctor for prescription strength pain medications (narcotics) such as Morphine in the initial stages of recovery.

Ice your bruise immediately after the injury.,
Elevate the bruised area.,
Use Vick's Vapor Rub to help blood leave the area.,
Rest after the injury.",How to Get Rid of Bruises Fast1," Putting something cold on the bruise will reduce swelling and bruising when applied quickly. Fill a bag with ice and cover it with a thin towel, then apply to the bruised area. Put ice on the area for 20 minutes every hour for the first 3-5 hours after the injury.


You can also use bag of frozen vegetables like corn or peas. Wrap the bag in a towel or T-shirt, and lay it over the bruise.
Flexible gel-filled ice packs, specifically designed for injuries, are available from sports shops. Athletes usually keep a few on-hand to fight bruises.
As always, do not use ice directly on bare skin or for more than 20 minutes at a time to avoid further damage to tissues.
If the bruise is already 2-3 days old then ice still may help with the healing, but not as much in the size of the bruise.;
, Reduce blood flow to the area with gravity's help. Lifting the bruised area so that it's above your heart will prevent blood from pooling in the bruised area, and reduce discoloration.


If the bruise is on your leg, settle onto the couch and rest your leg on top of a few pillows. If your leg is even a few inches above your heart, you're good.
If your arm is bruised, try to prop it up on an armrest or a few pillows, so that it's at heart-level or above.
If your torso is bruised, you might be out of luck. Focus on icing the area instead.

, Applying the Vick's salve to the area will cause the blood to transfer deeper into the tissue to where it will not be as visible at the surface. It works better if applied immediately after the injury.

, If you continue exercising and moving, you increase your heart rate and pump more damaged blood to your bruise, causing it to get bigger. Let your body heal itself, and the bruise will disappear more quickly. Call it a day and cool off to prevent further injury and give your bruise a chance to heal.


Hang out on the couch. Watch a movie, play a game, read a book — do something that doesn't require much physical activity.
Head to bed early. Your body needs sleep to repair itself, so hit the hay as soon as you feel tired.

Understand the different kinds of boils.,
If you're unsure of the medical reason behind your boil or lesion, consult a doctor.,
Use heat to treat the boil.,
Do not drain, lance, or pop the boil if it is still small and firm.,
Only pop the boil if it becomes soft and develops a visible pustule (optional).Again, most boils can be drained without popping, as popping is disruptive to the skin and inflammatory.,
For larger boils, consult a doctor.",How to Get Rid of Boils," A boil, or abscess, is a collection of pus that forms under the skin, although not all boils are made the same. Boils exist in four main forms.


A furuncle or carbuncle. A furuncle is primarily caused by the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, and refers to a boil that occurs inside a hair follicle.A carbuncle is usually bigger than a furuncle because it involves multiple hair follicles. Carbuncles may feel hard inside the skin.
An acne cyst. Cystic acne occurs when the oil ducts underneath the skin get clogged and infected, resulting in abscesses that are much bigger than common acne.A hidradenitis suppurativa. This condition involves multiple abscesses forming in the armpit or groin area, caused by infected sweat glands. Typically not treatable by antibiotics alone, hidradenitis suppurativa often requires surgery.A pilonidal cyst. This boil forms in the crease of buttocks, often after prolonged sitting. A hair follicle becomes infected and inflamed, soon resulting in a tender, firm boil.;
, If you're not totally sure that what you're dealing with is a boil, make an appointment to see your doctor. Self-diagnosing a cold can be dangerous; self-diagnosing a more serious medical condition can have adverse consequences.

, Applying heat to the boil will increase the circulation of blood and help activate the body's immune response, bringing antibodies and white blood cells to the infection.Use a hot pack. Purchase a hot pack that is microwavable or relies on a chemical reaction. Alternately, use a hot water bottle to apply heat to boil for intervals of 10 to 20 minutes every couple of hours.
Use a hot, moist compress (hot soak) to apply heat to the boil. Hot soaks are effective because they promote efficient drainage of the infected tissue if needed, as well as help send oxygen, nutrients, and white blood cells over to the infection., Most boils will drain on their own with the help of hot soaks. Draining and popping boils can lead to prolonged infection, inflammation, and scarring.

, Sometimes, however, popping is necessary when the boil has ""formed a head,"" meaning that the pus at the top of the boil is visible., Often, larger boils contain multiple small pockets of pus that will need to be lanced by a licensed medical professional.


Your doctor will also be able to prescribe a course of oral antibiotics to be taken in combination with lancing. Antibiotics will treat the underlying infection, although antibiotics alone often do not completely treat boils.

Opt for real foods for the bulk of your diet.,
Eat more fish to get Omega-3 fatty acids.,
Increase your iron intake.,
Make sure you get calcium.,
Go for pain safe foods during flare ups.,
Talk to your doctor about dietary supplements.,
Eat a variety of fruits and vegetables.,
Get more beans into your diet.,
Opt for broccoli.,
Eat fiber rich foods.,
Drink alcohol in moderation only.,
Limit saturated fat.,
Cut back on salt.,
Stay away from sugary foods.,
Eliminate coffee from your diet.",How to Eat when You Have Rheumatoid Arthritis," There are a variety of vital nutrients you need to reduce the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. Many people take dietary supplement, like fish oil pills, to gain essential nutrients. However, the effectiveness of substitutes is unclear. You should get your nutrition primarily from real foods rather than supplements and oils.You do not have to unnecessarily complicate a diet plan for rheumatoid arthritis. A healthy overall diet will help you get you the nutrients you need.
Stick to a variety of whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and healthy proteins.;
, Omega-3 fatty acids can help ease the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis by reducing inflammation and pain. They are also good for your health overall. Strive to eat fish for a few meals a week. You may notice a reduction in symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. The following fish are particularly good sources of Omega-3 fatty acids:Anchovies
Salmon
Sardines
Eel
Tuna
Trout
Mackerel
Herring
Whitebait

, Many people with arthritis develop issues with anemia (the inability to incorporate iron into your blood) due to certain chronic diseases. Upping your iron intake can help offset anemia, so strive to get a variety of iron rich foods into your diet. If you decide to take an iron supplement, then you may also need to take a stool softener because iron supplements can cause constipation. The following foods are rich in iron:Dark green vegetables such as spinach and kale
Red meat
Lentils
Haricot beans

, Calcium strengthens bones, which can help reduce symptoms of arthritis. You are at a greater risk for developing osteoporosis if you have arthritis, and a calcium-rich diet can help reduce your risk.Low-fat dairy products such as low-fat milk, yogurt, and cheese can be a great source of calcium.
Calcium-enriched milks, including non-dairy milks like soy milk, can be an excellent source of calcium.
Fish eaten with the bones still intact, like sardines, can also help you get more calcium. In addition to providing calcium, you can also get more Omega-3 fatty acids with such fish.
Osteoporosis of the hip or spine is common in arthritis.

, Certain foods have not been shown to increase symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. If you experience an arthritis flare up, you should opt for these foods until your pain passes. This will prevent your diet from worsening arthritis pain. The following should be safe to eat during a flare-up:Brown rice
Cooked and dry fruits
Cooked vegetables, such as artichoke, broccoli, chards, asparagus, collards, sweet potatoes, and spinach

, If you're still experiencing arthritis pain after adjusting your diet, supplements may help. However, you should never simply start taking supplements on your own. Without medical testing, you will not know if you have vitamin deficiencies. You also want to make sure vitamins do not interfere with any existing medication.If you want to try supplements, make an appointment with your doctor. Your doctor may want to run blood tests to see if supplements would help you.
You should also ask your doctor any questions you have about when and how to take dietary supplements.
You may want to take fish oil, omega-3 fatty acids, calcium, or iron supplements.

, Fruits and vegetables are great for your overall health. A healthy diet overall can reduce the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, so work on incorporating a lot of fruits and vegetables into your diet.Strive to have at least 1 1/2 to 2 cups of fruits for each meal, as well as 2 to 3 cups of vegetables.
Another idea is to fill half of your plate with vegetables at each meal.
The antioxidants in fruits and vegetables greatly help the immune system. As rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease, plenty of fruits and vegetables can help counteract its effects.

, Beans also have antioxidants. In addition to this, they have anti-inflammatory compounds. Try to eat a variety of beans in your diet. They are also heart healthy overall, so they can improve your health in addition to fighting arthritis pain.As beans are a good source of protein, try swapping out the meat in some meals for something like black beans. For example, have a black bean burrito for lunch instead of a chicken burrito. This is an excellent, low-fat healthy alternative.

, Broccoli may slow the progress of arthritis, so incorporating broccoli into your meals is a good idea. Opt for broccoli as your serving of vegetables for a meal. Add broccoli to salads, casseroles, and stir-fries. When eating out, see if steamed or boiled broccoli is an option for a side dish., High fiber foods can be helpful for your overall diet. For best results, get fiber from real foods over supplements.The following foods are rich in fiber:Fruits like raspberries, pears, apples, and oranges.
Grains like whole wheat pasta, barley, oatmeal, and whole wheat bread.
Legumes, like lentils, black beans, and split peas.
Vegetables such as broccoli, artichokes, Brussels sprouts, and potatoes.

, If you drink at all, stick to only a couple of drinks a day. This is especially important if you're taking medications that interact with alcohol. While some studies indicate red wine has anti-inflammatory properties, alcohol has a negative overall effect on arthritis so do not attempt to use red wine to treat your pain.Talk to your doctor about alcohol consumption for you. In some cases, you may need to eliminate alcohol altogether.

, Saturated fat is found in foods like meat, butter, and cheese. It can raise cholesterol levels, increasing your risk for heart disease. As people with arthritis are already at risk for developing heart disease, you should limit saturated fat in your diet.On a 2,000 calorie a day diet, you should not have more than 20 grams (0.71 oz) of saturated fat. However, you may need less than that depending on your current health. Talk to your doctor about a safe level of saturated fat for you.
Try to consume meats, cheeses, butter, and other foods loaded in saturated fat in moderation. Fast foods and processed foods tend to be high in saturated fat.

, Sat causes your body to retain more water, which may affect arthritis. Work on lowering the overall amount of salt in your diet. Keep in mind, salt is added to many foods. Just staying away from the salt shaker may not adequately lower your consumption of salt.Read foods labels carefully. Avoid foods that are very high in sodium. When possible, go for no-sodium or low-sodium foods.
When seasoning foods, rely more on herbs and spices than salt.
Do not eat out too much, as restaurant foods are often high in added salt.

, Foods high in sugar are bad for your overall health and can also lead to weight gain. Weight can put extra strain on your joints, making arthritis worse.Go for artificial, calorie-free sweeteners when possible.
You can also try things like maple syrup and agave nectar. While you should not overdo it on such sweeteners, as they are high in calories, they also contain certain nutrients that can help your overall health.
Read nutritional labels at the store, even for products like bread and pasta. Such products are often surprisingly high in added sugars.
Incorporate more zero calorie drinks instead of high calorie sugary drinks.

, Coffee can be a major trigger for arthritis pain. Try to wean yourself off coffee if you have arthritis. This can help reduce symptoms.As it can be hard to quit coffee cold turkey, try reducing your coffee intake by about 1/4 a cup a day until you eliminate it from your diet."

Protect your eye during any ""at-risk"" activities.As your black eye heals (which normally takes one to two weeks in total), you will want to ensure that you wear glasses or other protective gear if you find yourself in any situation that could potentially cause further damage to your eye.,
Check for additional damage.",How to Get Rid of a Black Eye1," Apply a cold compress, washcloth filled with ice, or a bag of frozen vegetables to the swollen area in 10-minute intervals.Apply the ice pack for approximately 20 minutes every hour during the first couple days of healing.


Begin this treatment immediately and continue it for 24 to 48 hours.Press on the skin around the eye, not on the eye itself.
Make sure you wrap the ice pack in a towel or cloth. Applying ice directly to your skin can cause skin damage and frostbite.;
, Acetaminophen (Tylenol) is generally considered to be the best option. Ibuprofen (Advil) works too, depending upon which you have available. Both are available for purchase over-the-counter at your local pharmacy or drugstore.


Aspirin should be avoided since it decreases the blood's clotting ability.Follow the instructions on the label when taking the medication. Usually, you will need to take two pills every four to six hours.
Do not take more than 4 grams total of any combination of ibuprofen and acetaminophen in a 24hr period in order to avoid liver damage.

, If this is the case for you, and if it is challenging to open your eye, there is no need to force it open unnecessarily. As long as you have ruled out that it is nothing more serious than a black eye (that there are no other medical concerns), there is no problem with keeping your injured eye shut if it is painful to open.

, Or, if you injured your eye during sports, refrain from participating in this sport until your eye has fully healed.

, A black eye is bad enough, but not necessarily serious on its own. If accompanied by other eye injuries, however, you will need to seek professional medical care as soon as possible. You may have suffered severe damage to your eyes or a severe head injury.


Look closely at the white portion and colored iris of your eye. If you see any blood in these spots, you could have injured your eye in a critical way. Schedule an urgent appointment with an ophthalmologist.[
If you have vision problems like blurring, double vision, or an increased sensitivity to light, you should also contact an eye specialist.
Other signs of potentially critical damage include severe pain when moving the eye, severe headache, numbness of the face, swelling or depression of the eye or eye socket, nosebleeds, and/or dizziness.

Use an herbal compress.,
Look for over-the-counter creams made to reduce darkness around the eyes.,
Apply vitamin C and vinegar to your bruise.,
Conceal a bruise with makeup.,
Know when to see a doctor.",How to Get Rid of Bruises Fast2," Lightly massage the bruise and the area around it and it will get the blood flowing, in return, get the bruise to fade. Healthy blood carries chemicals that will clean up your bruise, so stimulate blood flow to get rid of it quickly. Be gentle -- you do not need to cause pain, just stimulation to encourage blood flow.


Try using a toothbrush or comb to massage the bruise. Take a stiff, unused toothbrush and just gently massage the bruise with a circular motions.
Massage your bruise with a rice-filled sock: Fill a clean sock with 3-4 cups of uncooked rice and microwave for 1-2 minutes or until it is warm to the touch. Now press the sock firmly against the bruise, massaging it with heat and gentle motions to stimulate blood flow.

, These can make your blood ""thinner"" and increase the tendency to bleed into injured tissues. You should never stop taking a prescription medication without first checking with your physician, however


Take acetaminophen or ibuprofen for pain relief instead of aspirin. Read the label for the recommended dose.

, Using a compress soaked in an infusion (like a tea) of Arnica, Daisy (like the ones you see in your backyard), or Comfrey, and Witch Hazel can help the bruise heal faster.


Pour boiling water over the loose leaves/flowers and let steep for about 5-10 minutes. Dip the compress (small towel, piece of cloth, or cotton) in the infusion and gently wring it out. Add some Witch Hazel. You can even place some of the leaves/flowers between the folds of the compress.
Hold it on the bruise or secure it with a loose bandage, scarf, bandana, etc. Keep it on for as long as you can, resoaking & gently wringing it out as often as necessary.
If you do not have any Arnica, Daisy, or Comfrey available, using plain Witch Hazel also works, just not as fast.

, Vitamin K is known to help reduce bruising when applied topically or taken orally. Vitamin K is a known requirement for proper blood clotting.


Check with your physician before taking any oral medication. Not all people can absorb Vitamin K, and frequent easy bruising should be evaluated by a physician.

, Vinegar kills bacteria and increases blood flow to the skin's surface. Crush several vitamin c pills and add enough white vinegar to make a thin paste. Apply to your bruise like you would apply regular skin lotion.

, This method doesn't get rid of bruises, but it does make for a quick cover up. You will need a yellow concealer (to correct the purple parts of the bruise), a green concealer (to correct the red parts of the bruise), regular concealer (optional), and foundation. First, apply the yellow concealer directly on the bruise and pat it on gently. Now pat on the green concealer around the edges of the bruise to correct the redness. Once that's all done, you can either apply regular concealer and/or foundation to it to give your skin a natural look.

, Any bruise you cannot account for, any bruise that is weeping or seeping fluid, any very large or extensive bruise should be seen by a physician. These can be indicators of a more serious or life-threatening condition.

Avoid putting pressure on the eye or causing more damage.,
Switch to moist heat after 24 to 48 hours.After a day or two of using an ice pack to soothe the swelling, you should switch tactics and begin applying moist heat to the injured area.,
Call a doctor if the damage worsens or does not fade.",How to Get Rid of a Black Eye2," The damaged area will be sensitive until the discoloration fades. Putting pressure on the eye can make it hurt more, but it can also aggravate the damaged blood vessels beneath the skin, causing a worse or prolonged injury.


Before you get the swelling to calm down, you should also avoid forcing your eye to stay open for a prolonged period of time.

,


Hold a warm, moistened washcloth or compress against the affected area. Do not use a heating pad, since this provides dry heat and can actually be too hot, thereby causing more damage to the sensitive skin of your face.
Apply the warm compress in 10-minute intervals, each of which should be separated by a period of rest lasting no less than 10 minutes each.
Do not apply the warm compress directly to the eye. Only apply it to the skin around the eye.
Warm compresses promote an increased amount of circulation to the damaged blood vessels. This allows pooled blood trapped below the surface of your skin to be re-absorbed, which can speed up the healing process.

, Your black eye should fade significantly after a week and a half or so. If it has not faded much within that time frame, call your general practitioner and schedule an appointment.


Black eyes tend to look worse before they get better, so don't be alarmed if your eye looks worse during the first few days following the injury. If you have any reason to suspect there is still bleeding, however, then you should see your doctor right away.

Wait until the swelling goes down.Immediately after you receive the injury, your first priority should be to begin the healing process.,
Choose a corrective concealer.,
Follow with your normal concealer.Once the corrective concealer has dried, use a normal concealer that matches your skin tone over it.,
Apply additional make-up only as desired.",How to Get Rid of a Black Eye3," Applying makeup to the black eye while it is still swollen could irritate the skin and cause skin redness.


Additionally, the cosmetics used to conceal your black eye are likely to wear off as you apply cold packs to the injured area, making application prior to treatment fairly pointless.
Wait until you have entered the warm compress stage of treatment before applying any makeup to the injured area, and apply makeup as little as possible. If you feel you need to cover your eye when you need to leave the house or if you are having people over, that's okay, but when you're just at home on your own, you should avoid applying makeup.

, For best results, use a liquid corrective concealer in a yellow or green shade.Liquid corrective concealers are easier to apply and blend than most creams and require the use of less pressure on the skin.


You must use a corrective concealer first before using a standard concealer if you wish to disguise the black eye. Standard concealers match the tone of your skin and can only blend uneven tones together. Corrective concealers rely on the principle of complementary colors to correct discolored portions of skin.
A yellow concealer generally works best for a black eye in its early stages, when it appears to have deep purple undertones. As the black eye lightens and takes on more red tones or yellow-brown tones, you may need to switch to a green corrective concealer.
Apply the corrective concealer with your fingers. Use your fingers to dab specks of corrective concealer all around the blackened area of your skin. Use light pressure to gently and carefully blend the concealer into your skin, covering the entire damaged area.

, A normal concealer can blend any uneven shading caused by the corrective concealer.








, The two concealers should be enough to hide your black eye without any additional make-up. If you want to continue with your standard make-up routine, however, you can do so.

Don’t be surprised if your doctor expresses some skepticism about the benefits of your fast. She will most likely recommend you just drink more fluids and improve your diet to achieve lasting kidney-health.


If you have diagnosed kidney problems, your doctor may prescribe a diet for you in cooperation with a dietitian.A kidney cleansing fast can affect medication absorption, so do not fast if you are taking any medication.;
, If you want to go on a kidney cleansing fast, the safest way to do it is just to increase the amount of water you drink. Try to drink at least eight glasses of water a day to help keep your kidneys healthy. If you do opt for a kidney cleansing fast, make sure you continue to drink plenty of water., Help out your kidneys by cutting out refined and high-sodium foods. Refined carbohydrates that you should try to limit include: sweets, chocolate, cake, biscuits, and sugary drinks.Other refined foods are white breads and pasta.A detox diet that cuts out all highly processed foods can make you feel better in the short-term.
For a long-term solution, opt for a balanced diet., If you want a short-term method that may help cleanse your kidneys, you can attempt a fluid-only fast. One method claims that consuming three gallons of apple juice and three gallons of distilled water a day can help cleanse your kidneys and pass kidney stones.Apples are a good choice to help keep your kidneys healthy.
Apples can help lower cholesterol and glucose levels, and are good source of vitamin C. The peel is also a good source of antioxidants.Be aware that bought apple juice often contains a lot of sugar.

,
You are also recommended to drink a laxative tea every morning.There is, however, no scientific evidence that such cleanses are a good approach to better sustainable health., Another fasting technique cited by some as a way to cleanse your kidney involves consuming a lot of watermelon. You can buy between 20 and 100 lbs of watermelon and then try to eat it throughout the day, while regularly emptying your bladder.If you have chronic kidney problems you should avoid this method due to the high levels of potassium in watermelon.
You should not have more than a cup of watermelon a day if you have chronic kidney disease.Watermelons are around 92% water, so this fast is similar to just drinking a lot of water.
Too much watermelon can cause health problems, so talk to your doctor first., An alternative to the “lemonade diet” is a drinking a specially made herbal tea. This tea involves soaking a quarter cup of hydrangea root, gavel root and marshmallow root in ten cups of cold water. Leave it overnight and then add some boiled parsley, before bringing the whole mixture to boil and allowing it to simmer for 20 minutes.


Once it has cooled, drink a quarter cup and then put the rest in containers.
Each morning pour ¾ cup of the mixture and half a cup of water into a large mug.
Add 20 drops to goldenrod tincture and a tablespoon of glycerine.
Drink this throughout the day, but stop if you have stomach pains."

Drink lots of water.,
Have a healthy diet.,
Cut down on salty and fatty foods.,
Avoid smoking and alcohol.,
Have an active lifestyle.",How to Do a Kidney Cleansing Fast2," You will help your kidneys function effectively, and cleanse the toxins from your body naturally, by drinking plenty of fluids. In general you should aim to drink at least 8 glasses of water a day, but in hot weather you may need to drink more to make up for the fluid you lose through sweat.


Monitor the colour of your urine to judge if you should be drinking more water.
Your urine should be the colour of straw. If it is darker, you may be dehydrated and need to drink more.Drinking plenty of water throughout the day will lessen your risk of developing kidney stones., A healthy balanced diet will help you maintain good kidney-health, which in turn will help your body cleanse itself of toxins naturally. A healthy diet should include plenty of fruit, vegetables and whole grains in order to ensure you get all the vitamins and minerals your body needs. Use the myplate tool to evaluate and plan your diet: http://www.choosemyplate.gov/MyPlate.


Some of the best foods for the health of your kidneys include apples, blueberries and strawberries.
Try to include some kale, and spinach in your diet. Sweet potato is another kidney-friendly vegetable.
Fish that is high in omega 3 – fatty acids are good for your kidneys. Try to include some salmon, mackerel, herring and sardines in your diet., Lowering the amount of salty and fatty food you consume can help your kidneys to function more effectively. Buying fresh food more often than pre-prepared food can help you dramatically lower the amount of salt in your diet. Packaged foods often come with high levels of salt already included, but if you cook your own food you can control and lower the salt levels.


Look on food labels for phrases like “sodium free,” “salt free,” “no salt added,” or “lightly salted.”
Use herbs for flavour, rather than salt.
Be sure to thoroughly rinse all canned beans, meats, vegetables and fish before you eat them., Smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol can both be very damaging for your kidneys. Try to stop smoking completely, and limit your alcohol consumption to not more than two small drinks a day for a man, or one for a woman.


Smoking and drinking can both raise your blood pressure.
High blood pressure is one of the most common causes of kidney disease.You should visit your doctor to have your blood pressure checked at lease every five years., You should always couple a healthy diet with an active lifestyle. Being overweight will increase your blood pressure and can contribute to problems with your kidneys. In general, you should aim for at least around 150 minutes of exercise a week. This can include everything from running, cycling and swimming, to team sports and visiting the gym.Work out your BMI and use this to find out if you are at a healthy weight.

Take muscle relaxants.",How to Ease Multiple Sclerosis Symptoms Using Cool Temperatures," Consider whether or not your symptoms get worse during hot or humid weather. Your symptoms may even get worse if your house gets too hot or if you run a fever. For example, if you realize that the numbness and tingling in your arms gets worse when you don't run your air conditioner, you would probably benefit from cool temperature therapy.Your response to heat might even be the first sign of MS you experience. The standard diagnostic test for MS used to be checking a person for symptoms after immersing the person in a tub of hot water.;
, Extreme swings in temperature can also make your symptoms worse. Try not to go from a hot environment into a very cold one or you may feel worse. Instead, try to ease yourself into more comfortable temperatures.


If your symptoms get worse because of the heat, understand that it's usually temporary and doesn't mean that your MS is getting worse.

, If you can, rest in an air-conditioned or cooled room. Keep the blinds or curtains down to keep out the heat and run an oscillating fan to keep you cool. You can also hold a hand-held fan to direct cooling air directly onto you. If you don't have air conditioning, go to a cooled public space like a library or mall.


If you have to drive in the heat, start the car and let the air conditioner run before you need to drive anywhere. Don't forget to put a sunshade in the windshield when you park the car. This can keep your car from getting too hot.

, Choose clothes made of natural fibers that can wick away sweat and help your skin breathe, keeping you cooler. Wear loose layers of clothing that are light-colored. This way, you can easily adjust your clothing if your environment is too hot.You can also wear cooling products that have pre-cooled gels inside. Try using cooling neck wraps, bandanas, or wrist and ankle wraps. These are especially helpful when you exercise.

, If you have MS, exercise is encouraged and can help you manage your symptoms, but you should make sure not to overdo it. While you're exercising, pay attention to any worsening of your symptoms. If you start feeling worse, you need to take a break and consider trying a different exercise. Good exercises include swimming, stretching, walking, and gardening exercises.Try to work out in a temperature-controlled gym, especially if it's hot outside.

, If it's hot outside, eating and drinking cold foods and beverages can help you cool down. Keep cool or cold drinks nearby and remember to stay hydrated. You should also try to stay out of a hot kitchen. Instead, prepare and snack on cool foods like:Frozen yogurt, ice cream, or popsicles
Ice chips
Salads
Cold soups
Smoothies
Frozen berries

, Run a cool shower or bath and stay in it until you begin to feel your entire body cool down. Avoid running a cold shower or bath since the extreme temperature change could shock you. To keep you cool once you get out of the shower, fill a spray bottle with ice cubes and spritz it on your face, skin, and clothing.Keep damp sweat bands in the refrigerator or freezer and put these on your wrists, ankles and head to keep you cool.

, Your doctor may recommend medications to relieve symptoms and help you recover from attacks. For example, if you suffer from nerve inflammation, you may be prescribed corticosteroids like prednisone. Medications that have a higher risk of side effects (like beta-interferons, glatiramer, dimethyl fumarate and others) can work to block your immune system. Always follow your doctor's treatment recommendations.Be sure to talk with your doctor about any symptoms or problems you're having. It's not uncommon for people with neurological problems to develop depression. Your doctor may prescribe antidepressants., If your symptoms don't respond to common treatments like corticosteroids, your doctor may recommend plasmapheresis. This procedure removes whole blood, removes and replaces the plasma with a protein solution, and returns the whole blood back into you.Plasmapheresis is usually only done if your symptoms are new and severe. The procedure is only done for a short period of time.

, If you experience muscle weakness, trouble walking, or muscle spasms, your doctor may recommend that you work with a physical or occupational therapist. The therapist will teach you stretches and help you practice with mobility devices if you have trouble walking.In addition to stretches, the therapist will help you work on your gait and try to prevent the loss of muscle strength.
Physical therapy can also be helpful if you have bladder problems caused by weakened pelvic muscles.

, A common symptom of MS is spasticity which is muscle stiffness or spasms. Your doctor might prescribe muscle relaxants like baclofen and tizanidine which both have good safety records although they can't restore muscle strength or completely cure muscle spasms.You should avoid sudden jerky movements, extreme temperature shifts, and wearing tight clothing which can all trigger muscle spasms.

Wait for skin to heal.",How to Diagnose Scabies," Scabies is caused by a microscopic mite. The female Sarcoptes scabiei burrows into the skin and lays eggs, which ultimately hatch mite larvae. These tiny mites then work their way to the surface of your skin and can spread to other areas of your body or that of others.Scabies is most often spread by close physical contact.There are different types of scabies mite that affects dogs, cats, and humans. It is uncommon to get scabies from other species, as each type of scabies mite prefers one host.;
, Certain people may be more likely to contract or have a recurrence of scabies. Being aware of your risk factor may make it easier to identify and get treatment, as well as prevent outbreaks.The following groups are particularly susceptible to scabies:Children
Mothers of small children
Sexually active young adults
Residents of nursing homes, assisted living facilities, or extended-care facilities
Persons with weakened immune systems
Persons who have received organ transplants, Once you’ve come in contact with a scabies mite, it can take anywhere from one day to six weeks to develop a reaction. People who have had scabies previously generally take less time to see a reaction, while those who have never had scabies often see a reaction only weeks later.The most common signs and symptoms of of scabies include:Itching, mostly in the evening
Rash, which is often in a line on the skin and can look like hives or tiny bites
Sores, which are often a result of scratching from the mites
Thick crusts on the skin, which are a sign of Norwegian scabies, a severe form of the condition.

, Scabies can occur on any part of your body, but there are certain areas that they are more likely found. Scabies burrows or tracks are typically found in the folds of skin:Between fingers
In armpits
Around the waist
Along the inner arm, especially the wrist and elbow
On the bottoms of feet
Near the breasts
Near male genitalia
On the buttocks
On knees
Around the shoulder blades

, Infants and young children are especially susceptible to scabies, in particular if they visit daycare or go to school. In infants and young children, the most common areas on which to find scabies are the:Scalp
Face
Neck
Palms of the hands
Soles of the feet

, Because there is no over-the-counter cure for scabies, it is important to see your doctor as soon as you notice symptoms or suspect you’ve been exposed to scabies. This can help ensure you get treatment and may help prevent spreading the mites on your skin or to others.Don’t leave scabies untreated. Doing so can result in Norwegian scabies or skin infections such as impetigo. Norwegian scabies, in particular, can spread to large areas of the body and be difficult to treat., If you’ve identified symptoms of scabies or know that you’ve been exposed, schedule an appointment with your doctor. They will likely ask you a series of questions. Being prepared for your appointment can help them rule out possible other conditions.


Take a list of any signs or symptoms you’ve notice and for how long.
Tell your doctor about possible and definite exposure you’ve had to scabies.
If your doctor diagnoses you or another family member with scabies, they’ll likely want to examine other members of the household, even if they don’t have any symptoms of scabies., Your doctor will examine your skin for typical signs of scabies including burrows or rashes. They may be able to definitively diagnose scabies simply by looking at your skin.Show your doctor any areas of your body that may be causing you discomfort or on which you’ve spotted the symptoms of scabies.

, In some cases, your doctor may take a small scraping from a suspect area of your skin following your skin examination. They can then analyze it under a microscope to see if any mites are present, giving you a definitive diagnosis.Your doctor doesn’t need a large sample of your skin. They may scrape off the cells with a scalpel or other instrument. This may cause minor discomfort, but will not last for long.

, Once you have a definitive diagnosis, your doctor will likely prescribe a lotion or cream to treat the scabies. These preparations can cure most cases of scabies, especially if you follow your doctor’s orders. Most of the skin preparations are applied at bedtime and washed off in the morning, and some may require a follow up treatment one week later.Your doctor may prescribe one of the following medicated creams and lotions:5% permethrin cream, which is the most common treatment for scabies
25% benzyl benzoate lotion
10% sulfur lotion
10% crotamiton cream
1% lindane lotion

, In cases of widespread and Norwegian scabies, you may require stronger medication than a topical cream or lotion. Your doctor may prescribe ivermectin to treat a severe case of scabies.You may only require one dose of ivermectin to treat your scabies, though some patients may need two to three doses.Make sure to follow your doctor’s orders when taking ivermectin.

, In addition to medications, you may need other treatments to manage other symptoms or infections. Your doctor may suggest one or more of the following to help manage your symptoms and alleviate any discomfort:An antihistamine, which can help control itching and related insomnia
Pramoxine lotion, which can help control itching
An antibiotic cream or pill, to kill any infection
A steroid cream, to relieve any itching, redness, and inflammation
A cool bath or compresses to minimize itching

, Mites can survive without human skin for 24 to 36 hours. Washing your clothes, beddings, towels, and washcloths can prevent recurrence in your or scabies from spreading to others.Wash all items in a washing machine and use the hottest water you can.Dry everything in a dryer on the hottest possible setting.Dry clean anything you can’t wash or seal the items in a plastic bag for at least a week to starve the mites.In general, you do not need to wash anything that hasn’t touched your skin., On the day that you start treatment, vacuum your entire home. This can capture any mites that may be lingering in fabrics that you can’t wash and prevent recurrence or spreading the mites.Make sure to throw away the vacuum bag when you are finished and clean the canister with hot, soapy water., Getting medical treatment can kill mites, alleviate symptoms, and heal any infections that have developed. Your skin should heal within four weeks.You may notice that the itching and rash worsen the first few days of treatment.It some cases, people need multiple treatments to cure scabies. Contact your doctor if you continue to have symptoms after four weeks."

If you have had a fairly regular period and it changes, then those changes could be caused by uterine fibroids. However, these symptoms may signal other health problems as well. Symptoms that might indicate uterine fibroids include:Excessive bleeding during menstruation
Severe menstrual cramps
Bleeding between periods;
, There are a variety of general health problems that can show up both during and between periods that could signal uterine fibroids or another health problem. Some symptoms are directly related to your period but many simply affect your general health. Symptoms that could indicate fibroids include:Bloating or a non-painful mass in the lower abdomen
Frequent urination resulting from a fibroid that compresses the bladder
Pain during sexual intercourse
Lower back pain
Constipation
Chronic vaginal discharge
Inability to urinate

, Even if you do not have any acute symptoms, uterine fibroids can cause problems for reproduction. If you are having problems with infertility, it could be caused by uterine fibroids, although it could be caused by other health issues as well.If you are having a hard time conceiving, consult with your doctor. Your doctor can run tests on you and assess whether there are any medical problems that are preventing you from getting pregnant.

, There are some risk factors that can increase the likelihood that you will get uterine fibroids. Risk factors that increase your likelihood of getting uterine fibroids include:Ethnicity: African American women are more likely to get uterine fibroids and they are more likely to get them at a younger age. Also, while other women's risk of getting fibroids decreases with age, African American women's increases.
Weight: There is a slight increase in the risk of fibroids if you are overweight or obese.
Age at first menses: The younger you are when you have your first period, the more likely you are to eventually get uterine fibroids .
Lack of child bearing: You are more likely to get fibroids if you have never given birth to a child.

, If you suspect that you have fibroids, then you should get a medical exam. Your doctor will ask you about your symptoms, will do a general exam, and then will do a pelvic examination. A primary care doctor can do the initial exam and testing. They then will refer you to a gynecologist for further evaluation and treatment.Your doctor will likely perform an internal pelvic exam. To do this, the doctor will look inside your cervix and then perform a bimanual exam to assess the size of your uterus. They will also likely do a pap smear and test for any infections.

, After a physical exam, your doctor may order an ultrasound of the uterus. This may include both an external and internal (transvaginal) screening. This may be necessary to detect where the fibroid may be, what size it is, and how many there are., Once your doctor identifies fibroids, they will tell you what type you have. There are three types of uterine fibroids: subserosal, intramural, and submucosal. They differ based on where they are located in your reproductive system. These different types of fibroids can cause different symptoms and may require different types of treatments.Subserosal fibroids extend more than 50% outside of the uterus. These fibroids rarely affect fertility.
Intramural fibroids are within the muscle of the uterus, without any indentation of the uterine cavity.
Submucosal fibroids project into the uterine cavity. These fibroids can reduce your pregnancy rate dramatically.

, Depending on the type of fibroids you have and their severity, your doctor will recommend a treatment plan. This could include removal or leaving them in place. Whether the doctor suggests surgery or not, they may also prescribe medication to shrink the fibroids and minimize any symptoms.


In many cases the doctor will prescribe pain killers, birth control, and gonadotropin-releasing hormones, which slow or stop the growth of fibroids. The birth control will limit bleeding, if that is a symptom of your fibroids.If your doctor recommends surgery, it could mean a variety of types of surgery. These include laparoscopic myomectomy, hysteroscopic myomectomy, or laparotomy, all of which are surgical procedures used to remove the fibroids.Many women who have less severe cases of fibroids, about 30 percent, do not require treatment due to lack of symptoms or pain.If you want to become pregnant in the future, be sure to tell your doctor, as this may affect your treatment options.

, When you have fibroids they can cause heavy and painful periods, even if you are treating them medically. If this is the case, then you will need to treat the acute symptoms of your period. In order to treat cramps, heavy bleeding, and other problems associated with your period, you can:Use an ice pack. An ice pack on your abdomen or back can minimize pain. Use the ice pack for 20 minutes at a time, taking the pack off so that your skin does not get too chilled.
Take vitamin C regularly. Vitamin C can help your body to absorb excess iron, which can cause excessive menstrual bleeding.
Take an iron supplement. If you are having excessive bleeding it may cause you to become anemic. If that is the case, take a supplement to level out your iron.

, In addition to following your medical treatment plan and treating symptoms, it can help your condition to make some lifestyle changes as well. Anything you can do to minimize your period, for instance, will go a long way towards helping to minimize your symptoms. Some things you can do to minimize your period include:Exercise regularly.
Eat fruits and vegetables.
Avoid sugar and fat.

, If you have uterine fibroids you will need the help and support from the people in your life. You will need them to help you get the medical treatment that is required. For instance you will need a ride home and home care after surgery, and you will need them to help you when you are in pain and unable to care for yourself.


If your symptoms are affecting your ability to work or perform daily activities, you should make sure to explore all treatment options with your doctor. Discuss your condition with your employer and figure out ways for you to make up time or do types of labor that will be compatible with your condition.

Pay attention to physical symptoms.,
Know the symptoms in children.,
Check the tonsils for swelling and redness.,
Take your temperature.",How to Diagnose Tonsillitis1," Tonsillitis has a variety of physical symptoms that are similar to that of a common cold or sore throat. If you notice any of the following you may be suffering from tonsillitis.


A sore throat that lasts longer than 48 hours. This is the primary symptom of tonsillitis and one of the first symptoms you will notice.Difficulty swallowing
Ear pain
Headache
Tenderness around the jaw and neck.A stiff neck.;
, Tonsillitis is very common in children. If you're not diagnosing yourself but a child, remember children experience and express symptoms differently.


Children are more likely to experience nausea and stomach pangs when suffering from tonsillitis.
If children are too young to express how they feel, you might notice drooling, a refusal to eat, and unusual fussiness., Have a friend or family member check your tonsils for symptoms of tonsillitis. Or, if you suspect tonsillitis in a young child, check yourself.


Gently place the handle of a spoon on the tongue of a sick person and have them say ""ahhh"" while you shine a light on the back of the throat.Tonsils infected with tonsillitis are bright red and swollen, and might have white or yellow coating or patching., Fever is one of the earliest signs of tonsillitis. Take your temperature to gauge if you're suffering from a fever.


Thermometers can be purchased at most drug stores. It generally takes about of minute of placing the tip of the thermometer under your tongue before an accurate reading is present.
If you're taking a child's temperature, always use a digital thermometer over a mercury one. If your child is under three, you may have to insert the thermometer in the rectum to get a proper reading as children in this age group may lack the ability to hold a thermometer in their mouths.A normal temperature is anywhere from 97 to 99 degrees Fahrenheit. Anything higher than this is considered a fever.

Treat your tonsillitis.",How to Diagnose Tonsillitis2," If you think you may have tonsillitis, you might need special medication or even surgery to remove your tonsils. Only a doctor can tell you for sure and make an official medical diagnosis. Make an appointment with your general practitioner or an ear, nose, and throat specialist to get your condition evaluated. If your child is experiencing symptoms of tonsillitis, get an appointment with their pediatrician as soon as possible.

, Your doctor will likely have a number of questions for you and will expect you to ask questions in return, so be prepared.


Know roughly when your symptoms began, if any over-the-counter pain relievers have improved symptoms, whether you've ever been diagnosed with tonsillitis or strep throat before, and if symptoms affect your sleep. These are things your doctor will want to know to help with diagnosis.
Ask your doctor about the best course of treatment, how long test results will take, and when you can resume normal activities., Your doctor will perform a variety of tests to diagnose tonsillitis.


First, there will be a physical exam. Your doctor will look in your throat, ears, and nose, listen to your breathing with a stethoscope, feel your neck for swelling, and check for enlargement of the spleen. This is a sign of mononucleosis, which also inflames tonsils.Your doctor will probably take a throat swab. They will rub a sterile swab over the back of your throat to check for bacteria associated with tonsillitis. Some hospitals have equipment that can get results in minutes while, in other cases, you might have to wait 24 to 48 hours.Your doctor may order a complete blood cell count (CBC). This provides a count on different types of blood cells, showing what levels are normal and what are below normal. This can indicate whether the infection is caused by a bacterial or viral agent. This is usually only used if the throat swab test is negative and the doctor wants to determine the precise cause of tonsillitis., Depending on the cause and severity, different treatments will be recommended by your physician.


If virus is the cause, at-home care is advised and you can expect to feel better in 7 to 10 days. Treatment is similar to the treatment of any cold. You should get rest, drink plenty of fluids, especially warm liquids, humidify the air and suck on lozenges, popsicles, and other foods that cool the throat.If the infection is bacterial, you will likely be prescribed a round of antibiotics. Make sure to take all the medication as directed. Failure to do so can result in the infection getting worse or not healing.If your tonsillitis is frequently occurring surgery to remove the tonsils might be a possibility. Tonsillitis is usually a one day surgery, meaning you will be home the same day you go in."

Understand tonsillitis is highly contagious.,
Know what factors put you at greater risk.,
Be aware of tonsillitis in children.",How to Diagnose Tonsillitis3," The germs that cause bacterial and viral tonsillitis are very contagious. You may be at higher risk for tonsillitis under certain conditions.


If you've been sharing food and beverages with others, such as at parties and other get togethers, you could have easily contracted the germs. This heightens your risk and increases the likelihood the symptoms you're experiencing are related to tonsillitis.
Nasal obstructions, those severe enough to cause you to breathe through your mouth, heighten your risk for tonsillitis. Droplets of pathogens pass through the air when an infected person breaths, coughs, and sneezes. Breathing through your mouth increases the risk for tonsillitis., While anyone who still has their tonsils is at risk for tonsillitis, certain factors increase your risk.


Smoking can increase your risk as it leads to more frequent mouth-breathing and reduces the body's capacity to fight disease.
Excessive alcohol use lowers the immune system, making you more susceptible to disease.When drinking, people are also looser about drink sharing. This can lead to infection.
Any condition that weakens the immune system puts you at greater risk, such as HIV/AIDS and diabetes.
If you've recently underdone an organ transplant or chemotherapy you may be at greater risk., While you can get tonsillitis at any age, infection is more frequent in children than adults. If you work with young children you may be at a higher risk.


Tonsillitis is most common in pre-school years to mid-teenage years. One reason for this is the close proximity of school-aged children that leads to the sharing of disease-causing germs.
If you work in an elementary or middle school, you are at an increased risk for tonsillitis. Wash your hands frequently during an outbreak and avoid contact with anyone diagnosed for a 24 hour period."

Understand the risk factors for hepatitis B.,
Learn how hepatitis A is transmitted.",How to Diagnose Viral Hepatitis," The symptoms of acute hepatitis typically begin suddenly and get progressively worse over the course of several days. If you have the following symptoms, see your doctor right away:Anorexia
Fatigue
Fever
Nausea and/or vomiting
Hives or itchy skin
Abdominal pain
Dark urine
Pale colored stool
Joint pain
Jaundice
Pruritus (itchiness);
, People with chronic hepatitis B and C often experience no symptoms at all, which makes these conditions much harder to diagnose. If you believe you have been exposed to viral hepatitis, you should see your doctor for testing, even if you feel fine., For patients who do experience symptoms from chronic hepatitis, fatigue is the most common. If you have chronic fatigue, do not ignore this symptom. See your doctor for blood tests to find out if viral hepatitis is the cause.Because chronic fatigue can be caused by many other conditions and is sometimes a side effect of a busy lifestyle, people do not always recognize it as a symptom of hepatitis. This can lead to delayed diagnosis, and ultimately more liver damage.
Chronic liver disease can lead to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer). You may need a liver transplantation or medication to control these pathologies.

, Viral hepatitis is sometimes caught when patients have routine lab work that reveals abnormal liver functioning. If you have lab work done, check with your doctor to find out if your liver tests are normal.If your routine lab work is abnormal, you will most likely be sent for more blood work in order to determine if you have viral hepatitis.
The first test to be completed is the measurement of the AST and ALT, if these enzymes are elevated then you may possibly have hepatitis. However, there are other possible causes like alcoholism and gall bladder disease.

, One test that is commonly used to diagnose hepatitis is a liver enzyme test, also known as the AST and ALT test. This is a simple blood test that detects elevated levels of certain liver enzymes in the blood. Elevated levels suggest liver damage, which is often caused by viral hepatitis.Liver damage may have other causes as well, so elevated liver enzymes do not always indicate a diagnosis of viral hepatitis.
People with acute hepatitis are more likely to have extremely high enzyme levels that will subside to normal within a short amount of time, while people with chronic hepatitis are more likely to have slightly elevated enzyme levels that will remain elevated for an extended period of time.

, A viral antibody test is another blood test that is commonly used to diagnose viral hepatitis. It detects the antibodies that the body's white blood cells has produced to fight the virus.In patients with acute hepatitis, viral antibodies will still be detectable even after the body has eliminated the virus.
Patients who have been vaccinated against hepatitis A or B will have antibodies in their blood, but this does not mean the virus is present.For the rest of a patient's life, if they get tested for viral antibodies, and have had hepatitis vaccination, then the test will show surface antigen positivity, especially with the hepatitis B vaccination.

, If your blood tests are positive for viral hepatitis antibodies, your doctor may also want to look for evidence of viral proteins and/or genetic material in your blood. When these are present along with antibodies, it indicates that the patient's body has not been able to fight off the virus, which may indicate a diagnosis of chronic hepatitis.If your antibody test was positive, but there is no evidence of viral proteins or genetic material, this means your body has successfully eradicated the virus.

, Viral hepatitis can sometimes be confused with conditions that block the bile ducts, such as gallstones or cancer of the gallbladder. Even alcoholics can have unusual levels of enzymes that may need to be ruled out. Your doctor may want to do an ultrasound to rule out bile duct blockage as the cause of your symptoms., If you have tested positive for hepatitis, your doctor may want to do further tests to understand how severe the condition is and what specific type of hepatitis you have. This will help your doctor recommend the best treatment plan for you.


One of these tests is a liver biopsy, which is performed by inserting a long, thin needle through the skin and into the liver. This test measures the amount of liver damage caused by viral hepatitis.If you have been diagnosed with hepatitis C, you may need to have additional tests to identify the virus's genotype. Certain genotypes are more responsive to treatment than others, so knowing which type you have will help your doctor develop an appropriate treatment plan., The following individuals are at a higher risk for contracting hepatitis C:People who have had organ transplants or blood transfusions
People who have used intravenous drugs
People who have had kidney dialysis
People who have HIV
People who have been incarcerated
People who have had tattoos or piercings with dirty needles
People who were treated for clotting issues with blood products before 1987
People who were born to mothers with hepatitis C
People who have been exposed to the blood of an individual with hepatitis C

, Like hepatitis C, hepatitis B is transmitted through contact with the bodily fluids of an individual who has the virus. The following people are at a higher risk for getting hepatitis B:People who had a blood transfusion or received another blood product prior to 1972
People who have had a tattoo or piercing (if an infected needle was used)
People who have used intravenous drugs
People who live with people who have hepatitis B
People who have had multiple sex partners
Men who have sex with other men
People who have been to areas where hepatitis B is endemic
People who were born to a mother with hepatitis B
People who work in the healthcare field

, Unlike hepatitis B and C, hepatitis A is transmitted through feces. People who do any of the following are at an increased risk of contracting hepatitis A:Drink contaminated water
Eat raw shellfish that came from contaminated water
Eat food that has been handled in an unhygienic way by an infected person
Come into contact with the feces of an infected person

The easiest and quickest way to do this is to look online. Search for local restaurants and look for ones that offer gluten-free items on the menu. Most restaurants will have their menu on their website, so you can scan through and look for suitable dishes.Some restaurants may emphasise their gluten-free options more than others, so be sure to look carefully at the website.
Look out for a “GF” logo on the menu.It is becoming easier to find gluten-free dishes, but you should still always check first to avoid disappointment.;
, You may be able to use forums and websites maintained by people with celiac disease to find suitable restaurants. On these websites people note restaurants with gluten-free options, and can give ratings for how well the restaurants deal with gluten issues.There are a number of sites that enable you to search for gluten-free dining options by locality.If you have found a great restaurant with excellent gluten-free options, you can even submit it to these websites yourself.By doing this you will joining in and helping out other people with celiac disease.

, Call a restaurant twice before you visit with your gluten sensitive child. Make the first call several days ahead to see if the restaurant is a viable choice for your family, and call once again on the day you will be dining at the restaurant. If the chef knows well in advance, they are more likely to be able to meet your child’s needs.


Notify the restaurant in advance about which day you will be eating out so that the management can be sure that gluten-free menu ingredients are available.
A chef may even offer to cook something especially that is gluten-free., When you call up the restaurant you should have some questions ready to ask that will help to determine whether or not the food is safe for your celiac child. You can ask these questions even if the person on the phone says that they have a gluten-free option, just to check that you are both on the same page. If you explain why you need to be certain, the staff will likely be sympathetic and answer you fully.Ask if they have a gluten-free menu.
Ask what items can be made gluten-free for your child.
Politely ask if they know what gluten-free is, and if so what it is.
You can also ask if staff in the restaurant have completed any gluten-free training., When you arrive at the restaurant take a moment to inform the wait staff that your child has celiac disease, and cannot eat gluten. It’s best to make this clear at the start, but do it in a subtle and undemonstrative way. Don’t go in and loudly announce it to restaurant as this is more than likely to embarrass your child., Make sure that the staff in the restaurant understand what you mean when you say gluten-free. Explain why your child can’t eat gluten, and give the staff some detail on foods that your child can and can’t eat. Ask what items they have that are suitable, and remember that a restaurant has to tell you if an item has a cereal that contains gluten.


Be wary of soups, dishes with sauce, gravy, or stock cubes.The main part of the meal might be gluten-free, but the sauce that comes with it might not.
Be sure to double-check to clarify.

, Make sure you are polite and patient when talking to the staff in the restaurant. Even if you think they are not being especially helpful, keep in mind the stresses of working in a busy restaurant and show some patience. You need to ask the key questions about gluten-free food, but being polite and friendly will create a better atmosphere and may make staff more happy to accommodate you., You should be aware of the potential risks of cross-contact in the preparation of the food. Restaurants may not be as sharp on this as on other gluten issues, so be sure to ask about it. For example, look out for breaded and fried items on the menu. Things like fish and chicken are fine, but if they have been fried in the same pan as non-gluten free breaded items there is a danger of cross-contamination.


Ask the wait staff if they can use separate pans to ensure that there is no contamination.The surface the food is prepared on is another potential site for cross-contamination.Do not let your child share food off your plate as some of your food may be contaminated with gluten-containing food items.

, When you are in the restaurant, it will be helpful if you identify the dishes which are typically gluten-free. Some of the foods and ingredients that a person with celiac disease can eat safely include:


Foods made from flours of corn, rice, buckwheat, sorghum, arrowroot, chickpeas, quinoa, tapioca, teff, and potato.
Plain meats, fish, legumes, nuts, oils, milk, cheese, eggs, fruits are vegetables are also fine.As long as there has been no cross-contamination, your child can still eat a wide variety of foods.

, It is equally helpful to have knowledge of the foods that your child will need to avoid. A person with celiac disease should steer clear of anything that has wheat, barley, rye or most oats. This includes anything with plain flour, breading, soy sauce, teriyaki sauce, and any other seasoning that might include flour.


Remember that if you order a salad, your child won’t be able to have croutons or any topping made with bread that is not gluten-free., It can be difficult for your child to eat out, knowing that the requirements are very important. She might feel a little awkward with attention being drawn to her. Try to stay relaxed and patient to help put your child at ease. Of course it’s vital that you are 100% confident that your child will not be eating anything that could make her sick, but you should try to ask questions in a calm way.


If someone on the phone told you that there were gluten-free options, but when you get there they have run out, don’t make a scene.
Your child probably just wants to be treated like everybody else, so be subtle when you are in the restaurant.
Over time you and your child will get used to the requirements of a gluten-free diet, and get to know how to eat well.
Strong family support is essential, so don’t make your child feel singled out or unable to live a normal life.
Eating out is a good way to show that having celiac disease doesn’t have to have a big impact on your life., An important part of raising a child with celiac disease, is to help him learn what he can and can’t eat. You should try to do this in as positive a way as possible, and eating out is a great occasion to do this. Take him through the menu and always emphasize the things he can eat rather than the things he can’t.


Highlight the choices available, and encourage your child to learn about what’s good to eat.
Your child may want to make some menu cards with information on appropriate dishes in restaurants that you go to often.
Encourage your child to ask questions and to move towards being independent, and able to choose a meal without Mum or Dad., Your child may get frustrated or annoyed when you tell her that she can’t eat what she might want to, or what somebody else is having. It’s important that you are able to explain why, and help your child understand her condition. Explain that your child can’t eat gluten because it hurts her body, and makes it tougher for her to grow strong and healthy.Tailor your explanation to your child's age and level of understanding.


You can use online games and videos to help explain celiac disease to your child.Explain that celiac is not an allergy like a seasonal allergy, but rather it is an autoimmune disorder that is triggered by gluten. Explain that doctors still do not fully understand the disorder, but they think that some people inherit the disease and are unable to digest gluten properly. If a person cannot digest it properly but stills eat it anyway, it can cause her body's immune system to attack the lining of the stomach and intestines.
Say that about 1 in every 133 people in the US has celiac disease and she is not alone.If your child understands her condition, dealing with it in a restaurant should be easier and less stressful. Remind her that avoiding gluten will decrease any symptoms (like bloating), will allow her body to absorb necessary vitamins and nutrients, and may decrease her risk for GI cancer later in life., It’s important that when you eat out, you don’t get too stressed or frustrated. Try to keep the mood light, and make finding gluten-free food options part of the fun of eating out. Assuming you have called ahead and made sure that there are some suitable dishes for your child, you shouldn’t have to worry about him missing out.


Relaxing and having fun eating out is an important part of showing your child that having celiac disease doesn’t have to have a big impact on his lifestyle.
By getting more experience eating out and learning about diet, you will show your child that he can still participate in all the fun things, like parties and traveling., If your child is upset because she can’t eat something she wants to, try to sympathise and show understanding. It can be a difficult thing to get used to, but it’s important that you make sure your child is aware of the different substitutions and options available. Experiment with new things and look for ways to add as much variety as possible.Remember that eating is a multisensory experience, so your child may be put off by the sight or smell rather than the taste.
Try to introduce your child to a wide range of scents by using differences spices at home. This can make your child more open to trying things in a restaurant.
Introduce different textures, such as smooth, crunchy, and moist foods to broaden your child’s experiences of eating.
If your child is not convinced by a dish, encourage her to take a small bite to start with rather than pressuring her to eat the whole thing.
Be patient, understanding and persistent and you can help your child understand all the great variety of food options still available to them."

Call for help right away.,
Allow your doctor to monitor your lungs.,
Have your blood tested.,
Alert authorities so they can test specific locations for ricin.",How to Diagnose Ricin Poisoning1," If you believe that you or someone you know has been exposed to ricin, then it is crucial for you to get medical help right away. Call emergency services, such as by dialing 911 in the United States.

You can also call poison control in the US at 1-800-222-1222.;
, One of the first things your doctor will do is to listen to and run diagnostics on your lungs. This is important, as one of the most obvious signs of ricin inhalation is a sudden decrease in the ability of the lungs to work properly.

Your doctor may want to take an X-ray of your lungs to see if there is a fluid buildup.
Your doctor may listen to your chest with a stethoscope to see if there is fluid buildup., Within a few hours of ricin poisoning, your organs may begin to experience decreased function as they cope with the toxin.

Prioritize your own fitness.,
Integrate exercise into family life.,
Teach age-appropriate exercise habits.,
Walk to school with your kids.,
Go for a family bicycle ride.,
Integrate physical activities into your family vacation.",How to Teach Kids Healthy Exercise Habits1," Since kids look to their parents and guardians as models for health and exercise, you should make fitness a priority in your daily life. If you do not already integrate exercise into your daily life, consider joining a gym or going for a daily run.


Ask friends and family members for a gym recommendation.Try out a local gym to see if you like it. Most gyms offer test passes to prospective members, so you should take advantage of free passes and try out a few gyms in your area before signing up.;
, Your kids will model their behavior and physical activity level on your everyday behaviors and those of other adult family members, so the first step is to integrate exercise into your family lifestyle. By modeling the benefits of physical activity in your life and in your family, your children will watch, learn, and develop healthy exercise habits. You can model both moderate exercise such as taking a walk around the block or walking to school with your child, as well as more vigorous activity such as playing sports, running, or cycling.


Go to the park on Sundays for a game of Frisbee. If you normally stay inside on the weekends, try going to the park for a Sunday afternoon to enjoy a game of Frisbee.
Go for a family bicycle ride. On the weekend, go for a family bicycle ride. Plan your route so that you can visit some local attractions and enjoy a mix of scenery.

, It is important to tailor exercise routines to the age of your children, since younger kids need a lot of activity during the day and older kids should be getting some form of vigorous exercise. In addition, kids five years and older should engage in forms of exercise that help strengthen muscles and bones three days per week. You want to ensure a good mix of everyday, moderate activity and more energetic forms of exercise:


If your kids are five years or under and are able to walk, they should be getting at least three hours of exercise per day including light activities like walking and more energetic activities like playing tag with friends.If your kids are between five and eighteen years old, they should be getting sixty minutes of exercise per day including moderate activities like riding a scooter and vigorous exercise such as swimming, running, football, or dancing.Adults typically need at least thirty minutes of exercise a day, including a mix of aerobic activity and strength training., If your school is within reasonable walking distance, try making the time in your day to walk to school with your kids. By walking together, you can practice healthy exercise habits with your children. Although walking to school is a moderate form of exercise, both younger and older kids need to integrate moderate activity into their daily exercise habits.It is better for the health of your children and for the planet., Organize a family bicycle ride to the park. You could ride together from your house to the park and back for a fun family outing. If you live far from a park, you could also put the bikes on the back of your car and do a ride within the park itself. Introduce cycling to your kids so they can enjoy some freedom, fun, and fresh air in their lives.If your child is five or under and able to walk, you should make sure they get some vigorous exercise as part of their three hours per day of exercise. Cycling is one form of vigorous exercise that can benefit your child.
If your kids are between five and eighteen years old, they should be getting some vigorous exercise such as cycling fast or cycling up a hill.Kids bicycles can be purchased for around $100 at bike stores or for $50 from discount stores. It is best to avoid the really cheap bikes, which can be prone to mechanical difficulties.If you buy a used bike, have it checked and tuned up by a professional.
Make sure the bike fits your child. Their legs should be slightly bent at the end of each pedalling revolution. They should be able to touch the ground with both feet when the seat is at the lowest position., If you are planning a family vacation, plan your itinerary to include both moderate and vigorous forms of physical activity. For example, you could plan a family canoe trip, a family cycle touring trip, or a family hiking trip. Alongside such fitness focused vacations, you could plan a vacation at a health and wellness resort that includes spas, restaurants, and numerous fitness options.If you are planning a family canoe trip, it is best to plan your itinerary based on your prior canoeing experience. If you have a lot of outdoors experience, you will be more comfortable taking your family on a canoe trip. If you have less experience, you might want to try car camping first or a short canoe trip on a familiar lake.If you like the idea of a family cycle tour, you will have to choose between a self-guided and guided bicycle tour. A self-guided tour has the advantage of being very cheap but depends on your knowledge of cycling and the region or country you are exploring. If you want more assistance with safety, cycling mechanics, and the local region, you should look into available guided bicycle tours that include a support van and bicycle tour guide.If you are visiting a new place on your family vacation, you could look into local walks or hikes in the area. Take a break from visiting tourist sites and enjoy a family hike or walk.

With frostbite, there is an indication of damage. Blisters or skin mottling may appear with re-warming the skin.
Frostbite can lead to permanent damage, so if you suspect frostbite, get medical attention immediately.

, Buerger’s Disease is also known as thromboangiitis obliterans. It is a rare disease in which the arteries and veins in the arms, legs, hands, and feet are inflamed, swollen, and can become blocked with sometimes tiny blood clots.

Helping your child to relax for bed may reduce how often he/she grinds his/her teeth. Create a routine that involves relaxing activities before bedtime.These activities could include:


Taking a warm bath.
Listening to soothing music.
Reading a book.
Telling your child stories or singing lullabies.

, Dimming the lights and making the room cooler can help your child to sleep more peacefully, and thus stop grinding his/her teeth. To make your child’s bedroom relaxing and peaceful:


Keep the lights dim. Instead of using bright fluorescent bulbs, set your child’s room up with some dim bulbs that you can be turned on at night.
Keep the temperature down. Most people tend to sleep better when the temperature in their bedroom is lower (around 65° F or 18° C).
Make sure your child’s bed is comfortable. If your child is starting to outgrow his/her bed, you may want to consider getting him a larger one that he/she can grow into. Having a comfortable bed can help your child sleep better., Warm temperatures can create good blood flow. If you hold a warm, wet washcloth to your child’s face, you will help his/her jaw muscles to relax by creating good blood flow to the area. This will help your child’s jaw to relax and will make him/her less likely to clench his/her teeth together while he sleeps.


Run the washcloth under warm water. Make sure to test the cloth against your own skin first to make sure that it is not too hot. Hold the cloth over your child's jaw. Once the washcloth has cooled, run it under the water again and switch it to the other side of your child’s jaw.

Give your child plenty of fluids.,
Feed your child foods that you know he can tolerate.,
Put your child on the BRAT diet.,
Offer your child some yogurt.,
Try increasing the fat in your child’s diet.,
Take your child to see your pediatrician.,
Decide if your child’s diarrhea is acute.,
Ask about probiotics.,
Consider whether your child’s diarrhea may be chronic.,
Call your physician if you notice signs of dehydration.,
Take your child to an emergency room if you notice serious symptoms.",How to Stop Diarrhea in Toddlers," Because it is easy for kids to become dehydrated, making sure that your child gets enough fluid is the best thing you can do when she is suffering from a bout of diarrhea. Do not hydrate her with water alone — your child will need to replenish sodium, potassium, and other nutrients lost through diarrhea.Instead, look for oral rehydration solutions (ORS), such as Pedialyte.Make sure you speak to your doctor about how much and for how long you should give your child an ORS.ORSs are available in most drug stores. Do not try to make your own solution unless your pediatrician gives you a precise recipe.Do NOT use sports drinks, sodas, or even juice. The high sugar content in these beverages can make diarrhea worse.;
, Stick to foods that you know won’t cause a problem for your child and do not try to introduce your child to any new foods while he has diarrhea, either.The main things to avoid are high sugar foods and beverages because these can make diarrhea worse.
Avoid giving your child anything that has caused problems for him in the past.
If you feed your child something and it seems to make his diarrhea worse, then do not offer your child that food again.

, To stop diarrhea, it is also important to increase your child’s fiber intake.Fiber helps to solidify the stool. One good way to ensure that your toddler is getting enough fiber is to use the BRAT diet. BRAT stands for Bananas, Rice, Applesauce, and Toast (use whole grain bread to make the toast).


BRAT diet foods are unlikely to cause a problem unless your child has a food allergy or sensitivity to one of them. In that case, omit one of the foods or modify the food so that your child can have it. For example, if your child has a sensitivity to gluten, then give your child gluten-free bread instead of wheat bread.

, Yogurt may also help stop diarrhea in your toddler by rebalancing the bacteria in your child’s gut.Give your child whatever flavor of yogurt she will eat, just make sure that the yogurt contains “live cultures.” Live cultures provide the healthy gut bacteria that your child needs to maintain normal bowel function.


You can also use popsicle forms to make frozen yogurt popsicles if you think your child will like these better.

, In some cases, increasing your child's fat intake may help stop diarrhea. Try offering your child some more healthy high fat foods. Some good options include:Olive oil
Butter
Cheese
Whole fat milk (however, you may wish to avoid dairy products if your child is having a lot of diarrhea)

, If your toddler’s bowel movements suddenly increase or change consistency, then he probably has diarrhea. Diarrhea can often be treated at home, but it is a good idea to make an appointment for your child to see a pediatrician. Some forms of diarrhea may be caused by food sensitivities, infections, or other conditions that require medical treatment.

, Acute diarrhea is a bout of diarrhea that lasts for less than two weeks. Acute diarrhea is the most common form of diarrhea in children and it may be due to:Bacterial or viral infections or inflammation
Antibiotic use
Food sensitivities
Food allergies
Food “poisoning”

, If your child's diarrhea is prolonged or the result of antibiotics, ask your doctor about probiotics. It may be necessary to rebuild the good bacteria in your child's intestines to prevent further illness. The type of probiotic depends on why your child has diarrhea, as not all probiotics can help diarrhea, and not all types of diarrhea are helped by probiotics.Your doctor may recommend strains such as Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus reuteri, or Saccharomyces boulardii, or possibly even a combination., Chronic diarrhea is any bout of diarrhea that lasts for more than two weeks. Chronic diarrhea may be caused by:Dietary factors
Infections
Celiac disease
Inflammatory bowel disease

, If your child does not improve within two to three days, call your physician. If your child is showing any signs of dehydration, call your physician right away. If you can’t reach your physician and you see these signs, take your child to urgent care or the emergency room. Call 911 or emergency services only if symptoms are severe. Signs of dehydration in infants, toddlers and children include:Sunken-looking eyes
Weight loss
Infrequent urination or dry diapers
Vomiting
Fever over 101°F (38.3°C)
Crying without any tears
Dry or sticky mouth or tongue
Lethargy or excessive sleepiness
Increased irritability

, There are a few other “red flags” to watch for if your child has diarrhea. If you notice any of these symptoms, then take your child to the emergency room right away. These serious symptoms include:Bloody stools
A high fever along with vomiting or diarrhea
Extreme vomiting
A distended, enlarged, or tender abdomen
Pale skin and/or tiny red, round spots on the skin
Severe or persistent pain in the abdomen, especially on the right side

Be aware that grinding as a result of teething is not a large concern.,
Get a mouthguard for your child.,
Minimize the amount of caffeine that your child consumes.,
Try to keep your child from chewing on things other than food.,
Do not let your child chew gum.,
Teach your child how to avoid clenching his jaw when he notices it happening.,
Consider meeting with a therapist if you think your child’s teeth grinding might be psychological.",How to Stop Your Child from Grinding His or Her Teeth2," While it is still unclear why children begin grinding their teeth, it is thought that bruxism could be caused by your child’s baby teeth coming in. When your child’s baby teeth come in, it might cause them to feel irritation, which may lead to teeth grinding.Intervention is not usually required when your child grinds his or her baby teeth. However, it may help to develop a relaxing routine before bed to keep your child from grinding (see Method 1 for more information).

, Your child’s dentist may recommend getting him a mouthguard, also known as an occasional splint or night guard, to protect your child’s teeth. When your child grinds his/her teeth, he can actually wear his teeth down and damage his/her enamel. The guard is made of silicon rubber, which acts as a shield to keep the upper and lower molars from grinding against each other.Submerge the mouthguard in water during the day to keep it clean. Try to clean it with a toothbrush every one to two days.

, Caffeine can alter your child’s sleep schedule because it blocks the formation of a chemical called adenosine. This chemical helps to make you feel relaxed, which in turn can help you sleep better. Avoid giving your child caffeinated products like:


Sodas.
Energy drinks.
Chocolate.
Coffee.

, When your child grinds his teeth at night, it is important that he/she does not chew on anything that can damage his teeth further during the day. If you notice your child chewing on his/her nails, pencils, or pens, help him to break these habits.


You can read about how to help your child get over these habits here.


, Chewing gum causes your jaws to clench. This jaw clenching can become subconscious, which can make your child’s teeth grinding become worse. Help your child to stay away from gum while he/she works through his bruxism.

, If your child is old enough to be conscious of his/her jaw clenching and teeth grinding, show him how to stop doing those actions when he/she becomes aware of them.


To do this, tell him to place the tip of his/her tongue between his/her teeth whenever he notices himself clenching his/her jaw or grinding his/her teeth. Having his/her tongue in between his teeth will help him to stop doing the action.

, If you are concerned that your child’s teeth grinding might be linked to a psychological condition, you may want to meet with a psychotherapist who will be able to help your child overcome his/her bruxism. There are a couple techniques that the therapist might teach your child, including:


Auto-suggestion: This technique involves telling yourself “I will wake up if I grind my teeth” so that you can break the habit. While the approach lacks scientific evidence, some therapists believe thinking thoughts like that will help the child to overcome the habit of teeth grinding.
Guided meditation: This technique involves developing a sense of self esteem and a belief that you have control over your own body.

Check if the object is visible.,
Get clean tweezers.,
Grasp the object and gently remove it.,
Try tilting your child’s head and letting it fall out.",How to Remove Something Stuck in a Child's Ear1," Get up close to your child’s ear to look at the object. Use a flashlight to see the object better in their ear. Check if you can see the object sitting in their ear with the naked eye. If so, you may be able to extract it with tweezers or by using gravity.Do not stick cotton swabs, a matchstick, or any other items into the ear to poke at the object.
If you cannot see the object at all, or if the object appears to be deeply lodged in your child’s ear, you should seek medical care immediately. The doctor will have the proper tools to extract the object without damage.;
, Use clean household tweezers with dulled tips.

Get a bulb syringe and warm water.,
Insert the syringe in the ear to remove the object.,
Use baby oil or mineral oil to remove an insect.,
Pour the oil into your child’s ear.",How to Remove Something Stuck in a Child's Ear2," Another option is to use water to flush out the object in your child’s ear. Get a bulb syringe made for ears and a bowl of warm water. The bulb syringe will allow you to insert water into your child’s ear safely.You can find bulb ear syringes at your local drugstore or online.

, Fill the bulb syringe with warm water. Then, tilt your child’s head in your lap with the damaged ear facing upward. Insert the syringe into your child’s ear and press down on the plunger to release the water. Then, turn your child’s head downward so the water and the object can slide out of their ear.You may have to flush your child’s ear a few times to dislodge the item. If you have flushed their ear several times and the item does not come out, seek professional medical care.

, If there is an insect stuck in your child’s ear, you can use baby oil or mineral to try to float it out. Heat the oil so it is warm, but not hot.Do not use the oil to remove any other objects besides an insect.
If there is any pain, bleeding, or discharge from the ear, do not apply the oil. Seek professional medical care instead.

, Tilt your child’s head so the affected ear is facing upward. Pour the oil slowly into your child’s ear. Pull their earlobe back and downward to help ease the oil into the ear.The insect should then suffocate and float out of your child’s ear with the help of the oil.

"
"
Allow the doctor to examine your child’s ear.,
Discuss removal options with the doctor.,
Follow up with the doctor.",How to Remove Something Stuck in a Child's Ear3," The doctor will start by using medical tools to examine your child’s ear and identify the object in the ear. They may also ask you or your child to describe any other symptoms they are experiencing, such as pain, irritation, liquid coming from the ear, or difficulty hearing.In some cases, if the object is deeply embedded in the ear, the doctor may have to do an X-ray to identify the object and determine how to remove it.

, Depending on the object in your child’s ear, the doctor may try cleaning the ear canal with water or using a machine with suction to pull out the object. They may also insert medical instruments in the ear to remove the object or use magnets if the object is metal.Once the object has been removed, they may check for any injury to the ear canal.
The doctor may also prescribe antibiotic drops to treat any possible infection in the ear.

, If you notice your child’s hearing has been affected or the ear is not healing properly, follow up with the doctor. They may perform more tests on your child’s to determine if there is internal damage or injury to the ear."

Stay calm.,
Note the start time of the seizure.,
Place your child on a safe, stable surface.,
Ensure that the area surrounding your child is clear.,
Soothe your child, and make him comfortable.,
Turn your child onto her side or stomach to help her breath.,
Determine if emergency medical assistance is needed.,
Monitor your child's level of consciousness.,
Give your child acetaminophen or ibuprofen.,
Apply a cool, wet cloth to your child's face and neck.,
Bathe your child with lukewarm water.,
Provide fluids if possible.If the seizure is continuing, do not introduce anything to the child's mouth.,
Allow the child to sleep.,
Continue monitoring your child.,
Consult your pediatrician.",How to Stop Your Child's Febrile Seizure," Breathe deeply, and remember that, while your child's distress may be difficult to watch, the seizure should pose little threat to your child's long-term health if treated properly.;
, It is important for you to keep track of how long the seizure lasts so that you know whether emergency medical assistance is needed, and so you can accurately report the duration of the seizure to your child's doctor once the episode has subsided., The convulsions associated with a febrile seizure can cause your child to move about involuntarily, so you should make sure to place him away from any steep drop.If your child is already safe where he is, you should avoid moving him.
Placing your child on the floor, or in the center of a bed are good options. If your child is still small enough, you may simply lay him on your lap, and support him with your hands.

, If there are hard objects (such as furniture) in the vicinity, move them away from your child so that they can't accidentally strike her., Remain calm, and remember that, while it is distressing to watch, your child's seizure will pass.Speak in soft, low tones to your child. This well help both of you calm down. Remind him (and yourself) that you are there to care for him, and that everything is going to be alright.
If your child is laying on a hard surface, slide a blanket underneath him.
Remove or loosen any clothing from the waist up, especially around the neck.
Do not restrain your child. Simply ensure that he is safe, and allow the convulsions to pass., It is normal for a child to vomit or produce a lot of saliva during a seizure, and re-positioning her will ensure that her breathing passages remain clear.Watch for breathing problems, including the child turning blue from a compromised airway. If this occurs, dial 911 immediately.
Avoid sticking anything in your child's mouth to clear her breathing, as she may choke, or involuntarily bite down.

, If your child's seizure lasts longer than five minutes, or if your child does not regain consciousness quickly after his convulsions have ceased, you should call an ambulance before continuing treatment. Don't panic: even febrile seizures severe enough to require emergency medical attention do not pose a serious threat to most children.If you do call for an ambulance, calmly relate to the operator that your child is having a febrile seizure. Tell them how long the seizure has lasted, and briefly describe your child's convulsions and state of consciousness.
Know the difference between a complex and a simple febrile seizure. A complex febrile seizure lasts longer than 15 minutes and occurs multiple times in a 24-hour period., You should observe and soothe her constantly until your child returns to consciousness, or until emergency assistance arrives.

, If your child has already returned to consciousness, you may give him a normal oral dose (closely follow the instructions on the medication package). If the seizure is continuing, do not attempt this, as your child will likely be unable to swallow properly. You may give an acetaminophen suppository, if you have one.Children six months old or younger should not be given ibuprofen, and no child should ever be given aspirin, for any reason., This will help sooth the child, and lower her body temperature. , This will further relax your child, help relieve his fever, and make him more clean and comfortable.If the seizure is still in process, use a sponge to bathe your child, rather than moving him to a bath.
Do not bathe your child with cold water or rubbing alcohol. Lowering the body's temperature too quickly is dangerous and can induce shock.

, Continue soothing your child, and treating her fever while you await medical assistance.

, Once the seizure has ended, and you have taken steps to reduce his fever, make him comfortable in a cool room, and let him rest. Sleepiness is common after a seizure, and sleep will allow your child's body to begin working to lower his fever.While your child may feel chilly, don't bundle him up in too many blankets until his fever has broken. Remember that your primary goal once the seizure has ended is to gradually lower his body temperature.

, If her fever worsens, or she experiences more seizures, call for emergency medical assistance. Again, do not panic. Febrile seizure are dramatic and frightening, but even repeat episodes pose little threat to your child's long-term health, especially if you remain calm and focus on soothing her and lowering her fever., It is important to identify and treat the cause of the fever to prevent future seizures. Give your child's doctor a detailed description of the seizure, including symptoms, and the length(s) of the episode(s)."

Look for signs of withdrawal.,
Notice if they seem insecure in the relationship.,
Check if they are content in their relationship.",How to Spot Childhood Emotional Neglect in a Loved One1," Adults who don’t receive the type of emotional support they need growing up are often withdrawn when it comes to romantic relationships. They shy away from intimate relationships because they are unsure of how to show affection, likely because they weren’t shown the affection they needed when they were younger.You may find that the person with childhood emotional neglect doesn’t communicate with their partner, doesn’t express feelings or emotions, doesn’t show empathy or compassion, or seems uninterested in the relationship.;
, You may find that the person is extremely insecure about their role in the relationship. They may be afraid that their significant other is cheating on them constantly or that they don’t deserve the person. These feelings can make them go from one failed relationship to another.

You may also find that the person is attracted to people who treat them badly or have CEN themselves. You might find that they consistently gravitate towards abusive relationships.

, It’s not uncommon for people with CEN to feel as if something is missing from the relationship. They may never truly feel happy. This can cause undue suffering for both them and their partners.

For example, people with CEN may often feel like something is wrong or off in their relationships. They may not understand why. In reality, they simply struggle to feel a sense of belonging with others or a connection with their partners. However, they don't realize that heir contentment is an internal, not an external, problem."
"
See if they show empathy towards others.,
Check for self-defeating behavior.,
Look for an angry temperament.,
Look for addictive behavior.",How to Spot Childhood Emotional Neglect in a Loved One2," An adult who experienced childhood emotional neglect doesn’t show much concern for others. They tend to be closed off from people around them, even their loved ones. They just can't seem to relate to others' human sides.

For instance, you may notice that they call people who cry or upset “wimps” or have a difficult time understanding why people are emotional. They also often turn away from the people who need them the most., Adults who experience CEN are often extremely critical of themselves. They may become very upset if they make a mistake or don’t do the job the way they intended. They are often perfectionists and hold themselves up to a high, often unattainable, standard.

They may also not make time to care for themselves. You may find that they never take time to do what they enjoy or relax. This is likely because they aren’t aware of what they are feeling and how to make the situation better., Victims of childhood emotional neglect often act out and throw tantrums. They are unable to process their feelings in a rational way and explode because of it.

You may also notice they act emotionally abusive to those around them, including you. You might also feel disconnected to the person because they are unable to process their emotions., Many people with CEN look to drugs and alcohol to fulfill their needs. Anyone who experiences trauma, including emotional neglect, is predisposed to addiction.

Although substance abuse is the most common form of addiction for people with CEN, they may become addicted to other things, such as gambling and sex."
"
Watch for abuse.,
Question if they can tell what their children are feeling.,
Pay attention to how much they interact with their children.,
See if they offer comfort appropriately.",How to Spot Childhood Emotional Neglect in a Loved One3," People who were abused or neglected by their parents often mirror the same behavior with their own children. They may believe that the way they were treated is normal or they just aren’t aware of any other type of parenting. As such, they may show their children the same type of parenting.

Your loved one may be the victim of CEN if they ignore, tease, reject, isolate, or terrorize their child. They may also withhold love and affection., You may notice that your loved one doesn’t seem to notice when their child is upset. They may not understand that they are truly sad or angry and just brush them off. Their lack of emotional fulfillment growing up may make them closed off to emotional outbursts that occur around them.

Additionally, they will likely cause the same behavior in their own children when they grow up to be parents., A common type of withholding among parents who struggle with CEN is not spending much time talking or otherwise engaging with their children. They often don’t put any effort into bonding with their children because they don’t know any better.

For instance, you may notice that they don’t talk much during meals, don’t offer support or encouragement with school or extra-curricular activities, and don’t spend much time on a one-on-one basis., Children turn to their parents for support and encouragement, especially when times are tough. You may notice that your loved one doesn’t give the love to their child that you feel they need, even when it may be obvious they need it.

For example, when the child’s favorite pet passes away, best friend moves, or they get hurt, you may notice your loved one doesn’t console the child or even understand why they are so upset. Even just not asking what the child is so sad about and ignoring them could be defined as childhood emotional neglect, and a sign your loved one has it."

Pick an essential oil.,
Avoid certain essential oils.,
Perform a skin test.,
Test for an asthmatic reaction.,
Set up the aromatherapy inhaler.,
Breathe in the essential oils.,
Select a carrier oil.,
Create a very diluted essential oil mixture.,
Use a stronger solution for kids over 6 years old.,
Apply the essential oil to the skin.",How to Safely Use Essential Oils with Children," There are several essential oils that are safe for kids over the age of 2 to use. Always choose a 100% pure essential oil. Many of the following essential oils can relieve coughing, treat minor skin wounds, improve mood, relieve headaches, or have antibacterial, anti-fungal, and antiviral properties:Blue Tansy
Cedarwood
Copaiba
Cypress
German Chamomile
Geranium
Helichrysum
Lavender
Mandarin
Neroli
Sandalwood
Tea Tree;
, Always check with an aromatherapist, herbalist, or naturopath if you're unsure whether or not an essential oil is safe for use in children. Some essential oils (like bergamot, lime, bitter orange, lemon, and grapefruit) should be avoided if your children will be in the bright sun. Or, you should avoid specific oils if a child is under a certain age:In children under the age of 2 years avoid: cassia, clove, basil, lemongrass, verbena, ylang-Ylang.
In children under the age of 6 years avoid: anise (or aniseed), fennel, niaouli, peppermint, rosemary.
In children under the age of 10 years avoid: eucalyptus and wintergreen.

, Since kids are sensitive to essential oils, test a small area of your child's skin to see if there's an allergic reaction. Take a 0.25% solution of the essential oil and place a drop on a cotton ball. Dab the inside of the wrist or inside of the elbow with the cotton ball and wait at least 24 hours. If you don't see a reaction, you can use the diluted solution. But, avoid using the oil if you notice one of these signs of reaction:Rash
Itching
Reddened skin
Nausea or vomiting
Changed behavior

, In addition to doing a skin test, you should do a test run of letting your child breathe in essential oils. Have your child briefly inhale a diluted solution (0.5% to 1%) and then wait 1 to 2 hours. Continue using the essential oils if your child doesn't react. But, if you notice your child's breathing change or slow, take your child to the emergency room immediately.


Anyone can develop an allergic reaction to an essential oil, even after years of safely using them. This is why it's important to test before each use.

, Follow the manufacturer's instructions that came with your diffuser or inhaler. Most diffusers or stand-alone inhalers should be placed about 2 feet away from kids under 2 years old. If your children are older, you can place them closer. Adjusting the distance can strengthen or lessen the dose of essential oils your children breathe in.


Breathing in essential oils is considered to be the safest way to use essential oils with children.

, Load the aromatherapy inhaler with 8 to 10 drops of essential oil. The machine will then diffuse the oils or create a mist that your children can breathe in. If you're using a nasal inhaler, follow the package instructions and use fewer drops of essential oil since the child will just breathe in the oils directly.If you're using the oils with a child who's over 6 years old, you can also put 1 drop of the essential oil directly onto a cotton ball or tissue. Gently wave the cotton ball or tissue under the child's nose and direct the child to breathe deeply.

, Carrier oils dilute the essential oils to a safe level and help to create a substance that can be absorbed by the skin. Choose a natural carrier oil and avoid any that are processed (like corn or canola oil). Good carrier oil options include:Jojoba oil
Almond oil
Avocado oil
Baobab oil
Coconut oil
Tamanu oil

, Children under 6 years old have are more sensitive to essential oils, so inhalation or aromatherapy are the safest ways to use essential oils. But, if you do want you apply the oils to the skin and your child is younger than 6, make a 0.25% solution. To do this, combine 1 drop of essential oil to 4 teaspoons of a carrier oil.Do not use essential oils on the skin if your child is under 2 years old. Very young children have thinner, more delicate skin that can be even more sensitive to the oils.

, If you'd like to apply essential oils to children over 6 years old, make a 0.5% to 1% solution. To make a 0.5% solution, mix 2 drops of essential oil with 4 teaspoons of carrier oil. To make a 1% solution, mix 4 drops of essential oil with 4 teaspoons of carrier oil.Remember to test a small area of the skin for any sensitivity before continuing.

, Always use the diluted solution you made when you apply essential oils topically. You can either dab the solution onto the skin using your fingertips or you can dip a cotton ball in the solution and dab it on the skin. Consider applying essential oils topically to relieve:Bug and spider bites
Small rashes that cover only a few inches of skin (If it's a large rash, take your child to the pediatrician).
Minor bumps, scrapes and bruises

Call your child’s doctor.,
Gather all necessary paperwork.,
Make a list of health changes.,
Prepare a list of questions.",How to Take Your Child for a Back‐to‐School Checkup1," The first step in taking your child for a back to school checkup is scheduling an appointment. To schedule the back to school checkup, call your child’s doctor's office. Be sure to call well in advance to ensure you get an appointment before the school year starts.Set a date and time that is convenient. This will involve checking your own schedule and checking your child’s schedule. This might involve coordinating with other children and adjusting your other responsibilities, as this time of year is typically very busy for pediatricians.
For instance, you should find out if your child will be at summer camp during the date and time when their back to school checkup is scheduled, in which case you should reschedule the appointment.;
, If you have not been to the doctor your child will be seeing for their back to school checkup, your insurance information will not be on file. Therefore, you’ll need to bring your insurance card with your policy number and a photo ID.Check the doctor or hospital’s website for information about which insurance is accepted. If you cannot locate a list of insurance providers that the doctor accepts, contact their office for more information.

, If your child has had any health issues or problems since their last visit to the doctor, write them down on a list, or bring in copies of any medical records you may have. Unless your child was treated by the same doctor who will be administering the back to school checkup, bring associated paperwork, too, such as bloodwork results or other medical records. Make sure to note any allergies your child has, as well, including any allergies to medication.Your list should also include important life changes such as the introduction of a new sibling or the loss of a friend or family member.

, If you have questions about your child’s health, you should feel free to ask them when you take your child for a back to school checkup. For instance, you might want to ask your child’s doctor:Is my child growing at a normal rate?
Is my child at a healthy weight?
My child has a strange habit. Is it normal?
What can I do to ensure my child remains healthy?

"
"
Help your child understand the purpose for the doctor’s visit.,
Explain to your child what will happen at the back to school checkup.,
Keep your child from worrying about the checkup.,
Choose the right doctor.",How to Take Your Child for a Back‐to‐School Checkup2," If your child has not been to the doctor’s in some time, remind them of why the checkup is important. Say, “Before returning to school, you need a back to school checkup. It will help you stay healthy and strong.”, If your child is relatively young (age eight or below), you might try role-playing with your child. For instance, you might take the role of doctor to show your child what the back to school checkup will be like. You might say to your child, “Okay, now open your mouth” and peer inside your child’s mouth. You might give your child a gentle squeeze around their arm and explain, “This is what it’s like to have a blood pressure cuff on.”Look for children’s books of an appropriate age level for your child that deal with going to the doctor. Read the book with your child to help them learn more about back to school checkups.
Encourage your child to ask you questions about the doctor’s office and the checkup before you go.
Encourage your child to ask questions of the doctor when they are getting the checkup.

, If your child is young, they might worry about going for the back to school checkup. After telling your young child that they will soon be going to a back to school checkup, ask them how it makes them feel. With luck, the young child will reply, “happy” or “excited.” However, if your young child says they are afraid of the checkup and not looking forward to it, allay your child’s fearsLet your child know that you will remain with them throughout the checkup. This will free them from worrying about separation.
If you know your child will need to get a shot (vaccination, flu shot, or a similar procedure involving a sharp needle) tell your child that the shot will only sting a little, and that there is no need to worry about it. Remind the child that they are very brave and will have no trouble managing a shot, should it be necessary.
Always talk about the doctor and the back to school checkup in a positive way to put the child’s mind at ease.
If your child is older – say, a tween – they will probably not have anxieties about the purpose of back to school checkups. In this case, just listen to your child attentively and address any concerns related to the checkup they might bring to you, such as scheduling conflicts, what parts of their body will be examined, and how long the process will take., A good doctor for your child will not only be knowledgeable and thorough, but also friendly, interested, and sympathetic toward your child. If your child’s doctor seems aloof and does not relate well to your child, your child might find getting a back to school checkup (and future doctor visits) an unpleasant chore.Don’t be afraid to change your child’s doctor if you believe your child could be getting better care.
If you’re going to a new doctor, it can be hard to determine whether or not the doctor and the child will have a good relationship. In this case, you could ask friends for recommendations or read online reviews.
Most importantly, though, pay attention to the doctor’s interaction with your child during the back to school checkup. Use it as test run to determine if the doctor is worth returning to again for next year’s back to school checkup.

Transport your child to the doctor’s office.,
Get the basics.,
Get your child vaccinated.,
Ask the questions you have.",How to Take Your Child for a Back‐to‐School Checkup3," On the day of the appointment, collect your child’s medical and insurance information. Don’t forget your list of questions. Go to your child’s doctor with your child.Plan on getting to the doctor’s office about 15 minutes before you’re scheduled to be there. This will give you some wiggle room in the event you hit traffic or have some unexpected trouble arriving.
There may be additional fees for not showing up to your child’s back to school checkup. If you need to cancel, do so ahead of time.

, There are many things that could be examined during your child’s back to school checkup. The specific items that your child’s doctor will be interested in examining will vary depending on your child’s age. But there are a few standard metrics that any back to school checkup should include.For a comprehensive list of checkup occasions and associated items for examination, check out http://kidshealth.org/en/parents/checkups.html?WT.ac=ctg#catcheckupsubcat.

, If your child has not been vaccinated against all or most major illnesses by the time they are school-aged, let your doctor know. Get your child immunized against illnesses like polio, hepatitis A and B, tuberculosis, varicella (chicken pox), measles, mumps, and rubella, as well as any others required by their school.Your doctor will let you know if and when your child needs vaccinations based on where they are on their immunization schedule.
Getting your child vaccinated is not only a commonsense health decision, it’s also law in many places. Most U.S. states, for instance, require that your child receive vaccination for certain illnesses before enrolling in school., Since you’ve made a big effort to write down your questions for the doctor, it is important to ask your questions when your doctor administers the back to school exam. Request clarification on anything confusing.Being actively engaged in your child’s health will send a good message to your child that they, too, should feel free to question doctors and other authority figures regarding issues that concern them.

Remind your child to wash their hands.,
Encourage physical activity.,
Practice healthy eating habits with your child.,
Help your child get enough sleep.,
Get your child a flu shot.",How to Take Your Child for a Back‐to‐School Checkup4," Regular hand-washing throughout the day can keep your child free of germs and bacteria that cause illness. Before sending your child back to school, refresh them on how to wash their hands by demonstrating the proper technique.First, show your child how to wet their hands beneath the running water.
Next, show them how to rub the soap between their hands to work up a lather.
After that, instruct your child to scrub their hands by moving them back and forth, not forgetting to scrub the webbing between fingers and the backs of the hands.
Finally, tell your child to rinse their hands under the running water to remove the soap, turn off the tap, and dry their hands on a soft towel.

, Limit your child’s screen time and find ways to keep them active. For instance, go on family bike rides together at the park, or take walks around the park. Play catch in the yard. In winter, go ice skating and skiing with your child.Make physical activity a family affair to get your child in the habit of exercising.
Provide your child with opportunities to participate in team sports through community sporting leagues.
Getting your child in the habit of exercising will help them maintain their health throughout their life.

, Help encourage your child's overall health by teaching them proper nutrition. Encourage them to choose fruits, vegetables, and lean protein. Don't focus on the scale, though. Instead, focus on portion sizes by doing things like reading food labels with them, and encourage them to stop eating when they feel full.Try to avoid demonizing foods like sodas and candies. Instead, be positive about foods like fresh produce and whole grains. Teach your children that sweets are alright in moderation, but that other foods, like veggies, can be eaten more often.
Keep healthy food in the house. Kids are not going to make healthy choices if they do not have access to tasty, nutritious options.
Allow kids to be active in their meals. Give them options and let them pick what they want to eat, and allow them to help you in cooking process.

, If your child doesn’t get enough sleep, they will be more likely to be cranky and moody the next day. Lack of sleep can also result in an inability to focus in school and an overall lack of energy. Give your child a regular bedtime so that they will always get the right amount of sleep and wake up fully rested.The amount of sleep your child needs depends on its age. Preschoolers need 11-12 hours of sleep each night. Primary school-aged children need about 10 hours of sleep. Teens need between 9-10 hours of sleep.Keep your child’s room dark to encourage deeper sleep.

, Influenza (the flu) is one of the most common ailments among children. A flu shot will prevent the flu and is often included in the back to school checkup. Without a flu shot, your child is at greater risk of dehydration, sinus infections, pneumonia, and complications related to other conditions like asthma and diabetes.Do not insist on getting your child a flu shot if your child had a previous reaction or if they’re not feeling well.
Your child’s doctor will determine if your child needs a flu shot, but it's ultimately your call.

Pay attention to foods that seem to increase your child’s diarrhea.,
Offer small meals throughout the day.,
Try the BRAT diet.,
Add a cup of yogurt to your child’s daily diet.,
Consider offering your child one high-fat food option each day.",How to Stop Diarrhea in Kids1," Your child’s appetite should not change as a result of diarrhea, so you should be able to offer the same foods as usual. However, if your child seems to have increased diarrhea after eating something, then you may not want to offer that food to your child until he is better.


Try to stick to foods that you know your child can tolerate without an issue and avoid introducing new foods while your child has diarrhea.Children with diarrhea may temporarily have difficulty digesting dairy products, so you may want to hold off on dairy until he is well.;
, Large meals may make diarrhea more severe, so you may want to encourage your child to eat smaller meals spaced evenly throughout the day. Try to encourage your child to eat six small meals throughout the day to see if that helps to stop or at least reduce diarrhea symptoms., Increasing your child’s fiber intake may help to reduce symptoms of diarrhea, so the BRAT diet may be a good option.When using the BRAT diet, you will only feed your child bland foods such as bananas, rice (brown rice), applesauce, and toast(whole wheat). These foods are thought to be easier for your child to digest. Some studies have even shown that diarrhea goes away faster when kids eat foods that are easy to digest. Some other easy to digest foods that you may consider offering your child include:Pasta
Cooked beans
Mashed potatoes
Mashed carrots
Pretzels
Salty crackers

, Yogurt can rebalance the bacteria in your child’s gut, which may help to stop diarrhea.If your child has a favorite kind of yogurt, try offering some as a snack.


Look for yogurt that has live or active cultures, such as Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium bifidum.
Your child may be more interested in eating the yogurt if you allow her to pick it out in the store. Try asking your child to select a couple of flavors in the market.

, Offering your child an occasional high-fat food may help put a stop to your child’s diarrhea as well. This is especially helpful for children with ""toddler's diarrhea,"" which is a chronic mild diarrhea in toddlers. Some good options include:Whole fat milk
Olive oil
Cheese
Ice cream

"
"
Encourage your child to drink plenty of water.,
Offer flavored ice.,
Start your child’s day with a bowl of cereal and milk.,
Give your child a cup of broth or soup.",How to Stop Diarrhea in Kids2," Diarrhea can cause severe dehydration for kids, so it is important to encourage your child to drink plenty of water while he is dealing with diarrhea.Try filling up a water bottle and encouraging your child to carry it around and drink from it throughout the day. Refill the water bottle for your child (or ask your child’s teacher to refill it) if it becomes empty.


Do not give your child electrolyte solutions unless your child’s pediatrician advises you to. These are often only necessary if your child is becoming dehydrated.
Do not give your child sports drinks, sodas or juice. The high sugar content in these beverages can make diarrhea worse., You can also offer your child a frozen ice pop or two throughout the day to provide more fluids.Try choosing popsicles that are low sugar or make some of your own using popsicle molds. You can fill them with water and add slices of fresh fruit to make them more appealing to your child.

, Offering a bowl of cereal with milk is another good way to provide your child with some extra fluid to replenish lost fluids and help prevent dehydration.Ask your child to choose her favorite cereal and top it with a half cup of milk. Encourage your child to drink the milk as well.
However, if your child seems to have more diarrhea after consuming dairy products, then you may want to hold off on milk for a few days.

, Another way to give your child more fluid is to offer some broth or soup as a snack or as a meal. You can offer your child some chicken broth or even a clear broth-based soup, such as chicken noodle or vegetable soup. The salt in the soup may also help your child's body to hold on to more of the fluids."

Call your child’s pediatrician.,
Consider possible causes of diarrhea.,
Check for possible causes of chronic diarrhea.,
Seek immediate treatment if your child shows signs of dehydration.,
Watch for serious symptoms.",How to Stop Diarrhea in Kids3," If your child has had a sudden change in the frequency or consistency of his or her bowel movements, then diarrhea is probably to blame. You can treat your child’s diarrhea at home, but you should still talk to your child’s pediatrician about the best course of action. Diarrhea can be the result of food sensitivities, infections, or something else that may need medical treatment.

, When diarrhea lasts for less than two weeks, it is called acute diarrhea. This form of diarrhea is common, but it can be severe. Acute diarrhea may be due to:Inflammation
Bacterial or viral infections
Antibiotic use
Food sensitivities, food allergies, or food “poisoning”

, Chronic diarrhea is less common, but it can also be severe. Chronic diarrhea is when diarrhea lasts for more than two weeks. Chronic diarrhea may be due to:Dietary factors
Infections
Inflammatory Bowel Disease
Celiac disease

, Your child’s diarrhea should improve within three to four days. If your child does not improve and/or your child shows signs of dehydration, then call your physician right away. Take your child to the emergency room if you cannot reach your physician. Signs of dehydration in children include:Crying without any tears
Dry or sticky mouth or tongue
Sunken-looking eyes
Infrequent urination or dry diapers
Lethargy or excessive sleepiness
Increased irritability
Dizziness
Vomiting
Fever over 101°F (38.3°C)

, Some serious symptoms may accompany diarrhea that can indicate an emergency situation. Take your child to an emergency room or call 911 if you notice any of these serious symptoms, which include:Bloody stools

Feed children more fruit, veggies, and whole grains.,
Limit saturated fats and refined carbohydrates.,
Reduce sugary food and drink consumption.,
Talk with your kids about nutrition.,
Invite your kids to help plan or cook.",How to Reduce Heart Disease Risk Factors in Children1," One of easiest ways to provide kids with better nutrition is by getting them to eat more fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. While this can be challenging initially, kids will often prefer meals rich in these ingredients once they’re used to them.The high amounts of fiber and nutrients in these types of food will keep kids feeling full for longer, preventing unnecessary empty calorie consumption and other dietary habits that lead to unhealthy weight gains.
One way to immediately improve the nutritional value of the foods in your shopping cart is by avoiding packaging. The more fresh food you provide your children, the less low-value nutritional food they consume.;
, Foods such as red meats and full fat dairy products should only be consumed occasionally. This is especially important for children, as the dietary habits they pick up early in their lives are likely to persist into adulthood.If you do allow your children to consume dairy products, go for low-fat or fat-free options when they are two years old or older.
Limit red meat to a few servings per week.
Avoid processed, pre-packaged food as much as possible.

, A shockingly high amount of the food produced today contains high amounts of sugar - or worse, high fructose corn syrup. While the natural sugars in fruit are not a concern, large amounts of added sugar in a box of cereal or a pre-packaged bread, for instance, should be avoided. Packaged sweets are some of the worst foods to provide your children, as they will often contain high amounts of sugar, as well as unhealthy fats and heavily processed carbohydrates.While these types of ingredients may not affect a child’s heart directly, they are significant risk factors for the development of diabetes and obesity, both of which could put your child at greater risk for heart disease.
Consider disallowing your children from drinking sugary carbonated beverages. If you do allow them to drink soda, only allow it on special occasions.
Only provide 100% juice to your children, and keep portions small.

, You won’t always be able to control what children eat. In fact, the older they get, the more autonomy they will have in terms of what they eat. Even if your home is filled with only healthy foods, it’s important to mention things like smaller portions and healthy options. One particularly important discussion to have is about different types of fat.Avoid using food as a reward.
If issues with nutrition persist for your child, seek nutritional counseling. A professional will be able to talk to a child directly about all of the factors that are important to their personal eating behavior, and to you about meal patterns, etc.

, There's a good chance your child will enjoy helping you plan or prepare the family meal. Examples of specific activities include visiting the grocery store together, planning what you'll eat the next few days, and preparing ingredients.Talk about why you choose or use specific items, particularly in terms of nutrition. For instance, say things like, ""We'll get this whole wheat bread because the grains used to bake it were not processed, and are healthier for us to eat.""
While cooking, ask a kid which task they'd like to be in charge of. For instance, let them cover a certain task on their own, such as shucking the corn, mixing ingredients together, or setting the timer.

Allow ample playtime for young children.,
Encourage an hour of activity for children over five.,
Limit screen time.,
Encourage increased activity as children age.,
Start slow with resistant children.,
Set an example by exercising yourself.",How to Reduce Heart Disease Risk Factors in Children2," If your child is under five, allow them to determine their own activity levels by giving them plenty of time to play. The important components of play at this age are safety and support. Provide age appropriate toys, often meant to touch, rearrange, or look at., From age five into adulthood, children should exercise for at least an hour every day. Recreational, or “moderate” everyday activities include jogging, biking, and team sports that are stop-and-go, such as baseball. About three days of the week, a child's daily exercise should be more vigorous. Examples of appropriate aerobic or “vigorous” physical activity include running, playing tennis, or playing more active team sports, like basketball or soccer.When your child is young, be sure that some family time is spent doing physical activity. For instance, go on hikes together. You don’t have to push them to exercise heavily - but it’s important to get outside and move around a bit every day.

, Children should not spend more than two hours a day watching TV or playing video games. This is partly because these behaviors lead to sedentary lifestyles, and establish dangerous behavioral trends that are hand to change as someone ages. Meanwhile, physical activity patterns - which are most more likely when they are encouraged - often persist into adulthood.Avoid exposing children under two to video entertainment of any sort.

, As a person reaches their teenage years, increased physical activity can improve cardiovascular health even further. In fact, as people approach and enter adulthood, encourage them to shoot for two and half hours of moderate physical activity per day. An hour of more vigorous activity is also sufficient.This amount of exercise can reduce an individual’s risk of developing coronary heart disease by roughly 30%.

, With the rise in popularity of sedentary activities, you may get some resistance from young people when you encourage them to exercise. Keep in mind that if they remain inactive, they are are much greater risk of heart disease and other health conditions.In fact, persistent inactivity into adulthood can effectively double someone’s chances of experiencing a heart condition. Fortunately, even small amounts of physical activity can help immensely.

, One of the best ways to help motivate children to be more active is by being active yourself. Best of all, exercise together. Go for a walk after dinner, or bring a ball or other toy to a park near your home. On weekends, plan outings that include physical activity, such as hikes at nearby state parks.Even just two hours of walking per week can have a significantly positive effect on both your own and your children's cardiovascular health. This is in part because exercise helps prevent risk factors, such as obesity, from developing.

Breastfeed your baby.,
Do not expose your children to tobacco products.,
Have cholesterol levels tested.,
Measure a child’s BMI.,
Screen children for other potential risk factors.,
Talk to your family doctor about more serious risks.",How to Reduce Heart Disease Risk Factors in Children3," Believe it or not, breastfeeding your baby reduces the likelihood that they will develop several conditions that are risks factors for heart disease later in life. In fact, breastfeeding should be the exclusive form of feeding your baby for the first six months of their life. You should also continue to breastfeed until they are about a year old.However, if you are unable to breastfeed, don't feel guilty. Talk to your doctor about the best formula to feed your baby.

, Exposure to first and second hand smoke can contribute to many health maladies, including heart disease. Meanwhile, be aware that many young people experiment with tobacco use during high school - but that if they stay smoke-free through school, they are highly unlikely to use tobacco regularly.Cigarette smoking causes as much as 75% of the cases of childhood heart disease in those who are otherwise not at risk.
Talk to your children about the negative effects of smoking. These include discolored teeth, bad breath, and weakened lungs and muscles.
If you smoke, do not do so around your children, nor in any environments that they occupy, such as your car or home. Strongly consider quitting smoking, as your behavior increases the likelihood that your children will smoke too.
If you believe your child smokes, point out the reasons they should quit in an understanding, supportive manner. Mention that they will will longer, healthier lives and save considerable money by quitting. Have them talk to a healthcare professional about it too.

, Have your child’s lipids levels tested within a year of their tenth birthday, and then again between the ages of seventeen and twenty one. While it may seem a bit early to test a nine or ten year old, early testing can help lead to better control of your child’s cholesterol and a reduced risk of heart disease as they age.Your doctor may check your child's lipids sooner if they have risk factors.


Sometimes, high cholesterol is hereditary. Often, however, it is the effect of eating too much meat, dairy, and other foods with lots of saturated fat.
If you and your doctor discover that your child does have high cholesterol, follow their advice regarding behavioral changes and potential treatment options.

, Obesity is one of the most common risk factors for heart disease. This factor is especially significant for children. While many young people have yet to fully grow into their bodies, obesity is a medical condition based on the portion of fat that makes up an individual’s body mass. In order to ensure your child is not obese, you can calculate their BMI, or body mass index.An individual’s BMI is calculated by dividing weight (in kilograms) by height (in meters squared).
You can find free BMI calculators online. Usually scored in terms of percentile vs. the average, online calculators will include a chart that factors in your child’s age and gender.
The most likely cause of obesity is eating more calories than you burn.
If your child is obese, begin working to adjust their dietary behavior, as well as helping them become more active. See a doctor soon too, as there may be a medical cause.
Also, keep in mind that BMI is not always accurate for every body type, especially for more muscular teenagers. Your doctor will use the BMI along with other factors to determine your child's risk of obesity.

, There are several other factors that may put your child at greater risk of developing heart disease. For example, high blood pressure can increase their risk, and this often goes undetected in young people. Ensure that this test is done regularly at annual check-ups. Other factors that should be discussed with your child’s doctor include:Any sleep issues your child experiences.
Any family history of heart conditions or diabetes.
If your child is obese, they should also regularly be screened for diabetes.

, There are other medical conditions that can greatly increase the risk of heart disease as well. Aside from diabetes, be aware that kidney disease, organ transplant, and Kawasaki disease place your child at considerable risk.Other significant risk factors that will need to be addressed professionally include accelerated atherosclerosis before age 30, persistent inflammatory conditions, and HIV.
Mental health issues may also place your child at greater risk and should always be mentioned to your child’s medical doctor.

Give your child the proper medication.,
Use only one type of fever reduction medication.,
Cool your child off with water.,
Keep your child well hydrated.,
Make sure your child rests.",How to Reduce Fever for Children1," Administer a dose of children's acetaminophen or ibuprofen.The Mayo Clinic says to only use fever-reducing medications when the fever is above 102 °F (38.9 °C).Most pediatricians recommend treating a fever above 102 °F (38.9 °C), or if the child is uncomfortable with any degree of fever.
Both acetaminophen and ibuprofen products are available over the counter and are effective at reducing fever. It is safe to give acetaminophen to children who are over 2 months old, and it is safe to give ibuprofen to children who are more than 6 months old. Refer to the dosing guide on the product package or ask your doctor or pharmacist to measure an appropriate dose based on a child's weight.Acetaminophen will keep the fever down for four to six hours, and ibuprofen will lower the fever for six to eight hours.;
, Do not alternate doses of acetaminophen and ibuprofen unless instructed to by a physician. This method may be used in rare cases when the fever is above 104 °F (40 °C) and does not decrease after administering one type of medication., Sponge the child in lukewarm water if the temperature remains above 104 °F (40 °C) 30 minutes after you have administered medication.Sit the child in 2 inches (5.1 cm) of water that is 85 to 90 °F (29 to 32 °C). Use a sponge or washcloth to continuously moisten his bare skin.Shivering will cause the child’s body temperature to rise, so slightly increase the water temperature if necessary.Alternatively, you can apply a lukewarm, wet cloth on forehead, hands, and feet to reduce the temperature., Keep children hydrated with water, juice, popsicles, clear broth or drinks containing electrolytes that are intended to rehydrate the body.Have the child take small sips of water every 15 to 20 minutes.
Juice and sports drinks, like Gatorade or Powerade, are not recommended for infants under one year old, as they don't provide the proper balance of electrolytes in young children.Pedialyte, or other electrolyte replacement drinks designed for children, are ideal for ensuring proper hydration., When combatting a fever, it is of the utmost importance that your child gets plenty of rest."

You can also put protective covers on your child’s mattress and pillows so they are not exposed to dust or other things that could make their allergies worse.You should also get in the habit of washing any fabric items in your child’s bedroom, such as stuffed animals and blankets they may sleep with. Throw these items in the washer to remove any dirt or dust.;
, Make a daily inspection to find and remove any mold or mildew that may be accumulating in your child's space. These elements can make their allergies worse. Check for mold and mildew in areas that are often wet, such as the bathroom. Check the windows in your child's room for mold spots as well as any areas on the ceiling.The best way to get rid of mold and mildew is by using chlorine cleaners.
Bring in professionals to remove and repair the sources of significant or recurring mold accumulations.

, Clean the carpets in your child’s room and your home on a weekly basis by vacuuming them. Carpet can hold in allergens that can make your child’s symptoms worse, such as dust mites and pet dander.You should also get the habit of wiping off dust on window sills and shelves on a regular basis so your child is not exposed to this allergen.
If possible remove carpet and install hardwood floors that don’t accumulate allergens and easier to clean than carpet.

, If you have dogs or cats at home, try to keep them out of your child’s space. Pets carry dander that can make your child’s allergies worse. You may get in the habit of keeping your child’s door closed during the day so the pets cannot get in there. Or you may create a fenced off area so your pets cannot get into other rooms in your home.You should also get in the habit of keeping the windows in your child’s room closed. This will prevent airborne allergens from getting into their room as well as any pets that may be outside.

, You can soothe a child with a runny or congested nose by adding moisture to the air with a humidifier. Set up a humidifier in their room so moisture can circulate in their space and reduce their allergy symptoms. You can find humidifiers online or at your local hardware store.Make sure you clean the filter in the humidifier on a regular basis, following the directions on the label otherwise you can make your child’s allergies worse.
If you cannot afford to buy a humidifier, use your bathroom shower to add moisture to the air. Turn on the shower to hot and let the room fill up with steam. Keep the door closed. Then, go into the bathroom with your child and sit in there with them for 15 minutes. Do this for 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes at night to help clear out your child’s nasal passages., To make sure your child is getting fresh, clear air indoors, you can get an air purifier. Breathing in air free of allergens can soothe your child’s symptoms. Put the air purifier in their bedroom or have several throughout the house so the air is clean indoors. You can find air purifiers that can actually filter out pollen, dust, and bacteria in the air so your home is free of allergens.You can buy air purifiers online or at your local hardware store. Look for air purifiers that are designed to filter out allergens in the air.

Treat other symptoms, when necessary.",How to Reduce Fever for Children2," Dress feverish children in lightweight clothing and cover them with a thin blanket or sheet only if they are shivering or complaining of being cold.Heavy clothing and blankets prevent the body from naturally cooling itself., Lower the thermostat so the room temperature is slightly cooler than usual. Keep a fan close, if necessary, to keep your child cool.You can also open the windows if it is not too cold outside. Generally, anything below 68 °F (20°C) outside would be too cold for a child with a fever., When your child is awake, make sure he or she has a comfortable, supportive pillow to rest his or her head on., Extra or unnecessary movement will raise the body temperature in your child, so be sure they rest in one place and bring them what they need. Never allow your child to engage in strenuous activities when he or she is running a fever., You should know whether a fever is going up or down, or if it is staying steady. Check your child’s temperature often and make sure you are following the proper instructions for thermometer use.Never use an oral thermometer on a child who has just drank or eaten something cold. This can skew the results the thermometer gives you.Rectal thermometers provide the most accurate results, especially for children under one year old, but are uncomfortable for the child and are more difficult for you to use when trying to get a proper reading., Most children who are running a fever will show other symptoms of illness, such as a stuffy or runny nose, sneezing, a headache, an upset stomach, or other physical symptoms. Use safe and effective measures to treat those other symptoms, as they can prevent your child from resting comfortably, which will ultimately help in reducing the fever."

, If your child has a congested nose or irritated sinuses, you can irrigate this area using a saline solution. Try using a Neti pot with saline solution to flush out your child’s nose and make it easier for them to breathe. You can use the Neti pot on each nostril to clean out the area.You can also use a saline solution nasal spray, found at most health stores or online.
Another option is to use a bulb syringe to suck out gunk in your child's nose to help remove the congestion.
If your child has a sore or irritated throat, you may have them gargle salt water to help remove bacteria and soothe the area. Make sure your child does not swallow any of the salt water as this can lead to stomach issues.

, Honey is a natural antiseptic and anti-inflammatory. Give your child a spoonful of honey a day to help relieve an itchy throat. You can also put honey in hot water with fresh lemon and have your child drink it to relieve their symptoms.Another option is to have your child suck on the honey by putting it on a popsicle stick or a spoon. They may enjoy sucking it and consume it more easily this way.
Keep in mind you should only give honey to children that are 12 months or older.

, This is a good option if your child has a cough as a result of allergies. Apply an over-the-counter chest rub like Vicks Vapor Rub or Tiger Balm on your child’s chest once a day. Make sure the chest rub does not get in their eyes or mouth as it can sting. Put the chest rub on your child at night to help them sleep despite their cough.Do not apply chest rub products to children younger than two years of age. It can cause breathing difficulties in babies and toddlers.

, Often when a child is allergic to something, one of the first symptoms that shows up is red and itchy eyes. If your child has irritated eyes due to their allergies, give them eye drops. Look for eye drops that are lubricating and have antihistamines. Give your child the eye drops several times a day for a few days. Follow the dosage instructions on the label.If your child’s eye issues do not improve after four to five days, you may want to bring them to the doctor. You should not give them the eye drops for a prolonged period of time.

, Giving your child warm water to drink will facilitate the clearing of their sinuses. You can also try to add a little bit of honey and lemon to flavor the drink for your child. However, remember to avoid giving honey to your child if your child is younger than one year old.

Buy over-the-counter antihistamines.,
Get your child decongestants.,
Speak to your child’s pediatrician if their symptoms do not improve.",How to Soothe Your Child's Allergies3," If your child’s allergies do not improve with home care or adjustments in their environment, you should consider getting OTC antihistamines. Antihistamines block the histamines in the air that are causing your child’s allergies. Some can be taken every four to six hours and some can be taken every 12 to 24 hours. Look for antihistamines at your local drugstore.You should talk to your child’s doctor before giving them antihistamines to make sure they are suitable for your child. Most OTC antihistamines are safe for use by children.
Some antihistamines such as Benadryl have common side effects that include drowsiness and dry mouth. However, other antihistamines such as Claritin are not sedating. You can give 10 mg of Claritin to children 6 years of age and older to prevent seasonal allergies.
You can give your child antihistamines such as Benadryl before bed, before allergy season kicks in, or whenever they are having allergy symptoms, while non-sedating antihistamines can be used during the day.

, If your child has allergy symptoms like a stuffy nose or blocked sinuses, you can get over-the-counter decongestants. Decongestants come in pill, liquid, or spray form. Make sure you follow the dosage instructions and do not give your child decongestants for a prolonged period of time. You can try combining a decongestant with antihistamine medication to address your child’s allergies.Keep in mind decongestants can cause your child to become hyper or have difficulty sleeping. If you are concerned about giving your child decongestants, talk to your child’s doctor.

, If your child’s allergies do not get better through over-the-counter medication, you may want to speak to your child’s pediatrician. The pediatrician may recommend taking your child to an allergist to determine the exact cause of their allergies. They may also suggest giving your child an allergy shot to reduce their symptoms.Often, a series of weekly allergy injections over a few months can help to reduce severe allergy symptoms in children.

Limit the amount of fat in your child's diet.If your child has high cholesterol and you are trying to reduce his or her levels, an important place to start is by reducing your child's daily fat consumption.,
Opt for low-fat milk and other low-fat dairy products.One of the easiest ways to cut back on fat in your child's diet is to choose milk and dairy products that are of the lowest fat content possible.,
Select whole foods for your child to eat.Many processed foods are high in saturated fat and low in fiber and nutrients.,
Include lean protein in your child's diet.,
Cook homemade meals and avoid fast or frozen food.The overall health of meals made at home from scratch is far superior to ""fast food"" alternatives (be it frozen foods or processed foods).,
Learn your child's target weight.If your child is overweight or obese, know that this is a big risk factor that contributes to high cholesterol levels.,
Increase your child's aerobic exercise.Aerobic exercise is any form of exercise that increases your child's heart rate for a sustained period of time.,
Make exercise fun.,
Think about making exercise a family activity.It may be easier to motivate your child to exercise if it is something that the whole family gets involved in, such as going to the park to play, or using the weekend to go on an outdoor adventure.,
Get your child's cholesterol levels tested.If you suspect that your child may have high cholesterol (due to a family history of the condition, obesity, a poor diet, a sedentary lifestyle, or previous high cholesterol measurements), it is important to have your child's cholesterol values measured.,
Have a repeat blood test in three months.If your child's first blood test comes back positive for high cholesterol, the doctor will likely recommend starting with some lifestyle changes (such as changes to your child's diet and exercise).,
Start a cholesterol-lowering medication.Medications to lower cholesterol are offered to children over the age of 8, should their cholesterol levels continue to be elevated even after changes to their lifestyle.,
Understand the importance of reducing your child's cholesterol.If your child has been diagnosed with high cholesterol, this puts him or her at risk of developing build-ups on the artery walls called ""plaques.""",How to Reduce Cholesterol in Children," Fat should compose less than 30% of your child's daily calories. Specifically, saturated fat should be less than 10% of your child's daily calories, and trans fat should be avoided altogether. Cholesterol should be limited to less than 200mg per day.


Read the labels on the food you purchase for information on the fat content of various foods.
Note that these guidelines on fat consumption do not apply to children under the age of 2.;
, Skim milk or 1% milk is ideal.

, Select whole foods for your child to eat instead to ensure that your child is getting plenty of cholesterol lowering fiber and other beneficial nutrients.


Increase your child's consumption of fruits and vegetables.
Feed your child more complex carbohydrates that have a low glycemic index, such as whole wheat pasta, quinoa, oats, and brown rice.
Choose foods with healthier fats, such as fish, avocado, and nuts, as these are much better for your child's overall health., Lean protein sources are essential for your child's health. Lean sources of protein also contain less fat and cholesterol, so replacing fatty protein sources with lean ones may help to reduce your child's cholesterol numbers as well. Some good lean protein sources include:skinless poultry such as chicken and turkey
lean cuts of beef or pork
fish such as shrimp, cod, crab, and tuna
beans such as chickpeas, black beans, pintos, and kidney beans
egg whites
tofu

,


Taking the time to cook healthy meals from scratch will not only improve your child's cholesterol levels, but will also teach him or her the importance of putting an effort into healthy nutrition and cooking habits. This is a valuable life skill that will positively influence your child for the rest of his or her life.
Learn how to use healthy cooking methods and cook healthy meals at home instead of eating out.

, Ask your child's doctor for help in determining what your child's ideal body weight should be. This depends on a number of factors, including age, height, sex, and bone structure.


Your child's doctor can chart your child's weight on an age- and sex-adjusted growth chart, which will provide valuable information about your child's weight.
Your child's doctor can also chart your child's ""BMI"" (body mass index) which corrects the weight in relationship to your child's height, providing an even more accurate picture of how your child's current body weight compares to his or her ideal.

, At least 60 minutes of aerobic exercise is recommended every day. Aerobic exercise increases your child's HDL cholesterol, which is the ""good cholesterol.""


Having more good cholesterol reduces the impact of the bad cholesterol (LDL cholesterol), which has a negative effect on the body. That is why higher levels of the good cholesterol (HDL) are actually beneficial for your child's health, and these can be increased through exercise.
Exercise also helps with weight loss, which can also help to reduce bad cholesterol.

, Adults often enjoy activities like jogging, swimming, brisk walking, or riding a bike; however, for children, it may be helpful to incorporate more fun into their exercise routine. Consider signing your child up for sports that get his or her heart rate up, like soccer or basketball, that your child can do alongside his or her friends.


Signing up for a sport will also ensure that your child stays committed.

,


No matter what activity your child does for exercise, make sure that the activity is consistent and that your child enjoys doing it. This will motivate you child to keep up the positive lifestyle changes in the long-run.

, The official way to diagnose ""hypercholesterolemia"" (high cholesterol), and to proceed with treatments as needed, is via the blood test that can measure the cholesterol and total fat levels.


A child is eligible for medical treatment of high cholesterol if his or her LDL (""bad cholesterol"") is above 190mg/dL.
If your child has additional risk factors (such as a family history of high cholesterol, obesity, or high blood pressure), he or she will be eligible for treatment if the LDL cholesterol level exceeds 160mg/dL.
These are the current treatment guidelines as established by the American Academy of Pediatrics.

, You will then be asked to return for a repeat blood test in three months.


At three months, your child's doctor can assess whether the lifestyle changes were sufficient to bring your child's cholesterol back into the normal range or at least headed in the right direction.
If they were not, it is at this point (after the second blood test) that your child may be eligible to consider taking medication to reduce his or her cholesterol.

, Medications that your child can try include Cholestyramine, Colestipol, or Colesevelam. Your doctor may also try your child on a ""statin"" medication, such as Atorvastatin (Lipitor).


Your child will be advised to come back for a repeat blood test 3 months after beginning the new medication, to assess the effectiveness of it in terms of lowering cholesterol.
Your child's doctor will also check in at this time to ensure that the medication of choice is causing no bothersome side effects. However, make sure that you tell your child's doctor if you notice any side effects while your child is taking the medication.

, These plaques predispose your child to a heightened risk of future heart disease and strokes, among other health concerns.


Make sure that you follow through with treatment to reduce your child's cholesterol until your child's blood tests show that he or she is back in the normal range. You will also need to keep up the healthy changes to maintain your child's cholesterol at a healthy level.

Be alert for rashes.,
Look for red creases, known as Pastia’s lines.,
Check for a sore throat and fever.,
Know that other flu-like symptoms may appear.",How to Recognize and Treat Scarlet Fever1," When bathing or dressing your child, be aware of any patchy, red blotches on the skin. Scarlet fever rash shows bright red and feels rough to the touch, like sandpaper.The rash can emerge from two days after the child contracts the illness up to seven days afterwards.The rash may first appear on face, then spread down to the other body parts, arms first, then legs. You might see the patches first, and then bumps.It may also begin on the chest or neck.The rash resembles a sunburn. The red appearance is due to toxins that form with certain bacteria.If you exert pressure on the affected area, the skin will turn white, which can help you tell if it is a scarlet fever rash.
Once the rash has faded, your child's skin will begin to peel.;
, A specific way to tell if your child has scarlet fever is by examining folds of the skin. Check the neck, in the armpits, the groin area, along with elbows and knees. If you see red lines that are darker in color than the splotchy patches, it’s time to call the doctor.


The are due to fragile capillaries rupturing.

, The throat will be extremely red and irritated, often accompanied by swollen glands. The child will likely complain of pain and will probably beg to eat only ice cream and popsicles for the soothing effect. The throat might also show white or yellow patches. Your child may have a fever of 101°F (38.3° C) or higher., Your child might also get headaches. She might report having general body aches. Additionally, your child could have stomach cramps, become nauseated, and possibly throw up. If any of these symptoms occur alongside the sunburn-like rash, it could be scarlet fever."
"
Take your child to a trusted doctor.,
Administer the prescribed medicine.,
Follow instructions.",How to Recognize and Treat Scarlet Fever2," Make the appointment as soon as you notice multiple symptoms as listed above. Ensure that you ask many questions while in the doctor’s office. Physicians can be busy and accidentally skip over small details.

, In most instances, your child will have to take antibiotics to kill the bacteria that cause scarlet fever. Penicillin is often prescribed, as is amoxicillin. If your child is allergic to either of these common antibiotics, Macrolides or Clindamycin are alternatives. Your doctor can tell you which one will work for your child., All medications come with detailed information about how to use them. Don’t skip any of the steps or ignore any of the warnings.Read the instructions carefully, especially the warnings section. You need to know how to tell if your child is allergic to the medication. You also need to know if mixing it with any other medications the child is taking might further sicken him.
Be aware of how long the child should take the antibiotics. If the instructions say to take it for ten full days, then ten days it is, no matter if the child protests! Halting the use of the medicine will not rid the child of scarlet fever.
Give the appropriate dose. Do not give more or less than what is needed. For instance, don’t give your child two pills instead of one in the hopes of ridding him of the illness more quickly. You wouldn’t want your child to end up back at the doctor’s office.

Avoid people who are blowing their noses and coughing.,
Do not share utensils, glasses, or plates with an infected child.,
Seclude your child.,
Wash your hands with soap.",How to Recognize and Treat Scarlet Fever3," The bacteria that causes group A strep (that causes scarlet fever) comes from the nose and mouth. Scarlet fever spreads via bacteria in droplets of sneezes and coughs. Don’t let anyone spray you with their germs!, It might be faster to cut up her food, but get a different knife for your own use. The sick child’s germs can easily make their way into your system, too. You will be of no use to your beloved little one if you become ill., If there are other children in the home who are not infected, do not allow them to come into contact with the sick child or play in the same areas. Keep your child home from daycare or school as well. You don’t want other children to catch scarlet fever from your child., You should already be doing this regularly, so it is the easiest advice to follow. Hand washing rids your hands of germs that you could spread to your mouth, eyes or nose. Be sure to wash regularly and especially before eating and drinking."
"
Prefer organic and home-grown foods over other food.,
Take care with fish products.Smaller fish are safer for children's consumption; larger fish have lived longer and have had more time and space to accumulate pesticide and heavy metal residues including mercury, PCBs and dioxins.The cleanest fish are the smaller ones, including anchovies, sardines and mackerel.,
Use purified or filtered drinking water.,
Keep your home with green cleaning.,
Have a green garden.,
Reduce or eliminate the use of plastics in your home.,
Be careful of toys.,
Keep your cooking green and clean.,
Check your cookware.,
Ensure that the house is free of allergens and toxins from off-gassing and maintain indoor air quality.,
Don't expose your children to secondhand smoke.,
Keep medications to a minimum and only under the supervision of a certified health professional.",How to Reduce Your Children's Exposure to Chemicals," You don't have to break the bank to eat organic. There are some foods that should always be preferred in their organic form owing to the heavy use of pesticides to grow these foods. See Choose the Most Important Organic Foods for more details. Be sure to wash conventionally grown foods well, using a vinegar and water rinse (10% vinegar to 90% water) on fruit and vegetables prior to consumption. Preferring organic and home-grown foods will help reduce your child's exposure to pesticides.;
, Always prefer wild fish over farmed fish to avoid antibiotic overloads.

, This will remove many of the potential chemical contaminants that might impact your child's health. Cut back on or eliminate the use of bottled water; not only is this a very unsustainable and expensive way to consume water but the use of bisphenol A used to manufacture some bottles is considered to be of some concern.Although the jury is still out on these claims,it makes sense to use the municipal supply and reduce your ecological footprint anyway.

, Use eco-friendly and human-friendly cleaning products promoted by green cleaning. Avoid purchasing toxic cleaners and laundry products.Many of these products contain allergens, asthma triggers, endocrine-disrupting chemicals and carcinogens., As with household products, do not use chemical sprays, dusts and other products on your lawn and garden. Choose organic and eco-friendly solutions to garden maintenance. Be guided by the motto that if you could eat off it safely, your child can play on it safely.

, Plastic wraps, plastic food containers and drink containers contain plasticizers and other chemicals that are known carcinogens and endocrine disruptors.Choose glass for storage of food and for reheating and cooking of food. Keep away from plastic food wraps.

, Not all toys are benign. Plastic toys, especially, can be harmful to your child's health, containing such chemicals as phthalates.Toys from wood, cloth, natural fibers and paper are better choices for children than plastic toys. Be careful of painted wooden toys, however; check that the paint is non-toxic. Hand-me-down wooden toys may use lead-based paint - have them tested before passing them on.

, Avoid grilling food, as this form of cooking can create potentially carcinogenic compounds.Avoid charring meats or other foods on a barbecue and always cook foods on a barbecue outdoors and on gas or electricity, not with charcoal products.

, Some cookware is unhealthy when heated, such as Teflon™ products, which contain PFOA (perfluuoro-octanoic acid), considered to be a potential carcinogen.Better choices are stainless steel, cast iron (great source of iron!) or ceramic-coated steel. You can also try parchment/baking paper in the base of a skillet or pan for non-stick ""frying"".

, Remove mold whenever it grows; it is a known asthma trigger. Be careful of having carpet laid - choose low-allergen carpets with safe glues. Many floor coverings use formaldehyde based chemicals and the gases that are emitted impact children who tend to sit on the floor frequently.Prefer linoleum, natural carpets, bamboo flooring etc. Paints should also be chosen carefully as their contents can outgas harmful chemicals; select eco-friendly and natural paint options. Many companies are very conscious of this need now, so look them up and support them., There is no excuse for this one and remember not to smoke in the car; not even with the window down.

, Get a good doctor who has no fear in saying no to antibiotics for the sake of mollifying parental concern. Follow instructions and complete courses of antibiotics when they are needed.And keep the use of cough syrups, cough lozenges and other readily available self-chosen remedies to a minimum. Many of these products contain artificial colorings, flavorings and strong chemicals that children should not be exposed to.If a product says that it should not be administered to babies, infants, and children, follow that advice and don't use it.

Check for spinal area discoloration or birthmarks.,
Feel the spine for fatty lumps, protrusions, or dimples.,
Look for small clumps of hair along the spine.,
Consider potential severe symptoms.,
Look for an exposed sac of fluid.,
Look for eating or breathing issues.,
Be aware of an abnormally large head.,
Get a spinal column x-ray, MRI, or CT scan.",How to Recognize Spina Bifida Symptoms1," The color change could be the spot of neural tube incompletion. There may also be a malformation on the spine.Keep in mind that many birth marks are normal and do not indicate a problem. Ask your doctor to check any birth marks that you have along your spine if you suspect a problem.;
, There may be a malformation of the bone, fat, or membranes over the spine.This is usually a sign of closed neural tube issues.

, When the backbone doesn’t close the way it should, there is sometimes a tuft of hair at the opening. This can be undiagnosed until after birth, as with some other symptoms, because the ultrasound did not show the spine at the correct angle., In some cases of spina bifida, there may be some severe symptoms, such as lower body issues, which includes deformities as well as muscle weakness. These may include:


Physical and intellectual disabilities. However, most people with spina bifida without hydrocephalus are of normal intelligence.
Paralysis.
Urinary and bowel control problems.
Blindness and/or deafness (rarely)., The sac will be protruding from the spinal column area, which is either the meningocele (no spinal cord connection) or meningomyelocele (spinal cord connection) form of spina bifida. Sometimes there is a thin layer of skin covering the sac that protrudes from the back.Other associated symptoms follow:


Partial or total paralysis may occur.
Bladder and bowel problems are possible.

, A condition called Chiari II malformation is possible, where a portion of the brain protrudes lower into the neck area or spinal canal. This causes various issues, which also includes some upper arm function., A buildup of fluid around the brain, also called hydrocephalus, may occur, creating harmful pressure on the surrounding area. The most common indications of hydrocephalus in babies is an increased head size, but babies can potentially have a litany of symptoms including seizures, drowsiness, grouchiness, lowered eyes, and nausea or vomiting.Babies might develop meningitis, an infection in the tissues surrounding the brain. Meningitis can cause brain injury and threaten the life of the baby.
There may be learning disabilities such as short attention span, difficulties with language and reading, and problems with math., Usually this is for spina bifida occulta (SBO), the mildest form of spina bifida, but it can confirm other types as well. The primary method of discovering forms of SBO that may cause problems is an x-ray that can detect a small gap or abnormality of the spine, or less often a spinal cord that is tethered, thickened, contains a fatty lump, is split in two, or connected to skin. This can also be detected using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or computed tomography (CT) scan.Most people with SBO don't have any problems. However, there may be some other associated symptoms with SBO, such as:


Pain, numbness, or weakness in the back or legs
Deformed legs, feet, back
Change in bladder or bowel function"

Check for swollen cheeks.,
Look for flu like symptoms.,
Pay attention to the timeline of your symptoms.,
Seek medical treatment if you suspect you have the mumps.",How to Recognize Mumps Symptoms1," The best known symptom of a mumps infection is also often the last to present itself. The mumps virus affects the salivary glands in the mouth, which makes them swell and creates the appearance of swollen cheeks.The mumps virus will cause the cheeks to look swollen or puffy and feel warm to the touch.
Mumps is actually named as such because “mumps” was the term used to describe the puffy lumps or bumps in the cheeks.;
, The mumps virus might seem like a the common cold or a mild case of the flu when you first start to experience symptoms. In this early stage of infection, the only way you may be able to determine that your symptoms indicate the mumps is if you know you have been exposed to the virus recently. Common symptoms include:Fever and headache
Weakness, muscle aches and fatigue
Pain in the throat while chewing or swallowing and a loss of appetite
Swollen, painful testicles in adolescent boys, or swollen ovaries in adolescent girls, which can cause abdominal pain., The mumps virus can be nearly impossible to diagnose until symptoms present themselves. Unfortunately, symptoms of the mumps virus can take weeks to become apparent, and tend to be rather minor early on.Symptoms of the mumps virus usually do not present themselves until two to three weeks after exposure to the virus.
Symptoms may seem rather mild and are often misidentified as the flu or even just the common cold.

, Schedule a doctor's appointment immediately if you exhibit these symptoms or if you have reason to believe someone you interacted with had the mumps. Most people get vaccinated to prevent the mumps, but if you are unsure if you you received the vaccine as a child, see a doctor to be sure.There are other illnesses such as inflamed tonsils, another viral or bacterial infection, or blockage of the salivary glands that could produce similar symptoms. See a doctor if you have any reason to suspect that you have the mumps.
Let your doctor know about your concerns before you arrive at the doctor’s office to avoid long waits where you could possibly infect others.

Get the maternal serum alpha fetoprotein (MSAFP) test.,
Have an ultrasound.,
Request an amniocentesis.,
Ask for an internal scan for spina bifida.",How to Recognize Spina Bifida Symptoms2," During the second trimester (it’s not detectable in the first trimester), at roughly 16-18 weeks, spina bifida is typically detected via the MSAFP which measures something called alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). Higher levels of AFP are a potential sign of an uncovered neural tube.Keep in mind that the MSAFP test is not 100% accurate, and further tests may be required.

, If your AFP levels are high, then your doctor will probably want to do an ultrasound. An ultrasound can provide images of an unborn baby’s spine and spinal cord, which may enable the doctor to diagnose spina bifida., During amniocentesis, the doctor extracts some amniotic sac fluid that protects the fetus. Using the fluid, the doctor can screen for high levels of AFP. The one downside to this test, however, is that it is not thorough enough to know the degree to which spina bifida has affected the baby., Scans that are postnatal, after the baby is born, are often the only way milder forms of spina bifida are discovered. An x-ray, MRI, or CT scan examination can be performed. This option is used primarily when the spina bifida symptoms are not clearly visible."

Get vaccinated against the mumps.,
Avoid contact with the saliva of infected people.,
Get tested for the mumps virus.,
Be aware of possible complications.,
Receive treatment for the mumps virus.",How to Recognize Mumps Symptoms2," The mumps virus is no longer particularly prevalent today because most people are vaccinated as children. The mumps vaccination is usually combined with the vaccinations for measles and rubella, in the MMR vaccine. People who receive the vaccine are commonly considered to be immune to the virus.The vaccine is usually provided to children in two doses: one between twelve and fifteen months in age, and another at either age four to six or eleven to twelve.
Adults that have not been vaccinated should also receive the vaccine in two doses. A single dose does not seem to provide sufficient protection against the virus.

, The mumps is most commonly transmitted from person to person through infected saliva. It's important to avoid the saliva of anyone infected with the mumps virus.The mumps can be transmitted through the air via tiny droplets of saliva released through coughing or sneezing.
Do not drink from the glass of anyone you suspect to be infected with the mumps virus.

, If your doctor suspects that you have the mumps virus, a blood test is often conducted to confirm the diagnosis. Being tested for the mumps virus is the only way to know for certain that you have been infected.The blood test confirms a mumps infection by identifying the antibodies the human body produces to combat the mumps.
An oral swab is usually also taken to confirm the presence of the mumps virus.

, In the absence of complications, the mumps virus can offer a fairly easy recovery. Unfortunately, a number of additional medical issues can be caused by or exacerbated by the presence of the mumps virus. These complications are rare, but can be extremely serious.Inflammation of the testicles, breasts, ovaries, pancreas and parts of the brain can lead to significant health issues and even death.
The mumps virus can cause hearing loss in some people.
The mumps virus can possibly cause miscarriages in pregnant women.

, Unfortunately, because the mumps is a viral infection, antibiotics cannot help fight off the mumps virus. However, there are several effective treatments while the person with the mumps is symptomatic, including rest, hydration, fever or pain control, and time.You can apply warm or cold compresses to the cheeks to help with the pain and swelling. You should also eat more soft foods and avoid sour foods.
People are no longer contagious a week after a verified mumps virus test.
People often recover within two weeks of a positive mumps test provided there are no additional complications.

Apply mosquito repellent.,
Dress toddlers in covering clothing.,
Use mosquito nets.,
Treat clothing with permethrin.,
Keep toddlers indoors during dawn and dusk.,
Set up play areas in dry parts of your yard.,
Change standing water weekly or more.Children’s wading pools and bird paths are common sources of standing water.,
Practice outdoor home maintenance.,
Make sure toddler bedrooms have functioning screens.If the screens get holes, fix them immediately.",How to Protect Toddlers Against Mosquitoes," For young children between the ages of two months and three years, choose a repellent with DEET. Be careful that the product does not touch your toddler’s face or hands. First put the spray on your hands and then rub it on your child, or try a cream-based repellent. You do not need to use a large amount.Only apply the repellent to skin that is exposed. Under no circumstances should you apply bug block underneath a child’s clothes. Use warm water and soap to wash off repellent after your child is inside for the day/night.Products used on children should have no more than 30% DEET.Do not use DEET products on children under the age of two months.Do not spray repellent on any open wounds.With toddlers, do not use lemon eucalyptus oil for mosquito prevention.While it is important to wear both sunscreen and bug repellent, do not use a product that combines the two. Combination sunscreen and bug-block should be avoided. Instead, apply sunscreen, then follow with repellent, following the manufacturer's guidelines for reapplication.;
, For summer days, dress your toddler in lightweight, light-colored clothing. Pair a long-sleeved shirt with long, lightweight pants. Socks and shoes plus wide-brimmed hats are good to wear as well.Breathable cottons and linens make fine choices. Not only will you protect your child from mosquitoes, but you also will be giving her sun protection.


Do not dress your child so warmly that she becomes overheated. On hot days, opt for breathable, single layers of clothing.
Clothing designed for sun protection and swimming also can be great options.

, If you are visiting a place with a large amount of mosquitoes, use mosquito netting on your child’s bed at night and during naptime. If you are taking him outside during dawn or dusk, or through the woods or a marshy area, put mosquito netting over his stroller. He will still be able to breathe but you will give him extra protection.

, Use insect repellent with permethrin on your clothing. By doing so, you add another layer of protection. You can also buy pre-treated clothes at select sports stores.Do not spray repellents with permethrin directly on your skin., Although mosquitoes can bite at any time, they are particularly active in the early morning and early evening.If children are outdoors during this time, dress them in proper clothing and use insect repellent.

, Avoid putting a sandbox, children’s pool, or swing set in areas that are prone to having puddles or are near a marsh or pond. Instead, seek dry parts of your lawn. Although you might want partial shade from a tree for sun protection, strive to keep the play area within partial sunlight.


Limit the time you allow your toddler to play outside during the hours of 10 am to four pm if you worry about sun exposure.
Do not allow your toddlers to play underneath any decks. These areas tend to be damp and can house mosquitoes.

, Mosquitoes use stagnant water for breeding.Be sure to change water regularly.


Do not leave old flower pots standing up in your yard. They will collect water.If you do not regularly use your child’s wading pool, use the water for watering flowers or the lawn. Try to use the water for other purposes rather than dumping it out.

, Mow your lawn regularly and cut any tall weeds. Remove any accumulated debris from your gutters. If you have a fire pit, be sure to remove any standing water.The same applies to tire swings. They are havens for mosquitoes.In general, try to keep your lawn level so that water does not pool in unwanted places.


Mow the lawn regularly.
Trim any tall weeds or grass.

, Even small holes can let in many mosquitoes. Particularly during nighttime, mosquitoes are likely to use screen holes to find people to bite.

Talk to your kids about the importance of healthy eating.,
Show your kids what a healthy plate looks like.,
Replace unhealthy, sugary drinks.,
Teach that some foods should be enjoyed in moderation.,
Emphasize portion control.,
Make healthy food available in your home.,
Suggest healthier alternatives.,
Avoid making your child clean their plate.",How to Raise Nutrition‐Smart Kids1," While you don’t want to bore your children with food lectures, you should make healthy eating a common conversational topic in your household. No matter what age your child is, you can talk about how the food you put into your body affects you.Tell your children that fruits and vegetables help give us vitamins, minerals, and nutrients that keep our bodies strong. Talk about how lean sources of protein help give us energy and keep us strong.
Explain that sugar in large quantities can cause problems for your teeth and bodies. That’s why it’s important to eat it in moderation.;
, Talking about healthy eating is as important as showing your child examples of what healthy eating looks like. Fill a plate with the components of a healthy meal. Half of it should be filled with vegetables, while the other half should contain lean meats and whole grains, like quinoa.Showing your kids an example of a healthy plate can give them a concrete example to follow as they make their own plates.
In the grocery store, show your kids examples of different vegetables, fruits, lean meats, and whole grains. This helps them see the options they have for filling their plates.

, Many beverages that people consume are unhealthy. They are filled with sugar, calories, or chemicals. Instead of letting your child drink sodas, sugar-filled juices, or sports drinks, teach them to drink water and milk.Squeeze some lemon or lime in the water, or get a pitcher where you can infuse whole fruit into the water, like strawberries, kiwi, or melon.
Talk to your pediatrician to find out what type of milk is best for your child. Whole, low fat, and skim each have certain benefits depending upon your child's needs.If you let your children drink juice, make sure it is 100% natural juice. Even this juice contains a lot of sugar, so limit your child’s intake to four to six ounces daily.

, Try to avoid calling foods “good” or “bad.” Instead, help your kids learn that all foods can be eaten in a balanced diet. However, some foods should be enjoyed in moderation and are not foods you eat every day. This helps prevent your children from feeling like they are missing out, but also keeping them from eating junk foods every day.For example, don’t tell your kids that french fries and donuts are “bad” foods. Instead, tell them they are “sometimes” foods that should be enjoyed occasionally, not every day or every week.

, How much of a food we eat is as important as what we eat. Teach your children to think about portion size when they eat. Instead of heaping grains onto their plate, tell your kids to spoon out an amount the size of their fist. The amount of protein should be around the size of their palm. Even fruits should be limited to balanced portions. Non-starchy vegetables can be heaped on their plates.Teach your child to look at serving sizes on containers.
You can also think about teaching them what half a cup of fruit or grains looks like or a few ounces of protein.
Useful vegetables to help round out any meal include, artichoke, asparagus, beets, Brussels sprouts, broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, celery, cucumber, eggplant, mustard greens, mushrooms, okra, onions, peppers, radishes, salad greens, squash, tomato, and others., Your children will eat what you have in the house. If you have fruit, vegetables, hummus, or nuts available for snacks, your kids will eat those. If your cabinets are filled with junk food and sweets, that’s what your children will reach for.Keep healthy snacks in easy to reach places for your kids. Place apples or bananas in a bowl on the table or put baby carrots on a shelf in plain view next to hummus.

, If your child wants fried, sugary, or unhealthy foods, suggest a similar, healthier food instead. This helps your child eat a food similar to what they want, but teaches them how to make healthier choices that still taste great.For example, offer kale chips or salsa or guacamole with baked tortilla chips instead of potato chips. If your child wants candy, try fruit dipped in dark chocolate. Consider substituting frozen yogurt or sorbet for ice cream, or even cottage cheese with pineapple and dark chocolate chips.

, While you may have had to clean your plate when growing up, your child doesn’t have to do the same. Forcing children to keep eating though they’re full can lead to overeating. Instead, teach them to stop eating when they are full. You should also help them to learn how to fill their plates with the correct portion size.If your child doesn’t finish their meal but wants a snack soon afterwards, choose meal-like snacks, like hummus and vegetables or small pieces of meat. Talk to your child to make sure they are eating enough at dinner and not trying to get away with snacking later.

Pour 1 cup of boiling water over 1 tablespoon of dried root or bark and let it steep for 30 to 60 minutes. Strain and drink.Ginger – Ginger contains anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial agents. Start with a 2-inch piece of ginger root. Peel it, cut it into small pieces, and crush it. Add the crushed ginger to 2 cups of boiling water and boil for 3-5 minutes.

, Children with large tonsils are more prone to sore throats and ear infections. If your child has frequent tonsil infections – 7 or more times in 1 year, or 5 or more times over 2 years – you should talk to your doctor about a possible tonsillectomy – a low-risk, out-patient procedure to remove the tonsils."
"
Avoid calling food a “treat” or “reward.” As you raise your children, don’t refer to certain foods as “treats” or “rewards.” This gives the food more power than it should have and makes it seem like something special or desirable.,
Model healthy eating choices.,
Remove distractions from mealtimes.,
Discourage mindless snacking.",How to Raise Nutrition‐Smart Kids2," Instead, treat all food the same way, while emphasizing some foods should be enjoyed in moderation.For example, don’t refer to ice cream, cakes, or cookies as “treat” foods or use them as rewards. Instead, admit that they are tasty foods that can be enjoyed sometimes in moderation.

, Your kids watch and learn from you. If you are eating donuts, chips, and fast food, they will think these are acceptable eating choices. However, if they see you eating apples, nuts, chicken breasts, and a plate full of vegetables, you will be setting a good example for them to follow.Think about your children every time you make an eating choice. Ask yourself, “What message am I sending to the kids when they see me eating this?”

, To help teach positive eating habits, set a rule where mealtimes are devoted to food. This means your family sits down at the table and focuses on the joy of eating. Leave cell phones and tablets in another room, and don’t eat in front of the television.Eating while distracted can lead to overeating. If you are distracted, you also won’t enjoy the taste of the food and may feel hungry or crave food later.

, Most people eat well throughout the day, until they sit down to watch television at night. People can consume hundreds of calories by munching on chips, cookies, or ice cream while watching a movie or TV show. Set a good example for your children and teach them not to snack out of boredom or habit.Set specific snack times so that your children will not associate TV with snacks. This helps discourage overeating and snacking out of habit.

"
Make gradual changes.,
Involve your entire family in the healthy eating process.,
Take your children to the grocery store.,
Listen to your child’s likes and dislikes.",How to Raise Nutrition‐Smart Kids3," If you are changing the way your family eats, don’t do it all at once. Instead, make gradual changes so that everyone gets used to your new way of eating. Simple changes go a long way. Pace out your nutrition goals until your family is eating healthier.For example, you may want to incorporate more vegetables, reduce sugars, reduce refined carbs, switch to low-fat cuts of meat, and eliminate unnecessary snack foods. Instead of doing all of this in one week, do a few things at a time.
Try incorporating one more vegetable and fruit each day. Buy one less box of snack foods. Make one less serving of bread. Cut out one junk food full of sugar. Increase the frequency of these small steps until your family has hit your nutrition goals.

, Teaching your child how to eat healthy means involving them in your family’s meal and snack planning. Ask them to choose meals for your weekly menu and suggest snacks. This helps them learn how to make good choices and makes them feel like they have a say in the family’s food choice.For example, once a week, you can sit down with your child to talk about the menu. Ask them, “What meals would you like for breakfast, lunch, or dinner this week? What about snacks?”
If they suggest unhealthy options, discuss healthier options. For example, you can say, “Instead of french fries with our hamburgers, why don’t we eat kale chips, sweet potato medallions, or a fun colorful salad?”
You can discuss healthier substitutions with your child if they are old enough. For example, if they want pasta, talk about choosing whole wheat, rice, or quinoa pasta instead of white pasta. You can suggest pasta alternatives, like spaghetti squash or zucchini. Explain how hamburgers will be made from low-fat grass-fed beef, like 93/7, or hot dogs will be natural versions containing no nitrates.

, Get your child involved in the food choices by letting them help buy groceries. Encourage your kids to choose vegetables and fruits they want to eat, along with lean meats or healthy grains. Use the time to teach your children about choosing healthy food items and the importance of reading food labels.Let your children pick recipes and help shop for the ingredients.
Use your grocery store visit to talk about healthy food options and the importance of healthy eating.

, There are foods in each food groups that everyone dislikes. Ask your child’s opinions about the foods you are eating. If they really hate carrots but love green beans, cook green beans more often and don’t force them to eat carrots. Fix a wide variety of vegetables, fruits, meats, and grains so everyone in your home can find foods they like.Try fixing vegetables and meats different ways. For example, your child may like sauteed green beans with pecans but hate them boiled. They may not like cauliflower that’s been boiled or roasted, but they like mashed cauliflower or cauliflower in a casserole.

Focus on health rather than size.,
Avoid negative statements about other's bodies.,
Encourage participation in physical activities.,
Talk about what they see in the media.",How to Raise Nutrition‐Smart Kids4," When teaching your children to eat well, focus on how proper nutrition makes them feel. Explain to them that too much sugar or starchy food can impact how much fun they have when they play, while foods like vegetables and lean protein help give them strength and energy to play all day.Try not to encourage your child to stick to a certain size or weight. Children constantly grow and change, and may become self-conscious of natural, healthy growth if led to believe that they should be one specific size.
Remind your child that as long as they are healthy, their size does not matter. Making smart nutritional choices and engaging in regular exercise is what's important for your overall health, not the number on a scale.
If you believe that your child is rapidly gaining or losing weight, or seems to have problems maintaining healthy body function despite proper eating and exercise, consult your pediatrician. Do not make any major changes to your child's lifestyle without seeing a doctor.

, The easiest way to teach your child to have a negative body image is to have one, yourself, or otherwise to be critical of others. Avoid statements like, ""This outfit makes me look fat,"" or, ""I would hate myself if I looked like that person."" This only teaches your child that their value is based on other's opinions about their body.Instead of criticizing negative attributes, teach your child to be open and accepting of different sizes and shapes of people, as well as people of different backgrounds. Encourage them to believe that everyone is beautiful and valuable in their own way.
When negative concerns do need to be addressed, try to be informative rather than critical.
If you feel bad after eating too much, for example, let your child know, ""I ate too many non-nutritious things and now I feel tired and upset,"" rather than simply saying you feel fat.

, Not only does regularly participating in a physical activity such as a sport or play group encourage your child to exercise, it also helps them build a healthy view of their body. They build up their strength and skills, and start to take pride in those things their body can now do that it couldn't before.Sign your child up for a sport or another activity in which they have expressed interest. Encourage them to stick with it unless there is a serious reason to quit. It may seem difficult at first, but they will get the most out of any activity with regular practice.
Show pride in your child's accomplishments. Let them know that you are proud of their efforts and that you see them improving as they progress.
Even if your child's soccer team doesn't win, for example, tell your child how proud you are of them for being able to get the ball all the way down the field without having it stolen or kicked away.

, Online, on TV, in movies, and in print, the media encourages both unrealistic body standards and the idea that one's primary value is based on their appearance. Talk to your child about what expectations are unrealistic, such as a very thin or overly muscular physique.Explain that this is used to make people feel like they need to buy products or watch certain shows and movies, not because it is a standard to which everyone should hold themselves.
Limit the exposure your child gets to negative media images regarding body standards. Try to choose body-positive shows and online content, and encourage your child to go outside, work on school work, or focus on a hobby in their spare time.

Pay attention to your child’s emotions.,
Get your child help if they need it.",How to Raise a Healthy Child," Kids dehydrate more quickly than adults, so it is important to make hydration a priority. By the time a child tells you they are thirsty, they have already begun to dehydrate, so you should make water readily available throughout the day and offer your child water often.Young children, over age one, should drink about four glasses (32 oz.) of water a day, while older children should drink about eight glasses of water per day.
You can check if your child is dehydrated by their bathroom habits. If they urinate frequently and their pee is light yellow, then they are not dehydrated.
Other signs of dehydration include dry mouth, thirst, not having wet diapers for four to six hours (for babies), constipation, dizziness, fussiness or sleepiness (in children), and a sunken soft spot on the top of a baby’s head.It is also possible (but rare) for a child to get over-hydrated. Symptoms of overhydration include confusion, seizures, coma, or excess fluid accumulating in the lungs and lower legs.Overhydration usually only occurs with certain medical problems or rarely when giving babies or young children dilute formula or too much water when they are ill.;
, Even when you have a baby, if the child is not introduced to sweets, candy, cookies, soda, and the like, they will not have cravings for these foods. Therefore, they won't need these types of treats as they grow older and this will lead to greater overall health.Rather than giving cookies or other sweets as a snack, give your child a small serving of fruit (grapes, bananas, strawberries). These have sugar that they want, but not the overly processed kind.
Simply don’t buy processed sweets and fatty foods. If you don’t keep them in your house, it will be easier to keep them away from your children.

, Have a different vegetable every night. Make it fun! Maybe one night could be an Asian-themed dinner, and you could have an Asian chicken salad, or maybe an Irish dinner, and you could have potatoes.The key here is variety. There are many kinds of fruits and vegetables. Give your child a taste of different things so that they will be exposed to these flavors and grow accustomed to them early on.

, If your child shows good behavior do not give them sweets. That just teaches the child that good behavior is only worth it because of the sweets. Reward them with something educational, intellectual, or just a simple hug. This will help instill in them an appreciation for treats, rather than an entitled attitude.


Try rewarding your child with quality time or fun activities so that they don’t learn to become reliant on food for satisfaction or to feel good about themselves.

, Studies show that eating more meals at home often leads to healthier eating choices. In addition to the quality time with your loved ones, eating at home allows you to control your child’s portion size, to introduce new foods, and lessens the likelihood that your child will turn into a picky eater from being able to choose off the menu at most meals., Creating a meal from scratch means that you control every ingredient that goes into your child’s body. You can choose to make substitutions for healthier ingredients or to change up a recipe to account for your family’s taste preferences.


You can choose to substitute coconut oil for butter if you make a meal from scratch. Substitutions at restaurants or in pre-made meals are less easy.

, No matter what kind of eating your family does, it is important to raise your child with a good self-image. Tell your child they are beautiful and talk about loving your own body in front of your child.You should also focus on the health benefits of eating certain foods rather than whether or not certain foods will make you gain weight or lose weight.


Do not excessively talk about needing to go on a diet or how much you dislike aspects of your body in front of your child.

, Play sports and games with your kids. At early ages sign them up for soccer, dance, volleyball, baseball, softball, football, basketball, gymnastics, tennis, golf, or any other extra-curricular activities. Keeping fit can be fun, and playing sports teaches not only athletic skills, but helps socially, and builds sharing and team work skills.


Children should have about one hour of active time each day., Spend time with your kids while being active. Go for a walk. Take them to the water park. Take them to a regular park. Play hopscotch. Jump rope. Do things with your kids that involve more than just sitting on the couch. It will be good for both of you!, Spending too much time in front of the TV or computer is not good for children. It doesn’t promote as much brain development as active playing and it is not good for their eyes. Plus, any time spent in front of an electronic device is time that could have been spent playing and expending energy. Try to think of fun, active things for your children to do instead of watching TV or playing video games. You should also limit the amount of time your child is allowed to spend on these devices to two hours per day.

, Children need a lot more sleep than adults do because they are actively growing and developing, both physically and mentally. A well-rested child has more energy to be active during waking hours, so make sure your child is getting enough sleep. The average toddler needs between 12 and 14 hours of sleep per day (including naps), while kids ages five to 12 usually need around 10 hours of sleep per day., Children are more susceptible to germs and diseases because their immune systems are still developing. So, it’s important to provide a clean and safe environment for your children. This includes things like washing hands frequently (you and your children)and keeping the house clean to minimize allergens that could cause allergies or asthma in your child.You should also avoid cleaners with harsh chemicals like bleach or ammonia in them whenever possible. Try purchasing cleaners with non-toxic ingredients and always keep cleaning supplies out of reach.

, Children whose parents smoke get sick more often than those whose parents do not smoke. Second hand smoke can cause asthma and asthma attacks in children. It can also lead to higher instances of ear infections, bronchitis, and pneumonia in children., Vaccinating your children helps protect them (and others) from potentially serious, but completely preventable, diseases like polio and measles. This is one of the easiest and best things you can do to help your child live a healthy life.In addition to getting your child vaccinated, you should also take your child for regular checkups with a pediatrician.
In the past there has been some controversy about vaccinating children, largely because of a false claim that vaccinations are linked to autism. However, there is no medical evidence that autism is linked to vaccines at all., There are many different chemicals, substances, and objects that could cause severe harm to your child if he or she got a hold on them. To protect your child, put any unsafe items out of your child’s reach, such as in a locked cupboard, a safe, or on a high shelf. Some items that you should keep out of your child’s reach include:firearms and other weapons (keep these locked in a safe and unloaded at all times)
chemicals, such as cleansers, pesticides, and personal care products
houseplants, especially cacti and potentially toxic plants
small items that a child can choke on, such as buttons, screws, or marbles
medicines, prescription and non-prescription
alcohol and tobacco products
garbage

, Car seats are essential for children until they are old enough to use a regular seatbelt, which is usually when they are around eight to 12 years old. Make sure that you have a car seat that is appropriate for your child’s age and size and use it whenever you travel with your child.Always put your child’s car seat in the back seat of your vehicle. Airbags can seriously injure your child if she is in the front seat.
Use a rear facing car seat until your child is two years old. Then, switch to a forwards facing car seat.
Secure the strap across your child’s chest, at armpit level.

, When your child is using a bicycle, skateboard, roller blades, or scooter, she should always wear a helmet. Make sure that your child’s helmet is Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) certified to ensure that it is a quality helmet. This information should be printed on the label.Your child’s helmet should fit snugly on her head and it should cover her forehead too. Make sure that it does not wiggle around when she moves. The helmet should stay in place. You can adjust the chin strap to improve the fit.

, Children need to spend time with their parents and to feel that they are a priority in their parents’ lives. Set some time aside every day to have uninterrupted interaction with your children. This way, they’ll feel valued and prioritized and it will positively impact their emotional well-being., Even though it is often easy to dismiss your children’s behavior as associated with age (the terrible twos, teenage angst, etc.), it is still important to recognize that your child’s feelings are real and valid and they need to feel like you respect them and their emotions. Let your children talk to you about what makes them upset. Try to help them work through their feelings calmly.Don’t trivialize your child’s feelings, especially if they are sharing with you. Listen to what they say and try to help them resolve any anger or hurt feelings they might be experiencing.

, Sometimes children need more help than parents alone can provide for them. Maybe this means specialized doctors’ visits, or maybe this means some kind of professional emotional support, through therapy, counseling, rehabilitation, church involvement, etc.You should focus on getting your child the help they need regardless of how you may think it reflects on you as a parent, or any negative social stigma that might be attached to the help you think your child needs.


Your child may need help if they exhibit any of the following symptoms:

Mood changes
Behavior changes
Difficulty concentrating
Rapid weight loss
Intense feelings
Self-harming behaviors
Substance abuse

, You should also look for the symptoms of infection that may accompany your sore throat. These can include:


Fever
Chills
Coughing
Runny nose
Sneezing
Body aches
Headache
Nausea or vomiting

, If the pain is excessive or lingers, though, you should consider seeing a physician for a physical exam. The doctor will look at your throat, listen to your breathing, and take a throat swab. While the swab is painless, it can be slightly uncomfortable if it causes a gag reflex.The sample taken from your throat swab will be sent to a lab to figure out the cause of the infection. Once the virus or bacteria causing your throat pain is determined, the doctor can advise you on treatment.


The doctor may also order a CBC (complete blood count) or test you for allergies.

, Drinking water prevents dehydration and keeps your throat moist to reduce discomfort.Most people prefer room-temperature water when they have a sore throat. If cold or hot water makes you feel better, though, drink that instead.

If your throat feels particularly scratchy, try taking a hot shower and spending time in the steamy bathroom.

, Studies show that chicken soup can slow the movement of specific types of immune cells. The slower movement of these cells make them more effective. Chicken soup also increases the movement of tiny hairs in the nose that can help reduce infections. You should also stick to soft, mild, non-sticky foods for a while.


Examples of soft foods include applesauce, rice, scrambled eggs, well-cooked pasta, oatmeal, smoothies, and well-cooked beans and legumes.
Avoid spicy foods like chicken wings, pepperoni pizza, or anything with hot peppery, curry, or garlic.
Avoid hard or sticky foods that might be hard to swallow. Examples include peanut butter, dry bread, toast or crackers, raw vegetables or fruits, and dry cereals.

, Make sure to chew it enough to break it down before swallowing. Chewing and letting saliva moisten the food will make it easier for you to swallow.


You might also use a food processor to puree foods for easier swallowing., You can carry a small bottle of this throughout the day and use it to relieve pain as needed. Begin by measuring ¼ cup of filtered water for every 2 oz. of spray you want to make. To this, add two drops each of menthol essential oil (pain reliever), eucalyptus essential oil, and sage essential oil (antibacterial, antiviral, and anti-inflammatory).Mix it all together well and pour it into a one or two oz. glass spray bottle. Refrigerate any unused portion to use later.

, Add about 1 teaspoon of either table salt or sea salt to 8 oz. of warm water and stir to dissolve the salt. Gargle with the solution for about 30 seconds and spit it out. Repeat once every hour.The salt reduces the swelling by drawing out the water in the swollen tissues.

Young children may be susceptible to infant botulism which can contaminate honey., It also changes the pH of the throat, which helps fight bacteria. Baking soda can be a good alternative for those who can't handle the taste of gargling with apple cider vinegar.


Add ½ teaspoon of baking soda to one cup of very warm water.
Add ½ teaspoon of table or sea salt.
Gargle with this mixture every 2 hours.

, Although you should be avoiding spicy food, cayenne pepper tea can actually soothe a sore throat. Cayenne acts as a counter-irritant: it's a second irritant that counteract the original one.It also depletes ""Substance P"" in the body. Substance P is a neurotransmitter associated with inflammation and pain.Stir ⅛- ¼ teaspoon of ground cayenne pepper into one cup of steaming water.
Mix in about 1-2 teaspoons of honey (to taste) and sip continuously.
Stir the drink occasionally to redistribute the pepper.

, Licorice root tea is made from the licorice plant, Glycyrrhiza glabra. Licorice root has anti-viral, anti-bacterial, and anti-inflammatory properties.It’s good for treating any type of sore throat, whether caused by viral or bacterial infection. Most stores now carry herbal teas, and licorice root is pretty common. Use one teabag per cup of boiled water and add honey to taste.

,


For clove tea, add a teaspoon of whole cloves or ½ teaspoon of ground cloves to one cup of boiled water.
For ginger tea, you can add ½ teaspoon of ground ginger to hot water. If using fresh ginger (the best way to go!), use ½ teaspoon of peeled, chopped ginger.

, You should be aware that cold temperatures can aggravate some sore throats. If the child does not respond well to this treatment, stop using it. Gather your materials: two cups of Greek yogurt, two to three tablespoons of honey, and one teaspoon of ground cinnamon. Yogurt contains healthy bacteria that can help boost the immune system. The Greek style is tangier and thicker, so it won’t be as drippy as it melts. You can use either a plain yogurt or a fruit one — whichever the child will prefer.


Mix the ingredients in a food processor or mixer until smooth.
Pour the mixture into popsicle forms, stopping about ½ inch from the top.
Insert the popsicle stick and store it in the freezer for 6-8 hours.

, If you just try to yank the popsicle out of its mold, fresh from the freezer, you’ll find yourself holding a popsicle stick with no popsicle. Before pulling on the stick, dip the molds in hot water for five seconds. This loosens up the popsicle a little bit, and makes it easier to remove it from the mold.

, You can freeze any of the teas described in this article, as well. Simply pour your cayenne, licorice root, clove, or ginger tea into the mold and freeze for four to six hours. For children, especially, you may want to sweeten the popsicles with honey and/or cinnamon.

, When used with very young children, lozenges can pose a choking hazard. In older children and adults, though, they increase the flow of saliva, moisturizing your throat. These lozenges also add ingredients that soothe and heal sore throats. They should last for about six months if stored in a cool, dry, dark place. To make them, gather your ingredients: ½ teaspoon marshmallow root powder; ½ cup slippery elm bark powder; ¼ cup filtered hot water; two tablespoons of medicinal honey.


Dissolve the marshmallow root powder in the hot water.
Put the two tablespoons of honey into a glass measuring cup and add enough of the hot marshmallow liquid to have a total of ½ cup. Pour this into a mixing bowl and discard the rest.
Add the ½ cup of Slippery Elm Bark powder to a mixing bowl, and create a well in the middle of the powder.
Pour the honey/marshmallow solution into the well and mix the ingredients together. They should form small oblong shapes about the size of a grape.
Roll the lozenge in some of the extra slippery elm bark powder to reduce their “stickiness,” and place them on a plate to let them dry for at least 24 hours.
When dry, wrap each lozenge in waxed paper or parchment paper. To use, just unwrap the lozenge and allow it to slowly dissolve in your mouth.

, If it lingers beyond one week, though, it may suggest the infection causing it is serious enough to need medical attention. Furthermore, children, should always be checked out by a doctor if a sore throat doesn't go away with a drink of water in the morning. Call your doctor immediately if your child has trouble breathing or swallowing. Unusual drooling accompanied by a sore throat should also be examined as soon as possible. Adults are better at gauging whether they need medical attention. You can wait it out at home for a few days, but see a doctor if you experience:A sore throat that lasts longer than a week or seems severe
Any difficulty swallowing
Any difficulty breathing
Any difficulty in opening your mouth or pain in the jaw joint
Joint pain, especially new pains
Earache
Any rash
A fever higher than 101 F (38.3 C)
Any blood in your saliva or phlegm
Frequently recurring sore throats
A lump or mass in your neck
Hoarseness that lasts more than two weeks

, They should resolve on their own within five to seven days. Bacterial infections, however, can be easily treated with antibiotics prescribed by your doctor.


The medical lab’s analysis of your throat swab will determine whether your infection is viral or bacterial.

, If you don't take the medication for as long as your doctor prescribes, your symptoms may come back. This is because some antibiotic-resistant bacteria may survive a partial course of antibiotics. If they do, they can increase the population of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in your body. This puts you at risk of complications or a recurrence of the infection.


If antibiotic-resistant bacteria survive in your body, you are more likely to get infected again. This time, you'll need a stronger antibiotic to kill them off.

, Antibiotics attack the bacteria causing your infection, but also the healthy bacteria in your gut.Your body needs normal gut bacteria for healthy digestion and a strong immune system. This healthy bacteria is also important for the production of certain vitamins. Yogurts that have ""active cultures"" contain probiotics — healthy gut bacteria. Eating these products while on antibiotics will you healthy while the antibiotics do their work.


Always look for the term ""active cultures"" on the yogurt packaging. Pasteurized or otherwise processed yogurts will not help restore gut bacteria."

If this test comes back negative, then the infection is likely viral, especially if a cough is present. Although, your doctor may also order allergy testing and a complete blood count (CBC) to measure your current immune response., If the culture determines that your sore throat is due to a bacterial infection, then the doctor will likely prescribe you a course of antibiotics to help combat the infection. If you are prescribed antibiotics, take them for the prescribed length of time, even if you are beginning to feel better.If you don’t, some bacteria (the antibiotic-resistant bacteria) may survive and can increase the population of antibiotic resistant bacteria, as well as increase your risk of complications and recurrence of the infection.


If you are prescribed antibiotics, eat yogurt with active cultures to replace the normal gut bacteria that are also killed by the antibiotics. You have to eat yogurt with active cultures because this yogurt contains bacteria. Pasteurized or otherwise processed yogurts do not. This is recommended to prevent the diarrhea that is sometimes associated with antibiotic use and can help maintain the normal gut bacteria that are vital to keeping you (and your immune system) healthy.Watch out for unusual diarrhea while on antibiotics. Unusual diarrhea may signify another illness or infection.

Wash your hands.",How to Evaluate and Treat Strep Throat," Strep throat is contagious bacterial infection caused by Streptococcus pyogenes, also known as group A streptococcus.Although the hallmark symptom of strep throat is a sore throat, not all sore throats are a result of an bacterial infection caused by streptococcus. In fact, most of the time, sore throats are a result of common viruses and do not need treatment.However, if you do have strep throat treatment is important, as it can cause serious complications including spreading of infection to blood, skin and other organs, rheumatic fever that can affect your heart and joints, and kidney inflammation.
The most common age group affected is five to 15 years old, however anyone can get strep throat.;
, Seeking medical attention is important because doctors can do quick tests to determine if the infection you have is strep throat. Sometimes you may have symptoms of strep throat, but you may not actually have strep throat. One important thing to keep in mind is that there is no cough with strep throat. Symptoms of strep throat may include any of the following:flu like illness lasting for two to five days
fever (which worsens on the second day)
sore throat, stomach ache
nausea, lack of energy
difficulty swallowing, headache
swollen lymph nodes
rash

, Based on your symptoms your doctor may recommend coming in for a throat swab strep test. This will only take a few minutes and is the only way to definitively diagnose strep throat. You cannot diagnose strep throat just by looking at it.


The “throat swab” test is a rapid antigen test. This test detects strep bacteria in a few minutes. It works by looking for substances (antigens) in the throat. Although this is fast, it may not always be accurate. In some cases, the swab test will come back negative even if you have strep throat.If your doctor thinks that you have strep throat, s/he may culture the test to see if the streptococcus bacteria grows on the swab in the next one to two days.If your swab test or culture comes back positive, your doctor will prescribe a course of treatment that includes a course antibiotics.
If your doctor does not diagnose you with strep throat, it's possible that you have anything from a common cold to more serious condition like tonsillitis or mononucleosis.

, If your doctor determines that you have the streptococcus bacteria, then you will need to take antibiotics. Antibiotics are usually taken for 10 days, although your doctor may want you to take them for shorter or longer. The most common antibiotics prescribed for strep throat include penicillin or amoxicillin. If you are allergic, your doctor may prescribe a different antibiotic such as cephalexin or azithromycin. Remember a few things when you begin your antibiotics:Take the whole course of antibiotics, even when you feel better. Not taking the whole course can increase your chances of a recurrent and more serious infection, as the initial antibiotics may kill the weak bacteria, and the strong bacteria may survive and become resistant to the antibiotics taken. Do not skip doses. Regular antibiotics doses ensure that it works properly.
Try to avoid alcohol while taking antibiotics. While alcohol won't interfere with most antibiotics, it can intensify the side-effects, making you dizzy, drowsy, and giving you a stomach upset.Be aware that some cough syrups and mouthwashes contain alcohol.
Take as directed. Talk to your pharmacist about how to take the antibiotic. Depending on the antibiotic prescribed, it may work better with or without food. For example, Penicillin V should be taken on an empty stomach, while amoxicillin can be taken with or without food. Most antibiotics are taken with a glass of water.
Look out for allergic reactions to antibiotics such as rash, swelling of the mouth, difficulty breathing or swallowing. If you experience any reaction, talk to your doctor and s/he can prescribe a different antibiotic. If you experience difficulty breathing call 911 as this can be a life threatening reaction called anaphylaxis.
Look out for side effects. Side effects of most antibiotics include upset stomach and diarrhea. There may be particular side effects to the antibiotic you are prescribed.

, This will help pain associated with the sore throat and other symptoms such as fever. Preferably, take the pain medication with food., This will help to ease the symptoms of strep throat. Mix about ¼ teaspoon of salt into a tall glass of warm water. Take the saltwater in the back of your mouth, lift your head back, and gargle for 30 seconds. Spit the salt water out after the back of your throat is coated.Drink plenty of fluids. Drinking warm, throat-soothing tonics such as lemon tea or tea with honey can help relieve the symptoms of strep throat. In addition, fluids and water keep you hydrated, which helps you to heal more efficiently., A humidifier cycles dry air through moist air. This creates air that is easier and more soothing to breathe.If you don't have a humidifier handy, you can create a makeshift humidifier by bringing a pot of water to boil and letting it steam in a room you're inhabiting.
If using a humidifier, be careful not to overdo it. A little bit of moisture in your air is good. Too much moisture isn't. Too much moisture can help create perfect conditions for certain mold and fungus, aggravating symptoms, and possibly even delaying recuperation.

, Throat lozenges or sprays are available over the counter at pharmacies and can help relieve sore throats. These may contain local anesthetics or antiseptics and offer symptomatic relief.

, It is important to contact your doctor if your symptoms are do not improve within a few days (48 hours) or if symptoms worsen. This could mean your antibiotic is not working.


In addition, contact your doctor if you experience any side effects.

, After you begin taking antibiotics, you will need to stay home for up to 48 hours to avoid spreading strep to someone else. A person is still infectious for the first 48 hours after beginning their course of antibiotics. Take care to avoid infectious contact with other people during this time., Do this after the first couple days of antibiotics, but before you finish your antibiotics. Otherwise, your old toothbrush could become a carrier and re-infect you once the antibiotics are done.

, When possible avoid contact with people with strep throat, especially during the contagious period (up to 48 hours after starting treatment). If a family member has strep throat, don't share glasses or utensils.

, Proper hand washing is the best way to prevent all kinds of infections. According to the CDC proper hand washing technique includes:Wet your hands with clean, running water (warm or cold), turn off the tap, and apply soap.
Lather your hands by rubbing them together with the soap. Be sure to lather the backs of your hands, between your fingers, and under your nails.
Scrub your hands for at least 20 seconds. Need a timer? Hum the ""Happy Birthday"" song from beginning to end twice.

Identify potential allergens.",How to Cure Chronic Sore Throat," Simply gargling with salt water can sometimes alleviate the symptoms of a sore throat. Salt water mixed with warm water can be a soothing to the back of the throat.


Mix a cup of lukewarm water with about a tablespoon of salt. Mix the salt in until it's dissolved and the water looks milky.Gargle with the salt water about 30 seconds and then spit into the sink. Repeat as needed as symptoms persist.;
, Dry air can be the cause of a chronic sore throat. If you're living and sleeping in a dry environment, your throat can dry out and become sore. Try using a humidifier and see if symptoms improve.


You can purchase a cool air humidifier online or at a department store. Try using this in your home or bedroom to humidify warm, dry air.You can also humidify by simply sitting in a steamy bathroom for several minutes for once a day. See if this results in any improvement in symptoms., Throat lozenges can be purchased from most drug stores. Depending on the type, they contain ingredients to numb the throat and soothe pain. If your sore throat has been bothering you for awhile, considering trying lozenges.


You should not give lozenges to small children as they pose a choking hazard. Also, certain medications contained in the lozenges might not be healthy for young children.Lozenges tend to be most effective for mild pain. If your pain is severe or your you have other cold-like symptoms, try over-the-counter medication over lozenges., Make sure to stay hydrated if you have a sore throat. This can help diminish symptoms of a sore throat and prevent further complications.


Opt for high quality fluids. Go for soup broth, water, and whole juices without added sugar. Overly sugary or carbonated beverages can further irritate a sore throat.If your sore throat is accompanied by a fever, you especially need to drink water. Fluid requirement increases when the body is sick.Hot teas, especially those with ginger and lemon, can be particularly good for the throat. Try adding honey, as it has antibacterial products that can eliminate viruses that cause sore throats and other flu and cold like symptoms., If you have a sore throat, you may have a virus, cold, or flu. Bed rest is important. Avoid rigorous physical activity, such as exercising, and try to get more sleep. If it's possible, stay home from school or from work until symptoms pass., A sore throat is usually not cause for concern. Most sore throats are caused by mild infections that will pass on their own. When tackling a sore throat medically, opt for over-the-counter medications first.


Painkillers, like Tylenol and ibuprofen, can effectively treat the pain that accompanies a sore throat.A chronic sore throat may be caused by congestion, especially if it's allergy season. Look for a decongestant or nasal spray. Use as directed and see if it makes a difference in regards to pain and discomfort.If your sore throat is caused by reflux over gastrointestinal issues, an over-the-counter antacid might help alleviate symptoms., A sore throat should generally clear up on its own. If your sore throat lasts longer than three or four weeks, you should make an appointment with a doctor to evaluate the cause.


Your doctor will ask you about your medical history and lifestyle. Certain chronic conditions, like thyroid issues, as well as habits, like smoking, can lead to soreness in the throat. To prepare for your appointment, write down all symptoms you have, your general lifestyle, and any existing health conditions.Your doctor may prescribe medication the day of your appointment if he or she can easily identify what is causing your sore throat. However, if the cause is unclear further testing and possible blood work will be needed. Your doctor may do a throat swab, where the doctor runs a sterile swab over the back of your throat and sends it to a lab for testing. He or she may also complete blood count or an allergy test., Antibiotics may be necessary in the treatment of a sore throat. If your sore throat is caused by a bacterial infection, your doctor will probably prescribe a round of antibiotics.


Penicillin, taken by mouth for five to 10 days, is the most common round of antibiotic treatment. If you have a penicillin allergy your doctor might have to find an alternative.Take the full round of medications, even as symptoms improve. Do not drink alcohol while on antibiotics as this diminishes their effect. If you forget to take a dose, call your doctor or pharmacist and ask how to proceed with the meds., Thrush is a yeast infection in the lining of the tongue and mouth. Thrush can occur in children and young adults, usually if you have a compromised immune system due to chronic health conditions. This can cause a chronic sore throat. If your doctor feels your sore throat is caused by thrush, he or she might prescribe antifungal medications.


Antifungal meds can be taken as a pill, spray, mouthwash, or lozenge. Your doctor will determine the best form for you.Usually, thrush is accompanied by white sores in the mouth and difficulty swallowing. A doctor can usually diagnose thrush by examining your mouth. However, they may need to look at mouth scrapings under a microscope to confirm., A sore throat is usually curable and not a sign of a serious illness. However, a chronic sore throat can point to several more serious health complications.


Glandular fever, better known as mono, is a viral infection with symptoms that can last up to six months. Fatigue, fever, and other cold like symptoms accompanying a chronic sore throat could mean you have mono.In rare cases, a chronic sore throat could be the sign of various types of mouth cancers. This is why it's important to have a sore throat lasting longer than three weeks examined by a doctor.If you are HIV positive, you need to get a chronic sore throat examined as soon as possible. This can be a sign of a serious, possibly life threatening condition.If your tonsils are large enough that they frequently become infected, your doctor may recommend a tonsillectomy to correct the problems. This means your tonsils will be surgically removed., Tobacco smoke is one of the biggest culprits when it comes to a chronic sore throat. Cigarette smoke is a well-known irritant to the eyes, nose, mouth, and throat. If you smoke or live with a smoker, limiting your exposure to tobacco can help ease symptoms of a chronic sore throat.


If you smoke, try cutting back or quitting. Not only can smoke cause irritations like this, it can also lead to serious health complications down the road. Talk to your doctor about making a plan to quit smoking and consider joining a support group, either online or in person.If you live with a smoker, try to separate their smoking from your home. Require that smoking be done outside at a reasonable distance from your home., Muscles in the throat can be strained, as can arms and legs. If you work a job or engage in hobbies where you're yelling or talking for long periods, this can cause chronic sore throat. Make sure you take a few days a week to rest your vocal chords and minimize verbal communication. Also, strive to stay hydrated throughout the day if you must use your voice often., Allergies can cause a chronic sore throat, especially during seasonal changes. Try to identify any potential allergens and limit your exposure to them.


If your sore throat usually comes at a certain season, you may be allergic to something in the air. Staying in more often can help. You might also want to invest in over-the-counter allergy medications.If you're not sure what's causing an allergic reaction, talk to your doctor about taking an allergy test.If your sore throat came on suddenly, consider any new products you're using. New dental products or unusual foods could be potentially allergens causing your throat irritation. Cease use and see if symptoms improve."

See a doctor.,
Take antibiotics.,
Consider surgery.",How to Deal With Strep Throat1," If you suspect you have strep throat, you will want to visit your doctor for a definitive diagnosis. Strep throat is treated differently than sore throats caused by colds and other viruses because it is caused by bacteria, which is treatable with antibiotics. Your doctor will most likely perform a rapid strep test or a throat culture to determine if your sore throat is caused by Streptococcus bacteria.Symptoms of strep throat can include some, or all, of the following: pain when swallowing, red tonsils and white spots on your tonsils or the back of your throat, fever, swollen glands in your throat, loss of appetite, headache, and abdominal pain. If you are experiencing several of these symptoms, make an appointment with your doctor to confirm it is strep throat.Ask your doctor questions like: “What are other possible causes of my symptoms?” “What tests are needed to determine if I have strep?” “What treatment do you recommend?” “How soon can I expect my symptoms to go away?” These questions will help you get a better idea of what you’re dealing with and how quickly you can expect to feel better.;
, Once your doctor has confirmed you have strep throat, they will likely start you on antibiotics. While antibiotics will not necessarily cause your symptoms to go away much faster, they can help reduce the severity of your symptoms, as well as the amount of time you are contagious and able to pass strep throat along to others.


Antibiotic treatments generally last for about 10 days. You should start seeing improvement after a day or two.
You will not be contagious approximately 24 hours after starting antibiotics for strep throat.
Although rare, strep throat can cause complications like sinus and tonsil infections and rheumatic fever, if left untreated. Antibiotic treatment can help prevent these complications.Antibiotics can have side effects, including stomach ache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and loss of appetite. If these side effects continue once you have completed antibiotic treatment, contact your doctor.Always follow your doctor’s directions and finish taking all of the medicine you are prescribed.This is especially important due to the increase in antibiotic resistant bacteria. Not taking all of the medicine may lead to antibiotic resistant bacteria.

, Surgery is considered when, despite antibiotic treatment, you have more than one occurrence of strep throat in a year. During this surgery, called a tonsillectomy, a surgeon will remove your tonsils and hopefully reduce the number of strep throat occurrences you experience or stop them all together.Though there are rarely any serious complications experienced with a tonsillectomy, there are always risks associated with surgery. Some of the complications you could experience with a tonsillectomy include a negative reaction to the anesthetics, breathing problems caused by swelling of the tongue and roof of the mouth, bleeding from the wound during surgery or while you are healing, and infection.Ask your doctor the following to help you prepare for surgery: “Will I be under any dietary restrictions before surgery?” “Do I need to stop taking prescription medications before the surgery? If so, how far in advance?” “What is a typical recovery time?” “What kind of restrictions should I expect in my activities or diet after the tonsillectomy?”"

Take a steam.,
Gargle with warm salt water.,
Coat the throat with honey.,
Use lozenges to build up saliva.,
Drink hot tea.",How to Deal with a Dry Throat1," Like using a humidifier, exposing yourself to a steamy environment brings moisture to dry mucus membranes. Use this as an excuse to take a long, hot, steamy shower from time to time.


Another steaming method is to boil a pot of water, remove it from the heat, place a towel over your head, and lean over the steaming pot. Check to make sure the steam isn’t too hot first.;
, Salt kills germs in the mouth and throat and helps to relieve dryness and irritation. Gargling with salt couple times a day will help to soothe a dry throat.Add 1 teaspoon of salt to a cup of water.
Gargle 1-2 times a day for 30-60 seconds each time.
Don't swallow the water after gargling.
Some people also gargle with an apple cider vinegar solution (1 tablespoon per cup of water).It won’t taste great, but it may work for you.

, This one tastes better than saltwater or cider vinegar at least!


Along with the coating properties of its thick texture, honey also has antiseptic properties.No wonder bees love it.

, Sucking on lozenges or hard candies, as well as chewing gum, help stimulate saliva production, which can in turn soothe a dry throat.Stick to sugar-free versions -- your dentist will thank you.

, Most people find that warm liquids provide a soothing effect, so low-caffeine tea, perhaps with honey and lemon, can prove a good choice for dry throat relief.


Common herbal teas like chamomile can provide relief, but some people swear by teas made from ingredients like peppermint, ginger, cloves, licorice root, marshmallow root, echinacea, and slippery elm."
"
Get over-the-counter medication.,
Rest.,
Drink plenty of fluids.,
Eat soft foods.,
Gargle with salt water.",How to Deal With Strep Throat2," You will probably need ways to manage the symptoms of strep throat even after you’ve started antibiotics. Non-prescription medications like ibuprofen and acetaminophen can help reduce pain and fever. There are also over-the-counter (OTC) anesthetic throat sprays and lozenges that work to relieve pain.Before you start taking any OTC medications for strep throat, ask you pharmacist if these medications are safe to take with any of your prescriptions, what the recommended dosage is, and what the possible side effects are, if any.
Always read and follow all the directions on the medication packaging.

, Allow your body to get plenty of rest while you are fighting off strep throat. You can vary the amount of rest you get depending on how you feel. For example, if you feel weak and overly tired, stay in bed for a good portion of the day. Once your symptoms have started to decrease and you’re feeling back to normal, it is not necessary for you to stay in bed.


You will be contagious for up to 24 hours after starting antibiotic treatment. It is a good idea to stay in bed during this period to avoid passing strep throat on to others., You’ll want to keep your throat moist while you’re dealing with strep throat. This will help reduce the irritation and pain you experience. To do so, drink lots of liquids. It is always a good idea to drink lots of water when you’re sick, but you can also try the following to help relieve your strep throat symptoms:


Orange juice, which contains Vitamin C, can help get rid of your strep throat faster.Warm beverages, like herbal teas or hot teas with honey or lemon, can help relieve the pain from your sore throat.
In addition, using a humidifier helps keep the air moist and will help keep your throat from getting dry., Swallowing is difficult when you have a sore throat. To help prevent pain from swallowing, eat soft foods like applesauce, ice cream, and yogurt.


In addition to eating soft foods, opt for foods that are warm or cold, for example, soups and ice cream. Not only will these be easy to swallow, the temperature of these foods can also help ease throat pain., Another remedy to ease strep throat pain is to gargle with a salt water solution. Your solution should consist of ¼ teaspoon of salt and eight ounces of warm water.Gargle the solution in the back of your throat for about 30 seconds at least once every hour until your symptoms subside.As an alternative, try gargling with diluted apple cider vinegar, which has antibacterial properties. Apple cider vinegar is acidic, however, and can be harmful to tooth enamel so check with your doctor before you try it."
"
Avoid coughing or sneezing on others.,
Wash your hands often.,
Use disposable tissues.,
Replace your toothbrush.",How to Deal With Strep Throat3," You will still be contagious for up to 24 hours after you start antibiotic treatment so it is important you take measures not to infect those around you. Be careful not to cough or sneeze on other people. Doing so can spread the bacteria that causes strep throat.When you have to cough, cough into your hand, arm, or a tissue. If you cough into your hand or bare arm wash the infected area as soon as possible.

, You carry numerous germs on your hands every day, especially when you are already sick. Although being conscious about how you can keep germs off your hands in the first place is helpful, the best way to keep germs from spreading is to wash your hands frequently throughout the day.


To properly wash your hands, work up a lather using soap and warm water. Be sure to scrub both sides of your hands, your wrists, in between your fingers, and around your fingernails. Continue washing for approximately 10 to 15 seconds and then rinse them well with warm water and dry them with a clean towel., In addition to preventing the spread of strep throat to others, you also want to take measures to keep from reinfecting yourself. One way to do this is to use disposable tissues instead of a handkerchief that you use many times before washing. Throw away dirty tissues after each use., Your toothbrush can also carry germs that can reinfect you with strep throat. Replace your toothbrush both as soon as you start feeling sick and then again when your symptoms have subsided and you are feeling better."
"
Stay hydrated.,
Avoid tobacco smoke and pollutants.,
Address possible mouth-breathing.Breathing through an open mouth not only exposes the back of the throat to drier external air, it also means incoming air bypasses the typically moist environment inside the nose.,
Address possible acid reflux or GERD.,
Deal with dry air by using a humidifier.,
Rule out more serious conditions.",How to Deal with a Dry Throat2," A dry throat may indicate that your fluid intake is insufficient. Drinking enough fluids, especially plain old water, may then eliminate the dry throat. Sip water or any other fluids regularly throughout the day.


Limit your intake of caffeinated and alcoholic beverages, for the same reason an athletic trainer would recommend.These substances have a dehydrating effect, so regardless of what the commercials tell you, these are not the beverages to grab to quench your thirst.
Some medications can have dehydrating effects also, so consider consulting your physician or pharmacist regarding your medications and dry throat symptoms.

, Smoking is a bad choice for about a million other reasons already, but it -- and other throat irritants like dust and air pollution -- can cause dry throat. If you suffer from dry throat (and even if you don’t, for that matter), limit your exposure to throat-irritating pollutants., This is one reason why dry throat can occur when you are battling a stuffy nose.


If you notice dry throat especially after waking up, it may be the result of mouth-breathing during sleep.
Breathing through the mouth at night can be a sign of obstructive sleep apnea,a potentially serious medical condition, so consider consulting your doctor if you suspect this.

, The backflow of stomach acid into the esophagus can cause various kinds of throat irritation, including a feeling of dryness. Again, if your dry throat happens mostly as you wake up in the morning, this may be the cause.If you suffer from reflux during the night, you might try to limit your intake of acid producing foods in the evening, prop your head up higher with pillows, prop up the headboard side legs of your bed with wood blocks, or consult your pharmacist or doctor regarding the use of over-the-counter or prescription medications.

, Colder air holds less moisture, so during winter months especially, with the added drying effect of home heaters, your indoor air may become extremely dry. This can lead to a dry throat. The cool mist from the humidifier can soothe a dry throat by adding moisture to the mucus membranes.This may also be your excuse to take a long winter vacation to a warm, tropical climate!

, When caused by a medical condition, dry throat is usually the result of an annoying but generally not severe condition like allergies or the common cold. That said, when a more serious condition is present, dry and/or sore throat can be an early indicator.


Dry throat can be an indicator of strep throat or mononucleosis, tonsillitis, cancers of the throat or esophagus, or (to get even more rare but also more terrifying) the Ebola virus, among other conditions.If you have a fever and body aches with your dry throat, consult your physician to determine if you have an infection that may be of concern."

Gargle once every hour or so.You should wash your mouth out after so your mouth doesn't taste too bad.



Optional: Put one teaspoon of lemon juice or vinegar in the gargle and gargle as usual. Do not swallow!;
, Many herbal lozenges that you can buy over the counter contain analgesics like lemon or honey.


Some throat lozenges, like Sucrets Maximum Strength or Spec-T, are safe and effective and contain medicine (local anesthetic) that numbs the throat to soothe pain.Try not to consume lozenges with anesthetics for more than three days, as the anesthetics could mask a serious bacterial infection such as Streptococcus (strep throat) that needs medical intervention.

, Like lozenges, throat sprays such as Cepacol, help relieve pain by numbing the lining of the throat. Follow instructions on labeling for proper dosage, and consult a doctor or pharmacist for information regarding use with other medications and/or remedies.

, You can soothe pain on the inside of your throat with warm tea, lozenges, and throat sprays, but how about attacking the pain from the outside? Wrap a warm compress around the outside of your throat.This could be a warm heating pad, a hot water bottle, or a warm, damp cloth.

, Make a batch of chamomile tea (or soak 1 tablespoon dried chamomile flowers in 1-2 cups boiling water and let steep). Once the tea is warm enough to touch, soak a clean towel in the tea, wring it out, and apply to neck area, repeating as necessary., Mix 2 cups sea salt with 5 to 6 tablespoons lukewarm water to create a damp, but not wet, mixture.

Leave on for as long as you wish., Warm or cool mist moving through a humidifier can help soothe your throat, although take care not to make your room uncomfortably cold or damp.Use a steam treatment with warm water and a dishtowel. Bring 2-3 cups of water to a soft boil and remove from heat. (Optional: steep chamomile, ginger, or lemon tea in the water.) Lest rest for about 5 minutes. Put your hand over the steam coming off the water to test if it is too hot. Pour the water into a large bowl, drape a clean dishtowel over your head, and bring your covered head over the steam issuing from the bowl. Breathe deeply through your mouth and nose for 5-10 minutes. Repeat as necessary., For pain relief, it's okay to take acetaminophen and ibuprofen, but avoid giving children under the age of 20 any aspirin, as the combination has been linked to a serious condition called Reye syndrome. Follow dosage instruction on the label exactly.

, Shoot to sleep more than your usual daily allotment, about 11-13 hours while symptoms last.

, It's no secret that our hands are vectors for bacteria: We touch our face and other objects, increasing the likelihood of spreading bacteria. Wash your hands frequently if you have a sore throat or cold in order to prevent as much bacterial transmission.

,


Shoot for 3 liters (13 cups) of water a day for men, and 2.2 liters (9 cups) of water a day for women.If you have a cold or are showing signs of dehydration, avoid drinking coffee in excess. Above 5 cups per day, coffee is a diuretic, meaning it dehydrates the body. But recent studies suggest that normal coffee consumption does not inhibit the body's ability to retain fluids, meaning it's perfectly safe to drink under 5 cups of coffee and not worry about dehydration.
Drinking electrolyte-rich sports drinks, such as Gatorade, will help your body replenish the salts, sugars, and other necessary minerals it needs to fight the sore throat., Take frequent, steamy showers.Showering will help clean your body, offer a refreshing diversion, and allow the steam a chance to soothe your throat.

, Free radicals are compounds formed when our bodies convert the food we eat into energy.The scientific evidence about whether vitamin C specifically helps sore throats is controversial, but it certainly won't hurt your sore throat.You might as well take it.


Other antioxidant-rich foods include: green tea, blueberries and cranberries, beans (pinto beans, kidney beans, and black beans), artichokes, prunes, apples, and pecans, among others., This can work well, as garlic is a natural antibiotic.


Cut some fresh garlic into small pieces (medium slices).
Put the garlic pieces into a mug/teacup. Fill with water.
Put the cup inside of the microwave. Boil for two minutes.
Remove the cup. While still hot, take out the pieces of garlic.
Add your favorite teabag (preferably a flavored one to kill the smell of garlic), such as vanilla flavor.
Add some honey or other sweetener (enough to make drinking tasty).
Drink (it will taste really good thanks to the teabag and sweetener). You can have as many cups as you like.

, In some people, dairy increases mucus production., Sugary foods can irritate the throat. Popsicles, preferably sugar-free varieties, are acceptable as they can help soothe the throat.

, Don't let the cooling sensation of drinks fool you: You want to keep your body's core temperature up. Try to drink water that is lukewarm, even if it doesn't taste the best.

, It's better to be safe than sorry. Your doctor can look at your throat, discuss your symptoms, and perform tests that hopefully will put you back on the path to a quick recovery.

, Your sore throat is probably just that — sore. But there's a chance what you thought was sore throat is, in fact, strep throat or another potentially hazardous infection. Be on the lookout for these signs that you have strep throat:


Severe and sudden sore throat without the usual signs of common cold (coughing, sneezing, runny nose, etc.).
Fever over 101° F (38.3° C). Lower fevers suggest increased likelihood of viral infection, not strep.
Swollen lymph nodes in the neck.
White or yellow spots or coating on the throat and tonsils.
Bright red throat or dark red spots on the roof of the mouth at the back near the throat.
Scarlet blotches in the neck area or other parts of the body.

, Mono is caused by the Epstein-Barr virusand is usually associated with teens and young adults, as most adults have immunity to the virus. Symptoms of mono include:


High fever, anywhere from 101° - 104° F (38.3° - 40° C), with attendant chills.
Sore throat, with white patches on the tonsils.
Swollen tonsils and swollen lymph nodes all over the body.
Headache, fatigue, and a lack of energy.
Pain in the upper left side of the abdomen, near your spleen. If your spleen hurts, seek medical attention immediately, as it could mean that your spleen has burst.

Consider oil pulling.,
Take elderberry extract.,
Use peppermint.,
Use eucalyptus.,
Eat honey.,
Use ginger.,
Try thyme.,
Consider other natural herbs.",How to Stop Coughing Using Home and Natural Remedies1," Oil pulling is an Ayurvedic remedy in which you swish oil in your mouth to remove harmful germs and bacteria from your mouth. Use organic, cold-pressed oil like vegetable, sesame, olive, or coconut oil. Take a spoonful of oil and swish it in your mouth for one minute to gain the benefits. If you can, try to swish the oil for 15-20 minutes. To make sure the oil absorbs and detoxifies as much bacteria as possible, aim to do this with an empty stomach. Spit it out and rinse your mouth with lukewarm water.These contain lipids that absorb toxins and pull them out of saliva. They also stop cavity-causing bacteria from sticking to the walls of your teeth. This is a natural moisturizer that also helps prevent dehydration in the throat and mouth, which can ease the symptoms of a cough.;
, Elderberry is commonly used to treat coughs, sore throats and respiratory illnesses because of its anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties. It also stimulates the immune system. You can buy Elderberry extract as a syrup, lozenge or dietary capsule supplement at most nutrition or drug stores. Or, you can steep 3-5 grams of dried elder flower in a cup of boiling water for ten to fifteen minutes. Then, drink it as a herbal tea, up to 3 times per day. Consider the following precautions:It's better to take elderberry every 2 to 3 days, since prolonged use isn't recommended.
Elderberry is a blood thinner and may not be recommended for people with low blood pressure.
Do not use unripe or uncooked elderberries since they may be poisonous.
Speak to your doctor before taking elderberry, since it may have some side effects for pregnant women, people with autoimmune disease, and people taking diabetic medication, laxatives, chemotherapy drugs, or immunosuppressants.

, You can buy peppermint in the form of lozenges, extracts used in dietary supplements, herbal teas, essential oils and a fresh herb. Don't forget that you can use the fresh leaves as a garnish or flavouring in everyday meals. You can also make and drink your own teak up to 3 times a day by steeping one tea bag (approx. 3-4 grams or 1 ½ teaspoon) of dried peppermint leaves in a cup of hot water (80–85°C).Peppermint contains menthol, which can help soothe sore throats and dry coughs. It's also a decongestant that can thin mucus and help break up phlegm.
Don't use peppermint or menthol with infants. Also, don't take peppermint oil orally. Instead, it's usually used in aromatherapy or as a rub.

, You can buy eucalyptus as lozenges, cough syrups, and vapor baths at most drug stores to help soothe sore throats. Try applying topical eucalyptus ointments to your nose and chest to relieve congestion and loosen phlegm. It's generally safe for adults to apply eucalyptus to the skin. Or, you make eucalyptus tea to drink up to 3 times a day by steeping 2–4 grams of dried eucalyptus leaves in a cup of hot water for 10–15 minutes.Eucalyptus’ active ingredient is a compound called cineole, which works as an expectorant to fight respiratory infections and alleviate coughs. Eucalyptus also has antioxidant properties that protect against free radicals, molecules that can damage and infect cells.
You can also gargle eucalyptus water after meals to reduce bad breath and sooth your throat. Do this up to 3 or 4 times a day by steeping 2–4 grams of dried leaves in one cup warm water (40°C) for 5-10 minutes.

, You've probably heard that tea sweetened with honey can help a sore throat, but eating pure honey can actually stop a cough. Eat 2 teaspoons of honey during a bad coughing spell or right before bed. Studies have shown that consuming honey before sleeping can actually improve sleep quality.Never give honey to a child under 2 years old. It can cause botulism, a type of food poisoning that is potentially life-threatening in small children., Ginger can help you produce mucous and relieve coughing. You can steep fresh ginger in hot water to make a tea, chew on crystallized ginger, or add a few teaspoons of ground powdered ginger to 1 tablespoon of honey and eat it.Ginger can also calm any upset stomach or nausea you may also have. Repeat any of these treatments several times throughout the day to prevent coughing fits and ease symptoms.

, Thyme is used to treat bronchitis and coughing. It's also gentle enough that it's safe for small children to use.For a great combination of remedies, make a honey thyme tea. Steep 3 springs of fresh thyme and 2 tablespoons of honey in 1 cup of hot water for 10 minutes. Strain and drink to stop coughing.Never eat or drink thyme oil, which is toxic when taken orally.If you are currently taking blood-thinners, talk to your doctor before taking thyme, since it could increase the risk of bleeding., While many home remedies have been backed up by studies showing their effectiveness at treating coughs, many still lack scientific support. You might give them a try, but understand that some may be more effective for you than others. These include traditional remedies that are commonly known for their helpful healing properties:Marshmallow (Althea officinalis)
Slippery elm (Ulmus fulva)
Licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra)
Mullein (Verbascum densiflorum)
Sundew (Drosera spp.)
Stinging nettle (Urtica dioica)

Another option is gurgling apple cider vinegar, although it is way worse tasting than salt water.

, There are two sides to the story here: Some people believe that tea (especially chamomile with honey and lemon) is a great vocal soother.It's been used for decades in this manner. However, know that acid is bad for your epithelial tissue (the stuff that makes up your vocal folds) and both tea and lemon are acidic.What's your verdict?









There's nothing wrong with honey, however. Another common (but less common) method is a spoonful of honey straight. What a great excuse to get your honey on! Next up they'll be saying spoonfuls of Nutella.

, Steam can increase the moisture in your throat. It's the same reason you see divas wearing scarves when they're sick -- it's for the idea that heat is good for the throat.









Boiling water is an easy way to create steam. Put a towel over your head and the pot with hot water so you get a good amount of steam. Try adding some essential oils if you want. You could hang around the humidifier, too. Or, turn the shower on hot, plug the drain, turn off the fan and breathe deep. (Please use water responsibly, especially when in a drought).

, Many singers are on the slippery elm bandwagon (sounds kind of funny if you've never heard of it), but the official scientific verdict is still out. Slippery elm lozenges have great reviews, but there's no science to back up why they work. It could be a placebo effect.








Even if there's no math behind it, at the very least they're not harmful. Lozenges in general will offer some form of temporary relief.

Drink lots of water.,
Avoid inflammatory foods.,
Eat a Mediterranean diet.,
Add more Vitamin C to your diet.,
Take probiotics.,
Use oral coconut oil.,
Take zinc.",How to Stop Coughing Using Home and Natural Remedies2," Try to drink at least eight ounces of water every two hours. 2 litres of water is the daily recommendation for the average adult. You can also supplement with glucose-free sports drinks that have electrolytes. If you drink caffeinated beverages, you should also drink 1 litre of water for every cup (1 fluid oz.) of caffeine.Water helps ease congestion caused by colds, preventing postnasal drip that can irritate the throat, and keeps your throat from drying which can cause coughs.
Not getting enough water can also lead to dehydration which can cause headaches, irritability, dizziness, irregular heartbeat and shortness of breath.

, Certain foods can slow down your body’s healing process, impair the immune system and increase inflammation. They may also cause gastroesophageal acid reflux, which can make your cough worse. Try to cut back on or avoid these foods:Refined carbohydrates such as white bread, pastries and donuts.
Fried foods
Sugar-sweetened beverages such as soda or energy drinks.
Red meat such as veal, ham or steak and processed meats such as hot dogs.
Margarine, shortening and lard.

, Some foods can help reduce inflammation to help ease a sore throat. If your cough is caused by stomach acid reflux, try eat more green vegetables, whole grains, nuts and oil. You may want to cut back on eating fruits with citric acid, since they may trigger gastroesophageal acid reflux which aggravates your throat. Switch to a Mediterranean diet. It mostly consists of foods that help reduce inflammation, like:Fruits (such as strawberries, cherries and oranges.)
Nuts (like almonds and walnuts.)
Green leafy vegetables (such as spinach or kale which are high in antioxidants.)
Fatty fish (like salmon, mackerel, tuna and sardines.)
Whole grains (such as brown rice, quinoa, millet, oatmeal and flax seed.)
Olive or canola oil

, If your cough is a symptom of a cold or viral infection, strengthen your immunity to help your body heal faster and avoid future risks of infection. Research has shown that vitamin C plays a vital role as an antioxidant and in promoting immune function, lowering risk of various chronic diseases. You can take Vitamin C as a dietary supplement, or you can add vitamin-C rich foods to your diet. Good natural sources of vitamin C are:Sweet red or green peppers
Citrus fruit such as oranges, pomelo, grapefruit, limes or non-concentrated citrus juices.
Spinach, broccoli and brussel sprouts
Strawberries and raspberries
Tomatoes

, Probiotics are microorganisms that are naturally found in your digestive system and certain foods. Studies have shown that they can help reduce the severity of cold or flu symptoms, like cough, sore throat, and nasal congestion. They can also reduce the length of your recovery period. You can get probiotics from yogurt, certain types of milk, soy products and as dietary supplements.Talk with your doctor before taking probiotics if you have a weakened immune system or are currently taking immunosuppressant drugs.
Probiotics also help boost the production of cells that fight infections and suppress stomach acid reflux.

, Coconut oil has antibacterial and antiviral properties. 2 tablespoons of coconut oil, three times per day will often shorten a cold or flu to last only 1 to two days when otherwise it would have lasted 8 or 10 days. , Zinc is an essential trace mineral found in many foods you eat on a regular basis. It has antioxidant properties that help protect cells in the body from damage caused by bacteria and viruses, prevent future infection and strengthen the immune system. You can take a daily dose of 10 - 15 mg of zinc in a supplement, like zinc sulfate. Or you can get it from a healthy diet. The best dietary sources of zinc include:Oysters, shellfish, shrimp, crab
Red meats
Poultry
Cheese
Beans, sunflower seeds
Pumpkin
Tofu and miso
Mushrooms
Cooked greens

Get plenty of rest.,
Create a relaxing sleep environment.,
Gargle salt water.,
Blow your nose properly.,
Quit smoking.,
Practice mild to moderate exercise.,
Use a humidifier.,
Get an indoor houseplant.",How to Stop Coughing Using Home and Natural Remedies3," Your body needs sleep to heal itself. Studies show that sleep deprivation can weaken the immune system, increase the production of stress hormones, put you at higher risk for chronic disease and lower life expectancy. If you suffer from sleep apnea or insomnia, talk to your doctor for possible treatments. If you have a cold or nasal congestion, try to lie on the side that is least congested to breathe comfortably and allow the mucus to drain. To get plenty of rest, you can also:Avoid caffeine, alcohol and sugary foods 4-6 hours before heading to bed. These can act as stimulants to keep you awake.
Create a regular sleep schedule by going to bed early and waking up early to set your body's internal clock. This will make sure you get better quality and consistent sleep. If you can't fall asleep after 20 minutes, get out of bed, go to another room and do something relaxing until you are tired enough to sleep.
Melatonin (1 to 3 mg) and/or 1 to 2 Valerian capsules may also be helpful to fall asleep.
If you suffer from obstructive sleep apnea—frequently interrupted breathing during sleep— ask your doctor for treatment options. Your doctor may recommend surgery or CPAP.CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) is a common therapy for sleep apnea which uses a small machine to supply constant and steady air pressure, a hose, and a mask or nose piece. Some CPAP devices come with a heated humidifier to help with a dry, stuffy nose.

, Make sure your room is well-ventilated, quiet, dark, cool environment (between 65 - 75 degrees). Use heavy curtains or an eye mask to block light, a powerful cue that tells the brain that it's time to wake up. Improve airflow and keep mucus flowing by propping your head up on a pillow.The pillow should support the natural curve of your neck and be comfortable. Place a firm pillow between your knees and pull your knees up slightly toward your chest if you sleep on your side. This will prevent your upper leg from pulling your spine out of alignment and reduce stress on your hips and lower back.


Avoid sleeping on your stomach, since this can block breathing, promote acid reflux and cause stress.
Avoid working or exercise 3–4 hours before going to bed. Physically and psychologically stressful activities can make the body to secrete the stress hormone cortisol. Cortisol may increase your alertness. In this context it is interesting to note that melatonin counters the effects of cortisol.
Try listening to relaxing music or doing some light reading a few hours before sleeping. Regular, moderate exercise, especially in the afternoon, can help deepen sleep.

, Place ½ teaspoon of sea salt in a glass of distilled or sterilized warm (30-35ºC) water. Stir until it's dissolved. Gargle the water for 1–2 minutes, then spit it out instead of swallowing. If the salt irritates your mouth or throat, you can also use plain, distilled warm water for gargles. Repeat gargling every few hours.This helps ease a sore throat and moisturizes your sinuses. This lets mucus drain and prevents postnasal drip that can trigger coughs.

, Experts recommended that you blow by holding a finger over one nostril and gently blowing the other into a tissue. Don't blow too forcefully since the pressure from blowing hard can impact your ears, giving you an earache on top of your cold. Be sure to blow gently, and only as often as necessary. Wash your hands each time you blow your nose, to avoid chances of other infections from bacteria or viruses.It's important to blow your nose while you have a cold. This can prevent postnasal drip, keep your sinuses clear, and prevent mucus from irritating your throat, which can easily trigger a cough.

, Smoking can cause respiratory illnesses, chronic coughing, and even stroke since it deprives the body of oxygen needed to circulate blood throughout your body. It's one of the leading causes of chronic coughing and bronchitis, also known as “smoker’s cough”. Try to avoid secondhand smoke and other hazardous fumes if you have a cough or sore throat.Avoid smoking especially when you have a headache or fever, since smoking can weaken your immune system and prolong the condition.
Ask your doctor about ways to reduce and quit smoking.

, Mild to moderate exercises such as walking or stretching boosts your immune system, reducing the recovery period and alleviating symptoms. Regular exercises also reduce the risk of infection over the long term. A daily 30–45 minute workout with moderate intensity exercises like brisk walking, jogging and swimming is recommended. If needed, talk with a physician. Try to avoid intensive training if you have a cold, fever or headache.If intensive exercise is triggering your cough, along with symptoms such as wheezing, chest pain, and shortness of breath, you may have exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB).This happens when the tubes that bring air into and out of your lungs narrow with exercise, causing symptoms of asthma. Some people with EIB do not otherwise have asthma, and people with allergies may also have trouble breathing during exercise. Talk to your physician or an immunologist to help develop a personalized fitness plan for your condition. Avoid cold, dry temperatures and changes in atmospheric pressure as these can trigger EIB.

, Dry air can aggravate the symptoms of a cold, making it harder for mucus to drain and triggering coughs. Use a humidifier in your bedroom or living room to add moisture to the air, prevent dehydration, help clear your sinuses and soothe your throat. Aim for the right humidity. The air in your home should range from 30% to 55% humidity. The simplest way to measure humidity is with a gauge called a humidistat, which can be purchased from most hardware stores.If the humidity is too high, mold and dust mites may thrive, both of which are common causes of allergies. Mold also causes an unpleasant smell and can discolor surfaces. If the humidity falls too low, it may cause dry eyes, throat and sinus irritations.Both portable and central humidifiers must be cleaned thoroughly. Otherwise, they tend to become contaminated with mold and bacterial growth that may be blown through the house. Stop the humidifier and call your healthcare provider if you develop any respiratory symptoms that you feel are related to the use of a humidifier., For a natural humidifier, consider getting a houseplant. Plants can help regulate indoor humidity by releasing water vapor from their flowers, leaves, and stems. They also help clear the air of carbon dioxide and other pollutants such as benzene, formaldehyde and trichloroethylene.Good indoor plants include aloe vera, bamboo palm, weeping fig, Chinese evergreen, and various species of philodendron and dracaena."

Visit your doctor.,
See an otolaryngologist (ENT specialist).,
Get a chest x-ray.,
Check for symptoms of whooping cough (pertussis).,
Watch for signs of nasal or lung infection.,
Watch for severe symptoms of a cold.",How to Stop Coughing Using Home and Natural Remedies4," While most coughs go away after a few weeks, some may be warning signs of an underlying condition or infection. Smokers may cough more frequently and should go see the doctor if the cough lasts longer than 3–4 weeks. You should go see your doctor with the first development of a cough if you experience:Sore throat
High fever
Whooping cough
Postnasal drip, which feels like mucus running down your throat
Coughing up blood - get emergency medical care immediately
Coughing that interferes with your work and daily activities - get emergency medical care immediately
You should especially go see your doctor if you have previously been diagnosed with allergies, asthma, bronchitis, heartburn, gastroesophageal reflux disease or are taking prescription medication, such as ACE inhibitors, for a heart condition. Coughing can aggravate these conditions.

, Your doctor may refer you to an ENT specialist, who can check your throat for signs of viral or bacterial infection, or if other underlying causes. An ENT specialist can also perform a nasal endoscopy using a fiber optic scope to look at your sinuses. The ENT specialist will look for nasal polyps and vocal cord polyps. The ENT specialist will also identify structural problems if you have nasal infection, and may suggest an endoscopic sinus surgery.You should tell your doctor about any other respiratory conditions you may have.

, Your doctor may recommend getting a 15-minute chest x-ray exam if you have symptoms like shortness of breath, chest pain, chronic cough, or fever. A chest x-ray is a painless, non-invasive test that creates pictures of the structures inside your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. Although a routine chest X-ray won't reveal the most common reasons for a cough, like postnasal drip, acid reflux or asthma, it may be used to check for lung cancer and pneumonia and other lung diseases. An X-ray of your sinuses may reveal evidence of a sinus infection.Let your doctor know if you're pregnant or may be pregnant. In general, women should avoid all x-ray tests during pregnancy.

, Whooping cough starts like the common cold with a runny nose or congestion, sneezing, a mild cough, fever and sleep apnea. After 1–2 weeks, severe coughing can begin. Whooping cough can cause violent and rapid coughing, over and over, until the air is gone from the lungs and you are forced to inhale with a loud ""whooping"" sound. You may even vomit. See your doctor immediately if you have a whooping cough.Many babies with whooping cough don't cough at all. Instead, it can cause them to stop breathing. Infants and children under 6 years get emergency medical care immediately.

, If your doctor suspects chronic sinusitis, a nasal infection, or bronchitis, you may need imaging tests including an x-ray, computed tomography (CT) scan, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Other common symptoms of nasal infection include:Fever and headache. If you have a high fever or severe headache, you should seek medical care immediately.
Pressure in the forehead, temples, cheeks, nose, jaw, teeth, behind the eyes or at the top of the head.
Facial tenderness or swelling, usually around the eyes or cheeks.
Shortness of breath or wheezing breath
Squeezing or tightness in the chest that causes pain
Nasal stuffiness, loss of smell, nasal discharge (usually yellowish green), or post-nasal drip, the sensation of fluid dripping down the back of the throat, particularly at night or when lying down.
Rare complications associated with chronic sinusitis can include blood clots, abscesses, meningitis, orbital cellulitis which causes inflammation around the eyes, and osteomyelitis, an infection that spreads to the bones in the face.

, If you have severe symptoms of a cold or flu or have been previously diagnosed with any respiratory disease, you should get professional care immediately. These symptoms include:Cough with green or yellowish phlegm
A fever of 104ºF or more.
Ear or nasal infection
Nasal discharge
Skin rashes
Breathlessness due to asthma or another respiratory problem.

Give your hoarse voice a break.,
Breathe through your nose.,
Don't take aspirin under any circumstances.,
Don't smoke.,
Avoid acidic foods.",How to Recover Your Voice After Losing It2," The best thing you can do is to not talk at all for a couple of days. Vocal rest is necessary for your epithelial tissue to repair. Silence, after all, is golden.









If you have to communicate with someone, pass notes instead of whispering. Whispering can cause your vocal cords to bang together as strongly as if you were shouting. Passing notes can also be fun, if you draw pictures or make the receiver decode the message!
If you have a job which requires you to raise your voice to be heard, use mechanical means to make yourself louder.
Chew gum or suck on lozenges so that you will have no choice but to keep your mouth closed. It will also improve production of saliva.

, Hopefully you figured this out when you were told not to talk and keep your mouth closed. How else would you breathe, but through your nose? Breathing through your mouth makes it dry, so hopefully you don't have a stuffy nose and can still breath somehow!








, If one of the reasons you might have lost your voice because you yelled too loudly, you probably ruptured a capillary. Aspirin can reduce clotting and cause excess bleeding which can impede the healing process.









There are other ways to relieve pain if your throat is scratchy. We'll get to those in the next section.

, Big duh, right? In case you've been living under a rock, smoking is a cause of throat dryness, in addition to many other negative health consequences.









Smoking could be the cause of your voice changing. After all, your lungs are using smoke to produce sound. What do you expect? Quit smoking and you may see an immediate improvement.

, Foods like tomatoes, chocolate, and citrus fruits are highly acidic; that acid tears away at the tissue in your vocal folds. To be most comfortable with your hurt throat, it's best to avoid this as much as possible.









Spicy foods aren't super good for your voice, either. Anything that causes a reaction should be avoided. (That's why water is so ridiculously good for you -- it's au natural.)

Take it slow.",How to Recover Your Voice After Losing It3," If you rocked out at a concert a little too hard last night, it's perfectly normal to lose your voice the next day. But if you randomly lose your voice with no other symptoms, it's probably the sign of a bigger problem. Consult your doctor for further guidance.








, If you're battling a fierce cold, it doesn't make sense to tackle your voice -- hit your immune system first and your voice will fall into place. If you're experiencing other symptoms, address those first. It may solve your problem.








, Even if your voice is getting better, keep up your voice-healthy habits. Think of it as completing a course of antibiotics; even if you feel good after the first few days, you still have to take the rest. Keeping it up will ensure you reach 100% and stay there.









Stay away from dairy (in addition to acidic foods) if you're trying to sing during this time. Coating your throat won't do it any favors, though it might feel good at the time. You want to get rid of all that mucus buildup, not add to it.

Your immune system can handle these infections alone over several days or a week without help from a doctor. Other symptoms besides just throat pain that can point to a strep throat infection include:Fever—101°F (38.3°C) or above
Swollen lymph nodes in your neck
Fatigue
Rash
Headache
Nausea or vomiting
Red or inflamed tonsils with white patches;
, Treating strep throat is easy, but it does require a prescription from your doctor. If you believe that you have strep throat based on the above criteria, then you should make an appointment to see your doctor. Ignoring strep throat may lead to severe complications from the spread of the infection, including:Scarlet fever
Kidney disease
Rheumatic fever, which can affect your heart, joints, and nervous system

, Your doctor will look down your throat and feel the lymph nodes in your neck as part of a physical examination. He or she may also ask you to submit to another, more concrete form of testing to confirm strep throat as the diagnosis.


The fastest test your doctor can use is a rapid antigen test, which requires a swab of your throat. Though the test can provide an answer in minutes, it’s not the most reliable method.If the test comes back negative for strep throat, then your doctor may still order the next test.
A throat culture will also use a sterile swab of your throat, but the swab will be sent to a lab for a day or two as a culture to see if more strep bacteria grow from the sample in that time., If your diagnostic testing confirms that you have strep throat, then your doctor will write you a prescription for a course of antibiotics that will kill the strep bacteria. The duration of the prescription will vary based on the antibiotic prescribed (but ten days is common). Common antibiotics prescribed for strep throat include penicillin and amoxicillin.If you’ve also been vomiting due to your illness, then your doctor can give you an antibiotic via injection.You may then take an anti-nausea medication along with a regular course of antibiotics.
If you’re allergic to common antibiotics, then your doctor can prescribe other options, such as cephalexin (Keflex), clarithromycin (Biaxin), azithromycin (Zithromax), or clindamycin., Your symptoms may start to improve within a day or two of beginning your course of antibiotics, but it’s important to take the entire prescription until it’s gone. By stopping the course of antibiotics before you have finished it, you run a higher risk of recurrence of the infection, and it can also help to breed antibiotic-resistant strains of the strep bacteria.Ensure that you follow all other directions that accompany your antibiotic, including whether or not to take the drug on am empty stomach, avoiding alcohol, and the time interval between doses.Though you’re still taking the antibiotics, you can return to school or work without risk of infecting others after you’ve been on the antibiotics for a full twenty-four hours., While waiting for your lab culture to confirm your diagnosis (or even while waiting for your antibiotics to reduce symptoms), you can take other steps to soothe strep throat pain. OTC pain medications can relieve throat discomfort and reduce fever associated with your strep throat as well. Common OTC options include ibuprofen (Advil) and acetaminophen (Tylenol).Avoid the use of aspirin in children under the age of eighteen due to the risk of Reye syndrome—a potentially life-threatening condition that can lead to seizures, coma, or brain damage., Warm eight ounces of water and then stir in a quarter teaspoon of plain table salt. Gargle the mix at the back of your throat for one minute and then spit it out.This can help relieve throat pain, and it is safe to do several times a day as needed.


This option is also safe for younger children. However, ensure the child is old enough to properly gargle the solution without choking or swallowing the salt water., Sleeping gives your immune system time and resources to fight the bacteria with the help of the antibiotics.Aim to sleep an extra four to five hours during the day in addition to a full eight hours at night. Cover up with blankets and try not to have any drafts or overhead fans on, as these can cause postnasal drip, worsening your sore throat.

, In addition to preventing dehydration, drinking plenty of water will also keep your throat moist, which will ease the pain associated with swallowing.Current recommendations vary between men and women. On average, men should try to drink around thirteen cups (three liters) each day, and women should aim to drink nine cups (2.2 liters) each day.Some people find warm liquids more soothing whereas others prefer cold. If warm liquids are soothing, you can try warm broth or green tea with some honey. If you prefer cold liquids, you can even suck on a popsicle for some temporary relief., Rough shards of toast or other sharp foods will only irritate your throat further. During the worst of your sore throat symptoms, you’ll find it more soothing to stick to relatively soft foods. Yogurt, soft-cooked eggs, soups, etc. will all be much less abrasive to your throat.In addition to avoiding dry, rough foods, you will also find it wise to avoid spicy foods or acidic options such as orange juice.Probiotic yogurts containing active cultures are a good idea. Your antibiotics will target some of the healthy bacteria in your system as well, and these types of yogurt can help restore your system to normal more quickly.

, Along with drinking water, using a humidifier is another way to keep your throat moist to avoid painful swallowing.This is an especially good option while you sleep at night and nap during the day to avoid waking up with more throat pain than necessary.


Make sure that you clean the humidifier daily since the moist environment is perfect for breeding bacteria. Follow the manufacturer's instructions to clean the humidifier.
If you don't have a vaporizer or humidifier, you can simply place several dishes of water in the room with you. As the water evaporates a bit at a time, it will naturally humidify the air.

, These medicated lozenges can also help relieve sore throat pain. If it is your child who has strep throat, ensure that he or she is old enough not to choke on the lozenge.Sprays containing similar ingredients as sore throat lozenges are also available.

, Irritants such as air pollution and cigarette smoke can inflame your throat, leading to worsened sore throat symptoms.If you smoke, then you should avoid smoking while you recover (and consider quitting altogether). Avoiding secondhand smoke will also help you to avoid making your throat hurt more than it already does.

, Since strep throat is a bacterial infection, you risk not only infecting those around you but potentially reinfecting yourself after you’ve recovered, simply by having infected items around you. Most importantly, wash your hands often with warm, soapy water and lather them for at least twenty seconds.For situations when you cannot wash your hands, consider keeping a bottle of alcohol-based hand sanitizer around. Ensure that the solution is at least 60 percent alcohol.
If your do have to touch your mouth, such as when you floss your teeth, be sure to thoroughly wash your hands before and after.

, Once you’ve been on your antibiotic for at least twenty-four hours, you should replace your toothbrush since it’s come into contact with the strep bacteria in your mouth. If not, you risk reinfecting yourself once you’ve already cleared your infection.

, Utensils, cups, and other items that have come into contact with your mouth should be washed in hot, soapy water to ensure that you kill the strep bacteria present on them.This also includes pillowcases and sheets that have been close to your mouth while you were sick. Wash them with detergent on the hot setting of your washing machine.

, If your sore throat has also led to coughing, then you should make sure you cover your mouth with your hands, sleeve, or a tissue to avoid potentially infecting those around you.Make sure you wash your hands after as well.

, Along with cleaning them well, you should also avoid sharing items such as cups during the course of your illness."

Check for symptoms immediately after ingestion of fresh produce.,
Check for life-threatening symptoms.,
Determine whether your reaction is isolated to fresh foods.,
Write your symptoms in a food diary.",How to Diagnose Oral Allergy Syndrome1," To determine whether you are experiencing symptoms of oral allergy syndrome, check to see if you are experiencing symptoms immediately after ingestion of fresh fruits and vegetables. Typically, symptoms will subside once the fresh fruit or vegetable is either swallowed or removed from the mouth.If you experience any of the following symptoms when a fresh fruit or vegetable is in your mouth, you may have oral allergy syndrome:Scratchy throat.
Swollen lips.
Itchy mouth.
Swollen mouth.
Swollen tongue.
Swollen throat.
Itchy ears.;
, It is very rare for oral food allergy to cause anaphylaxis, but it can happen. One study found anaphylactic shock in 1.7% of oral allergy syndrome patients.You should make sure you are not experiencing any severe reactions to fresh fruits and vegetables and see a doctor immediately if you experience severe symptoms.In particular, get yourself to a hospital if you experience any of the following symptoms after eating fresh fruits or vegetables:Vomiting.
Dizziness.
Hives.
Nausea.
A tight feeling in the throat.
Trouble breathing or shortness of breath.

, If you react only to fresh fruits and vegetables, you may be experiencing oral allergy syndrome. However, if you experience a reaction in response to both fresh and cooked versions of a fruit or vegetable, you may have a food allergy. In contrast to conventional food allergies, oral allergy syndrome only happens in response to fresh fruit and vegetables.Some reactions may also result from pesticides on fresh fruits and vegetables. If your reaction to fresh fruits and vegetables is mild, then you might try washing the fruits and vegetables thoroughly, such as with a vegetable brush, some white vinegar, or baking soda. You can also try switching to organic produce to see if that helps.

, Keep a food diary in a notebook or on a computer. In your food diary, record your allergic reactions to particular foods. If you experience an unpleasant reaction to eating fresh apples, write down your symptoms in the food diary. You can then use this information when talking to your doctor. You can also look for any patterns in your allergy experience. For instance, you can see if your experience of a specific pollen allergy is associated with reacting to a particular fresh fruit or vegetable:If you have a birch pollen allergy, record any unpleasant reactions to almonds, apples, carrots, cherries, kiwis, hazelnuts, peaches, pears, or plums. It is common but not necessary for people with a birch pollen allergy to experience oral allergy syndrome in response to eating fresh versions of these foods.
Record any unpleasant symptoms in response to eating fresh melons, celery, oranges, peaches, and tomatoes. If you have a grass pollen allergy, you may be more susceptible to oral allergy syndrome in response to eating these fresh foods.
Record any unpleasant reactions to fresh bananas, cucumbers, melons, zucchini, or sunflower seeds. If you have a ragweed pollen allergy, you may be especially likely to experience oral allergy syndrome in response to fresh versions of these foods.

Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS). This is a rare but life threatening skin condition in which the outer layer of the skin (called the epidermis) separates from the inner layer of skin (called the dermis). The skin turns red or purple and begins to peel away from the body, and ulcers or blisters may form in the mouth, on the tongue, or genital or anal region. Other symptoms of SJS include:

High fever (>102F or 39C)
Flu-like symptoms (fever, sore throat, cough)
Burning or itching eyes


Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is similar to SJS but more severe because it involves a greater area of the body.

, Delayed reactions are common, especially several days after starting a new medication. They usually involve an extensive skin rash that may be itchy. This is not a dangerous reaction, and it is not associated with any of the other symptoms of allergic reactions described above.

Some also have properties that may help your body combat the cause of the problem. These can be found in many grocery stores and any natural food store. In particular, the following teas are recommended:


Ginger tea can be very soothing but should not be given to children under two years old.
Chamomile is always a favorite because of its mild flavor. This is the best tea choice for children.Licorice root is also helpful, but make sure you've got the real thing, not flavored candy.Marshmallow root is great for a sore throat. This is not the type of marshmallow you would roast over a campfire. This root is from a plant used for over two thousand years for healing all sorts of wounds. Don’t use marshmallow tea if you take lithium as a medication. Also, marshmallow may decrease blood sugar. If you take anti-diabetes drugs, be careful.Sage leaf is an effective antiviral,while rosemary is an effective antibacterial agent.Echinacea is another favorite, though the taste of echinacea may take some getting used to.

Tell your doctor if you have any airborne allergies.,
Tell your doctor about your history of specific allergies.,
Communicate key information to your doctor.",How to Diagnose Oral Allergy Syndrome2," Tell your doctor if you experience airborne allergies. The first step in determining whether you have oral allergy syndrome is to assess whether you have related allergy conditions such as hay fever or mold allergy. If you have airborne allergies and you react to eating fresh fruit and vegetables, there is more basis to suspect oral allergy syndrome. To determine whether you have any airborne allergies, you should review your medical history or consider whether you experience any symptoms. In particular, look to see if you have any of the following symptoms of common airborne allergies such as hay fever or an allergy to mold:Symptoms of hay fever include sneezing, stuffy nose, an itchy nose, and swollen eyes.Symptoms of mold allergy include dry skin, stuffy nose, cough, itchy throat, nose and eyes, and watery eyes., It is important for your doctor to know if you have any specific allergies such as allergy to grass pollens, alder, mugwort, ragweed, or birch. People with oral allergy syndrome usually have these specific allergies.So, it will be helpful for your doctor to know about these specific allergies when they are making a diagnosis. You may want to tell your doctor:


“I have an allergy to ragweed and pollen. Do you think this is related to my strange reaction to fresh fruit and vegetables?”
Also tell your doctor if you have an alder allergy. If you have an alder pollen allergy, you may have trouble ingesting fresh apples, cherries, pears, and peaches.The same applies for a mugwort allergy, so let your doctor know. If you have a mugwort pollen allergy, you may experience oral allergy syndrome in response to carrots, apples, melon, celery, watermelon, spices or Chamomile tea., In particular, it is important to tell your doctor your exact age and whether or not you have had any past reaction to fresh fruits and vegetables. If you are an older child, teen, or young adult and have been eating fresh fruits and vegetables for years without a problem, you are in an at-risk demographic. In many cases, oral allergy syndrome is adult-onset.Younger children do not typically experience oral allergy syndrome, although some older children do experience it.

"
"
Consult a certified allergist.,
Ask your doctor about an appropriate allergy test.,
Get a skin prick test.,
Do an oral food challenge test.",How to Diagnose Oral Allergy Syndrome3," An allergist is a doctor who completed a residency program in internal medicine or pediatrics, followed by a few years of studying allergies and asthma. By seeing an allergist, you can get a professional diagnosis of your oral allergy syndrome.Visit the website of the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology to search for an allergist by city or zipcode: http://acaai.org/locate-an-allergist.

, The diagnosis of oral allergy syndrome will be made primarily on the basis of your medical history and symptoms. However, your doctor may wish to confirm a diagnosis using a variety of allergy tests.Ask your doctor: ""Do you think we should test to confirm oral allergy syndrome?""

, If you think you may have oral allergy syndrome, you could ask your doctor for a skin prick test. The methods used for testing conventional food allergies do not work well for testing oral allergy syndrome. However, your doctor could do a prick-plus-prick test, which involves using fresh fruit extracts and pricking your skin to determine a reaction. If the test comes back positive, your doctor should be able to confirm the diagnosis., In addition to a skin prick test, your doctor may also conduct an oral food challenge test by having you try eating different raw fruits, vegetables or nuts and recording your reactions.If your doctor uses the oral food challenge test, you will be asked to eat small but increasing amounts of specific foods.

Look for an announcement on the label itself.,
Look for the words used for common allergens.,
Realize that the term ""may contain"" is a catch-all.,
If using products packaged overseas, know the local terminology for the allergens that you need to watch out for.

,
Ask the store, supermarket, or retailer to verify ingredients where there is no label.",How to Read Food Labels to Find Allergens," Many countries now have standard labeling for the most common types of food allergens. For example, a label might state ""May contain traces of nuts, dairy, and soy"", even though none of these ingredients were listed separately. On the other side, a label may make it absolutely clear that it is allergy-friendly, such as ""Contains no soy or gluten"".;
, This can be a bit trickier but it's important to know, especially where the label hasn't made it clear or you're still not sure whether the food is safe. Some common names to know include:



Milk: casein, whey, lactalbumin.

Egg: ovalbumin, albumen.

Peanuts: satay nuts, beer nuts, or arachis.

Soy: tofu, tempeh, tamari.

, The manufacturer is often the one determining what ""may contain"" means and it could be as simple as the conveyor belt carrying products from completion to the loading deck (wrapped and therefore unlikely to cross-contaminate) to something as complex as using the same vat to mix ingredients straight after another product was mixed (meaning that despite cleaning, there may have been ingredients missed or not removed adequately). Companies like to cover all bases if there are any chances of cross-contamination.

,, For example, bulk food items in food bins such as cereals, candies, cookies, etc., might not have an obvious label on them. While many stores try to ensure there is a label on the container, if there is not, ask or do not buy it. If there is any sign of hesitancy or lack of knowledge on behalf of the retailer, err on the side of caution and don't buy it.


In some countries, an information list of ingredients must be supplied on request.
Be aware that scoops, hands, and simple errors can transfer allergens between bulk food bins.

Start online.,
Do your own follow-up work.,
Communicate and ask lots of questions.",How to Protect Kids with Food Allergies at Summer Camp1," There are lots of summer camps around the United States that are now food-allergy friendly, either designed especially for campers with food allergies or that welcome them. Many of these camps have eliminated allergens from the premises, have guidelines for allergic crises, and have medical professionals on site who are trained to use epinephrine. Start your research online and take a look.One way to start is simply to google “Food allergy friendly camps” and sift through the results. Some camps are entirely allergy-friendly, while others like Medomak Family Camp have nut allergy free weeks.
Another good resource is the Food Allergy Resource and Education (FARE) website. FARE has compiled a list of allergy-free camps, from Brant Lakes Camp in New York State to Camp Westminster in Roscommon, Michigan.
You can follow links provided on the FARE site to individual camps. For example, Camp Emerson in Massachusetts accommodates food allergies and other dietary conditions like celiac disease. They keep a team of health professionals, registered dieticians, and special chefs and all employees are trained to use epinephrine.;
, Unfortunately, allergy-friendly camps aren’t vetted, certified, or accredited, so you’ll need to do your own follow up research. Once you’ve found a number of promising leads, look more closely at each camp to make sure that they will be safe for your child.Look more closely at websites and learn about camps’ staff, facilities, and guidelines for allergies. Are there strict no-nut policies in place, for instance? Do the camps serve special meals to allergic camps and segregate foods or are all meals allergen-free?
Try to find out more about the availability of medical attention, in an emergency. Does the camp have trained nurses on staff? Also, how far is the camp from the nearest medical facility or emergency room?

, Consider calling camps in person to communicate your concerns about allergies. Ask for specifics about things like food, facilities, activities, access to medical aid, and how the camp will accommodate your child.Ask what experience the camp has had with allergy emergencies in the past and how they responded. Also, how does the camp keep track of campers’ allergy needs? How do they ensure that campers are kept safe?
Ask as well who the camp’s primary health care worker is and what his or her credentials are. Is the person a registered nurse, for example? Who is responsible if the primary staff member is absent?
Try to confirm where the nearest hospital is located and if the hospital has a doctor on call at all times. Also, ask about possible outings and where the nearest medical facility will be in relation to the day trippers.
See if you can read reviews of the camp online or if you can talk to other parents who have sent their kids to that camp.

Notify the camp staff ahead of time.,
Meet with the director, head nurse, or counselor.,
Provide the camp with medication and documents.",How to Protect Kids with Food Allergies at Summer Camp2," Once you’ve decided on an appropriate camp, notify them ahead of time about your child’s specific allergies and needs. You’ll need to inform staff about what foods your child must avoid, but also about past reactions, symptoms, and how the reactions were treated or prevented.Fully describe the allergy. Let staff know what foods your child is allergic to and how they react when exposed to these allergens, as best you can.

, When you arrive at camp, try to make contact with staff members like the director, the lead medical professional, and counselors to touch base with them. Ensure that they are aware of your child’s needs and have informed other staff members, like cooks.Be sure that the director has informed all affected staff members about your child’s allergies and needs. Apart from counselors and cooks, this can include life-guards, bus drivers, camp nurses, allergists, and dieticians.
Ask whether the camp hosts volunteers, as well, who may have contact with your child. They’ll also have to know.

, The camp will also need to have any prescription medication that your child takes and a documentary record of her allergy needs. You will also probably have to give them written authorization to administer meds or to take your child to the hospital, if need be.Provide the camp with a current photo of your child and written instructions, medical forms, and any medicines that have been prescribed for allergic reactions.
Most camps have general medical waivers that authorize them to administer medicine or to take children to hospitals. Make sure to sign one of these waivers.
Also, consider filling out an emergency Anaphylaxis Action plan with camp staff and administration. This will give your contact information, outline what the camp can expect in case of emergency, and state how they should react with epinephrine or other treatments. Such forms are generally counter-signed by a doctor.
Double check the expiration dates on your child’s medications to make sure that your child’s medications will not expire while your child is away at camp.

"
"
Provide your child with essentials.,
Teach your child to avoid unsafe foods.,
Be sure your child knows how to respond to a reaction.",How to Protect Kids with Food Allergies at Summer Camp3," Ideally, you’ve found an allergy-friendly camp and made them aware of your child’s specific needs. But before you see off your camper, whether for a week or several months, give him all of the medical basics to be as safe as possible on his own.Does your child have a medical alert bracelet, for example? This is a good idea and, in case of an emergency, can carry vital information.
Medical alert bracelets can give EMTs or other medical professionals information about the child’s allergies. There are also newer brands of medical alert bracelets with embedded chips or scannable patches – these can contain digital copies of medical documents.
Your child might be old enough to carry his or her own epinephrine injection device. Check the camp’s regulations to see if this is possible – if not, you may have to leave it with a counselor or nurse.

, You’ve probably talked to your child about allergic reactions and taught him safe practices at school and elsewhere. Camp can be different from school, though. Your child might not always be closely supervised and might be exposed to unknown snacks or foods. Give him some basic guidelines to deal with the situation.Most importantly, your child should know what foods are safe to eat and what foods aren’t safe.
He also shouldn’t eat anything with unknown ingredients or trade food with other campers.
Teach your child to read food labels, as well, as campers may have access to a “candy store” at camp and will need to know if what they’re eating is entirely safe. Have your child ask an adult to check ingredients, if need be.

, Lastly, try to make sure that your child can identify an allergic reaction. She should know what her body might do in case one happens and how to act, including getting help from an adult as soon as possible.Teach your child to seek out help if she thinks a reaction could be starting, even if there are no visible symptoms. She should tell an adult and NOT go off alone if symptoms are starting.
If old enough, and if you’ve cleared it with a doctor, your child should know how to inject herself with an Epipen or other epinephrine injecting device.

Keep your immune system up.,
Stay away from other sick people.,
Wash your hands frequently.Because your hands interact with so many objects and people each day, keeping them clean is a great way to prevent Pneumonia.,
Stop Smoking.,
Live a healthy lifestyle.,
Get enough sleep.The average adult needs between 7 - 8 hours of sleep a night.,
Know the symptoms of pneumonia.,
Know if you have any major illnesses.,
Consult a doctor if any of the symptoms of Pneumonia appear.,
Get vaccinated.Children will typically get the pneumococcal vaccination which will help your white blood cells learn what the infection is and how to battle it.,
Schedule routine checkups.Getting regular checkups is one of the best ways to maintain a healthy lifestyle and prevent all types of illnesses and diseases, including Pneumonia; as it’s always easier to prevent something from starting than stopping it once it has.,
Drink plenty of fluids.Staying well hydrated is very important if you are sick.,
Take acetaminophen.Something like Tylenol or Aspirin will reduce pain and a fever, making you more comfortable.

,
Get plenty of rest.,
Get a prescription from your doctor.",How to Prevent Pneumonia," Keeping a strong immune system is important for not only preventing pneumonia, but also plenty of common illnesses and fatigue. People with weak immune systems, children younger than two years old, adults sixty-five years or older, and people with chronic health conditions are at a higher than normal risk of contracting Pneumonia. So make sure to take extra measures to maintain a healthy immune system if you are at a higher risk.


Eating too much sugar, not maintaining a healthy weight, stress, and lack of sleep can affect your immune system hampering its ability to fight off infection.Eat healthy foods with plenty of proteins and vitamins like fruits and vegetables.
If you know that you lack certain vitamins, like vitamin D, which we largely get from exposure to UV light, take the right supplements to balance what your body doesn’t produce enough of on its own.
A bad immune system can be a result of lack of exercise and being overweight. If you are overweight your immune system may not be working at full capacity.;
,


Because Pneumonia can be contracted easily if you are already experiencing other illnesses, even the common cold, avoiding people and places where you might encounter more germs will help you to prevent getting Pneumonia.

,


Think about all the things you touch on a daily basis, and what parts of your own body your hands are coming into contact with, from your eyes to your mouth. Keep them clean to keep yourself healthy.

, One of the easiest, and also possibly hardest ways to boost your immune system and prevent Pneumonia is to quit smoking.


Because Pneumonia is a lung infection, smoking, which makes your lungs more susceptible to infections, will make it harder for you to prevent or even battle the ailment.

, Many doctors recommend this since it can protect you from many types of infections.


A healthy lifestyle has just as much to do with what you do as what you abstain from doing. This means avoiding the wrong kinds of fats in food, too much alcohol, or avoiding stressful situations.
Fats that are found in plant-based foods and oils like Omega-3 fatty acids are better for you than saturated fats often found in red meat and dairy products like butter., Take measures to ensure you’re getting enough sleep.


Sleep in the right position. You’ll get the best rest when you sleep in a position that keeps your neck and head straight. Also avoid sleeping on your stomach because it causes your head to lie at an awkward angle.
Reduce light and sound an hour before going to bed. Give your body time to wind down by not using any electronics. If you feel restless, try reading in bed.
Not getting enough sleep can also make it harder to fight off infections.

, Once you know your enemy, you take measures to prevent them from attacking you. By knowing what to look out for, you can further prevent getting Pneumonia.


A cough containing strange mucus such as containing the colors green or blood like
A Fever, which may be mild or high.
Shaking chills.
Shortness of breath when climbing stairs.
Confusion.
Sweating and clammy skin.
A Headache.
Loss of appetite, low energy, and fatigue.
Sharp chest pain.

, Talk to your doctor if you have a serious illness, especially cancer or HIV AIDS as there is a higher risk of contracting Pneumonia due to an already weakened immune system.Other factors like taking certain health medications, or a previous stroke can make Pneumonia easier to contract.
To prevent Pneumonia, ensure that you are eating healthy foods and getting as much exercise as possible.
Ask your doctor what you can be doing to prevent infection as they can make recommendations that are specifically tailored to you.

, However, you may want to make sure that you don’t just have a common cold before making a trip to the doctor and spending the money.


If you feel that you may be showing symptoms, consulting your doctor as soon as possible can help you prevent the illness from worsening.
While you shouldn’t wait too long to go to the doctor if you do have Pneumonia, one of the ways to prevent getting Pneumonia is to stay away from areas where sick people are, like a hospital or doctor’s office. So it’s best to check to see if your symptoms resemble Pneumonia or just a common cold.

,


While this isn’t a cure-all or the ultimate prevention, a vaccination will help your body to learn what to look out for.
In addition, getting other vaccinations for illnesses like the measles or the flu can help prevent these illnesses from escalating to Pneumonia.

,


While a regular checkup may not find or prevent Pneumonia exactly, getting checked for myriad illnesses or conditions like immunodeficiency, blood pressure, asthma, etc., will help you prevent any other ailments that could lead to Pneumonia from getting worse.

,


Avoid drinks with sugar in them.
Water that is either warm or room temperature will be most effective for keeping you hydrated, and you can add a lemon for a bit of flavor.

,, Sleeping a lot will help your body recover faster as not exerting yourself will let your body focus on fighting the infection.

, If you have Pneumonia your doctor will prescribe an antibiotic that will help you to fight the infection within 2 - 3 days.


Your doctor will find which antibiotic is right for you based on your age, other health conditions, and medical history.

Avoid going outdoors when pollen counts are at their highest.,
Wear a mask, especially when doing yard work.,
Keep your car windows up when you’re driving.",How to Prevent Spring Allergies1," Pollen counts typically peak in the mornings, so it’s best to remain indoors between 5 a.m. and 10 a.m. On windy days, pollen is blown about the air, so it’s also a good idea to avoid going outdoors when it’s windy. Make sure to keep your windows shut and limit how often you open doors. This will help limit the amount of pollen which enters your home.You can track the pollen counts in your area by contacting the National Allergy Bureau.Typically, local news and weather stations also post current pollen counts.
Avoid exercising outside. Try to avoid letting pets out for long periods of time when allergens are high, as they can carry pollen in their fur.;
, It might not be fashionable, but a mask will filter out some of the pollen and mold that gets kicked up when you’re mowing the lawn or weeding the garden. It’s also a good idea to wear a mask when you’re out and about on days with high pollen counts during peak season. If you can avoid it, don’t do yard work in the morning., It’s tempting to roll the windows down to feel the breeze on a car ride, but during peak season, that breeze is loaded with allergens. Instead, run the air conditioning to keep temperatures at a comfortable level. This will prevent most of the pollen, dust, and mold out from entering your automobile.Be sure to point your air conditioner vents away from your face to avoid irritating your nasal passages and exacerbating your allergies.

Teach her how to use her emergency medications.",How to Protect Kids with Food Allergies," Preparing your kitchen and home for a child with a newly diagnosed food allergy can seem overwhelming. Take time to clean out the kitchen of any foods that are unsafe for your child.


Take a weekend to spend cleaning out and reorganizing your pantry, refrigerator, freezer and any other spots you store foods. This may take more than a day to get everything set up.
Remove all foods that contain the allergen. You'll need to read labels and ingredient lists to ensure all potentially hazardous foods have been removed.
You can choose to donate or trash these ""unsafe"" foods if you desire. Many times, unopened items can be donated to food banks.
Consider having your child help you. He should not touch or come into contact with these foods; however, it will be good practice to have him read labels and identify potentially unsafe items.;
, In addition to removing unsafe foods from your house, it's important to minimize ""cross contamination."" Make sure to wash and sanitize all items in your house.


Cross contamination is when allergens from unsafe foods come into contact with cookware or flatware that is supposed to be ""allergen-free.""For example, if you use a knife to spread peanut butter on your bagel, but use the same knife (even wiped off) to spread jelly on your child's bread, you have cross-contaminated your child's meal with peanut allergens.
All dishes and utensils need to be washed and thoroughly rinsed in hot soapy water. In addition, rinse off dishes that have food residue on them prior to putting them in a dishwasher.You may also want to consider labeling some flatware and cookware as ""allergen-free"" and only use these items to prepare and serve allergen-free foods. Also wash these separate from other kitchen items.

, If your child has a food allergy, it can be difficult to limit items in your house. This is especially true if you have other children in the home with you.


If you need to include foods in your home that contain an allergen one child has, consider labeling your foods as either ""safe"" or ""unsafe."" This allows the child with the allergen to clearly see what products they can consume without worry.
You can put green labels on ""safe foods"" and red labels on ""unsafe foods"" or create your own labeling system.Although this can be an easy system to follow, still teach your kids to read labels and investigate foods — especially when they're outside the home.

, Another easy and somewhat common method of cross contamination is food, crumbs, and leftovers eaten in other rooms.Keeping foods and eating contained to one room can help prevent this.


It's common for families to snack in front of the TV, eat in the car, or carry food to their bedrooms. However, this exposes an allergic child to many more opportunities for an allergic reaction.
Limit food storage, preparation and consumption to only the kitchen and/or dining room. Do not allow other children or yourself take foods into other areas of the house.
This can help children feel safe at home and not have to worry about unknowingly coming into contact with their allergen.

, Cooking and food preparation is a common time where cross contamination can happen.Take care when preparing foods for an allergic child to avoid this situation.


Consider using specialty cookware, flatware and storage containers when preparing your child's meals or take away meals. This can help prevent cross contamination.
If you're preparing both ""safe"" and ""unsafe"" meals or foods, prepare ""safe"" foods first. This allows you to know that no cross contamination has happened since you haven't prepared any foods yet with the allergen., Your allergist and doctor will be a key component on keeping your child safe at school. Talk to them in-depth about what you need to do and how to prepare for school.


Your allergist should sit down with you and discuss your child's allergy and how to handle it at home, outside the home and at school. Ask for additional resources for how you can prepare.
Your allergist will also need to fill out school forms and prescriptions. Make sure to set an appointment up to review the paperwork and any medications you're providing to the school.Also give your allergist your child's school information so they can contact the school nurse or other officials if needed.

, It's important to communicate early on and clearly with the appropriate school officials before the school year starts, or as soon as your child receives a diagnosis. Make an appointment to speak with someone in person.


Talk to the school nurse. This may be the person who gives a child medication and manages children with allergies. Ask the nurse when she is there during the day, if the nurse train teachers and other staff members how to administer medications, and if the medications unlocked during the day?
Talk to all her teachers. Ask the teachers if they're familiar with administering medications, how they manage food allergies in the classroom for birthday parties or special events, if they have talked to the entire class about food allergies, and how they educate children on hand washing.
Speak to the school bus driver or carpool driver. In addition, talk to the school or school bus driver about how foods and snacks are managed on the bus or carpool. Ask if children are allowed to eat on the bus and if the school bus driver has an emergency allergy plan ready.
Meet with the food service director and managers. You'll also need to speak with the dining service director or manager. Ask how they keep allergens away from children in the cafeteria, if they have special school meals and snacks that are allergen-free, and what are their food preparation practices.

, Although the school, school bus, and other facilities should be be well-prepared for you child and their allergy, it's still important to make sure your child is independent and can take care of an emergency by himself as well.


Keep your child prepared with: hand wipes, non-perishable foods/snacks for shelter-in-place or other emergencies, allergy-friendly school supplies, an epinephrine auto-injector if appropriate, and an emergency contact list.Encourage children to be vocal about their allergies to other students and their friends. This can be difficult, but helpful to make everyone aware in the classroom.

, It's important to regularly check-in with your child and her school about the management of her food allergies.


Don't ask your child on a daily basis, but keep abreast of any possible bullying, isolation, or other issues that can crop up.
Also ask your child if she feels safe at school or her opinion of how her allergy is being managed by the school staff.
Continually check-in with teachers, the school nurse, or other officials about the allergen and how they are managing it. Check on the her medications and possible expiration dates, how the staff thinks your child is handling the allergy, and if any rules or policies have changed.

, If you want to go out to eat with your family and a child has a food allergy, you should do some research in advance to find a restaurant that can accommodate your needs.


Check out menus online to see if they offer an ""allergen-free"" section or list that they are able to make changes or substitutions in their meals or foods.
Call restaurant in advance. Ask if they are willing to make changes to menu items or are able to accommodate specialty foods and preparation.

, When you arrive at the restaurant make sure to speak to the staff and alert them of your child's food allergy.


Download and carry a ""chef's card"" or ""allergy card."" You can find these online and even in your allergist's office. They state your child's particular allergy, reaction, and importance of specialty foods and preparation needs. It can help restaurant staff and others understand the seriousness of your child's allergy.Stress the importance of cleaned and sanitized preparation surfaces, utensils, pots, pans and all utensils.Get your child involved. Your child should practice alerting staff about his food allergy and ask about the options that are available to him.

, If you're unsure if a restaurant is willing or able to make changes for your child, consider bring specialty items for your own use.


You might want to consider bringing extra utensils that you know have been cleaned and sanitized appropriately.
You may also want to bring wipes to help wipe down plates, cups, or other items on the table prior to sitting down to reduce risk of cross contamination.

, Like school, it's important to be prepared when going out to a restaurant — even if it's somewhere that you've previously eaten.


Always carry the child's medication in case she does come into contact with an allergen.
Be aware of signs of possible symptoms. It can be easy to get distracted while eating out, so pay extra attention to any issues that may arise.

, Spending time one-on-one and with your child's allergist is important. You both will play a key role in teaching your child about his food allergy.


Talk to your child about his diagnosis and what that means. Explain that he will be able to eat most foods, but a select few will make him sick.
Encourage him to ask questions and be comfortable telling adults about his allergy or if he is having any symptoms of an allergic reaction.Try to remain calm while teaching your child. You may unintentionally scare him into thinking he is in danger anytime he is outside your home or ""safe"" zones.

, If your child is old enough, teach her about different foods that contain her allergen and how to read a food label.


Show your child different foods with her allergen. Teach her to look on the food label for the allergen listing and in the ingredient list.
Have her accompany you to the grocery store so she can get regular practice reviewing different food labels and understanding the amount of foods that may contain her allergen.
Also teach her to never accept foods from strangers or those who are unaware of her food allergies.

, It's also important to help your child understand what happens to his body if he does ingest a food that contains an allergen. Again, it's important to be calm and understanding when teaching your child about the potential dangers and (scary) side effects. Try to keep him calm and focused as well.


If your child is younger, it may be more difficult to explain serious medical side effects. Ask your allergist for assistance when explaining these tougher terms to your child.
Have your child repeat back to you the signs and symptoms of an allergic reaction and tell you what he would do.
Signs of a reaction vary and may include:Tingling or itching in the mouth
Hives, itching or eczema
Swelling of the lips, face, tongue and throat or other parts of the body
Wheezing or nasal congestion
Abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea or vomiting
Dizziness or lightheadedness


Signs of anaphylaxis include the symptoms above as well as the following symptoms which are life-threatening:Constriction and tightening of airways
A swollen throat or the sensation of a lump in your throat that makes it difficult to breathe or talk
Shock (a severe drop in blood pressure)
Rapid pulse
Confusion, Anxiety or loss of consciousness



, Teaching your child about taking emergency medications is a must when dealing with food allergies. An auto-injectable epinephrine medication, or EpiPen, is the most common and effective emergency treatment for food allergies.


Spend adequate time with the allergist and your child explaining how to remedy a bad reaction to a food.
Emphasize that the child should stay calm and to take the medication as directed.
In addition, review your child's plan of action and knowledge of medications a few times a year to ensure she hasn't forgotten what to do.
It's also essential to teach everyone in the family, school officials, and any close family members or friends.

Change your clothes and wash your hair.,
Conduct a thorough spring cleaning of your home.,
Vacuum and mop your floors regularly.,
Make your kitchen and bathrooms mold-resistant.,
Keep pets off of beds and other furniture.,
Dry your laundry inside.,
Make your bed every morning.",How to Prevent Spring Allergies2," When you get back to the house after being outside for a while, take a shower and wash your hair. Your hair is a major carrier of pollen particles. Change your clothing as well, since pollen can cling to fabric and continue to produce symptoms long after you come indoors., Allergens like mold and dust can lurk on shelves, around windows, and in heating vents, where they can wreak havoc during the spring season. Deep clean your house just before the springtime in order to minimize indoor allergens. Consider getting your heating vents professionally cleaned every few years to eliminate potential allergens.


Using natural products like vinegar, baking soda, rubbing alcohol, and lemon are a lot easier on your seasonal allergies., You’ll have to double up your cleaning efforts during periods of high pollen counts: Mop at least once a week and vacuum twice weekly. Dust shelving before you mop and vacuum, working top to bottom to optimize your cleaning efforts. Wear a mask while vacuuming, since mold, dust and pollen can be kicked into the air during the cleaning. If possible, use a vacuum with a HEPA filter.A HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) filter pushes air through a very fine mesh which traps pollen, pet dander, dust mites, and tobacco smoke. Vacuums with HEPA filters stir up less dust and trap more dust from their exhausts.

, Prevent mold and other allergens from growing by staying on top of cleaning these areas. Wipe down all surfaces at least weekly, and reduce lingering moisture in locations like inside the refrigerator, sinks, and bathtub. Use trash cans with insect-proof lids, especially in the kitchen, and store food in sealed containers. Keep track of when to get rid of items that are out-of-date or moldy., Like your hair, pollen can cling to the fur of dogs and cats, and your furry friend can transfer those allergens on to bedding and upholstery. If you have pets that go outside, you may need to vacuum your floor even more often than twice a week in order to keep pollen at bay. Give your pet a wash more frequently than normal, up to twice a month., Avoid hanging laundry outdoors to dry during spring allergy season. Instead, use your dryer or invest in an indoor clothesline to use during these times of the year. Pollen can cling to sheets and clothing hanging on the line, and then be transferred into your home when the laundry is brought inside.

, Making your bed and covering your sheets and pillows with a comforter, blanket, or duvet will keep allergens from settling on your pillow during the day. You should also wash all bed linens in hot water at least once a week (twice, if possible), to decrease the presence of allergens."
"
Take a regular antihistamine.,
Get your allergies tested.,
Seek ongoing care.",How to Prevent Spring Allergies3," If you’ve gone through all the preventative measures and still suffer allergies, consider taking an antihistamine regularly. Take it thirty minutes before going outside in order to prevent allergy symptoms. Look for non-drowsy formulas to stay clear-headed all day. Remember to check with your doctor first about taking medications, and be sure to follow proper dosage instructions., Your doctor can either offer you an allergy test, or refer you to a specialist. The most common allergy test is a skin test, in which a tiny amount of an allergen is pricked into the skin’s surface. If it becomes red or irritated, that means you’re allergic to the substance. It might seem a bit off-putting, but it’s essential to stop the guesswork and know exactly what your allergies are.


It’s wise to consult an allergist/immunologist for proper diagnosis of seasonal and year-round allergies. An allergy specialist can help you understand your particular triggers and peak season(s).
There’s also evidence that optimizing your care options with even a one-time consultation can decrease the financial burden of allergy management. That means it’s cheaper in the long run!, You might want to consider long-term consultation if you test positive for a diverse array of allergies and find it difficult to manage your symptoms on your own. Your allergist can also help you understand and manage allergies that persist over time despite your best efforts to control your environments. They can prescribe stronger antihistamines, nasal sprays, eye drops, and other means of improving your condition."

Consume things that contain quercetin.,
Break into the spice cabinet.,
Cut down on foods that make allergies worse.,
Consider taking butterbur.,
Try a Neti pot.,
Drink more water.",How to Prevent Spring Allergies4," Quercetin is an antioxidant that can prevent and relieve seasonal allergies by blocking cells from releasing histamine. It may also have anti-inflammatory properties. Quercetin is found in a variety of sources, including citrus fruits, onions, apples, dark berries and cherries, red wine, and tea. Dietary supplements containing the nutrient are also available.It's important to consult your doctor before making any changes to your diet. This applies whether you're eating more foods with quercetin or any other nutrient, or adding herbs or vitamin supplements to your diet.

, While you’re looking for allergy relief in the kitchen, consider cooking your dinner a bit spicier than you normally would. Hot and spicy foods not only add more flavor, but can thin out mucus secretions and clear out your nasal passages. Experts recommend spices like cayenne pepper, hot ginger, fenugreek, and garlic., Certain food can actually make pollen and ragweed allergies worse. Examples include melon, banana, cucumber, sunflower seeds, chamomile, and Echinacea. While you’re making your diet more allergy-friendly, look for even the slightest food intolerances which may cause hives or nausea. Eliminating foods that you’re mildly sensitive to will ease the burden on your immune system., Butterbur is an herb that may work to relieve nasal allergy symptoms. One recent study showed that taking one butterbur extract tablet four times daily was as effective as popular antihistamine drugs.The raw, unprocessed plant contains chemicals that can harm the liver called pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs). If you do pick up a butterbur product, make sure it’s labeled “PA-free.”

, A Neti pot or saline rinse can rinse away bacteria, thin mucus, and help reduce postnasal drip. Clearing the mucus from your nose may help relieve your allergy symptoms. You can purchase a sterile saline rinse at most drugstores, or make your own.To make your own saline mix, Mix 1/2 teaspoon salt with a pinch of baking soda in 8-ounces (237-mL) of warm distilled or sterilized water. Never use water that has not been sterilized.
To use, lean over a sink, tilting your head to the side, and flush your upper nostril. Then turn your head to the other side and flush the other nostril.

, If you are experiencing congestion or postnasal drip, increase your water intake to help thin out the mucus.Make sure you are drinking, at minimum, the daily recommended amount of fluids — 9 cups (2.2 liters) for women and 13 cups (3 liters) for men."

Try herbal remedies.",How to Prevent Hay Fever," Most people who suffer from hay fever have specific triggers that cause it to flare up. Figuring out what specific allergen triggers your hay fever can help you avoid them and get proper treatment if necessary.


You may be able to determine what your own triggers are. For example, if you experience the symptoms of hay fever after touching an animal or sleeping on feathers, the it is likely one of your triggers. Likewise, if walking through a field of fall foliage makes you sneeze and gives you watery eyes, that could be your trigger. Try to avoid triggers when possible.
Your doctor can also perform either a skin prick test or a blood test to determine what your specific triggers are.Many people get hay fever in the spring, but it can occur year round.If you have asthma or eczema, you're more at risk for developing hay fever because of an overreaction of hormones, such as histamine and leukotrienes.;
, Pollen and molds are one of the primary causes of hay fever. Keeping them at bay in your home and limiting your exposure when may help relieve your hay fever.Some effective ways to reduce your risk of ingesting pollen and mold include:


Avoid inhaling molds or pollen when you're outside. For example, ask a friend or family member to rake leaves or mow the lawn. You can also consider wearing a mask during outdoor activities like gardening. You may also choose to hire a lawn service.
Stay inside in the mornings as much as possible, as pollen counts are highest at this time.
Close your doors and windows during pollen seasons.
Dry your laundry inside or use a dryer. Pollen can stick to your laundry when you dry it outdoors.
Use an air conditioner in your house and car.
Employ allergy-grade filters in your ventilation systems at home and change them on a regular basis. Consider using HEPA (high efficiency particulate air) filters in your bedroom or in other areas in which you spend a lot of time.
Install a dehumidifier in your room, which may also help reduce the amount of pollen and mold to which you’re exposed.
Wear a dusk mask when you clean., Dust mites, which feed on dead skin and saliva, are present in all areas of your home, especially in carpets and bedding. By keeping your home and bedding clean, you may be able to eliminate a significant number of dust mites and help relieve your hay fever. You can help reduce dust mites by:


Placing allergy-proof covers on your mattress(es), box springs, and pillows.
Washing sheets and blankets in water that is at least 130 degrees Fahrenheit (54 degrees Celsius).
Recent studies have shown that not making your bed may also help keep dust mites at bay.
Reducing humidity with an air conditioner or dehumidifier.
Vacuuming your home every day or every other day your. Consider placing a HEPA or small particle filter on the vacuum to catch allergens.
Removing carpeting in your bedroom if dust mites cause you to have severe hay fever and interrupt your ability to sleep.
Spraying insecticide specially-designed for dust mites. Just make sure it is approved for indoor use on carpets, bedding, and furniture., Cockroaches can carry allergens with them as they pervade your home. It is also possible to have an allergy to cockroaches.Exterminating them and taking steps to deter their presence may minimize the number of allergens in your home and help control your hay fever.You can help eliminate cockroaches in your home by:


Exterminating your house. Although you can buy commercial cockroach treatments, if you are suffering from hay fever, you may want the help of a professional exterminator.
Blocking and cracks and crevices that may allow roaches to enter.
Clearing dishes and placing all trash in a sealed garbage can. You may also want to take out the trash every day.
Store all food, including pet food, in sealed containers., May people get hay fever from their beloved pets or those of other people. Controlling pet dander in your home and not touching animals when you are not at home may help relieve your hay fever. You can control pet dander in your home by:


Keeping pets outside as much as possible.
Bathing dogs twice a week, though you should be aware that this could irritate your dog’s skin. There is no evidence that bathing cats can control dander.
Keep pets out of your bedroom and off of your bed.
Vacuum floors and any carpeting daily., Antihistamines help neutralize allergens and can minimize your hay fever symptoms. There are many different over the counter and prescription antihistamines that can relieve hay fever. Talk to your doctor about which are best for you.You can buy antihistamines over the counter at most pharmacies and in some grocery stores. You may find that loratadine, cetirizine and fexofenadine help control your hay fever best.Your doctor can prescribe an antihistamine nasal spray to help relive hay fever that affects your nose. Ask her about azelastine and olopatadine to help relieve your hay fever.In addition, you can also try antihistamine eye drops, which may relieve the symptoms of hay fever that affect your eyes. You can get these at many pharmacies or your doctor can prescribe stronger versions.Some antihistamines may also help you sleep because they have a sedative effect.You should take antihistamines with food and water to reduce your risk of stomach irritation. You can dose antihistamines in adults every 8-12 hours; take between 1 and 2 mg of the medication at each setting., These drugs help prevent and treat inflammation, itching and runny nose caused by hay fever.Consider using nasal corticosteroids to help relieve your hay fever symptoms.Your doctor needs to prescribe most nasal corticosteroids. You may want to ask if medications such as propionate, triamcinolone, mometasone, and budesonide can help your hay fever.Recently, the nasal corticosteroid fluticasone became available over the counter and is available at most pharmacies and even some larger retailers., Your doctor may prescribe an oral corticosteroid such as prednisone if you hay fever is especially severe. Follow your doctor’s orders exactly when taking these medications.Oral corticosteroids can have serious side effects when used long term. These include: cataracts, osteoporosis, and muscle weakness.Your doctor might also prescribe prednisone if your hay fever is very severe, but the side effects (such as weight gain and issues with glucose metabolism) can be severe.

, If you are suffering from hay fever-related congestion, you may want to take either an over-the-counter or prescription decongestant. These medications can help relieve your hay fever and its uncomfortable symptoms.Decongestants come in liquid, tablet, and nasal sprays.The most common oral decongestant that you can get over the counter is pseudoephedrine.You will need to get a prescription from your doctor for nasal decongestants such as phenylephrine and oxymetazoline.Oral decongestants have a variety of side effects including high or increased blood pressure, insomnia, irritability, and headache.Using nasal decongestants for longer than 2-3 days can make your symptoms worse., If you have very severe hay fever that doesn’t respond to other medications, talk to your doctor about getting allergy shots. Over the course of a few years, they may help significantly relieve or eliminate your hay fever.Studies have found that allergy shots are especially effective at treating hay fever allergens such as cat dander, dust mites, pollen, grass, and weeds.Allergy shots are often called immunotherapy or desensitization therapy., You can use a squeeze bottle or neti pot to rinse out your sinuses. This may clear allergens from your nose and relieve any congestion.Using sterile water in either the neti pot or squeeze bottle, make a basic saline solution of one teaspoon of salt to one cup of water. Gently pour this into your nasal cavity and let it flow out the opposite nostril., There is some evidence that certain herbal remedies may help prevent seasonal allergies and hay fever. Consider this treatment if you don’t want to take any medications.Butterbur may help relieve your seasonal allergies. However, make sure that if you decide to use butterbur to only purchase products marked “PA-free”, which indicates that potentially hazardous toxic substances are removed from the product.There is also limited evidence that spirulina and tinospora cordifolia may also help relieve hay fever.Although there is no conclusive evidence, some other herbal remedies or supplements such as capsicum, honey, vitamin C and fish oil may help relieve seasonal allergies.You can buy herbal remedies and supplements at most health food stores and some pharmacies.

Take a break.",How to Prevent Motion Sickness in Kids," If you're going to be somewhere your child will get motion sick, try to skip foods that can cause nausea. For instance, spicy foods or greasy foods can often cause a child to feel sick. Even too much sugar can cause nausea. Try to stick to bland foods if you know you're going to be somewhere your child may get sick, such as the car. If it's a fairly short trip, you can just avoid eating right beforehand.If your child needs a snack, try something that isn't too harsh on their stomach, such as crackers and water.;
, In the car, the best place to help prevent motion sickness is in the front seat. However, if your child is under 13 years of age, they should sit in the backseat, where the middle seat is the best, as it still allows them to see out the front.However, keep in mind that laws vary by country and state about when a child can sit in the front seat.


If you're traveling by plane, pick a seat right over the wings, preferably by the window. Your child can stare at the horizon, and the wings are the most stable part of the plane., You can use medications to help prevent motion sickness before it starts. However, keep in mind that most of these medications will make your child sleepy. If your child is over two, you can use Dramamine, designed to help with motion sickness. If your child is over six, you can use Benadryl, which is an antihistamine that may also help.Always read the label first to check for medications your child is allergic to. In addition, it's always best to talk to your child's doctor before giving them a new medication.

, Acupressure bands are stretchy bands that go on your child's wrist. They have a small piece of plastic on one side that's supposed to go on the inside of your child's wrist. The plastic presses on a pressure point that can help with nausea and motion sickness.Put these on your child before you get in the car. They should be about half an inch above the wrist crease, with the plastic point on the inside of the wrist.

, No remedy is fool-proof, so your child might still get sick. It's a good idea to be prepared with zip-top plastic bags or paper bags (for vomit), air freshener, wipes, washcloths and water (for a compress), and towels to clean up any messes. Also, be sure to have a change of clothes on hand for your child.If your child is prone to throwing up, consider placing a towel underneath them to help catch vomit.
If your child is under 3, don't give them a plastic bag to throw up in. Make sure to use paper. However, zip-top bags are still good for holding soiled clothes.

, Motion sickness happens because there is a disconnect between what the inner ear is sensing and what the eyes are seeing. It's also caused by the nerves in the limbs. Therefore, a child looking outside the car or plane will perceive movement, so they are less likely to get motion sick.Looking out the front window is best., Watching something in the car, such as a movie, or reading a book can make motion sickness worse. It increases the disconnect between the outside movement and your child's body not recognizing movement. Therefore, it's best to have your child skip these distractions if you know they have problems with motion sickness.In addition, avoid other situations that cause motion sickness. While you child can't avoid every instance of motion sickness, as being in the car is a primary cause, teach your child to avoid other places that may cause motion sickness. For instance, watching 3D movies can cause some people to be motion sick. Roller coasters and even swings or other playground equipment can also be a problem., Many people find that distractions can help with motion sickness. Try playing a game with your child when they're feeling sick or put on their favorite music, both of which can help them not feel as sick., Another good distraction is using soothing scents. Lavender or peppermint can be soothing, and it can give your child something else to think about besides feeling sick. In fact, some people are sensitive to bad smells when they're motion sick, so it can help cover up those., Chewing peppermint gum can also be a good distraction. Some people find that ginger helps, so try giving your child ginger candy to reduce the nausea. The distraction and the ginger can help with the motion sickness.Don't give candy or gum to kids under the age of 4 because it is a choking hazard.
Don't let kids of any age suck on candies in a moving vehicle because sudden stops and starts may cause them to inhale and choke on the candy.

, Sips of clear liquids can help to calm your child's stomach. Water is best, but any clear liquid can help to settle their stomach.Some people also have good luck with fizzy drinks, such as lemon-lime soda or ginger ale.

, Of course, staying still can be difficult for any child. However, having your child try to not move their head and body can help with the symptoms of motion sickness. Try having them rest their head on a pillow as they look out the window., Crack a window to let some fresh air into the car. It can keep your child from getting overheated. Plus, the fresh air may help the child feel better. If it is too hot or cold, try taking the air off recirculate in your car, which may help some.If you're on a plane, open the air vents for circulation.

, Once your child starts to get motion sick, it can help to take a break. If you're in the car, stop for a little while so your child's body has time to adjust to not moving. Walking around or laying down with their eyes closed may help while you're stopped. If you're in a plane, encourage your child to walk up and down the aisles.You can also try putting a cool cloth over their head to ease the sickness."
"
Get vaccinated while pregnant.,
Create a “circle of protection.” Before your child is born, you should begin checking to make sure that all family, friends, and caregivers that will be around your newborn have been vaccinated against whooping cough.,
Have your infant vaccinated according to the recommended schedule.,
Recognize symptoms of pertussis.,
Don’t downplay the risk or avoid vaccination.,
Continue to take special precautions.,
Vaccinate your kids as toddlers and pre-teens.,
Avoid outbreaks.,
Ask about post-exposure prophylactic antibiotics.,
Watch for possible changes in whooping cough immunization practices.,
Look and listen for signs of pertussis.,
Seek medical attention as needed.,
Be respectful of others.",How to Protect Kids from Whooping Cough," Before your child is even born, you can begin the process of protecting him or her from whooping cough. Under normal circumstances, expectant mothers should be vaccinated against whooping cough at some point between their 27th and 36th weeks of pregnancy.The antibodies you develop will be passed on to your unborn child, helping to protect him or her during the first few weeks of life, when the dangers of whooping cough are the greatest. Newborns cannot be vaccinated until they are two months old, so this indirect protection is the best alternative.
Women should be vaccinated each time they are pregnant. Adult vaccination requires one shot of the “Tdap” vaccine, which also covers tetanus and diphtheria.
Kids age seven and above and adults get the “Tdap” vaccine; kids under age seven get the “DTaP,” which covers the same illnesses but has a slightly different composition.;
, Do not let unvaccinated people come in contact with your newborn, as they could unknowingly pass on pertussis.Exposure prevention is the best way to protect a newborn from whooping cough.
Do not let your discomfort prevent you from protecting your susceptible newborn. If someone isn’t sure if he or she has been vaccinated against whooping cough before, require a new vaccination — it won’t hurt if it is a repeat. Adults should be vaccinated every 10 years, but it is safe to get them more frequently. Newer vaccines may also wear off sooner, so you may want to get a booster before 10 years have passed.
If you want to do more than just say ""I'm sorry, but if you haven't been vaccinated, you can't be near my baby,"" the CDC has collected a wide range of supplemental materials that may help at http://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/materials/parents.html. These materials include single-page fact sheets, videos, a children's book, and personalized e-cards that you can send out before your baby is born. Use them to support your insistence about the vital importance of vaccination.

, In the U.S. and elsewhere, it is recommended that newborns receive “DTap” shots at two, four, and six months of age, then one more shot at 15 to 18 months. Unless there is a medical reason why your child cannot be vaccinated, following this schedule is the best protective measure you can take.About one in four newborns will experience minor side effects from the shot — typically fever or injection-site redness or swelling for a couple of days. More severe reactions are very rare — discuss the risks and signs to watch out for with your baby’s pediatrician.

, For most older children and adults, whooping cough presents first like the common cold, with congestion, coughing, and a runny nose, followed after one to two weeks by more severe coughing. It often progresses to severe coughing spells that are sometimes followed by a ""whoop"" sound as you are catching your breath. This cough may last for weeks or even months if left untreated. Symptoms in infants can be harder to identify, however, which is another reason why protecting them is so important.Some infants do not develop the telltale cough, and may instead experience apnea — abnormal pauses in breathing. Sadly, in rare cases, pertussis-induced apnea in infants can lead to cardiac arrest and even death. Pertussis can also cause dangerous cases of pneumonia in newborns.
If your infant presents with cold-like symptoms (runny nose, etc.), contact the doctor to discuss the infant’s risk of pertussis and to get the infant tested if pertussis is suspected. About half of all infants who develop whooping cough need to be hospitalized.

, Many good-intentioned people continue to advocate against childhood vaccinations, and can present superficially compelling and even scientific-sounding defenses for the position. However, there is an overwhelming mountain of evidence demonstrating that the benefits of vaccination for illnesses like whooping cough outweigh any potential risks by exponential degrees.There is simply no legitimate scientific evidence that vaccinations cause autism, make illnesses worse or more likely, harm the immune system, or any of the other common claims. Vaccination is not 100% effective, and can hurt some people; but it helps so many more.
Don’t sell whooping cough short — it is a threat to your infant’s life. Get your baby and those who surround him or her vaccinated.

, If your infant or small child has not been vaccinated against whooping cough, due to an allergy or medical condition for instance, you must continue to be vigilant in protecting him or her from contracting pertussis.


Most babies who contract whooping cough get it at home, from a parent, sibling, or other visitor. If vaccination is not an option (yet or ever) for your child, ""cocooning"" him or her by limiting contact with non-vaccinated or potentially infected persons is your best alternative.Don't hesitate to ask people if they or their children have been vaccinated, or if they have been sick recently. Disclose that your child cannot be vaccinated and is thus at an increased risk. Once again, the materials at http://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/materials/parents.html may be helpful.
With non-vaccinated infants in particular, you should try to avoid contact with anyone who has been sick, whooping cough or not. Children under six months old are particularly susceptible to a variety of illnesses. You're not being rude by asking if someone has been sick recently or turning down a play-date; you are protecting your child and being a responsible parent.

, After the series of three shots at 2-6 months and one more at 15-18 months, current recommendations advise that children be vaccinated once more with the “DTap” shot between the ages of four and six. Generally speaking, have your child get the final “DTap” shot before he or she begins school, which is a common breeding ground for the spread of illnesses like whooping cough.At age 11-12, your child should receive a single dose of the “Tdap” vaccine as well. As an adult, your child will need to be vaccinated again every 10 years.

, The whooping cough vaccine is about 80%-90% effective when administered according to the recommended schedule. This means vaccinated children are at a small risk, and unvaccinated children at a much higher risk if whooping cough is spread at school, a playground, etc.However, keep in mind that the vaccine loses its effectiveness over time, so your child is at a higher risk the longer it has been since he or she was vaccinated.


Even if your child has been vaccinated, steer clear of kids or adults who have or may have whooping cough. If your child has or may have whooping cough, keep him or her out of school and away from public areas until he or she recovers and your doctor says it's ok to return. Treating pertussis with antibiotics will help your child recover faster and it may even help prevent the spread of pertussis to others, including family members.
Remember, even if pertussis is unlikely to be more than an annoying illness for your child, each case of whooping cough increases the chance that a newborn (or other high-risk person) somewhere will contract the illness.

, If your child has been exposed to someone who has pertussis, either at school or at home, then your child’s doctor may want to put your child (and anyone else who was exposed) on an antibiotic, such as azithromycin. Your child would have to take the antibiotic for five days. The antibiotic may prevent your child from developing pertussis after exposure.


You will also need to follow up with your child’s doctor if he or she has been exposed. Your child’s doctor would need to examine your child and tests may also be necessary if your child is having any cough or cold symptoms.
A post-exposure prophylactic antibiotic will need to be administered within 21 days of exposure, so take your child to see the doctor as soon as you find out that he or she was exposed to pertussis., Recent outbreaks of whooping cough — such as in California in 2010 and again in 2014 — have led some to question the efficacy of the vaccine (and a few others to condemn all vaccines). Early evidence indicates that changes in the vaccine in the 1990s meant to reduce the severity of possible side effects may have reduced the long-term efficacy of both the “DTap” and “Tdap” shots.At present, no changes have been recommended to the current immunization schedule. However, it is possible that the age-based schedule may eventually be supplemented or replaced by a risk-based, targeted schedule. For instance, shots may be recommended at the start of a new outbreak, akin to how flu shots are recommended at the start of each flu season.
If you have questions, talk to your doctor.

, Whooping cough can be hard to recognize at first, as it often mimics the common cold for one to two weeks. In most older children and adults, though, a telltale cough eventually develops. Once it does, see the doctor for treatment.Pertussis often causes coughing fits so severe that the lungs are emptied of air; the struggle to refill the lungs by gasping for air creates the distinctive “whooping” sound between coughs.
To hear an audio sample of a coughing fit with the “whooping” sound that gives pertussis its common name, visit http://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/materials/everyone.html#pertussis-sounds.

, If an infant shows any signs of a cold or illness, contact the doctor. If a child has had what seems to be a common cold for more than a week or two and develops a severe cough, or develops the severe coughing fits at any time, visit the doctor.


After testing to confirm a pertussis diagnosis, antibiotics are a common treatment. Antibiotics can shorten the amount of time that someone with pertussis is contagious, which may prevent others from becoming infected. Otherwise, the treatment options comprise primarily of rest, fluids, and symptom treatments (such as easing the cough).It may be necessary to monitor infants for signs of apnea or other problems while staying in the hospital.

, If your child has (or may have) whooping cough, keep him or her out of school and away from large gatherings. Whooping cough spreads extremely easily among children who are not vaccinated, and less so in those who are vaccinated, and there is no way for you to know if other children have been vaccinated or not.People with whooping cough are most contagious during the first three weeks or so, which covers the initial stage that mimics the common cold, and the early period when the severe coughing fits usually begin. But follow your doctor’s advice regarding how long your child should avoid contact with large groups."

Assume it is a stomach bug.,
Consider the possibility of other common causes.,
Be aware of unusual but serious causes.,
Understand motion sickness.This may be the most frustrating common cause of vomiting in children, as it can make the car trip to Grandma’s house a recurring disaster.",How to Prevent Vomiting in Children1," Because they often interact in close quarters and don’t always practice the best hygiene, children easily spread viruses. Vomiting can be a common symptom, along with fever, weakness, tiredness, and diarrhea, among others.Teaching your child good hygiene (like frequent hand-washing) and steering clear of other sick children are the best way to reduce the likelihood of getting sick from a stomach virus, but don’t expect miracles when dealing with kids.
Vomiting due to a stomach virus usually clears up within 12–24 hours. If vomiting continues for more than a day or two, gets worse (for instance, the child cannot keep down liquids), or other symptoms worsen, contact your child’s doctor or seek medical attention.
Rest and rehydration are the best treatments for this type of vomiting. Have the child rest in a reclined position with her head turned to the side (to prevent aspiration of vomit), and offer regular, small doses of electrolyte solutions, sugar water, Popsicles, gelatin water, or other liquids as recommended by the pediatrician. If she continues to vomit every time you try small amounts of fluids, stop and call your doctor right away.;
, Absent other evidence, a stomach virus should be your first guess for the cause of vomiting. However, other illnesses and even simple childhood activities can bring it on.If your child has a respiratory infection, such as a common cold, sometimes this can lead to vomiting because of continuous coughing and the drainage of mucus into the stomach. An ear infection can also sometimes cause vomiting.
Sometimes throwing up can be triggered by a long bout of crying. If your child is very upset and cries continuously for a long period of time, he can make himself sick and begin throwing up.
Overeating can cause vomiting, as can overexertion. Mixing the two is often a recipe for disaster.
Food allergies or intolerances can cause vomiting. Take note if certain foods seem to trigger vomiting and inform the pediatrician. Seek immediate medical attention if the vomiting is associated with hives. swelling of the face or body, or trouble breathing.
Anxiety and excessive stress can also lead to vomiting, not to mention headaches and other maladies. Sources of anxiety in children can range from school troubles to family breakups to fear of monsters in the dark. Stress reduction strategies, behavioral therapy, and perhaps even medication may help reduce both anxiety and the resulting episodes of vomiting., Vomiting in children is usually not something you need to be overly worried about, but it is prudent to be aware of potentially serious causes. Call your child’s doctor or seek medical attention if:Your child is vomiting and has a severe headache or neck stiffness.
The vomiting is forceful or projectile, especially in a baby.
Your child vomits due to head trauma or injury, as she may have a concussion or more serious injury.
There is blood (possibly appearing like coffee grounds) or bile (usually green in color) in your child’s vomit, as these can indicate serious stomach or intestinal conditions.
Your child is noticeably lethargic or has a marked change in mental status, which can indicate severe dehydration
Your child has severe abdominal pain, which can be caused by meningitis or appendicitis.
There is the possibility that your child has consumed a toxin or poison.

, Knowing your enemy is the first step towards conquering it.


Motion sickness occurs when the “motion sensors” in your body — eyes, inner ears, and nerves in the extremities — receive conflicting information.
Thus, when your body is moving but your eyes are looking at a stationary book or video screen, you may experience motion sickness.
It is not clear why children tend to experience vomiting with motion sickness more often, but children ages two to 12 seem most susceptible.

Combat nausea by keeping your child hydrated.,
Encourage your child to rest when feeling ill and relax while eating.,
Control a persistent cough.,
Prepare for car sickness ahead of time.",How to Prevent Vomiting in Children2," While it is an essential treatment after vomiting, small but frequent sips of liquids can help calm nausea before vomiting as well.Have your child drink small amounts of clear liquids. Because drinks that contain sugar can help soothe an upset stomach, offer sweetened liquids such as flat soda or fruit juices. Popsicles also work well. The sugar in these drinks can help to calm the stomach better than water alone.
Electrolyte solutions such as Pedialyte can be helpful if your child will drink them.
Let sodas like cola or ginger ale go flat before giving it to ease nausea, as the carbonation can further upset the stomach.Stay away from juices that are too acidic like grapefruit and orange juice, as these juices can make the stomach feel worse.
Pediatricians generally prefer focusing on hydration with nausea (or after vomiting) over the use of anti-emetic (anti-vomiting) medications because of the risk of side effects with the latter.However, if nausea or vomiting are severe or continuing, anti-nausea and vomiting medications may be recommended and can be very effective.

, It can be a tall task to get an active child to calm down, even when he is feeling ill, but appropriate rest and relaxation are some of the best tools to prevent vomiting.Resting can help to calm your stomach. Sitting or lying in a propped up position is preferable.
Any physical activity can make nausea worse. Encourage your child to stop playing until the nausea passes.
Try not to let your child eat while he is playing. Encourage your child to sit down and have his snack. If he runs around while eating, this motion can lead to sickness. (It is also a choking hazard.)
If you suspect overeating may be contributing to vomiting episodes, try offering smaller, more frequent meals. Replace fatty, heavy foods with more fruits and vegetables.

, If your child’s vomiting is caused by a persistent cough, getting rid of the cough should also get rid of the risk of vomiting.See your doctor if the cough is severe or not improving after one week to see if medical treatment may be needed.


Always follow dosing recommendations for over-the-counter cough medications. Check with the pediatrician before giving any medicine to small children, especially medicines not intended for that age group. Most pediatricians don't recommend cough medicines for children, especially under age eight. If your child is older than one, talk to your doctor about giving honey for coughs.
If your child is old enough to safely suck on lozenges or hard candy, these may also help soothe a cough. Err on the side of caution with young children, especially if they are under four, to prevent choking.

, A little planning beforehand, and some quick action if motion sickness symptoms appear, can prevent major delays (and clean-up operations) later.Schedule plenty of stops during your trips. This will help give your child a chance to get some fresh air and will calm her stomach. If car sickness develops, stop immediately and allow the child to get out of the car and either walk around or lie on her back with her eyes closed.
It can help if your child has something in her stomach, especially for a longer trip. Try giving her a small snack before the car ride. Be sure to give her something that is not too sweet or fatty, though. Crackers, bananas, and applesauce make a good snack to help prevent nausea.
Be sure to give your child plenty of fluids before and during a car ride. This will also help calm her stomach by keeping her hydrated.
Seat your child so that she faces the front windshield when riding in the car. Watching movement out of the side windows can worsen nausea. But always follow proper car seat usage, even if this means your child must face backwards.
Distract your child from any feelings of car sickness by listening to or singing songs, or just talking. Books and video screens can exacerbate motion sickness.
There are also several medications for motion sickness. However, before giving your child any over-the-counter medicine, it is advisable to consult your doctor. Motion sickness medications can also cause side effects like drowsiness that may last long after the car trip ends.

Children are most likely to get lice from classmates, family, and other children that they are in close contact with., Hats, coats, scarves, hair accessories, combs, brushes, headphones, and towels should not be shared. Sharing these items can allow for indirect transfer of lice.Your child should also avoid putting his personal belongings in shared spaces such as lockers or on shared hooks., Indirect transfer can also occur if your child lies on a bed, couch, carpet, stuffed animal, or pillow if the item has been in contact with an infested person.The risk of infestation is lower than head-to-head contact, but it is still possible.

, Children should not put their items on shared coat hooks or in shared cubbies or lockers. If the school or day care does not provide each child with his or her own space, have your child put her items in a sealed plastic bag before the items are put in the shared space.Also, have your child avoid playing with any dress up clothes that are shared and not washed regularly."

Small rocks;
, Toys with small pieces are not intended for young children and should include a warning label. Follow age guidelines on toy packaging. Do not give children toys from vending machines as these do not have to follow safety regulations.At restaurants with kids’ meals, ask for an age-appropriate toy.

, If you spill a bag of pasta, for example, pick it up immediately. Check under tables and chairs for extra pieces. Anything on the floor is fair game for a child to place in his mouth., When your older children play with items like Legos or Barbie shoes, ask them to pick up their messes. Explain that they too need to be careful about small objects.Consider making it a game for school-age children to see who can find the most small items.

, Although you cannot watch children 100% of the time, try to be as vigilant as possible. If you see them getting into something they should not, intervene immediately. Set ground rules for items that they can and cannot touch.

, Remember that a child’s windpipe is as wide as a drinking straw. Remove seeds from foods like watermelon and pits from foods like peaches.This practice applies to both children and adults.


For hot dogs, slice the hot dog lengthwise. Then cut it into smaller pieces widthwise.Remove the skin.Quarter grapes.Be especially careful when eating fish with bones (which should only be done by older children and adults, not young children). Tell your children to try to take very small bites and remove any bones beforehand if possible. Do not swallow too fast.

, Show your children how big a bite should be. Show that the piece of food should be smaller than their child-sized spoon or fork. Talk about how we need to eat slowly for safety and also to be polite. Instead of praising children for being done eating quickly, praise children who eat at a moderate pace.

, When discussing healthy eating practices, explain to your children the importance of chewing their food well. They should chew their food until it is soft and easy to swallow. You might consider having them count to ten while they chew. After a while, they will be used to slower chewing.


Do not feed children solid, chewy food until they have sufficient teeth and are developmentally ready. Talk to your doctor to see where your child is in terms of development.
Children learn based on what they see. Try to plan enough time for meals so that you are not rushed.
Alternate drinking and eating. Teach your children not to drink and eat at the same time.Encourage your children not to speak and chew simultaneously.

, Do not feed your young children while they are walking, standing, or otherwise moving. Sit at the table whenever possible with a straight back. In no case should your child eat and run. Also avoid eating in the car or while on the bus or subway.If you make a sudden stop, you or your child could choke.

, Children under the age of five should avoid several food items. If you do give these items to children, you should cut or cook them very carefully (e.g. hot dogs). Although older children and adult can eat these items, they too should practice caution. Foods for young children to avoid include:

Show them affection.,
Communicate regularly.,
See their pediatrician regularly.,
Form a relationship with school staff.,
Reach out to family and friends.",How to Promote Good Mental Health for Your Child1," You don’t have to hug your child every five minutes, but one great way to promote good mental health for your child is to let them know that you care.Showing affection can give your child a sense of security and confidence. It can also model appropriate ways to express emotions.


Although older children and teens might resist a bit, give them a hug, pat on the back, or even a fist bump every now and then.
Tell your child that you care about them and that you love them on a regular basis. For instance, you could say, “Love you” when you’re dropping them off at school. Make sure that you let your child know that you love them no matter what. Do not only tell them you love them or offer praise when they do something that is pleasing to you.;
, Talking with your child on a regular basis can help support their mental wellbeing in several ways. Good communication will help maintain and strengthen your relationship. It will also let your child know that you care about them and that you're there for them. It can also make it easier for you to notice if something is wrong and for them to tell you about it.


Talk to your child about everyday events. For example, tell them how your day was and ask how theirs was. Talk about world events and news in your community.
Talk about emotions and feelings and how to manage them. For instance, if you notice your child seems disappointed, you might say, “I see you’re disappointed. I know how that feels. One way to handle it is to think about something positive.”
Send them a good morning text or try video chatting when you can't be face-to-face. It’s a great way to quickly communicate to them that you care.
Remember that half of communicating is listening. Give your child your full attention when they’re talking to you and really listen to what they’re telling you.

, Your child’s physician can be a great resource for you and your child for medical and other issues. In addition to making sure everything is physically okay, their pediatrician can provide you with information and recommendations for others services.


Attend all scheduled appointments. Regular check-ups can help you identify potential problems early on.
Talk to their pediatrician about any questions or concerns you may have. For instance, you might ask, “Can you recommend some resources that can help me to learn more about promoting good mental health for my child?”
Encourage your child to ask their pediatrician questions and talk about issues concerning them. Try sitting down with your child before the appointment and making a list of all of their questions and concerns. It is easy to forget these when the appointment comes, so making and taking this list to the appointment will help to ensure your child can bring up all of their questions and concerns.

, Teachers, coaches, school counselors, and support staff spend several hours each day with your child. They can help build your child’s self-confidence, handle problems, and let you know if there might be something going on with your child.Attend parent-teacher conferences and other meetings with the adults in your child's life.
Ask school and community leaders for support when your child is facing issues.
Make sure your child knows that there are adults they can turn to if they ever need help with anything. For example, you might say, “You can talk to your teachers about homework and anything else that might be on your mind.”

, Just like your child needs a support team to help build good mental health, you also should rely on the people close to you.Turn to friends and family for advice, encouragement, and parenting examples. They can support you, as well as be a part of your child's support team.


Ask other parents you know and respect for tips on promoting your child's mental and emotional wellbeing. You could say, “What are some things you do to support your child's mental health?”
Let your child know that your family and friends care about them, too. For instance, you could tell your child, “You can always talk to your aunts, uncles, or grandparents about things going on in your life.”

Stay updated on any outbreaks of lice in your child's daycare or school.,
Clean any items that have been in contact with an infested person.,
Do not keep your children out of school.,
Be careful with shampoos that claim to prevent lice.",How to Prevent Lice in Children2," Schools and daycares notify parents if a child has head lice infestation. Begin to monitor your child's hair and clothing for lice.Under a bright light, use a fine tooth comb to comb through the hair for adult and nymph (baby) lice and their eggs (nits). Look for light brown, yellow, white, or tan seed-like objects.Pay special attention to the area around the ears, hairline, and nape of the neck. It is easier to spot nits in those areas. Itching in those areas can also be a symptom of lice.You may also find small red bumps or sores in the scalp.
Inspect your child's bedding, towels, and any clothes worn in the last two days for lice.Remind your child to avoid head-to-head contact and sharing of personal items.
Continue checking until the lice infestation at school is over.

, Clothing, bedding, and any other items the infested person wore two days before they began lice treatment should be washed in hot water and dried on high heat as well. Items can also be dry cleaned or sealed in plastic for two weeks.Vacuum the floor and furniture, especially where the person sat or lay. Lice survive less than one to two days once they fall of a person so vacuuming these items is enough.Stuffed animals should be put in the dryer on high setting.Note that lice do not live on pets., It is not necessary to keep your child home from school or daycare if another child has lice. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that healthy children should not be kept home from school if he or she has head lice infestation or if another child at the school has head lice infestation. It is completely safe for children to finish the school day, be treated for lice, and go back to school the next day.The AAP has encouraged schools to change their policies that ban children with head lice infestation from attending school. No child should miss school because of lice., Some over-the-counter hair products claim to repel lice. However, these products are usually not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration, and the safety and effectiveness of them is unknown. It is better to use proven methods to prevent lice than use these products.Head lice prevention products are usually more expensive than typical hair products as well and need to be used repeatedly. This can end up becoming an expensive solution without any guarantee that these products will work."

Sometimes parents treat children with lice when they do not have an active infestation.Also, an itchy scalp could be a symptom of another disease such as dandruff or eczema.Your child may not experience itching until two to six weeks after the infestation., Your doctor will probably recommend an OTC treatment. Make sure you ask the doctor for specific instructions regarding the timing and frequency of using these medications. Common medications include Permethrin (Nix) and Pyrethrin (Rid, A-200, Lice Killing).Follow the directions on the package.


Hair should be shampooed and not conditioned before using one of these treatments. You can also try rinsing the hair with white vinegar before using the medicine.Common side effects of these medicines are redness and itching.
Pyrethrin should not be used if your child is allergic to ragweed or chrysanthemum.Continue to check everyone in your family for lice for one week after treatment is finished.Pediatricians usually recommend that you repeat the treatment once after 1 week.

, If the OTC medications do not work, your doctor can prescribe a medicine such as Benzyl alcohol (Ulesfia) and Malathion (Ovide). Benzyl Alcohol can cause redness and itching and is only recommended for children six months of age and older. Malathion should only be used by children six years of age and older., Wet the child's hair, apply conditioner and then comb the hair with a fine-toothed nit comb to remove the lice. Hair should be combed from the scalp to the ends at least twice. Repeat this process every three or four days until the lice have been gone for two weeks.There is no scientific evidence that wet combing is effective for removing lice., Mayonnaise, olive oil, butter, and petroleum jelly can also be applied to the hair and scalp. Note that there is no scientific evidence that supports these home remedies,and that they can be quite messy.


Apply these products to the hair and then cover with a shower cap. They should be left in overnight and then washed out., Any items the infected person used in the last two days should be cleaned. This includes bedding, clothing, and hair care items. If the items cannot be put in the washing machine, they should be dry cleaned or sealed in a plastic bag for two weeks.Hair care items should be cleaned using hot, soapy water.

Dress a child in layers.,
Put babies and young children to sleep in their own beds.,
Keep the thermostat at a constant temperature.",How to Prevent Heat Related Illness in Children2," Remove a child's outer layer or coat when entering heated buildings or on longer car trips. If you are warm with a coat on, your child probably is too.


Remember when the child is strapped into a safety seat and gets hot, the child cannot easily remove his or her jacket.

, Avoid putting babies down with parents or siblings.


The fabric used in adult blankets causes overheating and suffocation more easily and extra bodies provide more heat.

, Resist turning up the heat in a baby's room because a baby or very young child cannot dissipate heat as well as adults.

"
"
Observe your child for symptoms of mild dehydration and heat cramps.,
Take immediate action by moving a child inside and giving liquid (if possible)if you notice symptoms of heat exhaustion, severe dehydration or heat stroke.,
Call emergency services immediately if you notice severe confusion or hallucinations, lack of sweat (dry skin), vomiting, trouble breathing (or fast breathing that does not slow down in a few minutes), unconsciousness or seizures.

",How to Prevent Heat Related Illness in Children3," These are the two earliest heat illnesses. If noticed, take the child to a cool place immediately and give liquids.


These symptoms can range from complainants of being very hot or very thirsty, sweating, muscle cramps, red skin and dizziness and nausea. Babies may have red skin or dampness around their neck and hair.

, You should also remove excess clothing and give a child a cool bath or shower.


Symptoms may include excessive sweating or no sweating at all. A child may complain of vision problems, headaches, dizziness and weakness. He or she may exhibit agitation or confusion, hallucinations and rapid breathing.

Give encouraging feedback.,
Teach them about positive self-talk.,
Provide positive experiences.,
Encourage your child to be social.,
Support their interests.",How to Promote Good Mental Health for Your Child2," Part of good mental health is the ability to handle feedback and criticism. Early experiences receiving feedback can help your child learn to accept criticism without it lowering their self-esteem. You can help your child by providing them with corrective feedback, as well as specific praise.Instead of just telling your child what they’re doing wrong, suggest ways they can improve. For instance, instead of saying, “You're not reading that right,” you might say, “Try breaking the word down into smaller parts.”
Praise your child's efforts rather than their qualities. For example, you could say, “ I'm proud of how you stuck with that project,” instead of saying, “You're so smart.”

, Showing them how to combat negative self-thoughts and the criticism of others can help promote good mental health in your child. Positive self-talk can help them maintain their self-esteem as a child and as an adult.


Model using it yourself. For instance, you might say, “Wow, his comment on my post was kind of mean. I’m going to remind myself that I'm still a great person.”
Help your child develop a list of their positive qualities, skills, and traits. They can refer to this list when they need to.

, One way that children develop self-esteem is by experiencing success.Having these experiences can help build their confidence and promote good mental health. Create regular opportunities for your child to display and develop their skills and capabilities.


You can give your child tasks to do that are age-appropriate and that you know they can handle, but it is more important to let them decide what tasks are important to them. For example, a young child may get the most joy out of buttoning a button on their own for the first time. Be sure to share in your child’s celebration.
Allow your child to show their independence. For instance, resist the temptation to help your toddler with their shoes. Just be patient and allow them to show you they can get dressed without your help.

, Having friends and participating in social activities is a necessary and fun part of growing up.Being social promotes good mental health because it can build self-esteem and give your child additional people to get support from. Provide your child with the opportunity to meet and socialize with peers, as well as to participate in activities at their school and in your community.


Take your child places where they can meet other kids their age. For instance, you might go to the park, a community center, or a trendy café.
Support your child in their extracurricular activities and hobbies. For example, encourage your child to explore their interest in swimming by joining local swim team.

, Although you may not be able to attend every event they’re participating in, you can still support them and their interests. Letting them know that you're interested in their hobbies and activities can help boost their self-esteem and encourage them to have character and confidence-building experiences.It also lets your child know that the things that are important to them matter to you as well.


Ask your child questions about their interests and activities. For example, if they enjoy online gaming you might ask about the latest game release.
Or, for instance, you could make snacks for your child's basketball team or help out with their fundraiser.
Encourage your child to try new activities. You might say, “I’m proud of how you explore new experiences and opportunities.”

Show them deep-breathing techniques.,
Prepare nutritious foods.,
Encourage good sleep habits.,
Be physically active with your child.,
Try meditation as a family.,
Talk about journaling.",How to Promote Good Mental Health for Your Child3," While children don’t necessarily have the same types of stress that adults do, they do experience stress. It may be the stress of starting a new school or having a spat with their best friends. One way to help your child maintain good mental health is to teach them to manage stress appropriately. Deep-breathing is a stress-management technique that children of all ages can use.


Teach your child how to use deep breathing to calm down during difficult situations. For example, when they feel angry, show them how to count to five as they slowly inhale and exhale to calm down.
Show your child how to inhale through their nose, hold it a few seconds, and then release it through your mouth. You might say, “Watch how I breath in, hold it, and then let it go.”

, Eating nutritious food promotes your child physical health by giving them energy and maintaining their immune system, which can help them manage their stress. Although your child may prepare their own snacks and meals, you likely make some of the meals and the major grocery decisions and purchases for the household. Provide and prepare foods that support your child’s brain development in order to help promote their mental health.Include whole grains, fresh fruits and vegetables, and proteins in their meals and snacks. You might, for example, prepare grilled chicken breast with steamed vegetables for dinner.
Encourage your child to choose healthy snacks when they aren’t with you. For instance, you can send some fresh veggies as a post-practice snack so they don't have to get chips out of the gym vending machine.
You can include children in grocery shopping in different ways depending on their ages. For example, you can tell your young child what healthy items you are putting into the cart and have them repeat the names, or if they are old enough to read, they can read off the items for you. For teens, you can involve them in making the grocery list and have them help you by crossing off items on the list as you add the to the cart.

, Whether you're an adult or a child, it can be difficult to manage stress when you’re tired. Make sure that your child is getting enough sleep each day so that they can have the energy and focus they need to be mentally alert.Set a bedtime for your child and stick to it. For instance, you might decide that your child should be in bed by 9:30 PM so that they can be well rested for the next day.
Create a bedtime routine to help your child get ready to rest. For example, you could read a book together, give them a bath, and then talk for a few minutes over a glass of milk.

, This is a great way to spend quality time with your child and to promote their mental health.Physical activity can help reduce tension, boost creativity, and help you and your child stay physically fit. Go for a walk, swim, or bike ride together or do yoga or martial arts with your child.

, This is a great way to help your child reduce stress and manage their emotions. Meditating together will give you the opportunity to spend time with your child and will give them a stress-management technique they can use their whole life.


Explore different forms of meditation to find the style that works best for you and your child. #*Encourage your child to explore other types of meditation on their own. For example, you might share resources like videos, apps, or books about meditation.
You can start by sitting or lying somewhere comfortable with your child. Walk your child through relaxing their mind and body. You might say, “Close your eyes. Try to just think about breathing and relaxing your body.”

, Keeping a journal is a good way for children to release their emotions and manage their stress. This can help promote their good mental health by giving them a safe, private place to express themselves.Talk to your child about using a journal as a way to share their thoughts, feelings, and experiences.


Give your child a blank journal and suggest creative ways for them to use it. For instance, younger children can draw pictures, while older children can write.
Schedule a journaling time for you and your child. Take 10 minutes each day with each of you writing in your journals.

Look out for problems in school.,
Pay attention to sleep patterns.,
Watch for substance abuse.,
Notice if there are problems with aggression.,
Seek help if you’re concerned.",How to Promote Good Mental Health for Your Child4," Sometimes when children are having emotional, mental, or social problems it’s not always evident at home. They may be able to function normally during family times, but show signs of a problem when faced with the stressors of school like peers, academics, etc. Also, some mental health issues like ADHD are most evident in structured settings like school. Staying in touch with how they're doing in school academically, behaviorally, and socially can help you recognize and address any problems early on.Be aware of falling grades, trouble completing homework, discipline issues, and other signs that there may be a learning or mental problem.
Pay attention if your child suddenly seems reluctant to go to school. This may indicate they there are social problems, like with a bully.
Communicate frequently with your child’s teachers and other school personnel. You can ask them to let you know if they see anything concerning.

, Children should get about 10 hours of sleep each day, but you know your child's specific sleeping habits. Some children, especially teens, may seem to be constantly napping, whereas other children seem to need little sleep at all. Sleeping a lot or only a little may not necessarily be a sign of concern. However, sudden or dramatic changes to your child’s sleep patterns may suggest that there is a mental health issue.


Ask your child about their dreams. Frequent nightmares, particularly in younger children, may be a sign that your child has some issues that need to be addressed.
Ask them how they slept. For children of any age, trouble falling asleep or staying asleep might suggest that there is a problem.
Pay attention to whether your child seems rested in the morning or if they seem to be tired and lacking energy.

, Unfortunately children may abuse alcohol and other substances like prescription medications and illegal drugs at younger ages than we would like to believe. Being aware of the signs of substance abuse can help prevent mental health problems because the two often occur together.


Be aware of how your child spends their money. For example, you might check to make sure their lunch money is being used at school for lunch and not other things.
Check with websites like https://www.ncadd.org/about-addiction/signs-and-symptoms/what-to-look-for-signs-and-symptoms for specific warning signs of substance abuse.

, Every child will throw a temper tantrum, yell, or become too physically aggressive at least once in their childhood. However, it may suggest a bigger problem if these behaviors become frequent or start to negatively impact your child.For example, if your child is bullying others at school or frequently picking fights with siblings, there may be something else that needs to be addressed.
Remember that adolescents and teens may be experiencing normal hormone changes that can account for some of their aggressiveness occasionally.

, You don't have to wait until something happens or an issue arises to get support. If you are concerned about your child’s mental health, you should talk to a professional as soon as possible.Physicians, therapists, and other similar professionals have the resources and experience to help you promote and address your child’s mental and emotional wellbeing.


Ask your child’s school counselor, pediatrician, or coach for recommendations for community resources. For example, you might say, “I have some concerns about my child’s mental health. Could you suggest places we can get help?”
See a family counselor to work through issues you all may be having and to address your concerns about your child’s mental health.
If you have immediate concerns about your child’s safety, you should contact a crisis hotline like the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 immediately.

Vaccinate your baby starting at 2 months old.,
Expect mild discomfort from the shot.,
Vaccinate older children and adults if they are in a high-risk group.,
Call your doctor if your child has a severe reaction to the shot.",How to Prevent Haemophilus Influenzae Type B (HIB) in Children1," The Hib vaccine, or shot, is the best way to prevent Hib infection and is 95% effective. All children younger than 5 years old should get the Hib vaccine.Make sure your child gets all doses for the best protection, and if you miss a dose or get behind schedule get the next dose as soon as you can.Children should get a Hib vaccine at:


First dose: 2 months of age.
Second dose: 4 months of age.
Third dose: 6 months of age (There are two types of Hib vaccine for babies, and depending on what brand of vaccine is used your child might not need the six month dose. Your healthcare provider will tell you if this dose is needed.)
Final dose: 12 through 15 months of age.;
, The Hib vaccine is given as an injection into your baby’s upper thigh in infants and toddlers, or the upper arm of older children.Hib vaccines are safe, but mild or moderate side effects can occur, usually lasting 2 or 3 days.The most common side effects include redness, swelling, and warmth where the child got the shot, and fever around 100F (37.8C).The vaccine cannot cause Hib disease. The Hib vaccine is an inactivated and fractional vaccine, containing only part of the Hib germ. Only the entire Hib bacteria can cause Hib disease.To minimize shots your child has to receive, the Hib vaccine can be given at the same time as other vaccines. Some brands of vaccine contain Hib along with other vaccines in a single shot, such as the DTP-HepB+Hib (Diptheria-Tetanus-Pertussis + Hepatitis B + Hib).Rare problems that could happen after any vaccine include brief fainting spells or, very rarely, severe shoulder pain in the arm where a shot was given.

, Some adults and children over age 5 are at increased risk for invasive Hib disease and may need additional doses of the Hib vaccine even if they got all their shots as babies. Hib vaccine is not routinely recommended for healthy adults 19 years and older even if the person did not receive Hib vaccine as a child. However, Hib is recommended if a person has the following conditions:


Sickle cell disease.
Asplenia (no spleen).
HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) infection.
Antibody and complement deficiency syndromes.
Receipt of chemotherapy or radiation therapy for cancer.
Receipt of hematopoietic stem cell or bone marrow transplant., Severe allergic reactions from a vaccine are very rare, happening in fewer than 1 in a million doses. If one occurs, it is usually within a few minutes to a few hours after the vaccination. Problems might include rash, trouble breathing, or changes in your child’s behavior."

Choose the best time.,
Describe what is going to happen.,
Explain the IV.,
Answer questions.,
Trust your instincts.",How to Prepare Your Child for an MRI1," The best way to help your child prepare for an MRI is to talk to them about it beforehand, describe what will happen, and answer questions. Generally speaking, for kids 2 and under, this will be most effective on the way to the appointment. For kids 11 and over, this preparation can come weeks in advance.Use this chart to decide when you should begin preparing your child for their MRI:


2 years old – speak to them on the way to the appointment
3-5 years old – speak to them the day before the appointment
6-10 years old – speak to them a few days before the appointment
11 years old and up – speak to them a week or two before the appointment;
, Using simple, straightforward terms, tell your child everything that is going to happen. Speak to your child's doctor to get a specific overview of your child’s procedure. Details can differ from patient to patient, such as the length of the procedure, the use of sedatives, and the use of an IV.Your child will lie on a “special,” movable bed that will slide into a narrow opening. They might go in head or feet first, depending on what’s being examined.
A large magnet will create a kind of “force-field” around your child. This is totally painless; they will not feel the radio waves directed at them.
You child will hear some clicking, buzzing, and thumping noises. They may wear earplugs or headphones to help block the noise. For some procedures they may also need to wear a special helmet.
During this process, it is very important for your child to stay still, “like a statue.” Many MRIs last from 30 to 45 minutes, but your child’s could be shorter or longer than this.
When it is finished, your child will slide out of the tube. If they have been given an IV, this will be taken out. If you child has been given medicine (a sedative), they will still be pretty sleepy for several hours. When the procedure is over, you can go home together.
Your child will probably be scheduled for a follow-up appointment to review their results.

, Some MRIs will require the use of a contrast dye to make the images clearer. This dye is administered using an IV. The doctor can let you know if this will be a part of your child’s MRI, and if so, be sure to talk to your child about this aspect too.A tourniquet, or “stretchy rubber band,” will be placed on your child’s arm to help the nurse find a vein.
The nurse will clean the skin, and may spray the area with a cold “freeze spray.” This will help numb the area.
The nurse will then prick your child with a small needle, and place a tiny tube inside the opening. The cold spray will help make this less painful. Also, the needle will come out right away and only the little tube will remain. Any pain will only last for a few seconds.
Finally, the nurse will place tape on the tube to help keep it in place.
You may want to distract your child during this process, but they are welcome to watch if they prefer.

, Once you have explained the procedure to your child, give them a chance to ask questions. Provide clear, honest answers. If there is an answer you don’t know, consider calling the doctor together to find out. Remember that kids may need some time to formulate their concerns, so be prepared to answer questions minutes, days, or weeks after your initial talk.Some kids might ask:

“Is this going to hurt?”
”How does the test work?”
”How long will I be in the tube?”
""How will I feel when the test is done?”


You can explain:

”The test won’t hurt your body at all. There will be some loud noises, so you can wear earplugs or headphones to keep your ears safe.”
”A machine uses a big magnet—like what we have on the fridge, but way stronger—and radio waves—like the sounds coming out of our radio—to take picture inside your body.”
”Let’s call the doctor and see if they can tell us how long your MRI will go.”
Depending on whether or not your child will take a sedative, you can either say, “You should feel totally normal,” or “You might feel sleepy for a while, but you can come home and watch movies.”



, You know your child best, and all children are individuals. When you talk to your child, and how you talk to your child, is up to you. The most important thing is simply to help them mentally prepare, assuage any fears they may have, and be available to answer their questions."
"
Tell them about the appointment a day or two in advance.,
Be positive.,
Tell the truth.,
Explain the purpose of the examination.,
Describe what the office looks like.,
Let them know they’ll have to wait.,
Walk them through a typical exam.,
Explain special exams or procedures.,
Get them involved.,
Address your child’s fears.,
Role play.,
Read books about going to the doctor.,
Treat your child like normal.,
Distract your child while you’re waiting.",How to Prepare Your Children for a Visit to the Doctor," You might think that keeping your child’s doctor’s appointment a secret until the day of will keep them from making too big a deal of it. However, springing a doctor’s appointment on your child might actually make it more stressful than it needs to be. Letting your child know they have a doctor’s appointment coming up a couple days in advance can help lessen their anxiety about it.


Tell your child about the appointment only one or two days in advance. If you let them know too long in advance (a week, for example), small children may forget by the day of the appointment and for older, school-aged children, a week might give them too much time to worry and fret over the appointment.Tricking or failing to inform your child about the appointment can make them distrust both the situation and the doctor.;
, Providing your child with information about their doctor’s visit can help them worry less and keep a good attitude towards the doctor. When you’re talking about the visit, stay positive. Let them know that the doctor is a friend who wants to help ensure they are healthy so they can continue to learn and play. Promoting a positive picture of the doctor and the exam can help increase your child’s comfort level, confidence, and their willingness to cooperate with the doctor., Your child may have lots of questions about their upcoming visit. Do your best to answer these questions, no matter how many they have, as honestly as you can. Don’t just gloss over questions or lie to make things easier on yourself. For example, while it may seem like telling your child the exam won’t hurt would make it easier on you both, your child may feel betrayed when they find out this isn’t true during the examination.


If you aren’t sure about an answer, tell them so. You probably won’t know everything that is going to happen during their exam so if they ask you a question you’re not sure about, tell them you don’t know. For example, say, “I don’t know if you’ll have to get a shot. The doctor will figure out what you need to feel better after they examine you.”, One of the first questions your child might have after learning about their upcoming doctor’s appointment is why they have to go. If it is a routine check-up, you can say something like, “All healthy kids go to the doctor to make sure they are growing and developing like they should. The doctor will examine you and ask you some questions to make sure you are healthy.”


If the appointment is to diagnose an illness, try saying, “The doctor needs to look at your body to figure out how to fix what’s been bothering you and help you feel better.”, As a general rule, giving your child as much information about their upcoming doctor’s appointment as possible will be most helpful in easing any fears or worries they might have. This includes describing the building, waiting room, and exam room to them. If you can, tell them what they will see, what there is to do in the waiting room, where they’ll sit in both the waiting room and exam room, and another building the doctor’s office might remind them of., Your child may feel especially anxious while waiting for the doctor to see them. Explain to them ahead of time that it is normal to wait to see the doctor and tell them how the waiting room might be set up and what they might be able to do there, like play with other children or new toys. Knowing what to expect and understanding that this is a normal process can help take away some of the worry they may experience., As expected, the actual examination is probably going to be the scariest part of your child’s doctor’s visit. It can help them cope if you walk them through what a normal examination will entail. Some of the typical parts of an examination include:


Getting their blood pressure taken
Having their temperature taken with an ear thermometer
Using a tongue depressor to hold their tongue down and look in the back of their throat
Looking at their eyes and ears
Listening to their heartbeat (on both their chest and back) with a stethoscope
Tapping or pressing on their tummy to feel what’s inside
Weighing them and taking their height
Tapping on their knees to check their reflexes
Looking at their feetA potential quick look at the genital area

, If your child is going to the doctor for a special exam or procedure, it can be difficult to explain the procedure to them because you might not even know what all it will entail. When you call to make the appointment, you can ask to speak to a nurse or doctor to find out some general information about what will go on during the procedure.


If the procedure might be uncomfortable, embarrassing, or painful, be honest with your child. Let them know it could be unpleasant for a moment, but don’t go into too much detail, and remind them that you will be there the whole time to comfort and protect them., Your child will probably have lots of questions about their appointment and what the doctor will do during it. Allowing your child to be involved in the process of gathering information for their appointment can help ease their mind. In addition, they will likely be reassured by your active role in the process. Try some of the following ways to get your kid involved:


Ask them to contribute to a list of symptoms you will give the doctor.
Ask them to write down any questions they have for the doctor. They can then give this list to the doctor to read or ask them the questions themselves.
If your child is going to the doctor for a recurring problem, have them help you list the treatments they’ve had previously and document which have worked and which haven’t., It is completely normal for children, and many adults, to have fears about going to the doctor. Talk to your child about any fears they may have and do your best to ease their worries about these fears. In doing so, address their fears in words they can understand, always be honest, and don’t make promises you can’t keep. Some of the most common fears include:


Fear of separation—being afraid they’ll be separated from their parent during the visit
Fear of pain during the exam
Fear of the doctor—some children may take a doctor’s serious demeanor, speed and efficiency, and detached attitude as a sign that they are very stern or don’t like them
Fear of the unknown—your child’s imagination can run wild when they don’t know what they are going to the doctor for and they can blow regular check-ups or minor illnesses way out of proportion
Some children may also experience feelings of guilt when going to the doctor. They might believe that their illness or the exam is some sort of punishment for wrongdoing. Let them know that going to the doctor is a normal occurrence., Acting out the part of the doctor and patient can help small children understand what will happen during a visit to the doctor. You can use dolls your child has or a play medical kit to go over what the examination might entail and to demonstrate some of the typical parts of an examination.In addition to introducing your child to some of the equipment they might see, it can also help to describe how this equipment will feel. For example, let them know that it is normal for a blood pressure cuff to feel tight around their arm., There are also many children’s books available that help explain and illustrate the process of going to the doctor. Reading these books and talking about them to your kids can help ease anxiety about going to the doctor. There are also a number of videos that can help your child understand the appointment process.


It might be tough for your child to articulate their fears about the doctor, but if a character in a book is experiencing the same worries, your child may be able to talk about what is worrying them more easily., Your child’s fears about their doctor’s visit might get worse while they are in the waiting room. This increase in their anxiety level might cause them to act out or misbehave. You can help them acclimate to being in the waiting room by holding them to the same standards of behavior you do at home or in any other public place. Holding them to the same standards as usual will let them know this is just another routine part of their daily life., You can help take your child’s mind off their upcoming exam or procedure by distracting them with an enjoyable activity while you wait. Try doing a puzzle or letting them play their favorite game on your phone. Hopefully this activity will take your child’s mind off the exam and make them feel more relaxed.


This strategy can also work during the exam or procedure. For example, try having a conversation with your child while they are getting a shot to distract them from what is going on."

Consider an annual vaccination as your first line of defense in flu prevention.,
Recognize symptoms of influenza.,
Practice good hygiene habits throughout flu season to minimize exposure to the virus.",How to Prevent Influenza in Children," Flu shots are available at doctor's offices, pharmacies and clinics. Each year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American Academy for Pediatrics update their guidelines for flu vaccines, so parents can determine the best course of action for their children.


Flu vaccines are typically recommended for children from 6 months of age up to 19 years. Vaccines are particularly essential for children younger than 5 and those with chronic health conditions like asthma and diabetes, which could create a higher risk for flu complications. The only exceptions to the vaccine recommendation include children who are allergic to eggs, those who have had an allergic reaction to the flu shot in the past and kids who are currently sick and running a fever.
A nasal-spray is also available for parents of some children. Vaccinating parents will help prevent them from spreading the flu to their children. The nasal spray administers a live, weakened virus, as opposed to the dead virus administered in the injection. Because it is a live virus, the nasal spray is not recommended for people who have chronic conditions like asthma, children under the age of 2 and those who have had an allergic reaction to the flu shot or eggs in the past. It is also not used for children or adolescents who are on long-term aspirin therapy.
In most cases, the flu vaccine is the best way to prevent getting the flu. However, it is not a foolproof method, since it is impossible for doctors to predict the precise flu strain that will circulate in any given year to make up the vaccine. For those that do get the flu after having the vaccine, symptoms of influenza are typically milder and do not last as long.;
, If your child exhibits them (even after getting a flu vaccine), keep him home from school or day care to avoid spreading the virus. Influenza is a highly contagious virus that can be spread through airborne germs or human contact. Keeping children away from others when sick can go far in minimizing the effects of the virus.

, Flu season typically begins around September, and may run as long as May of the following year. During this time, the virus can run rampant in some communities, especially where many people did not get the flu vaccine.


The CDC recommends frequent hand washing as one of the best ways to keep the flu virus at bay. In addition, the agency suggests instructing children to cover the mouth and nose when they sneeze and immediately throw used tissues away. Teach children to avoid touching the mouth, nose and eyes, where germs are easily spread. It is also important to avoid contact with others who exhibit flu symptoms or other signs of illness.

Avoid vaccinating children younger than six weeks of age.,
Forgo the vaccine if your child was ever allergic.,
Wait to vaccinate until your child is healthy.,
Follow regular healthcare precautions.",How to Prevent Haemophilus Influenzae Type B (HIB) in Children2," Hib vaccine should never be given to a child younger than six weeks old, as this might reduce his or her ability to respond to later doses and develop immunity., Anyone who has ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction to a previous dose of Hib vaccine or to an ingredient in the vaccine (such as latex, which is present in the vial stopper of some brands of Hib vaccine) should not get another dose., Children with a moderate or severe current illness should receiving the vaccine when their condition has improved., It is always wise to use good hygiene, but if you cannot vaccinate your child try to keep him or her healthy with practices like you would to avoid the flu. Hib is spread person-to-person so avoid sick people, especially if they have pneumonia, meningitis, or epiglottitis, the most common illnesses caused by Hib. Parents, wash your hands often and well before being with your child.


Some adults who are in close contact with someone who is sick with Hib should receive antibiotics to prevent them from getting the disease. This is called prophylaxis. A healthcare provider will make recommendations for who should receive prophylaxis."
"
See your healthcare professional for a diagnosis.,
Get treatment immediately.,
Vaccinate your child even after he or she recovers from Hib disease.",How to Prevent Haemophilus Influenzae Type B (HIB) in Children3," Meningitis (infection of the fluid and lining around the brain and spinal cord), pneumonia (infection in the lung), and epiglottitis (infection in the throat that makes it hard to breathe) are the most important diseases caused by Hib bacteria. In developing countries pneumonia is more common than meningitis in children with Hib disease, but Hib disease should be suspected in the case of any child with signs and symptoms of meningitis or pneumonia.Symptoms of Hib meningitis include fever, decreased mental status (confusion, lethargy, behavioral changes), and stiff neck.The diagnosis of Hib disease is usually made based on one or more laboratory tests using a sample of infected body fluid, such as blood or spinal fluid., Hib disease is treated with antibiotics. Most people with Hib disease require hospitalization. Even with antibiotic treatment, 3% to 6% of all children with Hib meningitis die from the disease.Immediate treatment can improve chances of survival.


An additional 15% to 30% of survivors suffer some permanent neurologic damage, including blindness, deafness, and intellectual disability.

, Children younger than 2 years old don't develop very good immune responses to either the vaccine or the infection, and may not develop protective levels of antibodies. This means that a child could get Hib disease more than once.Children younger than 2 years old who have recovered from invasive Hib disease are not protected and should receive the Hib vaccine as soon as possible."
"
Practice holding still.,
Pack a blanket and stuffed animal.,
Bring music or a movie.",How to Prepare Your Child for an MRI2," One of the hardest parts of the MRI for some kids is holding still. You can help prepare them by brainstorming ways to hold still together.You might try singing songs, telling stories, counting, or imagining they are visiting their favorite place.
You might even practice these at home, and work up to staying still for the full length of their MRI.
Most MRIs last 30-45 minutes, but they can be as short as 15 minutes and as long as 90.

, Children are usually allowed to bring comfort objects, such as blankets or stuffed animals, as long as they do not contain metal. Help your child select the blanket and/or animal they would like to bring. The room is sometimes cold, and these items help keep them calm and cozy as the MRI works., Some children will be able to listen to music and/or watch a movie during their MRI. Ask your doctor if this is a possibility for your child. If it is, help your child select a calming CD or a favorite movie. You may also want to bring your own headphones from home though they must be approved by the technician."
"
Remove all metal from your child.,
Help your child fast.,
Stay with them during the test.",How to Prepare Your Child for an MRI3," On the day of the MRI, be sure that your child is not wearing anything metal. This could be jewelry, belts, hair clips, electronic devices, or zippers on clothing. Be sure they are dressed in comfy clothes and free from all metal objects., If your doctor will be using a contrast dye in your child’s MRI (via IV) your child may be required to refrain from eating or drinking for several hours prior to the test. The doctor will provide details about this.Make sure your child eats something before the fast period begins.
If they are hungry during the fasting period, you can try to distract them.
You might play eat pretend food with a small child, or engage an older child in conversation.

, In most instances, parents will be asked to step into an adjacent room during the MRI. This room should have windows, allowing you to watch the process. In some cases, parents may be allowed to stay in the MRI room. After the procedure is over, your child should be able to head home. If you child was given a sedative, they will still be sleepy for a few hours. Otherwise, they should be able to resume normal activities right away.Prior to the procedure, you can show your child where you will be.
Even if you must be in an adjacent room, you can explain to your child that you will be nearby and watching the whole time.

Understand that the alcohol itself is often not the culprit.,
Know the common symptoms associated with an allergy to alcohol or anything else that contains alcohol.These symptoms include:


Nasal congestion
Itchy, red, inflamed skin that is warm to the touch (hives)
Headache
Accelerated/rapid heartbeat
Nausea and vomiting
Pain in the abdomen
Runny or stuffy nose.

,
Try drinking one type of alcohol only for a night.,
Determine how much alcohol you can consume without experiencing symptoms.,
Visit a doctor to have tests performed to confirm whether or not you have alcohol allergies or an alcohol intolerance.,
Stick with alcohols you know don't affect you, along with alcohols that contain fewer ingredients.",How to Tell If You Have Allergies to Liquor," While an allergy to alcohol itself is quite rare, it's not unheard of. Far more likely, however, is that one of the grains used to make the alcohol, or a preservative used to keep it fresh, is causing the allergic reaction.Beer, wine, and liquor each contain the allergen histamine, produced as a result of the fermentation process.Histamine, of course, is what sets off allergic reactions in humans.
Beer and wine also contain sulfites, used as a preservative.Sulfites are known to worsen asthma and cause other allergy symptoms.
A protein allergen called “LTP” is found in the skins of grapes, making red wine (fermented with the grape skins, as opposed to white wine) a common allergen.At the same time, red wine tends to have fewer preservatives than white wine, meaning fewer sulfites.;
,, Stick with beer only (preferably the same kind), or wine, and see if symptoms develop. If symptoms don't develop, cross that beer/wine/liquor off the list and gradually try a different beer/wine/liquor. Over time, you should be able to figure out which beers/wines/liquors contain offending allergens, and which don't.

, Sticking with one beer/wine/liquor, try to pinpoint the amount of alcohol that is needed for symptoms to present.


In some cases, those affected by alcohol allergies may only experience very mild symptoms when drinking, or symptoms only when mass quantities or certain types of alcohol are consumed. If this is something you can tolerate, a doctor's test typically isn't necessary. To confirm a diagnosis, however, you should visit a doctor.

,


Your doctor will perform a skin prick test or a blood test to make a conclusive diagnosis. A skin prick test involves pricking the skin with a needle that contains one of the possible causes. If the skin reacts, you have an allergy.
A blood test will look for immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies, which can help measure your immune system response to specific substances. Unfortunately, this test isn't always accurate.
The doctor will also perform other tests, such as obtaining a complete medical history and a physical examination. Diseases such as Hodgkin's lymphoma, being of Asian descent and taking certain antibiotics, anti-fungals or the alcohol abuse drug disulfiram present with a greater chance of alcohol intolerance.

, Once you've made a list of the alcohols that don't make you burst out into hives, stick with those. Also consider these alcohols:


Try out grain-free liquors like potato vodka, rum (fermented from sugar), and tequila (fermented from the agave plant).
Stay away from flavored liquors.
If sulfites in wine cause allergic reactions, stick to red wines. If LTP in red wine bothers you, stick to white wines.
Stay away from liquors that contain carbonation (such as coolers). Liquors that contain carbonation are more likely to cause allergic reactions."

Note that sneezing occurs both when you have allergies and when you have a cold.,
Look at your mucus when you blow your nose.,
Monitor any sinus pain you feel.,
Consider whether you have a sore throat or an itchy throat.,
Pay attention if you are coughing a lot.",How to Tell Whether You've Got Allergies or a Cold1," Sneezing is one of your body's natural defenses to get rid of foreign invaders. The same physical reaction occurs for both allergens and cold viruses, so sneezing is generally not the best way to determine whether you have allergies or colds. However, if you are sneezing and have some of the other symptoms listed in either the cold or allergy sections of this article, you can make a better guess at what you are dealing with.


When foreign invaders (like pollen or a virus) get trapped in the tiny hairs of your nose known as cilia, the invaders can begin to tickle your nose. This tickling sensation can make your brain trigger a sneeze to get rid of the invaders. By sneezing, the allergens or virus are expelled from your nose.
Some of the most common allergens that cause sneezing include: dust, pollen, dander from the fur of animals, and mold.;
, While this might sound gross, it really can help you determine whether you’re dealing with a cold or allergies. When you get infected with a virus, or get bad allergies, your nose will get stuffed up and start running. When this happens, take a look at the color:


If it is clear, it is likely that you are dealing with allergies.
Yellow, green or greyish mucus generally comes along with a cold.

, Sinus pain refers to an aching or sharp pain or pressure that you feel in your nose, eyes, and forehead. Your sinuses are hollow air spaces in your forehead, behind your cheekbones, and between your eyes. The sinuses release mucus that attempts to keep allergens and other foreign bodies out.If your body’s immune system releases histamine, your sinuses may become inflamed, leading to this sinus pain.
Your sinuses can also become painful because of a cold. This is because your the virus causing the cold can infect your sinuses.

, Your tonsils are essentially two masses of tissue that filter and trap germs and other microorganisms (like allergens) as they enter your airways. These tissue masses are found in the back of your throat and can also produce antibodies to fight infections. If a large amount of microorganisms, such as a virus causing a cold, get trapped in your tonsils, your throat can become infected.


If you are dealing with a cold-caused sore throat, your throat will most likely feel raw or tender. You may have a hard time swallowing.
If you have an itchy throat caused by allergies, your throat will most likely feel like you need to scratch it like you would an itch on your skin.

, When you are dealing with a virus or allergens, one of your body’s natural reactions is to develop a cough. This is especially true if the infection or allergen has reached your respiratory system.


A cough caused by a cold might become productive, meaning that you begin coughing up phlegm.
A cough caused by allergies is generally dry, meaning that you don’t cough up phlegm.

Check your body for signs of a rash.,
Monitor any itchiness you feel.,
Take note if you feel short of breath.,
Listen for signs of wheezing with you breathe.",How to Tell Whether You've Got Allergies or a Cold2," A rash that is caused by allergies will generally look like swollen red bumps or circles. When your body releases histamine in response to an allergy, small blood vessels in your skin can expand and can cause the surrounding skin to swell up and become red.


These hives are one of the most visible ways to tell if you have allergies.

, Your top layer of skin (which is referred to in the medical world as your epidermis) contains special nerve fibers called C-fiber that create the sensation of feeling itchy. When your body reacts to an allergen, your skin cells can become inflamed, in turn affecting or damaging this C-fiber. When this damage occurs, you feel itchy.When you get allergies, the most common places you will feel itchy include your eyes, nose, ears, throat, lips, or around your mouth.

, When inflammation reaches the breathing tubes where air passes through, the tubes becomes narrow. This narrowing of your airways can lead to feeling like you can’t catch your breath or breathe in fully. This is called shortness of breath and can be very dangerous if the inflammation becomes too much.


If you are having trouble breathing, take an antihistamine (allergy medication), let someone know what you’re going through and, if necessary, get yourself to a hospital.

, The chemical histamine is released into nearby cells if your body’s immune system detects a harmful foreign body (in this case, allergens). Histamine causes small blood vessels in your body to expand and become inflamed. When this inflammation reaches your throat and airways, your breathing tubes become narrow, making it harder for you to breath. What results is a high-pitched whistling sound each time you breathe."

Know that cold symptoms generally only last for 2 to 14 days at the most.,
Check to see if you have a low grade fever.,
Monitor feelings of mild fatigue and muscle aches.,
Take note if you find that you don’t really have an appetite.,
Check to see if your eyes are watery.",How to Tell Whether You've Got Allergies or a Cold3," Symptoms of a cold become noticeable one or two days after you have been in contact with the virus. If your symptoms last for longer than 14 days, they may be caused by allergies, or you may have a bacterial infection., If your temperature is anywhere between 37.2°C to 37.8°C or 99°F to 100°F, then you have a low grade fever. When your body starts fighting off an infection, such as a cold virus, it releases pyrogens, which make your body’s temperature rise.Many microorganisms, including some cold viruses, cannot live through these increased temperatures.

, Infections can cause you to feel both tired and achy. This is because when your body is fighting off an infection, your muscles can become inflamed. This inflammation can be interpreted in your brain as pain, leading to you feeling tired and uncomfortable., When your body is dealing with an infection, your normal eating habits may change. This is particularly true when you have a fever. If your body temperatures get increased, the enzyme in your taste buds stops working, which in turn makes you feel less hungry., When you have a cold, your tear ducts can become blocked and inflamed because of the infection. That means that your tears can build up in your eye, leading to excessively watery eyes.Your tear gland is also known as your lacrimal gland.

Get a skin prick test done to test for allergies.,
Try eliminating things from your diet to see if you are allergic to a certain food.,
Have your doctor use a throat swab to see if you have a cold.,
Try using a nasal swab to test for a cold.,
Have a blood test done if you suspect that you have severe allergies.",How to Tell Whether You've Got Allergies or a Cold4," This procedure is done to quickly test for allergies. A small portion of a liquid containing an allergen is put on your skin. The doctor will then prick your skin and wait to see if you have any rash that forms around the area.Common allergens that are tested this way include:


Dust, pollen, animal hair, and food products.
The controlled food challenge is another test that is similar to this one but is only used for food allergies. The test is only done in a doctors office and it can be dangerous. You would be given a small amount of food that you might be allergic to and observed for signs of an allergic reaction.

, If you think you may have food allergies, you can talk to a doctor about eliminating certain foods from your diet to see if you are allergic to them. The way the process works is you focus on eliminating one food group each week to see if your allergies clear up. You rotate eliminated foods until you figure out the food that is causing your symptoms.Foods that commonly cause allergies include eggs, nuts, wheat, milk and soy.

, Throat swabs are used to figure out what virus is causing the cold. A doctor will take a sterile cotton swab and gently run it along the inside of your throat. This can be uncomfortable but will help to figure out what kind of treatment you need if you do in fact have a cold rather than allergies.Once the doctor has gotten a large enough sample on the swab, he or she will send it off to a laboratory to be tested.

, Like a throat swab, a nasal swab is when mucus is collected from you by sticking a swab in your nose. Again, this can only be done by a doctor. When the doctor has collected a large enough sample, the swab will be sent off to a lab for testing.


You will generally get your results back 48 hours after your visit to the doctor’s office.

, When you go into the doctor’s office, a nurse will take a sample of your blood. That sample will be sent to a lab for examination. Different types of allergens will be exposed to your blood so that the doctor can figure out what you are allergic to.


This test generally takes a few weeks and is usually reserved for really severe allergies.

Ask your doctor about OIT.,
Talk about how OIT might help your allergies.,
Get a referral for an allergist.,
Sign up for a clinical trial on OIT.,
Go to an OIT clinic.,
See if your allergist will administer OIT.,
Read the clinical trial results on OIT.,
Be aware of the possible side effects of OIT.,
Stay up to date on the latest developments on OIT.",How to Use Oral Immunotherapy," Before you pursue the use of oral immunotherapy on your own, you should consult with your doctor about this treatment. Make an appointment with your doctor and get all the available information about OIT. Your doctor should be able to outline the process and tell you about where oral immunotherapy is at in terms of approval from the FDA and use by the general public.You may ask your doctor several questions about OIT, including, How does OIT work? Is it safe for use by the general public? Would you recommend it as a medical professional?;
, You should also talk to your doctor about how OIT can be a benefit for your particular allergy. OIT has been used in clinical trials to treat egg, peanut, milk, shrimp and other food allergies.Not all allergies can be treated with OIT. Your doctor should be able to tell you if your allergy will qualify for treatment through oral immunotherapy.You should also ask your doctor about the possible side effects of OIT on your body. Allergic reactions during OIT have been common, and have included severe ones, such as anaphylaxis or eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE).You should be fully prepared for the effects of the treatment before you pursue it further.

, If you are serious about trying oral immunotherapy, you should ask your doctor for a referral to an allergy specialist or an allergist. An allergist is trained to help you treat your allergies with short term and long term treatment. They can also tell you about the viability of a treatment like oral immunotherapy for your allergy.You may ask your doctor to refer you to an allergist who has used OIT before on their patients. This will ensure that the allergist is trained in the use of OIT and can recommend an OIT clinic or specialist that you can try.

, Oral immunotherapy is still in clinical trials, with many medical centers running trials with a variety of participants. You may see if your local medical center is running a trial and volunteer to be a subject. If you are chosen, you will be given OIT in controlled doses to see if it successfully treats your allergy.You may also look up clinical trials at reputable medical centers online and then sign up to be a subject by contacting the medical center directly.
The U.S. National Institutes of Health has a searchable database of clinical trials available at https://clinicaltrials.gov/


, There are a few medical clinics in the United States that offer oral immunotherapy as a treatment for those with certain allergies. Keep in mind that because this treatment is not yet approved by the FDA, it is not offered as a treatment option at many medical centers. Make sure the clinic you select is approved by your doctor or your allergist.You may ask your doctor or your allergist to recommend an OIT clinic where you can receive the treatment. You should also make sure you have no other health issues that could lead to complications with the use of oral immunotherapy for your allergy.

, Some allergists may be able to administer OIT to you, depending on their qualifications. Because oral immunotherapy is still in the testing phase, you may be hard pressed to find an allergist to do OIT on you. However, you can still ask your allergist if they are able to do this treatment for you.


For example, you may ask your allergist, What is your professional opinion of oral immunotherapy? Do you think OIT is right for my medical needs? Can you perform OIT on me to address my allergy issue?

, You should do your research and understand how OIT works on real test subjects. Read the clinical trial results on oral immunotherapy online to ensure you know how positive the treatment works on others. Look for clinical trials that focus on your particular allergy and trials that have been done on children, especially if you are considering OIT for your child.Make sure you read the latest clinical trial results to get a well-rounded picture of how OIT is being tested.You may note if the trial results are mostly positive and somewhat conclusive, as this will tell you whether OIT is a viable option for you or a loved one.
You can find clinical trial results for OIT online through scholarly journal websites or medical journal websites. Clinical trials start by determining a person’s threshold for an allergen. They do this by administering a small amount of the allergen to the person, and then building up the amount every 15 to 30 minutes over the course of three to four hours until there is a reaction., You should be well informed about how OIT could affect your body once you undergo the treatment. Ask your doctor about the possible side effects before you begin OIT.

, This treatment is continually evolving and being tested to determine its viability for use on a national and international level. Make sure you read recent, reliable information about where the use of oral immunotherapy stands and to stay up to date on the use of OIT."

Use turmeric to soothe inflamed airways.,
Eat local honey to increase your pollen immunity.,
Consume basil to reduce inflammation.,
Eat onions to reduce your body's production of histamine.,
Cook with ginger to reduce allergic reactions.,
Use garlic to increase your body's resistance to allergens.,
Drink green tea to fight all types of allergies.,
Eat more apples to control the release of histamine.,
Increase your intake of vitamin C, as it helps to break down histamine.,
Eat foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids to reduce sinus inflammation.,
Drink peppermint tea to promote free breathing.",How to Use Natural Antihistamines to Treat Pollen Allergies1," Turmeric contains a substance called curcumin which prevents the release of histamine in the body (which causes allergy symptoms). It also acts as an anti-inflammatory, soothing the inflamed airways of the throat following an allergic reaction.You can increase your turmeric intake by adding a pinch of turmeric to any vegetable, fish or meat dishes you make. It doesn't have a strong flavor, but gives the food a pleasant yellow/orange color.
The recommended daily intake of turmeric is 300mg per day.;
, Bee pollen in raw honey helps to boost your immunity and prevent allergies and infections. By consuming a small amount of pollen each day, you are essentially vaccinating yourself against pollen allergies.It's best to eat local honey, as the pollen it contains will be specific to your local area, making it much more effective as an antihistamine substitute.
Try to eat two tablespoons of raw, local honey daily for best results.

, Basil contains antihistamine properties that help to prevent inflammation caused by allergies. It can also be used to remove bee or insect venom from a sting. To increase your basil intake, you can chop fresh basil leaves and add them to your salads, soups and dressings.
Alternatively, you can make basil tea by chopping fresh basil leaves and adding them to a cup of boiling water. Allow the leaves to steep for 5 minutes, then filter the tea and add honey to taste before drinking.

, Onions contain a chemical compound called quercetin, which helps to check your body's production of histamine and reduce the symptoms of pollen allergies.Try to include more onions in your cooking. Eat raw onions where possible, as they contain a higher quantity of quercetin.
Quercetin also helps to open up your airways, making breathing easier.

, Ginger possesses anti-inflammatory and antihistamine properties, both of which help to prevent allergic reactions.To make a ginger tea, cut an inch of ginger root, mash it or grate it and add it to a cup of water of boiled water. Allow it to steep for 5 minutes before filtering the ginger and drinking the tea.
You can also add grated fresh ginger to curries, stir fries and salads for a burst of Asian-inspired flavor.

, Garlic suppresses certain enzymes that cause inflammation in the body. It is also a natural antibiotic that boosts your immune system and helps you to fight off allergies and infections.


Raw garlic is more effective than cooked garlic, so try to eat two or three small cloves of fresh garlic each day.
If the flavor of fresh garlic is too strong, add chopped or grated garlic to soups, stir fries and salad dressings.

, Green tea contains a compound called catechin which prevents the conversion of histidine to histamine, thereby stopping an allergic reaction before it has the chance to produce symptoms.Aim to drink two to three cups of green tea a day for the greatest antihistamine benefits.
Green tea also helps with other types of allergies (dust, dander, etc) not just pollen allergies.

, Apples contain a flavonoid called quercetin which controls the release of histamine, thereby limiting allergic reactions to pollen.Everyone has heard the phrase ""an apple a day keeps the doctor away"", but an apple a day can also help to prevent pollen allergies.

, Vitamin C reduces the release of histamine, helps to break down released histamines faster and decreases the sensitivity of your airways to histamines.


Foods that contain high levels of histamines include: Papaya, banana, mango, guava, pineapple, broccoli. cauliflower, cabbage and sweet potatoes.
The recommended daily amount of vitamin C for allergies is 1000mg.

, Omega-3 fatty acids contain anti-inflammatory properties that help to reduce sinus inflammation caused by sinus allergies. Omega-3s also improve lung health and boost your immune system, helping your body to fight off pollen allergies.Foods that are naturally high in omega-3 fatty acids include flaxseeds, walnuts, soybeans, cauliflower, sardines, salmon and shrimp.
The recommended intake of omega-3 fatty acids is 1000mg, three times a day.

, Peppermint contains a substance called menthol which helps to decongest a blocked nose and relax the muscles of the respiratory tract, thereby promoting free breathing.Peppermint also contains anti-inflammatory and mild antibacterial properties, helping your body to fight off infection.
To make peppermint tea: Place 1/2 ounce of dried peppermint leaves in a one quart jar. Fill two-thirds of the jar with boiling water, and steep for five minutes. (You can inhale the steam for added benefit). Let cool, strain, sweeten if desired, and drink.

Keep in mind mumps is contagious before symptoms occur.,
Check for swelling of the salivary glands.,
Note any other general symptoms of mumps.,
Check for swollen testicles or breasts.,
Get a diagnosis from your doctor.,
Be aware mumps will usually relieve itself within a week to two weeks.,
Isolate yourself and rest.,
Take over the counter painkillers.,
Apply a warm or cold compress to swollen glands.,
Drink a lot of water.,
Eat food that does not require a lot of chewing.,
Wear an athletic supporter for any groin pain.,
Seek medical treatment immediately for severe symptoms.,
Call your doctor if you have severe abdominal pain and vomiting.,
Monitor children carefully.,
Talk to your doctor if you contract mumps while pregnant.,
Go to the doctor if you experience hearing loss.,
Confirm you have received both doses of the MMR vaccine.,
Be aware of circumstances where you do not need to get the MMR vaccine.,
Practice good hygiene like hand washing and using a tissue.",How to Treat the Mumps," The symptoms of mumps usually develop 14 to 25 days after the person is infected.Someone who is infected with mumps is most contagious about 3 days before the facial swelling becomes evident.


Be aware, in addition, that in about 1 in 3 cases, mumps doesn’t cause any noticeable symptoms in the infected person.;
, The most common symptom of mumps is swollen parotid glands, commonly called “hamster face.” The parotid glands are a pair of glands that are responsible for producing saliva. They are located on either side of your face, just in front of your ears and above your jaw.While both glands are usually affected by the swelling, only one gland can be affected.
Due to the swelling, you may have pain or tenderness around your face, ear(s), or jaw. You may also have dry mouth and a hard time swallowing.

, There are several other symptoms you may experience prior to the parotid gland swelling when you have mumps, including:Headache
Joint pain and aches
Nausea and a general feeling of illness
Ear pain when chewing
Mild abdominal pain
Loss of appetite
A high temperature (fever) of 38°C (100.4°F), or above

, If you are a male over 13, you may develop swollen testicles. If you are a female over 13, you may develop swollen breasts. Women who contract mumps can also develop swollen ovaries.
For both men and women, the swelling can be painful. However, it will rarely lead to sterility, or the inability to have children., Swollen parotid glands and the above symptoms are usually a clear sign you have the mumps. However, other virus (like influenza) can cause parotid swelling, though this is often limited to one side. In rare cases, parotid swelling can come from a bacterial infection or from plugged salivary gland(s). Your doctor can confirm you have the virus by checking for these symptoms. Your doctor may also take a blood or urine sample to run tests and confirm the mumps diagnosis.It's also important to report the mumps to your doctor so he or she can let the Public Health Department in your area or country know. This will prevent the spread of the mumps to others. A recent mumps outbreak among college students in the Midwest has raised the awareness of mumps by US Public Health Department.While mumps is not usually a serious disease, it does have symptoms of other serious diseases like glandular fever and tonsillitis. So its important to speak to your doctor if you suspect you or your child has the mumps., Children usually recover from mumps in about 10-12 days. It takes about 1 week for the swelling to go down in each parotid gland.The average recovery time for adults is 16-18 days.
If your symptoms do not improve after 7 days of home care, or they get worse, talk to your doctor., Call in sick to work and rest for at least five days. This will prevent mumps from spreading to others.Your child cannot go to school or daycare for at least five days after the glands start to swell.
In Canada, cases of the mumps must be reported to the nearest Public Health Department.
In the United States, all physicians are required to report any cases of the mumps to the Public Health Department., Ibuprofen or Tylenol can relieve any discomfort or pain around your face, ear, or jaw.For children, ask your pediatrician what the best and safest pain relief options are. Never give aspirin to children under the age of 18.

, This will help to reduce swelling and soothe any pain., It’s important to stay hydrated when you have mumps by drinking lots of water throughout the day.Avoid acidic drinks like fruit juice, as these can irritate your already swollen glands. Water is the best fluid to relieve the mumps.You should also avoid sour foods like citrus fruits as these can make the swollen glands worse., Opt for soft foods like soup, oatmeal, mashed potatoes, and scrambled eggs., You can also apply ice packs or bags of frozen peas on the area to relieve the pain and swelling.If you are experiencing swollen breasts or abdominal pain, apply a cold compress to the area to help relieve any pain.

, Go to the nearest hospital or call 911 if you develop a stiff neck, have convulsions, experience severe vomiting, experience weakness or paralysis, or become semi-conscious or unconscious. These could be signs of a brain infection like meningitis or encephalitis.Some patients with mumps can develop meningitis, which may require further medical treatment.Encephalitis occurs when your brain is inflamed. Left untreated, it can lead to neurological problems and become life-threatening.

, These could be signs of an inflamed pancreas, or pancreatitis., Bring your child to the nearest doctor if he or she experiences convulsions or if you suspect malnourishment or dehydration. These may be signs of a more serious illness or condition., Mumps during a pregnancy can be dangerous, with an increased risk of miscarriage in the first 12-16 weeks., In rare cases, mumps can cause hearing loss in one or both ears. So if you start to lose hearing in one or both ears, speak to your doctor. They can then refer you to hearing specialist., The MMR vaccine is a combined measles-mumps-rubella inoculation. It contains the safest and most effective form of each vaccine. You are considered immune to mumps if you’ve had the infection before or if you’ve been immunized with the MMR vaccine. But a single dose of the vaccine does not offer enough protection during an outbreak. So its important to ensure you receive two doses of the MMR vaccine.The recommendation of the second dose did not begin until the late 1980s or early 1990s. So many young adults may not have received a second dose of the vaccine. If you are an adult, talk to your doctor about the number of vaccines for mumps you have received and ensure you are given both doses.
Two doses of the MMR vaccine are recommended before a child enters school. The first one should be given between 12 and 15 months old. The second one should be given between 4 and 6 years old.
Though the initial shot for the vaccine may be a bit painful, most people do not experience any serious side effects from the vaccine. In fact, less than one out of 1 million doses causes a serious allergic reaction.Despite fairly prevalent internet rumors due to a discredited study, the MMR vaccine does not cause autism., If your doctor runs a blood test and confirms you are immune to measles, mumps and rubella, you do not need the vaccine. As well, if you have already been given two doses of the vaccine, you normally do not need to be vaccinated again. In the case of a severe outbreak, a physician may recommend that you receive a third dose to “boost” your immunity.The vaccine is not recommended for women who are pregnant or plan to get pregnant within the next four weeks.
It is also not recommended for individuals who have a life-threatening allergy to gelatin or antibiotic neomycin.
Check with your doctor before getting vaccinated if you have cancer, a blood disorder or HIV/AIDS. Talk to your doctor before getting vaccinated if you’re taking steroids or other drugs that affect your immune system., When you sneeze or cough, use a tissue to wipe your nose and cover your mouth. Throw away any used tissues to keep them away from others. You should also wash your hands regularly to prevent the spread of germs, including mumps.To prevent the spread of mumps to others, it’s important to stay home for at least five days after you have been diagnosed with mumps.The mumps virus can be spread via surfaces that have been infected, so do not share utensils or cups with someone who has been infected and be sure to sanitize shared surfaces (countertops, light switches, door knobs, etc) with antiseptic cleaners.

Visit an allergist.,
Ask about being tested for allergies.,
Ask your doctor about immunotherapy.,
Try montelukast.,
Try anti-immunoglobulin E (IgE) therapy.",How to Treat Seasonal Allergies As an Asthmatic1," An allergist can help diagnose what is causing the worst of your asthma symptoms. Seeing an allergist is particularly recommended if you have severe, daily asthma attacks, if you have severe seasonal allergies, or if you need help figuring out what your symptoms are. Also, if you've been in the hospital because of asthma, you'll likely need to see an allergist., If you already suffer from allergies, you know you have them, and you don't need an allergist to tell you that. However, an allergist can confirm the diagnosis and help you narrow down what allergens you are most susceptible to, which can be useful. If you know, you can avoid those allergens when the count is particularly high.Skip taking antihistamines for five days before the test, so that your body will actually react to the allergen. You may need to stop other medications, too, so make sure you give a full list of medications to your allergist before having the test done.The main method of testing for allergies is through a skin prick test. A nurse will divide an area of your skin into small sections, usually on your back or arm. Next, they will add a bit of allergen to each area. As they do, they will prick the skin so that the allergen enters it.
You can also have a blood test done, though it generally does not give as much information as a skin prick test., Immunotherapy exposes you to small doses of the allergens that affect you to decrease your allergic response. You have the choice of two main types of immunotherapy: allergy shots and sublingual tablets.With allergy shots, you receive injections of your allergens on a regular basis. This treatment may take several years to work, but over time, it may decrease the severity and frequency of your symptoms.
Sublingual tablets work in a similar way, but you take a tablet under your tongue. Not all allergies can be treated this way. In addition, you shouldn't use this method if your asthma isn't under control.While these methods are designed to treat allergies, if your allergy and asthma symptoms occur together, allergy shots may also help alleviate your asthma symptoms., This medication, sold brand-name as Singulair and identified as a leukotriene modifier, can help both asthma and allergy symptoms.It's a pill you take once a day that works on the immune system by helping to calm overactive immune responses, which cause both allergies and asthmatic problems.Talk to your doctor to see if this treatment option is a good one for you.
However, this pill isn't for everyone, as some people have psychological side effects. For instance, although rare some people have suicidal thoughts while on this pill. You need to monitor yourself closely for these side effects when you're first on the medication.

, This type of therapy is another treatment option to help treat allergy and asthma symptoms that occur at the same time. IgE antibodies mistakenly identify certain allergens as a threat. When they sense allergens, they send histamines to fight against them, which is what triggers both the allergic and asthmatic reaction. IgE medications, such as the injectable omalizumab, work on the IgE antibodies, helping prevent them from initiating the attack."

See your doctor.,
Identify cross-reactive foods.,
Read product labels.,
Limit exposure to cross-reactive foods in your kitchen.,
Peel skin from cross-reactive foods.,
Cook cross-reactive fruits and vegetables.,
Remove or swallow the cross-reactive substance.,
Navigate restaurant visits.,
Recognize OAS symptoms.,
Take an antihistamine.,
Seek medical treatment.,
Consider allergy shots.,
Carry an epinephrine auto-injector.",How to Treat Oral Allergy Syndrome," If you suspect you may have oral allergy syndrome, it’s important to see your doctor. Medical professionals can help identify your specific oral allergy and make suggestions on what types of raw fruits and vegetables to eliminate. Your doctor may even suggest seeing an allergist or immunologist to pinpoint specific oral allergies.Let your doctor know what foods cause a reaction when you eat them. This may be things such as apples, kiwis, peppers, or almonds.
Make sure the doctor knows what types of symptoms you experience, especially if they are severe. Your doctor may suggest taking anti-histamines or carrying an epinephrine injection to relieve symptoms, depending on severity.;
, OAS symptoms occur because of your mouth reacting to a certain substance in raw foods and vegetables. Certain pollens you may be allergic to also have cross-reactive foods. Knowing what raw fruits and vegetables may inflame OAS can help you avoid them and prevent a reaction. The following is a list of pollens and their cross-reactive fruits and vegetables:Ragweed: bananas, melons, zucchini, cucumber, dandelion, chamomile
Birch: apples, pears, peaches, apricots, cherries, plums, nectarines, prunes, kiwi, carrots, celery, potatoes, peppers, fennel, parsley, coriander, parsnips, hazelnuts, almonds, walnuts
Grass: peaches, celery, melons, tomatoes, oranges
Mugwort: celery, apple, kiwi, peanut, fennel, carrots, parsley, coriander, sunflower, peppers
Alder: celery, pears, apples, almonds, cherries, hazelnuts, peaches, parsley
Latex: bananas, avocado, kiwi, chestnut, papaya

, In some cases, cross-reactive fruits and vegetables that are packaged may also cause OAS symptoms. Reading the labels on packaged foods for cross-reactive substances, such as sunflower or celery, can prevent a bout of OAS., Avoiding cross-reactive foods is the best way to treat your OAS. Getting rid of or limiting exposure to potentially cross-reactive foods can minimize your risk for an allergic reaction.Avoid using raw fruits and vegetables that are cross-reactive. Consider not keeping them in your kitchen to minimize your risk of eating them.
Store cross-reactive foods in a place where you aren’t exposed to them.
Stock alternatives to raw fruits and vegetables that cause OAS symptoms. For example, if you have a grass allergy and like peaches, consider plums or apples instead.

, The protein that causes OAS symptoms is often concentrated in the skin of the fruits or vegetables. Peeling off the skin may help to reduce or prevent OAS symptoms., High temperatures break down the proteins that can cause OAS. Try cooking the cross-reactive fruits and vegetables to reduce or prevent OAS symptoms.Place the cross-reactive food either in the oven or a microwave. Both will break down the proteins that cause OAS. Try eating them after cooking to see if you still have OAS symptoms.

, In most cases, your OAS symptoms will go away once you swallow the cross-reactive fruit or vegetable. You can also remove it from your mouth. Both methods can minimize and relieve your OAS symptoms.Avoid swallowing any cross-reactant if you experience trouble breathing, tightness in your throat, nausea, dizziness, rapid heartbeat, or fainting. These are signs of a serious allergic reaction called anaphylaxis. Remove the cross-reactant and seek immediate medical attention if you experience any of these symptoms.Also avoid swallowing cross-reactant food if you have a history of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), so that you can minimize the exposure of the problematic food to your esophagus., Having OAS can make it difficult to eat out. Many places prepare dishes with raw fruits and vegetables or on surfaces exposed to the allergens. Call ahead and ask questions about the menu and preparation to minimize your risk of an OAS bout.Ask the manager, server, or cook to accommodate your OAS when possible. Explaining your triggers can help.
Make a second, safe choice if you can’t get your first without cross-reactive substances.

, Although most often confined to the facial area, OAS can come with a host of symptoms. Recognizing symptoms may help you more quickly identify and treat a reaction. Symptoms of OAS may include:Itchy mouth
Scratchy throat
Swelling of the ears, lips, tongue, and throat
Itchy ears
Irritation of the gums, eyes, or nose, In some cases, removing or swallowing a food won’t relieve your OAS symptoms. If this happens, take an over-the-counter antihistamine. This can block the reaction caused by the allergen and relieve your symptoms.Over-the-counter antihistamines you can try include:Loratadine (Claritin, Alavert)
Cetirizine (Zyrtec Allergy)
Fexofenadine (Allegra Allergy)
Levocetirizine (Xyzal), a relatively new medication., If your OAS isn’t relieved by home measures or is getting worse, make an appointment with your doctor.An exam can identify specific allergens and cross-reactive fruits and vegetables. Your doctor can also help formulate a plan to relieve your OAS symptoms.


Let your doctor know about any specific symptoms you’re experiencing and ways you have tried to relieve them. You should also tell your doctor if your OAS symptoms are caused by nuts or cooked fruits and vegetables.Ask your doctor if there is any medication or measures that may help you. Make sure to take any medication she suggests or prescribes.Seek emergency treatment if you develop any signs or symptoms of a severe OAS reaction including constriction of airways that makes it difficult to breathe, shock with a severe drop in blood pressure, rapid pulse, dizziness or lightheadedness.

, If you have recurrent or severe OAS, getting allergy shots may help control and prevent symptoms. Consult with your doctor about using allergen immunotherapy, or allergy shots, for your OAS.Recognize that it may take up to a year to see the full benefits of allergy shots. Maintenance may require monthly injections for five to seven years., Some individuals have severe and recurrent OAS symptoms. Others may have gone into anaphylactic shock because of a cross-reactant. If you fall into either category, consider carrying an epinephrine auto-injector to treat potential severe reactions.Discuss getting a prescription for an epinephrine auto-injector with your doctor.Use this medication only as directed by your doctor. The medication also comes with patient instructions that you should read and follow.
Make sure that you and your family know how to properly use the auto-injector. Proper administration of the medication is injecting it only into the muscle or subcutaneous fat of your outer thigh.Injecting into your buttock or a vein can cause serious side effects.
Carry two auto-injectors with you at all times to minimize the risk of a serious OAS reaction.

Consume stinging nettle to reduce the amount of histamine in your body.,
Experiment with quercetin and rutin.,
Take bromelian to reduce swelling in the sinuses.Bromelain is an enzyme found in pineapples and other plants.,
Use eyebright (also known as euphrasia) to treat inflammation and irritation of the eyes.,
Take an elderberry supplement or tea.,
Use butterbur as an effective substitute for antihistamines.,
Try dong quai to treat allergies and respiratory complaints.,
Take goldenseal to reduce the symptoms of pollen allergies.,
Use eucalyptus as a decongestant.",How to Use Natural Antihistamines to Treat Pollen Allergies2," This may surprise anyone who has quite literally run into stinging nettles in a field-- most people tend to get a nasty rash from it, but research shows that it can reduce the amount of histamine in your body. In one study, over half the people who used freeze-dried nettles to treat allergies reported relief. Other studies have also indicated that taking nettles as a supplement or as a tea during allergy season especially, can benefit those with pollen allergies, decreasing the symptoms.Nettles is best taken as a supplement, following manufacturer’s instructions, or as a tea. Start taking nettles or drinking nettles tea (2-3 cups a day) 1-2 weeks before allergy season and continue through the season
Nettles is considered safe except for pregnant women-- it may stimulate uterine contractions

, Quercitin and rutin are chemically related and are found in a wide variety of plants. They are both bioflavonoids and appear to function to protect blood vessels from excessive “leakage”, reducing the swelling associated with allergies. Both also function as anti-inflammatory agents.Both quercitin and rutin appear to be safe, with rare rashes and digestive upset being reported.
Quercitin and rutin are taken as a supplement, following manufacturer’s instructions.
The safety of quercitin and rutin have not been tested in children or pregnant women.
There is some evidence that quercitin and rutin can lower blood pressure-- if you are taking blood pressure medications, speak to your physician before taken either quercitin or rutin.
Quercitin and rutin should not be taken with cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune).
If you are taking blood thinners such as warfarin or aspirin, talk to your physician before using either quercitin or rutin.

, It is used as a digestive enzyme and to treat inflammation.Animal studies also indicate that bromelain may be effective in allergic asthma.The German expert panel, the Commission E, recommends doses of 80-320 mg (200-800 FIP units) 2-3 times daily. Bromelain is taken as a supplement.
Do not take Bromelain if you are allergic to latex. For reasons that are not clear, sensitivity to both is common.
If you are taking amoxicillin or any blood thinning medication, contact your physician before using bromelain.

, As you can probably tell from its name, eyebright has been used primarily for allergic (and other) reactions in the eye. Eyebright has been known to have anti-inflammatory effects comparable to indomethacin.Taken orally, it has also been used to treat allergies.


Eyebright has not been tested for its safety in pregnant women.
Eyebright can be taken as a tea or as a supplement.
It reduces inflammation in the eye caused by blepharitis (inflammation of the eyelash follicles) and conjunctivitis (inflammation or infection of the membrane lining the eyelids). It can be used as an eye wash, as eye drops, or plant infusions may be taken internally for ophthalmic use.Eyebright is also used as an anti-inflammatory for hay fever, sinusitis, upper respiratory tract infections, and catarrh (inflammation of the mucous membranes).

, Elderberry has been traditionally used to treat individuals with pollen allergies.It is high in bioflavonoids, anti-inflammatories, and antioxidants, which may play a role as an anti-allergy remedy.Elderberry as a tea or as a supplement is considered to be safe for children.

, Derived from a common weed in Europe, butterbur (Petasites hybridus) is another alternative to antihistamines. Studies have indicated that it can decrease histamine and other inflammatory substances in individuals with allergies.According to studies, butterbur is just as effective as the drug cetrizine, the active ingredient in the popular anti-histamine tablet Zyrtec.Even though cetirizine is supposed to be a non-sedative antihistamine, researchers reported that it did cause drowsiness, while butterbur did not.
A word of caution though — butterbur is in the same family as ragweed, so it could worsen allergy symptoms in people with ragweed allergies.
Butterbur is not recommended in pregnant women but is well-tolerated and safe in most adults and children.

, Several chemical agents in dong quai may have an antihistamine and anti-serotonin effect. Histamine, serotonin, and other substances are released from the blood cells in response to something that irritates the body -- such as pollen, dust, chemical fumes, or animal dander -- causing the symptoms we associate with allergies. Dong quai's antihistamine effect helps to prevent these allergy symptoms.


Dong quai supplements are available at health food stores, or you can boil dong quai leaves in water to make a tea., Goldenseal is a very popular treatment amongst herbalists. They use it for its wide variety of beneficial properties, including its use as an alternative, anti-catarrhal, anti-inflammatory, antiseptic, astringent, bitter tonic, laxative, anti-diabetic, and muscular stimulant.


In terms of allergies, goldenseal is said to have an astringent effect it on the mucous membranes of the upper respiratory tract, the gastrointestinal tract, the bladder, and rectum (applied topically), and the skin.
When used with a saline nasal spray, goldenseal can also greatly reduce the symptoms of pollen allergies., Eucalyptus is a common ingredient in cough lozenges and syrups. Its effectiveness is due to compound called cineole. Cineole has numerous health benefits — it’s an expectorant, it can ease a cough, it fights congestion, and it can soothe irritated sinus passages. Eucalyptus oil has anti-inflammatory, anti-viral, and anti-bacterial properties. Eucalyptus oil vapor acts as decongestant when it is inhaled and hence can be used in treatment of sinusitis.

Get herbs to use in a steam treatment.,
Add the herb to 1 cup of boiled and steaming water.,
Breathe in the steam.,
Be careful!",How to Use Natural Antihistamines to Treat Pollen Allergies3," Nettles, Eyebright, and Butterbur can be used in steam treatments if you have the dried herb. You will only need 1 teaspoon of the dried herb per treatment session.

, Stir the herb into the water, so that it is fully combined. You do not need the water to be actively boiling, just steaming.

, Cover your head with a towel and inhale the steam using both your nose and mouth. Do this for as long as you want to, but the longer you do it for the more your sinuses should be cleared out.

, Make sure you are careful not to burn yourself on the hot steam! Also, the first time you do this approach, take one breath and then step away from the steam. This is to test whether you have any reaction to the herbs. When you think about it, you are having an allergic reaction to a plant product and there is a chance you might react to this herb!

Try antihistamines.,
Use decongestants.,
Try nasal sprays.",How to Treat Seasonal Allergies As an Asthmatic2," One of the go-to treatments for allergies, including seasonal allergies, is antihistamine medications. When your body releases histamines to attack allergens, it causes allergic reactions, such as a runny nose and itchy eyes. Antihistamines help to combat that reaction.You can get many once-a-day antihistamines over-the-counter, including loratadine, cetirizine, and fexofenadine.These medications are non-drowsy and are safe to take every day.You can also take other antihistamines that may cause drowsiness, such as diphenhydramine., Decongestants help to relieve stuffiness in your nose. While they don't affect the reaction as much, they can help to relieve your symptoms, which can help you breathe easier. These medications come in both pill form and nasal spray form.These medications are available over-the-counter. However, you should not use the nasal sprays for more than three days in a row. Even pill decongestants should not be used for more than five days in a row.

, Another option is a nasal spray called cromolyn nasal solution.This nasal spray affects the mast cells, which releases substances that cause allergic reactions. You can use these sprays continually to treat both seasonal and long-term allergies.This medication is available over-the-counter.

Stay inside as much as possible.,
Delegate outside tasks.,
Watch for high allergen counts.,
Close your windows.,
Remove seasonal allergens from your home.,
Keep your clothes and skin allergy-free.",How to Treat Seasonal Allergies As an Asthmatic3," As an asthmatic with seasonal allergies, you need to try to avoid your allergens as much as possible. While you can't avoid them completely, staying inside when allergen counts are high can help with the problem, particularly on days that are dry and windy.Plan outdoor activities for days when it's just been raining, as allergens won't be as much of a problem.

, If possible, have someone else do the outside tasks that need doing, such as mowing the lawn or landscaping the bushes, particularly when your seasonal allergies are bad. Doing these tasks puts you in direct contact with these allergens, making you vulnerable to asthma attacks.If you must do outdoor tasks, try wearing an allergy mask (available at drug stores) and changing your clothes as soon as you enter the house.

, Most weather stations and websites now track allergen counts, such as pollen, grass, mold, and trees. Knowing when allergens are high can help you know when you need to take extra steps to avoid the outdoors as much as possible., While you might like to let in the fresh spring air into your house, it's best to keep them closed, especially when pollen counts are high. If you're warm, use a ceiling fan or turn on the air conditioner, which has filters to help rid the air of allergens.The same rules apply to your car. Close the windows, and keep the air conditioner on recirculate.

, One way to help your home have fewer allergens is to use a HEPA air filter. The best place to have one is in your bedroom, as it filters allergens out of the air. A dehumidifier can also help, as it can keep allergens down.Also, make sure you are vacuuming regularly, as that helps remove allergens. Just make sure your vacuum has a HEPA allergen filter.

, As noted, it's best to take your outside clothes off when you enter the house, as they can have allergens on them. It's also a good idea to take a shower when you enter, washing allergens off your skin. That way, you'll be relatively allergen-free while you're in the house.It's also a good idea to wear items like a wide-brim hat, sunglasses, and even an allergy mask to keep allergens away from your face as much as possible while you're outside. When you come in, try using eye drops to wash away allergens.
Similarly, try using saline rinses in your nose on a regular basis to help rid your sinuses of allergens."

Update your practitioner on any changes.,
Go to your “clean up” visit.,
Attend your final visit.,
Maintain immune function with regular clean ups.",How to Use NEAT to Treat Allergies," If you’re suffering from allergies or sensitivities, NEAT may be an option for you. NEAT is a naturopathic medicine that has its basis in NAET, or Nambudripad’s Allergy Elimination Technique. Locating NAET/ NEAT practitioners can put you on the path to relieving your food or environmental allergies.Find practitioners of NEAT and NAET in the United States at https://www.naet.com/Patients/locator.aspx. There are also individual search sites available at this site for practitioners in Canada, Central and South America, Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia.;
, Once you’ve found a practitioner in your local area, call the office and schedule an appointment. Let the doctor you would like to undergo NEAT or NAET to relieve your allergies. Consider asking questions about things such as directions, payment, and parking., Make sure to arrive at your appointment on time and fill out any necessary forms before your exam. Let your NEAT practitioner know what specific allergies you have or think you have. This may point the person to specific allergens or symptoms you have.Make sure you let the doctor know any supplements and medications you are taking.
Allow the doctor to exam your skin and body as necessary and if you are comfortable. The NEAT protocol uses elements from both acupuncture and homeopathy with computer technology.
Have your skin conductance measured at acupuncture points with a computerized electrodermal screening system. This uses a blunt probe to touch on specific acupuncture points, which then tell the practitioner about the electrical energy and problems it may cause, including allergies.Take a sample of any suspected allergens to the practitioner.

, After undergoing your NEAT examination, your practitioner will discuss your diagnosis with you. This is based on the “problem” energies found when the practitioner probed your acupuncture points. Your doctor may diagnose you with specific allergies or even sensitivities to food and environmental allergens.Ask any questions you may have about the diagnosis. Let the doctor know about any concerns you may have, including ability to avoid these substances. This can help the doctor formulate the best treatment plan for you.

, Your NEAT practitioner will develop the treatment for your allergies based on the “problem” energies and the best way to contain them. This usually requires testing the responses of the patient to certain allergens and then creating specific natural “medicines” from the findings.Recognize that the NEAT treatment protocol usually takes seven visits over the course of a few weeks.

, Your initial visit to the practitioner is the first step of seven in your treatment. In order to reap the most benefits from your NEAT treatment, you’ll first need to make sure your membranes are not acting as barriers during the second visit. Your practitioner will assess the barrier functions of your members and then desensitizes them before beginning the treatment protocol.Undergo a brief acupressure technique by your practitioner to clear any membrane barriers that exist.Hold a vial of liquid that your practitioner has imprinted with the energies of the allergens. Then your doctor will stimulate specific points with a reflex hammer. Keep grasp of the vial for 15 minutes, which can set your new energy state. Avoid any allergens for 24 hours if you are able.

, For your third through fifth visits with the NEAT practitioner, you’ll update the person on any changes in your allergies or sensitivities to food or environmental allergens. During these visits your practitioner will also make sure any previous substances are now clear for you. The person will also test new panels of substances and perform barrier clearing for each of them.Do any sampling of work or home exposures that your practitioner prescribes.
Contact your practitioner in between visits if you notice any recurrent symptoms or problems.

, The sixth part of your NEAT treatment is the “clean up” visit. Your practitioner will test all of the categories of allergens and sensitivities discovered in your previous five visits. The practitioner will then repeat the treatment procedure for each of these substances to help clear the energy and relieve your allergies., Three to four weeks after your “clean up” visit, your practitioner will see you to review any changes to your immune system. The person will also see if you have any aggravations to barrier functions or your allergies since the “clean up” visit.Ask the doctor any questions you may have about maintaining barrier functions or how best to treat residual symptoms. The practitioner’s suggestions may include a healthy, natural diet or natural hygiene choices., The best way to maintain the benefits of your NEAT treatment is to have regular cleanup visits. These can be anywhere from every three months to every six months or once a year.This can help maintain the enhancements to your immune system and keep barrier functions clear."

Pay attention to GI symptoms.,
Try to link your symptoms with consuming dairy products.,
Distinguish between lactose intolerance and a milk allergy.,
Realize how lactose intolerance is linked to ethnicity.,
Get a hydrogen breath test.,
Take a blood glucose/lactose tolerance test.,
Have a stool acidity test done.",How to Recognize Symptoms of Lactose Intolerance," As with many conditions, trying to understand if your physical experience is unusual or out of the ordinary is sometimes difficult to determine. For example, if a person always has GI issues after meals, then that is their established ""normal"" and they likely assume others feel the same way. But experiencing bloating, flatulence (passing gas), cramps, nausea and loose stool (diarrhea) after meals is not considered normal and always represents signs of digestive problems.A variety of conditions and diseases cause similar GI symptoms and diagnosing can be tricky, but the first step is realizing that your digestive experience is not normal and it needn't be accepted as unavoidable.
Lactase splits lactose into two smaller sugars, glucose and galactose, which are absorbed by the small intestine and used by the body as energy.Not all people with lactase deficiency have digestive or GI symptoms — they produce low levels, but it's enough to handle their dairy (lactose) consumption.;
, The typical signs and symptoms of lactose intolerance (bloating, abdominal pain, passing gas and diarrhea) often begin between 30 minutes to two hours after eating foods or drinking beverages that contain lactose.As such, try to link your GI symptoms to consuming dairy products. Start first thing in the morning by eating a breakfast devoid of any lactose (read labels if you're unsure) and see how you feel. Contrast that to eating lunch with some dairy, such as cheese, yogurt and/or milk. If there is a significant difference in how your GI system feels, then you may very well be lactose intolerant.


If you feel bloated and flatulent after both meals, then you may have a stomach or intestinal issue such as inflammatory bowel disease or Crohn's disease.
If you feel pretty good after both meals, then maybe you have a food allergy to something else in your diet.
This sort of approach is usually called an elimination diet, meaning that you eliminate dairy products from your diet in efforts to narrow down the cause of your GI problems.

, Lactose intolerance is essentially an enzyme deficiency disease, which leads to an undigested sugar (lactose) ending up in the large intestine (colon). Once there, normal intestinal bacteria feast on the sugar and produce hydrogen gas (and some methane) as a byproduct, which explains the bloating and flatulence associated with lactose intolerance.In contrast, a milk allergy is an abnormal response by the immune system to milk products and often occurs within a few minutes of being exposed to the causative protein (casein or whey).Symptoms of a milk allergy can include wheezing, hives (severe rash), swollen lips/mouth/throat, runny nose, watery eyes, vomiting and digestive problems.


Cow milk allergy is one of the most common allergies that affects children.
Cow's milk is the usual cause of an allergic reaction, but milk from sheep, goats and other mammals can also trigger a reaction.
Adults with hay fever or other food allergies are more likely to have a negative reaction to milk products.

, Although the amount of lactase produced in your small intestine becomes less with advancing age, it is also linked to your genetics. In fact, the prevalence of lactase deficiency in certain ethnic groups is quite high. For example, about 90% of Asians and 80% of African-Americans and Native Americans are lactose intolerant.The condition is least common among peoples of northern European ancestry. As such, if you're of Asian or African-American ancestry and commonly experience GI symptoms after meals, there's a very high probability it's caused by lactose intolerance.


Lactose intolerance is unusual in all babies and infants, regardless of ethnicity — it's typically a condition that appears in adulthood.
However, babies born prematurely may have reduced ability to produce lactase because of their underdeveloped intestines.

, The most common test for the diagnosis of lactase deficiency is called a hydrogen breath test.This test is done at your doctor's office or an outpatient clinic, but typically after you've experimented with an elimination diet. The hydrogen breath test involves drinking a sweet liquid containing lots of lactose (25 grams). Your doctor then measures the amount of hydrogen gas in your breath at regular intervals (every 30 minutes). With people who can digest lactose, very little or no hydrogen is detected; however, for lactose intolerant people, the hydrogen reading is much higher because the sugar ferments in their colons via bacteria and produces the gas.


The hydrogen breath test is great way to identify lactose intolerance because it's highly reliable and very convenient.
The test typically requires you to fast the night before and avoid smoking.
Using too much lactose on some people can give false positives, as can bacterial overgrowth in their colons.

, The lactose tolerance test is a blood test used to gauge your body's reaction to consuming high levels of lactose (usually 50 grams).A fasting serum glucose is taken by your doctor as a baseline measurement and then compared to readings taken one to two hours after drinking the lactose beverage. If your blood glucose level doesn't increase by 20 g/dL above the baseline within that time frame, it means your body isn't properly digesting and/or absorbing lactose.


The blood glucose/lactose tolerance test is an older method of diagnosing lactose intolerance and not performed nearly as frequently as the hydrogen breath test, but it can also be helpful.
The blood glucose/lactose tolerance test has a sensitivity of 75% and a specificity of 96%.False-negative results occur with diabetes and bacterial overgrowth in the intestines.

, Undigested lactose creates lactic acid and other fatty acids in your colon, which end up in your feces.A stool acidity test, which is typically used on infants and young children, can detect these acids from a stool sample. The child is given a small amount of lactose and then several consecutive stool samples are taken and tested for higher than normal acidity levels. A young child may also have glucose in their stool as a result of undigested lactose.


For infants and children who can't take other lactose intolerance tests, a stool acidity test is a good alternative.
Even though this test is effective, the breath test is usually preferred due to its ease and convenience.

Try a natural alternative.",How to Treat an Allergic Reaction to Flea and Tick Preventatives," Some animals that receive topical flea and tick preventatives may experience an allergic reaction at the site of application. As the allergic reaction worsens, the symptoms may spread to other parts of the body. If your pet is having an allergic reaction, contact your vet immediately.Signs of a skin allergy include:


hives
hair loss at the application sitecongestion or sneezing
excessive itching and scratching
unusual sensitivity
shock
respiratory ailments;
, Topical preventative products aren't the only potential hazard. Some dogs that receive oral preventative products experience adverse digestive reactions to the product.If your dog has a reaction to an oral product, contact your vet right away. Signs of an allergic reaction to an oral product typically involve digestive problems, including:


vomiting
diarrhea
loss of appetite

, Some cats and dogs experience a condition known as flea allergy dermatitis. This condition is an allergy to the saliva in fleas, and when a pet with this condition gets bitten, it experiences an adverse reaction.Signs of flea allergy dermatitis in dogs include hair loss, thick skin, redness, and hot spots on the rear end, tail, thighs, and abdomen.
Cats can be harder to diagnose. Signs typically include hair loss due to frequent and excessive licking (especially on the back) and tiny red crusts on the back, though these crusts are not always present.
If you think your pet is having an allergic reaction to a flea bite, talk to your vet about how to safely prevent fleas. Your vet may also prescribe antibiotics for skin infections and/or medicated shampoos to treat inflammation.

, If your pet is particularly sensitive to flea and tick preventatives, or if you've accidentally administered too much of a preventative product (including through the combination of multiple products), call your vet immediately. An animal that has been poisoned by or overdosed on flea and tick preventatives will need immediate medical attention.Common signs of poisoning in animals include:


excessive salivation and/or drooling
dilated pupils
tremors
vomiting
shivering
skin irritation
hiding from humans

, If your pet is having a topical allergy to flea and tick preventatives, the first thing you'll need to do is wash any residual preventative product off the animal's body. You can do this in the bathtub or shower, but it should be done as soon as possible to minimize your pet's adverse reaction.Use a mild soap to wash any areas where the product was applied.
Thoroughly rinse the area with copious amounts of water, ensuring that all of the soap (and the preventative product) have been rinsed off.
Gently dry your pet with a clean, dry towel. Be extra cautious when toweling off the area where the product was applied, as it may have caused skin sensitivity in your pet.

, Whether your pet experiences topical or digestive reactions, it's important to get your pet to the veterinarian as soon as possible. Your vet will be able to treat any adverse side effects associated with the allergic reaction and may be able to recommend alternative preventative treatments., Your veterinarian may recommend medication or topical treatments to help soothe your pet's adverse reaction. Follow your vet's advice and be sure to read the instructions any products they prescribe or recommend.

, When using any flea and tick preventative, it's important to follow the written instructions exactly as they're written. You should always read the instructions before administering any product. Even if you've used a product before, the directions or usage guidelines may have changed.Only use one application per pet. Make sure it's for the right animal, as cats and dogs should receive different products.
Use the right size or dose for each application. For example, don't split a large dog application between two small dogs or use two small dog applications for one large dog.
Closely monitor your pet after you've administered any flea and tick preventative to ensure that it does not experience any adverse side effects.
Always talk to your vet before using a preventative product on animals that are old, weak, sick, nursing, or on medication. Ask your vet about how to prevent fleas and ticks on pets that have had allergic reactions in the past.

, Timing can be a factor in how your pet reacts to flea and tick preventatives. Many pets suffering from adverse reactions experience these problems when the treatment is used too soon before or after administering other products or vaccinations.If you must give your pet multiple medicinal products, space out their use by at least 7 days. If going to the vet, make sure your pet does not receive a vaccination on the same day as any preventative products.
An abnormal body temperature can also lead to adverse reactions to preventative products. Never administer flea and tick preventatives immediately after your pet has been bathed, sedated, or anesthetized., Sometimes pets that have an adverse reaction to one type of preventative can handle a different application method. For example, if your pet did not do well with a topical product, try an oral product. If oral products have caused problems for your pet, try switching to a topical product.Always talk to your vet before administering any flea and tick preventative if your pet has experienced problems in the past.
Give oral products with food. This can help reduce the risk of digestive problems.Some experts recommend administering an over-the-counter antacid like Pepcid shortly before administering an oral preventative product.

, Some animals with severe allergies to both oral and topical flea and tick preventatives may need a non-medicated preventative. Even though natural alternatives are not technically medicated, you should still consult a veterinarian before using any product on your pet. You can find vets that specialize in holistic treatments by searching online or checking your local phone book.Some natural alternatives that your vet may recommend to prevent fleas and ticks include:


herbal black walnut
quassia bark
diatomaceous earth
essential oils

Itching
Flushed or pale skin
The feeling that your throat is closing
Swollen tongue or throat
Breathing problems or wheezing
Weak, fast pulse
Vomiting
Diarrhea
Fainting;
, If you carry an epinephrine injector (EpiPen), give yourself the injection. Follow the instructions in the package.Inject the medication into the outside of your thigh. Do not inject it elsewhere because this will increase your chances of having side effects.
Do not use the medication if it has changed color or if you see solid clumps in it.

, Because anaphylaxis can quickly be fatal, go to the emergency room even if you feel better.


Getting checked by a doctor is necessary in case the symptoms start again.
Side effects from the epinephrine injection can include skin reactions, fainting, irregular or racing heartbeat, vomiting, stroke, and breathing problems., Chances are you will have a different set of symptoms, depending on what your allergens are. There are many common allergens:Substances that are in the air such as pollen, pet dander (which is what causes people to be allergic to dogs and/or cats), dust mites, and mold will often cause a stuffy nose, coughing and sneezing.
Bee or wasp stings will cause swelling, pain, itching, and in extreme cases, possibly anaphylactic shock.
Foods such as peanuts, other nuts, wheat, soy, fish, shellfish, eggs, milk may cause digestive problems like nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea or even anaphylactic shock.
Medications like penicillin often cause systemic reactions including an itchy rash, hives, or anaphylactic shock.Latex or other things that touch your skin may cause local irritation including a rash, hives, itching, blisters or peeling.
Allergic-like reactions are even possible to extreme heat, extreme cold, sunlight, or friction on the skin.

, If you are having trouble determining what your allergies are, your doctor can conduct tests to help figure it out.During a skin test or prick test the doctor will put a tiny amount of suspected allergens under your skin and then watch to see if you react with redness and swelling.
A blood test will allow the doctor to evaluate whether your body is reacting with an immune response to particular allergens.

, This should be done under the supervision of a doctor.If you have suspicion of what you might be allergic to, eliminate it from your diet.
If that was the source, your symptoms should improve.
Your doctor may ask you to eat it again, to see if your symptoms return. This would help confirm that it was the source.
Keeping a food diary during this process can help you and your doctor keep track of your symptoms and detect any other possible allergens you might still be exposed to.

, Be sure to talk to your doctor before taking supplements or herbal remedies, especially if you are taking other medications or have any medical conditions to make sure they won’t interact or aggravate your condition. Also, the dosages in herbal remedies are not well regulated, so it is difficult to know how much you are taking. Remember: ""natural"" doesn't automatically mean ""safe.""


Take butterbur tablets. A scientific study suggested that they may reduce inflammation and have effects that are similar to antihistamines. Bromelain may also have anti-inflamatory properties.Inhale steam from water with eucalyptus oil added to it. The oil will give a sharp smell which will clear your sinuses. But don’t ingest it or put it on your skin because it’s poisonous.Relieve congestion with a saline nasal spray. It will help reduce inflammation and dry out a drippy nose., Antihistamines can improve a drippy nose, itchy eyes, watery eyes, hives, and swelling.

, If you aren’t able to tolerate antihistamines, you may have more success with these. They prevent your body from releasing chemicals that cause allergic reactions.


Cromolyn is an over-the-counter nasal spray.
Prescription eye drops include: Cromolyn (Crolom), Lodoxamide (Alomide), Pemirolast (Alamast), Nedocromil (Alocril).

, Many are available over-the-counter. Some also have an antihistamine in them.Cetirizine and pseudoephedrine (Zyrtec-D)
Desloratadine and pseudoephedrine (Clarinex-D)
Fexofenadine and pseudoephedrine (Allegra-D)
Loratadine and pseudoephedrine (Claritin-D)

, But don’t use them for more than three days or they might make your congestion worse.Oxymetazoline (Afrin, Dristan)
Tetrahydrozoline (Tyzine)

, This can reduce stuffiness, sneezing, and dry up a drippy nose.Budesonide (Rhinocort Aqua)
Fluticasone furoate (Veramyst)
Fluticasone propionate (Flonase)
Mometasone (Nasonex)
Triamcinolone (Nasacort Allergy 24 Hour)

, This will improve itchy, red or watery eyes. But you need to be closely monitored by an eye doctor because these medications may increase your chances of cataracts, glaucoma, eye infections, and other problems.Fluorometholone (Flarex, FML)
Loteprednol (Alrex, Lotemax)
Prednisolone (Omnipred, Pred Forte)
Rimexolone (Vexol)

, But don’t use these for an extended period of time because the side effects are serious. They may cause cataracts, osteoporosis, muscle weakness, ulcers, high blood sugar, delayed growth in kids and exacerbate hypertension.Prednisolone (Flo-Pred, Prelone)
Prednisone (Prednisone Intensol, Rayos)

, They counteract leukotrienes, which are substances that your body releases during an allergic reaction. These medications should reduce inflammation.

, This is also called immunotherapy and is offered when medications don’t work and you can’t avoid being exposed to the allergen. The doctor will expose you to the allergen to decrease your reaction to it. Each dose you get will be greater than the last until you have built up enough tolerance.
The allergens are usually administered as shots, but for grass and ragweed, you may get a pill that will dissolve under your tongue.
This must be done under a doctor’s supervision and may take several years., Many substances in the air in our houses can cause allergies. This includes pet dander, dust mites, and pollen that has blown in from the outside.


Vacuum frequently. Using a vacuum with a high-efficiency particulate air filter (HEPA) will reduce the allergens that are in the air.
Reduce the number of carpets you have in your house. Carpets, in contrast to hard floors, hold allergens and pet dander, making it more difficult to keep the house allergen-free.
Wash your bedding regularly. You spend about a third of your day in bed. If you have allergens on your sheets and pillow, you are spending a third of your time breathing in those allergens. Use a plastic cover on your mattress to prevent allergens from settling.
Wash your hair before you go to bed to rinse out any pollen that might be stuck in it.
If you are allergic to particular pollens, stay at home as much as you can at the time of the year when the levels of those types of pollen are high. Keep your windows closed to prevent pollen from blowing into your house.

, This will reduce the amount of spores in the air.


Keep your home dry using fans and dehumidifiers in rooms with high humidity, like the bathroom.
Fix any leaks in your house. This includes small things like drippy facets and larger issues like leaky roofs that might allow water to drip down the walls.
If you have mold, kill it with a solution of bleach and water.

, If you are allergic to foods that are common ingredients like eggs or wheat, you may need to thoroughly read the ingredients lists on packaged foods.


If you have a lot of food allergies, print them on a business card so that you can give them to your server in restaurants. The server can then check with the chef to make sure you won’t be getting any of those foods.
If you need to, bring your own food with you. Then you will always know what you are eating.

, If you are severely allergic to stings, stay far away while this is happening.


You may need to do this again every few years.

Seek a medical diagnosis.,
Disclose your exposure.,
Take medication as directed.,
Look into oxygen therapy.,
Rest after receiving your diagnosis.,
Limit your exposure.,
Stay in areas with good ventilation.,
Wear protective gear.,
Minimize mold exposure.,
Limit exposure to crops and animals.,
Leave unsafe work environments.",How to Treat Farmer's Lung," It’s important to make sure the symptoms you experience are the result of farmer’s lung and not another medical problem before you begin treatment. This is best done by making an appointment with your doctor. Let them know when you go in that you suspect farmer’s lung, and talk about the levels of exposure you experience, as well as your symptoms.Your doctor may request one or more tests including blood tests, lung function tests, CT scans, an inhalation challenge test, or other types of diagnostic testing.
If you are experiencing a severe attack that is impairing your ability to breathe, do not wait for a doctor’s appointment. Seek emergency medical help.;
, Farmer’s lung has a number of symptoms that it shares with other common afflictions such as the flu and asthma. To get proper treatment, let your doctor know if you have been exposed to the types of mold spores that grow in crops, or otherwise work in an inherently moldy or dusty area. Farmer’s lung is most common among those who work with:Agricultural chemicals
Silage or grain storage silos
Farm animals with feathers, hair, or fur
Crop fields
Hay, corn, wheat, or other grains
Fish meal

, Sub-acute and acute attacks of farmer’s lung may be treated using corticosteroids or other prescription medication. Fill the prescription immediately and take as directed by your doctor.Let your doctor know immediately if you have any negative reactions to the medication so that they can provide a different prescription or help you seek alternative treatment.

, Acute attacks may also require oxygen therapy, and those who experienced chronic attacks may also find therapy helpful. Talk to your doctor about a specialist recommendation if you think oxygen therapy would be helpful.Oxygen therapy may be delivered at a hospital or specialist's office to treat an acute attack, or you may be prescribed a portable oxygen tank or machine and mask for long-term care., In some cases, bed rest may be required by your doctor. In all cases, though, you should take time to make sure you can fully recover. Try to avoid returning to work and other physically strenuous activities until your breathing is under control, your fever has passed, and you feel strong enough to do physical labor again., The first thing you need to do if you have been diagnosed with farmer’s lung is to limit your exposure to the moldy or dusty environment. The length of time you will need to stay away depends upon the severity of your condition, but someone who is diagnosed with acute farmer’s lung could be asked to stay away from the exposing environment for a few weeks to a few months., If you must return to work shortly after recovering from a farmer's lung attack, ask for accommodations with proper ventilation. This will help prevent dust accumulation and reduce the risk of a subsequent attack. It is also helpful to avoid moldy or dusty areas in your home during recovery., Help prevent inhaling mold spores by wearing protective gear including face masks or respirators. Depending upon your location, your employer may be required to provide you with protective equipment. Ask them for proper protective gear prior to beginning work for the day., Once you are allowed to return to work after a farmer’s lung episode, do what you can to minimize your exposure to mold in your work environment. When possible, implement preventive techniques to keep mold from proliferating in an agricultural environment. These techniques may include:Drying crops completely prior to storage
Wetting feed or grain before moving to prevent excess release of dust
Using mold inhibitors to prevent crops from molding, In addition to limiting exposure to mold, it can be advisable to limit your exposure to the crops or animals that can carry the mold. If you have the ability, consider mechanizing the harvesting and feeding processes so that you can reduce your direct interactions with the offending environment., Many people are able to return to work after an acute or sub-acute farmer’s lung episode. However, if you experience chronic farmer’s lung, or if your work refuses to provide you with proper safety equipment and risk reduction techniques, it may become necessary to leave such an environment.Chronic farmer’s lung can pose serious problems that could lead to permanent breathing problems, disability, or death. If you suffer from chronic farmer’s lung, talk to your doctor or a medical specialist about if it is safe for you to continue working in your current environment."

Determine what kinds of allergens bother you.,
Purchase a high-quality vacuum cleaner.,
Limit pet dander.,
Pick up messes on the floor.,
Install low-pile carpet.,
Keep your windows closed.,
Run air conditioning in warm, humid weather.,
Purchase a dehumidifier.,
Prevent a cockroach infestation.,
Wash your sheets often.",How to Safeguard Your Home Against Allergens,"


It's worthwhile to try to control all potential allergens within your home, but if you know you're allergic to one specific substance over another, you can then focus your safeguarding efforts on that allergen.;
, Vacuum your home 1 to 2 times per week.


A vacuum cleaner certified as ""asthma friendly"" removes allergens more effectively. The Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America has a list of allergy approved vacuum cleaners on their website.

, Control the amount of dander in the house by regularly washing the animal. Make your bedroom off-limits to the pet. Wash the areas and bedding the pet frequently uses.


If you have a pet, it's very likely that the animal is provoking your allergies. For those severely allergic to pet dander, consider if your symptoms are worth keeping the pet.

, Clean the surfaces of your home with disinfectant.


Dust mites thrive in dirty, cluttered areas. The more bare walls and floors in your home, the fewer dust mites you will have.

, Utilize washable rugs as often as possible.


Dust mites hide in high carpet. The shorter your carpet, the easier it is to clean and remove the allergens. Rugs are beneficial because they can easily be washed.

,


Allergens from the outside work their way indoors through open windows and doors.

,


Dust mites thrive in warm, humid environments.

,


The more moisture that is in the air, the more allergens flourish. Using a dehumidifier will also cut down on mold growth, which is a notorious indoor allergen.

, Consistently taking out trash and making sure food isn't left out.


The presence of cockroaches is well known to precipitate allergic reactions. If you are sharing your home with cockroaches, remove them with non-chemical poison baits that will not upset your allergies.

, Cover your mattress and pillows with allergy relief mattress and pillow protectors.


Wash your linens in 130 degree Fahrenheit (54.4 degrees Celsius) water to kill dust mites.

Avoid alcohol.,
Try honey.,
Drink warm liquids- especially herb teas, with honey.,
Use saline sprays or rinses.,
Consider stinging nettles.,
Boost your flavonoid intake.,
Talk to you doctor about probiotics: Probiotics are strains of “friendly” bacteria which reside in the intestinal tract, such as lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidus bacteria.,
Be aware of other dietary considerations: Certain foods can cross react with pollen sensitivities, which may enhance the effects of pollen exposure and exacerbate allergy symptoms- and you might also experience more itching and discomfort around the mouth (oral allergy syndrome).,
Consider a cleanse.",How to Relieve Allergies Naturally," Unfortunately, alcohol helps to dilate all those surface blood vessels and flood even more histamine release into those already inflamed eyes and mucous membranes.Better to stay of the sauce until you are in the clear.;
, Local honey is best, but honestly any honey will do. This is because honey contains remnants of pollen, which is high in anti-inflammatory flavonoids. By consuming local honey, you may also benefit from oral tolerance which is basically how your body learns to become immunologically non-reactive to the innocuous things that it is exposed to. While individuals have reported allergy relief from consuming honey, scientific reports haven't found a definitive effect on allergy symptoms., These help to loosen congestion and keep you hydrated.

, These work very well to rinse the offending pollen out of your mucus membranes- especially after returning from the great outdoors.Those familiar with the use of neti pots may use these. Saline sprays can be found at most pharmacies.

, Dried extracts of stinging nettles have been used traditionally as a treatment for respiratory allergies/hay fever.They not only contain components which help to block the histamine response, but research shows they also curb inflammation and congestion. Some people find nettles only somewhat helpful in practice unless part of a combination- so it's advised to use it in tandem with herb regimens that pack more punch and they work very well. But you need to find a professional knowledgeable in botanical medicine to guide you in their use.

, Flavonoids are constituents of plants which exhibit a range of bioactive behaviors- including modification of inflammatory responses.There are a few select foods which contain extraordinary quantities of the specific flavonoids shown to have anti-allergic effects. These include: buckwheat, capers, parsley, onions, peppermint, thyme, spinach, broccoli, cabbage, carrots, and peppers. Here's an example of great flavonoid-packed, cleansing ""allergy season"" smoothie.

, Their actions have a critical role in the development and maintenance of immune functions in the body. The natural ecology of the intestines can be upset by events such as intestinal infections and antibiotic use. Research shows that supplementing with probiotics may significantly improve the symptoms of seasonal allergies., You may therefore gain additional relief by cutting out foods such as bananas, peaches, kiwi fruit, melons, sunflower seeds and hazelnuts during the height of allergy season.


It is also wise to avoid foods that have been cooked with vegetable oils at high heat, including deep fried foods, donuts, pastries and cakes. These types of foods promote an increase in inflammatory reactions throughout the body.







, ""Cleanses"" can be simple or fancy, cheap or expensive. At it's foundation, a cleanse means you eat and generally live simply for a period of time, at least a week or so. Give up all added sugars, junk foods, and eat small meals with lots of fresh fruits and vegetables- eliminate or at least limit all animal-derived foods for a little while. You may go for vegetable broths and lots of vegan smoothies. Drink tea and water. Get plenty of sleep, fresh air, and some movement each day.

Eat something.,
Take vitamins.,
Have a spoon of olive oil.,
Drink milk.",How to Prevent a Hangover1," Commonly referred to as ""soakage"", eating something before a night of moderate to heavy drinking definitely helps to lessen the effects of a hangover. In fact, the more you eat, the more time it will take for the alcohol to affect you. This is because food helps to reduce the formation of acetaldehyde in your stomach, and it is this substance that is thought to be the main cause of hangovers.


Fatty, carbohydrate-filled foods, such as pizza and pasta, are best for preventing hangovers, as fat slows your body's absorption of alcohol.However, if you are trying to eat healthily, go for oily fish that contain healthy fatty acids, such as salmon, trout and mackerel.;
, Your body uses up a lot of vitamins and nutrients when metabolizing alcohol, while alcohol itself destroys essential B vitamins. Depleted of these vitamins, your body has a tough time whipping itself back into shape, leading to the dreaded hangover. You can help your poor liver out by taking a vitamin supplement leading up to any major drinking event. For the most effective results, opt for B complex, B6 or B12 vitamins.Vitamin B supplements can be found in most drug stores and supermarkets, or you can increase your intake of B vitamins naturally by eating liver, meat and other animal products, such as milk and cheese., This may sound a little gross, but many Mediterranean cultures swear by this hangover prevention technique. Basically, it's the same principle as eating fatty food before drinking - the fat in the olive oil will limit your body's absorption of alcohol. So if you can stomach it, swallow a tablespoon of olive oil before you head out for the night.Alternatively, you can increase your intake of olive oil less directly by dipping some crusty bread into it, or drizzling it over a salad.

, Milk is often said to help prevent hangovers as it forms a coat on the lining of the stomach, which may help to limit the amount of alcohol that gets absorbed into your bloodstream. While there is little scientific evidence to back up the notion that milk helps to prevent a hangover, there are many people who swear by the method. If nothing else, milk is a healthy source of calcium and B vitamins, so drinking it can't hurt."

Look for the symptoms of a reaction to metal.,
Get your condition diagnosed by a qualified health professional.,
Avoid wearing costume jewelry unless you know its metallic content.,
Avoid body piercing unless you are one hundred percent certain of the content of the metal being used.

,
Check to see if you have workplace exposure to metals that are triggering your allergic reaction.,
Consider other possible triggers for metallic allergies.,
Wear barrier items.",How to Reduce Allergic Reactions  to Metals," These will likely include a skin rash, or some other reaction on your skin where the metal has made contact. Blisters and other damage can also occur. If there are blisters present, it may be a type of eczema, known as pompholyx., Although you might suspect that you are having allergic reactions in response to wearing or touching metallic items, it is important to have your doctor or other health professional confirm your concerns. The doctor can take a skin patch test to test reactions.

, Since a lot of costume jewelry contains nickel, it will likely aggravate your condition. Prefer pure elements rather than amalgams of metals such as gold and silver. Also note that few people have recorded allergic reactions to platinum or titanium.,, If so, find out how the workplace can put practices in place that reduce your exposure.

, Nickel is other products, not just the most obvious. It can be found in washing detergent, canned food, chocolate, tea, wheat, and legumes.For some people, loose change can trigger a reaction. A low-nickel diet is an unrealistic option for avoiding a reaction to nickel, as nickel is in most food but avoiding canned foods and chocolate can help.Look around your home and work and try to avoid directly touching such items as:


Clothing zippers, hooks and metallic buttons etc.
Metallic holders around makeup items
Kitchen utensils
Stationery
Computer components
Keys
Catches on bags, belts etc.
Sewing items
Tools

, Use gloves, a cloth, oven mitt or some other barrier between your skin and the metallic object when handling them. Consider replacing items that can be replaced, such as wooden spoons for metallic ones, a synthetic watch for a metallic amalgam one (or pure gold if you can afford it!), pens with plastic instead of metallic outer shells etc.

"
Stick with one type of alcohol.,
Choose light liquors.,
Alternate alcoholic drinks with water.,
Avoid ""diet"" mixers.,
Be careful with champagne and sparkling wine.,
Know your limits.",How to Prevent a Hangover2," Mixing drinks is your worst enemy when it comes to hangovers. This is because different alcohols contain various additives, flavorings, and other elements which, when combined, can give you the mother of all hangovers as your body struggles to process everything at once. Choose beer or vodka or wine or rum, but whatever you do, don't have them all in one night. Choose your drink and stick to it.


Cocktails are particularly lethal, as they usually contain two or more alcohols mixed together. If you can't resist the bright colors and tiny umbrellas, try to at least limit yourself to a maximum of two Cosmopolitans!

, Dark liquors - like brandy, whisky, bourbon and some tequilas - have a higher concentration of toxins called congeners, which are formed during the process of fermenting and distilling alcohol. These toxins can contribute to the severity of your hangover, so if you're going to drink the hard stuff, stick with light colored liquors like vodka and gin to lessen your intake of toxins., Alcohol is a diuretic, which means that it makes you urinate more, leading to dehydration. Dehydration is one of the major causes of hangover symptoms like thirst, dizziness and headaches. Therefore, the more water you drink to rehydrate before, during and after drinking, the less severe your hangover is likely to be the next morning.Have a big glass of water before you start drinking, then try to drink a glass of water for every alcoholic drink that you have over the course of the night. Your body will thank you for it in the morning.
Drinking water in between alcoholic drinks will also slow the speed of your alcohol consumption, preventing you from drinking too much too quickly.

, Mixers such as diet lemonade or diet cola are not a good idea when you're drinking. This is due to the fact that diet mixers contain no sugar or calories, without which the alcohol shoots directly into the bloodstream. Sticking with the regular version of mixers keeps a few calories in your system, which should work in your favor once morning rolls around.Even though regular mixers are better than diet versions, fruit juice is a better option than either. Juice is uncarbonated - which is good as any carbonated beverage increases the speed of alcohol absorption - while it also contains a certain amount of vitamins, which certainly doesn't hurt.

, Champagne and sparkling wine can literally go straight to your head. Studies have shown that the effects of bubbles in alcohol increases the delivery of alcohol through your system and cause you to become intoxicated faster.


If you're at an event such as a wedding and you can't resist a little bubbly, try drinking just one glass of champagne during the toast and drink a different alcohol for the rest of the evening.

, Know your limits and stick to them. The hard reality is that if you drink too much alcohol, some form of a hangover is inevitable. A hangover is your body's natural way of clearing the toxins in alcohol from your body, so the more you imbibe, the nastier the hangover will be. The number of alcoholic beverages it takes to reach a state of intoxication varies from person to person and knowing your own limits is important. It's usually recommended that you don't have more than three beverages in any one to two hour period, and no more than five beverages in one night.Pay attention to how different types of alcohol affect you. No matter what the studies say, every person's ability to metabolize alcohol differs and you'll know by experience which beer, wine, spirit, or liqueur works for you or plays havoc with your body. Listen to your own body's reactions and take care accordingly.
Keep in mind that regardless of all the preventative measures you can take, the only surefire way to avoid a hangover is not to drink at all. Failing that, you should pay close attention to quantity - the less alcohol consumed, the better your chances of avoiding a hangover. Simple as.

"
"
Rehydrate.,
Eat a good breakfast.,
Sleep.,
Distract yourself.,
Take a couple of painkillers.",How to Prevent a Hangover3," As mentioned above, dehydration is the main cause of hangover symptoms. To head off dehydration in advance, pour yourself a large glass of water as soon as you get home, and drink it all before going to bed. Also remember to bring a glass or bottle of water with you to leave on your night stand and sip whenever you wake up throughout the night. You may need to get up to relieve yourself at 4 a.m. but you'll feel better for it in the morning.


The next morning, regardless of how you feel, drink another big glass of water. Drink it at room temperature if water from the fridge is too hard on your stomach.
You can also rehydrate and replace lost electrolytes by drinking energy drinks or coconut water. Flat ginger ale will help soothe an upset tummy, while orange juice will give you energy.
Avoid caffeine the morning after drinking,as this will only dehydrate you further. If you absolutely need a hit, limit yourself to just one cup of coffee or have something less intense, like an iced tea.

, A moderately healthy, but hearty breakfast after a night's drinking can work wonders. The food will settle your stomach, while also giving you energy. Try some toast topped with a little butter and jam, or better yet, some scrambled eggs. The toast will soak up any excess alcohol left in your stomach, while the eggs contain proteins and B vitamins perfect for replenishing your body's natural resources.


You should also eat fresh fruit to get the benefits of their high vitamin and water content. If you're on the go, try a fruit smoothie - healthy and satisfying!

, When you go to bed drunk, your quality of sleep that night typically isn't very good, leaving you feeling tired and groggy the next morning. After getting up, drinking some water and having some food, allow yourself to go back to bed for a nap, if possible.


It will take your body several hours to metabolize the alcohol, so you might as well sleep through a couple of them and hopefully you'll feel much better when you wake up!

, The pain of a hangover can feel much worse if you just sit around stewing in it. It might be tough, but force yourself to get up, get dressed and go outside for some fresh air. A stroll around the park or a walk along the beach might be just what you need. If that sounds like too much work, try watching a movie, doing some reading or call a friend so you can piece together exactly what happened last night...


Some people even advocate exercise as a great hangover cure, so if you're up for it, try breaking into a run and sweating out the toxins. Not for the faint of heart!

, If your head is hurting, try taking a couple of painkillers such as aspirin or ibuprofen to ease the pain. Always take these pills in the morning, rather than the night before when you still have alcohol in your system. Alcohol is already a blood-thinner, and the painkillers will only thin your blood even further, which can be dangerous.



Never take acetaminophen-based pills when you have alcohol in your system, as mixing these two substances can be very dangerous.Drinking the next day can have the effect of making you feel better, but remember that your body will have to metabolize all of the alcohol in your system at some point, so drinking more is simply prolonging the pain of recovery.

Think about getting a sponsor.",How to Get Through Your First Alcoholics Anonymous Meeting," Alcoholics Anonymous is an international fellowship of men and women who have had a drinking problem. It is self-supporting, non-professional, multiracial, apolitical, and available almost everywhere in North America. There are no age or education requirements to becoming a member of AA. Membership is open to anyone who wants to do something about their drinking problem.The primary purpose of AA is to help alcoholics stay sober and assist others who may turn to AA for help achieving sobriety. AA does not recruit members, nor actively seek to turn everyone sober. Still, AA welcomes new members and encourages sharing and support among members.Some people are required to attend AA by court order. Others choose to attend AA due to their personal struggle with alcoholism. If you are not sure if AA is right for you, you can take a 12 question quiz on the Alcoholics Anonymous website to determine if you are ready for AA.;
, You may be worried about being hugged as soon as you walk into an AA meeting or hounded with questions about your problems. In fact, AA meetings are not like going to the doctor or like going to a prayer circle. They are casual and though you may be encouraged to speak, you are not required to say anything and you can decline to speak if you are uncomfortable.The AA/Support Group Guidelines, which are followed every meeting are:Keep confidentiality: “What you hear stays here”.
Make “I” statements: Avoid using “you” or “we”. For example: “I am Stephan. I am an alcoholic.”
Stay in the “Here and Now”: Share what you are dealing with today or this week.
Share feelings about your experiences, strengths, and hopes.
No fixing or advice giving to other members.
No crosstalk or asking of questions. Listen first.
AA meetings do not cost anything to attend. There is usually a collection passed around at the end of the meetings to cover the cost of renting the meeting space and paying for refreshments. But there is no expectation to contribute.Quite a few AA meetings are held in church halls, but only because they are convenient and affordable venues. AA groups are in no way affiliated with any religious organizations. The AA program can be spiritual, but what exactly this means is left up to individual members to decide., Every AA meeting is 1 hour long. It will have a set format and structure, so after your first meeting, you can expect mostly the same format every time. The only thing that will change is the topic of discussion.One of the traditions of AA is that members are all trusted servants, so no one governs the group. But there will be a Chairperson who has volunteered to lead, or chair, that particular meeting. Usually this will be someone who has a number of years in AA recovery. The basic structure of most AA meetings is:Welcome: Chairperson starts the meeting with a welcome such as, “I am Jenna, an alcoholic. I would like to welcome you to the Monday evening AA meeting. We would like to give a special welcome to new attendees and have you introduce yourselves.” New attendees will then introduce themselves, though this is not required.
Chairperson reads the “AA Preamble”: ""ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS is a fellowship of men and women who share their experience, strength and hope with each other that they may solve their common problem and help others to recover from alcoholism. The only requirement for membership is a desire to stop drinking. There are no dues or fees for A.A. membership; we are self-supporting through our own contributions. A.A. is not allied with any sect, denomination, politics, organization or institution; does not wish to engage in any controversy; neither endorses nor opposes any causes. Our primary purpose is to stay sober and help other alcoholics to achieve sobriety.""
The Chairperson then asks a member to read the “How It Works” section from the AA book.
The “12 Traditions” of AA are read by a member or members.The AA/ Support Group Guidelines may be reviewed if new people are present.
The Chairperson suggests a topic or step for discussion. Each time someone shares, they will begin by first saying their name, for example, Mark: “I am Mark, I am an alcoholic.” The group will then respond with a greeting, such as “Hi Mark.” After someone finished sharing, the group will respond with thanks, for example, “Thanks Mark.” This builds respect.
When it is time for the meeting to close, the Chairperson will ask the attendees for someone to chair the next meeting. She will then ask all attendees to stand and hold hands and say the “Serenity Prayer”: ""God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I can not change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference"".
At the end of the prayer, the group may say ""keep coming back it works if you work it"".
The meeting is now officially over. Attendees may stay and have informal discussions or ask questions of one another before leaving. Coffee or tea may be available after the meeting.

, Each AA group follows the rules and guidelines of the AA program, but they can have their own agenda and mandate. There are several different types of AA meetings:Step meetings: Follow the 12 steps outlined by Alcoholics Anonymous.Each meeting focuses on one of these steps. The step will be read out loud and commented on by members. Not everyone in the group will be on that step, but everyone gets a chance to talk about what the step means to them.
Big Book meetings: These meetings use a reading for the Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous to spark discussion.Several pages may be read aloud by a volunteer and members take turns reading a portion of the Book. There is a round the room discussion of a chosen topic from the Book.
Speaker meetings: These meetings are less participatory, as a single speaker will be talking for most of the meeting. The speaker will recount their experiences with alcohol and AA to instruct and guide other members. Some of these meetings will be open to the general public.
Location specific meetings: A meeting can be formal or casual, based on the setting of the meeting. Church meetings (run by a church, not just a meeting held at a church) may be styled toward whichever religion is sponsored by the group. There are also smoking and non-smoking meetings offered, though with recent bans on smoking indoors, smoking meetings are less common.
Beginner meetings: These are meetings for people who are new to AA and want to learn more about the program. The agenda and structure for these meetings will likely follow the traditional AA structure.Open and closed meetings: Open meetings are for anyone and Closed meetings are for alcoholics only. Many groups don’t adhere to this distinction and it is not uncommon for regular participants in a meeting to be unclear whether their meeting is officially open or closed. Family and friends of an AA members, as well as observers, are welcome at open meetings. Closed meetings are reserved for those who consider themselves alcoholics or who are investigating the possibility for themselves. Newcomers are always welcome to closed meetings.Special purpose meetings: AA clubs often offer alternative to traditional drinking opportunities, such as alcohol-free holiday meetings and parties. These meetings are a safe place for alcoholics to go for the Super Bowl or to celebrate Halloween. Some meetings can focus on an event in a club member’s life, such as a wedding or death of a loved one.

, Look for a list of meetings online on the Alcoholics Anonymous website, located here. You can also search online for the contact number of your local drug and alcohol commission. They often have local meeting lists available in their office. Any local treatment facilities will also provide you with a free local list of meetings.Once you find your first meeting, you will be able to get a list of other meetings there. The meeting list will provide the name of the meetings, the time and place of the meetings, and what kind of meetings are available in your area.
Besides the types of AA meetings, there are also certain group distinctions for each chapter. For example, meetings may be mixed (male and female), men only, or women only. Meeting schedules are indicated by codes (MO for men only, WO for women only) if a meeting is restricted.

, This is one of the best ways to find a meeting that is right for your recovery. If you know someone who attends AA meetings or who is an existing member of AA, talk to her about which type of AA meeting might be the right fit.It also may feel less scary or intimidating to attend an AA meeting based on a recommendation from someone already in AA.

, If you have a friend or acquaintance who is an AA member, ask her if you can attend your first meeting in her group or together in a different group. You can also contact the your local AA Central Office and ask for a volunteer to call someone in AA who would be willing to go to a meeting with you.Going to AA takes courage, so don’t be afraid to reach out to existing AA members for support.

, As part of AA protocol, meetings always start on time, on the dot. Try to get to the meeting 5 minutes early or right on time to ensure you can find a seat and get comfortable.AA meetings always last one hour, and no longer. You should turn off your cell phone and shut off any other distractions for the duration of the meeting. You may be asked to leave if you disrupt the meeting with cross talk (or talking over others), cell phones, or any other inappropriate behavior.Once you sit down, you will usually be welcome or greeted by AA members. They may introduce themselves or offer to shake hands. But you are not obligated to participate in small talk or share your personal story right away., Often, people’s first AA meetings are about listening to others and learning how AA works. Though the Chairperson may ask you to share your thoughts during the discussion, you are in no way obligated to participate or respond. Simply decline to share if you are not ready and listen to others in the group. You’ll soon discover you are in a room with peers who are struggling with the same feelings and issues as you.Try to stay until the end of the meeting. One strategy newcomers might do is “arriving late and leaving early” due to fear or anxiety around attending the meeting. Do this will only lead to an unstructured meeting schedule and a stilted recovery. Counter this by arriving early for the meeting and leaving late. Stick around after the meeting and try to talk to the other members over refreshments.By the end of the meeting, you should feel welcome and accepted in the group. Though you may have only listened for an hour, you should start to see the AA group as a place where you can be honest and open about your struggles.

, If you feel comfortable with the structure of the AA group, attend next week’s meeting, or go to another meeting in another group. Over time, you should start to feel comfortable enough to participate in the discussions and share your inner struggles. As the AA mantra says,""keep coming back it works if you work it"".

, A sponsor is someone who can help you, as a newcomer, stay sober. They do this by sharing their own personal experiences and struggles. However, they are not doctors or professional therapists. An alcoholic who has remained sober for at least 6 months and has a desire to spend time with a newcomer is considered a good sponsor candidate. Generally, sponsors have worked through at least the first 5 steps of AA. They are volunteers who are not compensated financially for their time.The sponsor will often suggest you work through the 12 steps of AA, and encourage you to attend AA meetings and connect with other members.
The sponsor should not impose their personal views on you. They should not demand anything of you or try to control you. They should also never lend you money or help you get a job or an income. Instead, they should help you recognize triggers for your alcoholism and work through your daily struggles with alcohol.
You should get together at least once a week with your sponsor, often before or after an AA meeting and whenever there is a special need.

Figure out if you are at risk.,
Know if you are being affected.,
Avoid contact with rubber latex.,
Use an epi-pen.,
Look for synthetic alternatives in the most common places that rubber latex is found, that includes, (but in no way is limited to): rubber elastic bands, rubber latex gloves, condoms, baby-bottle nipples and pacifiers, and balloons.

,
Read labels on items for home and business, tags on clothes, even labels on feminine hygiene products.

,
Check to make sure all foods and treatments were prepared without latex utensils or equipment.",How to Recognize or Prevent a Latex Allergy," Many people are at risk, and you should know if you are too. People who are at risk are:


Those with spina bifida (myelomeningocele)
Healthcare workers and rubber industry workers
People who have had repeated exposure through multiple surgeries, repeated exposure to: latex tipped urinary catheters, medical equipment with latex, condoms, rubber latex gloves, and other household or pubic use of rubber latex products (this includes breathing in the protein molecules suspended in the air by use of powder on latex gloves, etc.),
People who have food allergies that have protein molecules that simulate the proteins in latex: the most common being banana, fig, tomato, strawberry, tropical fruits, and chestnut/hazelnut;
, Some common reactions are:



Atopic Dermatitis It is characterized by dry, itchy, and/or reddened skin. There can be localized scaling and/or lesions. It is a sensitivity rather than an allergy, and can be made worse by powdered gloves and harsh cleansers.
Allergic Contact Dermatitis. This may not always show up right away, but when it does manifest, it does so with red raised lesions that are itchy and painful and can spread to other areas of the body. The lesions can resemble other contact reactions such as poison ivy and poison oak. They usually get worse with repeated use or contact with latex products.
Immediate allergic reaction. It manifests right away, sometimes starting with irritated eye and hay fever type symptoms, but can rapidly progress to rapid heartbeat, palpitations, difficulty breathing. This is a serious condition and is often referred to as anaphylaxis or anaphylactic shock. Untreated, it can lead to death.

, There are usually synthetic alternatives to latex, so do some research. Medical facilities have latex-free treatment options, so always let them know you are sensitive to latex.

, For the more severe reaction, treatment consists of antihistamines, steroids, and in very severe cases, epinephrine. Those individuals who have this reaction should keep that information on them at all times and carry an epi-pen.

,,, Avoid the problem foods mentioned above.

Look for signs of alcoholism.,
Practice what you'll say.,
Talk to the person.,
Avoid argument, judgement, or nagging.,
Try to understand the person.,
Do not try to force the person to stop drinking.,
Do not drink around the person.,
Talk to others.,
Talk to the person.,
Try to involve a professional.,
Be encouraging throughout the treatment period.,
Be prepared to support a relapse.If the person attended a rehab center and has completed a course of treatment, he may be vulnerable when he leaves.,
Take care of yourself.Being a close friend or family member of an alcoholic is exhausting and can lead to feelings of helplessness and despair.,
Spend time with other friends and family members.",How to Help an Alcoholic Stop Drinking," Someone who has an ""alcohol problem"" may not have crossed the threshold into full alcoholism. An alcohol problem can be addressed and overcome by someone on his own, but alcoholism is a disease that cannot be cured. This requires outside intervention to control. Alcoholics usually show these signs:Problems at work and school, such as showing up late or not showing up at all due to hangovers.
Frequent blackouts after heavy drinking.
Legal problems due to drinking, such as arrests for being drunk in public or drunk driving.
Inability to leave a glass of alcohol half full or to be around alcohol without drinking it.
Planning schedules around drinking and hangovers that follow.
Relationships that have been harmed due to the person's alcohol use.
Craving alcohol first thing in the morning and experiencing withdrawal symptoms when not drinking.;
, Once you've decided to talk to the person about his or her drinking habits, practice exactly what you'll say. Keep it brief, non-judgemental, and detailed. This will keep the other person from zoning off if you talk too long and keep him from feeling as though you're emotionally ganging up on him.


Try to remember a few key sentences that are important to you. For example, you could say, ""I love you and I'm worried that you're hurting your health by binging on the weekends. I'll support you in getting the help you need.""It may also help to have a group of trusted friends to help you talk to your loved one. Be careful that they do not feel ganged up on, however.

, If you've noticed some signs of alcoholism, have a talk with the person and tell him that you're worried.Explain that his behavior is affecting other people and that it's time to stop drinking for his own good and the good of the family. Tell him about the problems that his drinking is causing.Pick a time to talk when the person hasn't been drinking. Speaking in the morning is usually best. It's alright to talk if the person is feeling hungover. Bring up the fact that the person is harming his body by making it sick day in and day out.
Be prepared for denial. Alcoholics typically deny there is much if any problem with his or her alcohol intake. He or she is unlikely to acknowledge the issue, or take it seriously until he or she is ready. While you should keep attempting to bring truth and reality to the person, be prepared for the fact this is unlikely to be the day.

, When you're talking to the person about his drinking habits, don't start by accusing or judging the person. Avoid constantly nagging about the drinking problem, since this could just make it worse. Arguing will make it harder for the person to open up to you about the reasons for drinking.Be warned this will likely trigger a personal attack or personal criticism. Part of an alcoholic's defense against fully recognizing what negative effects his or her behaviors are having is often by making other people the reason he or she drinks. As a result, commonly any comment that there is a problem will be countered that the ""problem"" is the issue (such as work or spouse), not the person.
Try listening honestly and be reasonable. This, of course, is much easier said than done. But it is hard to get angry at someone who is being pleasant, accepting, and honest. You do not have to accept blame or abuse. Healthy boundaries are important in dealing with an alcoholic, as often this is lacking with a person dealing with alcohol issues. Even if there are problems that have contributed to alcohol issues (relationship issues, for instance), 'you did not cause the alcoholism'. Nor is it acceptable to act in an cruel, manipulative, irresponsible, or otherwise abusive way.

You have every right to walk away or otherwise disengage from an alcoholic acting in such a manner.
This is not ""being mean"" or ""abandoning"" the person. If the alcoholic does not have to face that such behavior has a negative effect on his or her life, he or she is likely to keep drinking.



, When you're talking about his drinking, be sure to ask if there are problems or things that stress him, leading him to drink. You should also find out if the person has a good support system. If not, you may want to suggest getting group help.The person may not want to discuss the issue that leads to the drinking or might deny there's even a problem.Understand, however, that alcohol use fundamentally changes a person, often to the point it is hard to know what is due to drinking, and what is the real person inside.
Alcohol can cause irrational behavior, poor decision-making, and muddy thinking. This can still continue even when an alcoholic is not currently swigging a drink. Asking an alcoholic ""why did you do that?"" may not yield useful answers. The ""answer"" may simply be ""because of the alcoholism.""
It is OK if you still do not understand. You may not be able to, and you may not be in the best position to do so. Just loving a person a lot does not mean you can fix them. For example:
A 14 year old may not be able to understand the world the way a 41 year old can.
A person who has not been in combat cannot fully comprehend what it is like to see a comrade die in battle.

, Alcoholism is a complex disease, and one of the difficulties is the paradoxical nature of it; ""forcing or or trying to shame the person into sobriety is unlikely to work.""In fact, it may actually lead the person to drink more.


You need to understand that you cannot stop the person from drinking. But you can suggest and assist the person in finding help.This does not, however, mean you help the person get alcohol, or condone him or her using it.

, Drinking around an alcoholic, like it or not, puts up a ""you drink, why can't I?"" argument for the alcoholic--it does not matter if you can handle drinking because he or she cannot.It may also lead to unhealthy drinking habits within your own life. You can help the other person by meeting and spending time in places that do not serve alcohol. This will make it easier for the person to stop drinking.

, Ask people closest to the person if they've noticed any concerning behaviors or if they think the person has a problem. Avoid telling them the person is an alcoholic and be careful not to tell anyone who doesn't need to know. Don't risk destroying the person's privacy.


If you think the person is an alcoholic, the time has come to get others involved. The problem is too big for you to tackle by yourself, and you must get outside help for the alcoholic as soon as possible., Remind him that you're worried, that you care about him, and want him to get help. Share your thoughts on what you've noticed and ask what you can do to help. Be prepared if the person doesn't want your help or avoids you for a while.


If the person is open to getting help, offer to put him in touch with a professional. Have a list of resources ready to hand to the alcoholic. It should include contact information for local Alcoholics Anonymous groups,the names of therapists and psychologists who specialize in helping alcoholics, and a list of rehabilitation centers., If the alcoholic refuses to go into treatment or even consider it, try to involve a therapist.A therapist will have experience dealing with different types of alcoholics, and will work with you to create a plan for the alcoholic.


A professional therapist will know how to handle defensiveness and other behaviors that may upset or confuse close family members.

, If the alcoholic does agree to go to treatment and take steps toward sobriety, make it clear that you're supportive and that this is the best thing the person could be doing. Curb the person's feelings of guilt or embarrassment by showing that you're proud of him for getting help.

, For most people, treatment is never over and alcoholism is something the person must constantly deal with. The alcoholic's family and friends should continue to support the person, even if he relapses. Relapse happens with almost every alcoholic.


Come up with non-alcoholic activities to do together. Very often, when an alcoholic has made drinking so much a part of his or her life, finding activities that are alcohol-free can feel unnatural. Being a good role model and friend can mean rediscovering that one can have fun, socialize, and relax without a drink.
Encourage the person to attend AA meetings frequently and to get counseling when needed. Let him know that you're there to talk if he needs you.

, Alcoholism is often called a ""family disease,"" since its effects go so far beyond the life of the person with the alcohol problem. Take time to do activities that make you feel good and bolster your confidence and self esteem during this time.


Consider getting therapy. It might be helpful to have someone to talk to about your feelings during this emotionally difficult time.

, You need to take breaks from dealing with the person's drinking problems. While you're focused on the well-being of your alcoholic family member, spending time with other people in your life can help take your mind off of things and restore your energy.


Make sure you're dealing with your own personal issues during this time. Avoid focusing so much on the person with the drinking problem, that you hurt other relationships in your life or develop dependency issues of your own."

Talk with your kids, teens and young adult children.,

Avoid over-consumption of alcohol at parties, pubs and other social drinking occasions.,

Get employees who sell alcohol to double check the age.,

Know the effects of alcohol when pregnant.,

Recognize if you're drinking too much.,

Convince your loved ones to seek advice if they're suffering from a drinking problem, such as addiction to alcohol or rage brought on by drinking.,

Teach and educate in school.",How to Observe Alcohol Awareness Month," Getting the word across to your kids or teenagers about alcohol usage is very important. Many parents don't realize what their kids do after school, at a friend's house, or at a party. Teen peer pressure is one of the top reasons why kids start to drink. It is important to help your kids understand that alcohol is something to be had in moderation and not to be used either as a crutch for problems or as a social lubricant substitute for good conversation skills. There are set legal ages for drinking alcohol in most countries around the world. Help children, teens and young adults to understand that the reason for these laws is to protect them, not to deprive them. It's not an easy sell but if they understand the facts, it can help considerably:

Explain that some people use alcohol to relieve stress, only to find it causes more stress. Help your children and teens to know the difference between a celebratory drink and drinking that is used as a way to overcome unhappiness, worries or lack of confidence. Find more constructive ways to help your children and teens overcome these negative feelings, such as confidence building and exercising to release stress.
Talk about how alcohol can consume a person's daily life, causing an addict to allow everything to revolve around alcohol instead of leading a normal, healthy life. Alcoholism can also lead to arguments and violence.
For teens and older, explain the statistics of deaths and injuries caused by alcohol, on the roads, at parties, and so forth, as relevant to your country. Reality hits hard but it's best they know than pretend that alcohol isn't going to cause them harm.
Help children and teens to understand that it's not just about themselves but about their friends, their family and about other people who might be harmed by another person's alcohol consumption.
Show by good example. The manner in which you use or abuse alcohol will have a big impact on your children's attitude toward it. Are you showing them appropriate values toward alcohol? Teach your teens what the recommended intake of alcohol is for your country (it varies), so that when they're old enough to consume alcohol legally, they're aware of the limits for good health.;
, Stick to your daily limit and then switch to other non-alcoholic choices spiced up with great conversation and fun games like pool, darts or joke-telling. Have fun with mock drinks or sparkling cider. Help others who would like to enjoy parties without having to seem drunk show that it's still possible to enjoy a get-together without imbibing too much alcohol.

If alcohol is on the drink list, have a system of taking away vehicle keys of guests as they step in the door. Never let a drunk, even tipsy, person drive, even if they promise they're okay. If it's necessary, call a taxi or cab and have them pick their car up in the morning.

, Depending upon the law of the country or state, a business or owner may be fined if the purchase of alcohol is sold to a minor. Bouncers, cashiers, and bartenders should double check and verify the actual birth date along with the current photo on the I.D. If there is no I.D. or the I.D. appears suspicious, then no alcohol should be sold., Fetal disorders may include low birth weight, prematurity, birth defects, and even death (miscarriage or stillborn). Never mix alcohol with pregnancy. Having a glass of wine is not a substitute or an excuse for ""needing some"". Even the amount of caffeine taken should be monitored and in moderation but alcohol is definitely best left out of the pregnant woman's daily intake. Speak to your doctor for precise advice on the matter if you're pregnant., Sometimes we fall into drinking more alcohol than we ever intended, due to stressful jobs or home lives, or through peer pressure to ""keep up"". If you find yourself drunk and hungover a lot, and others have been telling you to ease up, then it's time to face reality. Use this month to learn more about the effects of alcohol long-term (as well as the obvious short-term impacts on your life) and to start minimizing your alcohol intake.

If you say that you're drinking too much and think you don't drink more than anyone else but your friends and family are worried about your drinking and you've had mishaps when drunk, you may be in denial. Listen to what others have to say and seek help; realize that this isn't affecting just you but is also affecting others around you.

, Go with a loved one who has an alcohol problem to an AA (Alcoholics Anonymous) group session or any similar treatment program that matches your needs. Anything that is said within a therapy or group session room, stays in that room. With AA, anyone can remain anonymous; as the sharing of names is fully optional. Group sessions make people feel more comfortable because no one is alone in the world, they understand that there is another person dealing with the issue, and they can find ways and suggestions to help one another.

Be supportive but not judgmental or enabling of any loved one who has problems with alcohol. Let them know that you care about them and that you're a ready shoulder to lean on but that you won't tolerate the continuance of the self-harm (and harm to others) through their drinking habit.
Look after yourself if you're living with an alcoholic. You may be worried all the time, which can drain you of energy. If you're a victim of alcohol-caused violence, seek immediate help and safety. While it might be ""the alcohol talking"", be well aware that the alcohol isn't doing any listening either, so protect yourself and your children above all. Partners of heavy drinkers can feel intensely embarrassed and ashamed and may withdraw from public life when help is most needed. If this is your experience, seek help through family, friends, your doctor or local hospital, or AA.

, Teachers and other guidance counselors can educate teenagers in school about alcohol abuse and the effects of it. Because this observance is for a month, create projects, essays, or lesson plans about it. Make brochures and other flyers relating to the daily lesson plan and have the students share what they're learning with peers and family members.

Teach children assertiveness and confidence skills; as skills, these are completely teachable and doable by each student. Having confidence and feeling assertive will remove the temptation to use alcohol as a crutch in difficult or testing social situations. Teach children not to bottle up their feelings; this leads to explosiveness and can lead to turning to the bottle too.
Catch children at risk of or suffering from anxiety, depression, low self-esteem and self-hurting. These children may turn to alcohol to cope. The sooner they get help, the more likely they will be to learn coping skills that don't include anesthetizing themselves with alcohol.

Understand that Anaphylaxis is the allergic response by more than one of the following bodily systems:Cardiovascular / CV - This is the 'shock' known as Anaphylactic Shock and is potentially fatal when untreated.,
Look for symptoms in the following groups.,
Determine if the person affected can make their own decisions regarding treatment.,
Ask them if they have an epinephrine auto-injector and if so do they need to use it immediately.,
Monitor their state of mind and ability speak.,
Administer the epinephrine auto-injector.,
Get the patient to the hospital or seek professional medical attention as soon as possible.",How to Recognize Anaphylaxis," This is also reaction with the fewest outward symptoms.

Respiratory - This usually manifests as difficulty breathing and is also potentially fatal when untreated. People with asthma may try to use only asthma rescue medications not realizing it is anaphylaxis which has lead to fatalities due to shock. It is important to look for multi-system symptoms and once confirmed treat with epinephrine.

Skin - these alone are not considered life threatening, but is an indicator to look for other reactions.

Gastrointestinal - these alone are not considered life threatening, but is an indicator to look for other reactions.

Neurological - These are the most difficult reaction to isolate to anaphylaxis since the symptoms can have many other causes. It is important to realize that true anaphylaxis may cause the victim to be confused or irrational, thus may not know how to seek the best treatment.;
, Shock or breathing symptoms alone, or more than one of the other three groups is considered Anaphylaxis and should be treated with epinephrine:


Shock - weak but rapid pulse, falling blood pressure, pale skin, dizziness, fainting.



 



Breathing - wheezing or throat swelling indicated by the feeling of a lump or tightness in the throat, or difficulty talking.







Skin - itching, hives, flushing, rash, or swelling.







Stomach - Cramps, nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea.







Brain/Cognitive/Emotion - an impending sense of doom and/or anxiety, confusion, or dizziness.







, The anaphylaxis itself may cloud their judgment or prevent them from administering the medication even if they know they want to. Early treatment with epinephrine can reduce the chances of a secondary reaction later. Ask them if they need help and if so look for medic alert information or have them tell you what to do. Enlist someone else to call emergency services if possible.

, If they cannot give you a clear definitive answer they may be going into shock. Ask them if they need help administering the injection. They may not be able to do so without assistance.


If they are clear that they do not want the injection, then now is the time to call emergency services if you are alone.
Advise them they should not be standing or walking. Laying down is recommended.If they have a history of anaphylaxis and expect to need an injection but do not have their own injector, send people to find one by asking all bystanders, going into a place of business and ask for the first aid kit or go to the closest pharmacy.

,


If they cannot talk, their airway is closing and they need the epinephrine injection immediately.
If they need an injection but do not have one available, they should be lying down and remaining as calm as possible.
If they lose consciousness, they need the injection immediately. 

, An auto-injector is a single-use device and, once it is triggered, it cannot be reused.


Remove the injector from its case and follow the instructions on the side of the injector.
The injection should only to be made in the middle of the thigh from the outside of either leg. It can be made through one layer of clothing or to bare skin.
Hold the injector in the middle according to the instructions; do not put your hand over either end.

For a child or someone agitated restrain the leg to be injected.
Do not swing and jab, bounce or poke the tip into the thigh because, if it bounces out, or the victim jerks away, the injection will be unsuccessful.

For EpiPen: Remove the blue safety cap and place the orange tip firmly to the thigh.

For AdrenaClick/generic: Remove cap #1, then cap #2, then place the red tip firmly to the thigh.


Press it into the thigh until you feel the trigger occur or an audible 'click' is heard and hold it for 10 seconds.
Remove the injector and massage the injection site for 10 seconds to speed delivery of the medication.
The injector will have triggered if the orange sheath extends on the EpiPen or the needle is visible on the Adrenaclick. If the device did not trigger you may not have pushed hard enough, or the device is defective.

, The epinephrine only temporarily relieves the symptoms. A secondary reaction is possible so it is critical to get to a hospital, ambulance, or qualified medical personnel as soon as possible.


If professional medical care is not available it is important to have a second auto-injector available in case of a secondary reaction.

Role play.,
Help your child to know the steps that need to be taken when an allergic reaction does occur by practicing an emergency situation.

,
Listen to your child’s preferences when it comes to eating in certain situations.",How to Talk to Children About Their Food Allergies2," Using role-playing to prepare for situations can make the preparation a little more fun for you and your child. Prepare for common situations like ordering out in a restaurant or telling a friend that your child cannot have a certain type of food when it is offered to him.

,, This is especially helpful as the child gets older. Work with your child to create a plan for a school event or a friend’s party by understanding what makes him feel comfortable and uncomfortable in certain situations. By including him in the process, he will be more likely to follow the plan that is laid out.

"
"
Help your child to feel that he is normal and that his food allergy does not make him different.,
Be mindful of how you speak about your child’s allergy.",How to Talk to Children About Their Food Allergies3,"


No child wants to feel weird or different from his friends. Help him realize that his allergy is not a big deal by making sure he will not have to read labels or talk about his allergy in front of his friends. Make a food plan for your child before he goes out with his friends and discuss it with him so that he knows what he will be eating in advance and won’t have to think about it while he is out.
For younger children that are not your own, speak with the parents who will be in charge of your child while he is out. Inform them of his food allergy and be very specific about what he can and cannot eat.
Also make sure your child is well aware of what to do in case of an attack when he is out by himself.

, Food allergies can cause some children a great deal of anxiety. This is why it is important to always remain calm when talking about their allergy and to use a matter-of-fact tone when conveying information about the allergy.

"
"
Be open and honest.,
Give your teenager his own voice.,
Discuss the “What Ifs.” Let your teenager know what to do in certain situations by discussing “what ifs.” Let him know what to do if he forgets his medicine or if one of his friends won’t stop pressuring him to try a new type of food.,
Let your teen know that you believe and trust in them.",How to Talk to Children About Their Food Allergies4," Don’t be afraid to be completely open and honest with your teenager about the concerns and expectations you have for him. Make sure he understands that he can come to you with any questions he may have. Explain that you understand that he is more grown up now, but that his food allergies are still something that he needs to pay careful attention to.

, Listen to him when he tells you his concerns about privacy and about having his independence. Even though you may really want to get your points across, it is important to not dismiss these concerns. Privacy and independence are very important during teenage years and if you ignore these needs, your teenager will be more likely to tune you out.

, What if an allergic reaction happens when he is away from home and around his friends? By discussing these potential situations, it can help you and your teen to better understand these concerns and anxieties about their food allergies. This may also help to build trust between you and your teen by helping you to see that your teen may already know the answers to some of these “what if” questions.

, By displaying your confidence in your teen, it will help him to follow the guidelines he needs to follow when it comes to his food allergies. Letting him know that you are confident in his ability to handle things on his own, lets him know that you are willing to work with him to keep him safe when he is away from the comfort of his own home.

Drink plenty of water.,
Drink an isotonic sports drink.,
Drink fruit juice.,
Drink ginger tea.,
Sip drinks throughout the day.,
Avoid caffeinated drinks.",How to Get Rid of a Hangover1," The dehydration caused by alcohol consumption needs to be tackled if you are to get rid of your hangover. The most straightforward way to re-hydrate yourself is simply by drinking lots of water when you wake up. Drinking bland fluids that are easy on your digestive system will help you replace lost liquid without irritating your stomach.Drinking a pint of water before you go to bed will help to lower your dehydration levels before you wake up. Keep a glass of water next to your bed to drink from in the night.;
, As well as water, an isotonic sports drink can be a very effective way to replace fluids and give you some much-needed energy. These drinks contain carbohydrates that release energy slowly, helping you pick up as the day goes on.Look for drinks that contain electrolytes, which you need to replace when you have become dehydrated.Be wary of sports drinks containing caffeine as these will likely make you more dehydrated.
If you feel severely dehydrated, look for an oral rehydration solution. These are specially formulated to treat dehydration, whereas most sports drinks are not.

, Another good thing to drink is fresh fruit juice. The vitamins and minerals will give you a boost.Fruit juices are generally high in fructose, which is sugar that affects your energy as well as the functioning of your liver.


Fruit juices are also often high in vitamin C, something which is often lost in your urine when you are drinking.Tomato juice, orange juice, and coconut water are all good choices., Drinking ginger tea can help to suppress nausea and vomiting. It is often drunk by pregnant women to help with morning sickness and the same principle applies for a hangover.One option is to boil 10-12 pieces of fresh ginger root in about four cups of water and add the juice of one orange, half a lemon and half cup of honey.


This concoction will provide quick relief from the hangover by stabilizing blood glucose levels.
A calm tea is probably better than a carbonated ginger ale. Fizzy drinks increase the pressure on your stomach, and could cause you to feel nauseated., With all of these drinks, there is no fixed amount that you need to drink, it is more a question of drinking throughout the day. Taking regular sips of water, fruit juice and/or an isotonic sports drink will help you replenish your lost fluids, vitamins and nutrients as the day goes on., Just as you are drinking water and juice to help rehydrate yourself, drinking a lot of caffeinated drinks, such as coffee, can make you more dehydrated rather than less. Caffeine also narrows your blood vessels and raises your blood pressure, which can also exaggerate your hangover symptoms.

Excessive drinking can also impair your judgment, damage your relationships, and leave you feeling tired and sick.If you are considering reducing or eliminating your beer consumption, you may find it helpful to identify some of the reasons you want to stop drinking beer.


If you are concerned that drinking too much beer may be affecting your health, talk to your doctor about it. Your doctor may be able to give you a better idea about what sort of effect the alcohol you consume is having on your body.
Consider whether the amount of beer you are drinking may be affecting your work or your relationships. Are you having arguments with your family, friends, or significant other(s) because of the amount of beer you drink? Are you often too tired to get work done because you had too much beer the night before?;
, Once you have identified some of your reasons for wanting to stop drinking beer, you might find it helpful to write them down. You may wish to ask a supportive friend or family member to sit down with you and help you come up with your list., Depending on how much beer you drink and how dependent you are on beer, you may need to quit gradually rather than just stopping abruptly. Your doctor can assess your overall health and help you come up with a plan that works best for you.Depending on your health and how alcohol-dependent you are, your doctor may recommend quitting beer altogether, quitting for a specific period of time (e.g. 30 days), or simply reducing your beer intake.
Bring up any questions and concerns you may have about how drinking beer is affecting your health.

, Once you have discussed a possible course of action with your doctor, write up the steps you intend to take to stop drinking beer. Post the plan somewhere in your home where you will see it every day, like on the door of your refrigerator or on your bathroom mirror.Make a list of strategies that you will use to keep yourself on track, e.g. avoiding going to the bar with friends after work, getting all the beer out of your house, or filling your regular drinking time with some other activity.
Include a list of possible obstacles to carrying out your plan, and strategies for dealing with these obstacles.
If you have decided to scale back your use of beer gradually, include a timeframe for reducing your beer drinking in your plan. (E.g. cut back to two glasses a day the first week, one glass per day in the second week, and so on).

, Make note of any relapses, but also keep track of your successes. When the period of your plan ends, evaluate how you did and revise your plan if necessary. Then, keeping the things you learned in mind, try again., Tell people that you know will be supportive. This may include family, close friends, or your doctor. They can help keep you accountable and take steps to support your efforts."

Drink water.,
Take a pain reliever.,
Eat plain, starchy foods.,
Go back to sleep.",How to Treat a Hangover1," While something so simple might seem ridiculous while you’re hugging your toilet, re-hydrating yourself is key to overcoming any hangover. Drink 8 to 10 glasses of water slowly over the course of the morning after you have been drinking. Alcohol causes your body to lose water by stimulating your kidneys to excrete more water than you drink, resulting in dehydration. The more alcohol you drink, the more water passes out of your body.Symptoms include dizziness, headache, nausea, dry mouth and fatigue. A hangover is caused by a combination of alcohol metabolism, dehydration, and Vitamin A, B, and C depletion.;
, Your head is throbbing because alcohol widens blood vessels, and the widening of vessels around the brain usually causes pain, much as it does in a migraine headache. While pain relievers do not necessarily make you any healthier, they will take away the pain of your hangover for a short period of time.


Painkillers such as Advil and Ibuprofen work well to kick the pain riddling your brain. Avoid acetaminophens like Tylenol, as they are tough on your liver, which is busy working through the alcohol in your system. Taking acetaminophens while alcohol in your system may cause liver damage., Plain bagels, toast, and crackers are all good carbohydrates or ""Carbs"" to eat when hungover. While they might not be the tastiest of snacks, chances are you probably don’t feel like eating much anyway. Hangovers cause your blood sugar levels to drop--plain carbs will help increase your blood sugar and settle your stomach.

, When you drink excessively and then pass out in bed, your body generally doesn’t get a chance to enter R.E.M. (rapid eye movement) sleep. R.E.M. state is when your body restores itself and when you are most deeply at rest. Crawl back into bed, wrap yourself in the fuzziest blanket you own, put on some soothing music and catch a few more hours of sleep.


You might consider calling in sick to school or work if your hangover is too much to handle. While you shouldn’t make a habit of doing this, taking a ‘sick’ day will allow your body to repair the damages from last night’s wild excesses.

Eat some eggs.,
Have a bowl of cereal.,
Have bouillon soup to restore vitamins and minerals.,
Eat food rich in potassium.,
Eat bland foods like toast and crackers.",How to Get Rid of a Hangover2," Eggs are an excellent thing to eat to combat a hangover. They contain an amino acid called cysteine, which your body will be very happy to receive after a bout of drinking. Cysteine works to break down the toxins that make you feel unwell after drinking. By helping cleanse your body of these leftover toxins, eggs can help you to feel better, rejuvenated, and more energized.Avoid preparing your eggs with too much fat or grease, as this could make you feel nauseated.

, If the thought of eggs makes your stomach turn, try a bowl of fortified breakfast cereal. Whole grain cereal is preferable, as it will have more vitamins and nutrients., A bouillon soup is a thin broth that is based on vegetables. It’s a good source of the vitamins and minerals you need to replenish when you’re hungover. It’s also perfect if you are feeling very fragile and might struggle to keep down solid foods.Bouillon soup can particularly help you to replace salt and potassium., When you are drinking you will find yourself making regular trips to the bathroom, due to the fact that alcohol’s a diuretic. When you are urinating a lot you will lose more potassium than normal. Lower potassium levels contribute to tiredness, nausea and weak limbs, all symptoms of a hangover. To tackle this eat foods that are good sources of potassium.


Two cheap, easy to find examples you might already have in your kitchen are bananas and kiwi fruits.Baked potatoes, leafy greens, mushrooms, and dried apricots are also good sources of potassium.Sports drinks are often good sources of potassium., Eating bland foods may be the best option if your stomach is feeling sensitive. The point of eating to tackle a hangover is not to ""absorb"" the alcohol, but to boost your blood sugar and replenish nutrients.Alcohol prevents your body from maintaining normal blood sugar concentration, and low blood sugar leads to fatigue and weakness, making your body tired..
Complex carbohydrates (oatmeal, whole-grain bread) are good choices.

Go back to bed.,
Take a gentle walk.,
Try not to dwell on it.,
Do a special hangover massage.",How to Get Rid of a Hangover3," Simply put, sleep is the best way to deal with a hangover.The kind of sleep you get after drinking may involve less of the R.E.M. (rapid eye movement) state of sleep which provides proper restoration for your brain, so it’s important to get some more sleep if you can.Sleep deprivation can certainly make the symptoms of a hangover worse.The only real cure for a hangover is time.

, Without exerting yourself too much or risking further dehydration, getting out of the house and taking a walk can help you to feel better when hungover. The rate that alcohol toxins are broken down is increased by your oxygen levels.


A brisk walk will help speed the metabolism and clearance of alcohol in your system.If you are really struggling, don’t push yourself but rest and recover.

, If you are hungover, it can be tempting to wallow in your state of disrepair and refuse to get out of bed or off the couch all day. If you counter this and try to carry on regardless you might find that your symptoms feel diminished. Denial can be a powerful way to try to convince your brain that everything is okay., You can try relieving some of the symptoms of a hangover by massaging special points on your head and hands.

Massaging the point in the center of a pit under the occipital protuberance will help you normalize blood pressure.
Put some strong pressure on the point between the eyebrows above the bridge of the nose.
Gently massage your temples.
Squeeze your earlobes with thumb and index fingers.
Push the point directly under the nose, above the center of the upper lip, with your index finger.
Massage the point in the hole on the chin with vibrating movements.
Massage a point in the center of your palm on both hands.
Massage cushions of your little fingers: first on your left hand, then on your right hand.

Take an over-the-counter painkiller.,
Take an antacid pill for your stomach.,
Take a multivitamin pill.,
Be wary of “miracle cures”.",How to Get Rid of a Hangover4," Your throbbing headache and aching muscles can be tackled with a simple and easily available over the counter painkiller. Check the recommended dosage on the packages, usually two tablets, and take them with a glass of water when you wake up.


You can take aspirin-based painkillers or NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen), but they may irritate your stomach further and cause nausea.If you have a sensitive stomach or are in any doubt about what painkillers to take, contact your doctor.
Do not take acetaminophen! Acetaminophen is processed in your liver, just like alcohol. Tylenol instructions, for instance, specifically say not to mix with alcohol. Doing this can lead to liver failure. (Brands include Tylenol, Paramol, and Anacin).In some countries, acetaminophen is called paracetamol: it is the same medication., A common symptom of a hangover is a very delicate stomach caused by high stomach acidity levels. If you feel nauseous, consider taking an over-the-counter product that can neutralize stomach acid and tackle feelings of indigestion.As with the painkillers, there is a risk that these tablets could irritate your stomach, so be sure the read the package and take as advised.


There are a number of branded antacid pills available to buy.
Common antacid ingredients include aluminum hydroxide, magnesium carbonate or calcium carbonate, and magnesium trisilicate.These ingredients are found in brands such as Tums, Mylanta, and Maalox.

, When you drink alcohol your body will lose a lot of nutrients, including vitamin B12 and folate, that will need to be replenished.If you're feeling really nauseous, you might not be able to keep a multivitamin pill down.


As with the other pills, taking a soluble or effervescent pill will mean that it gets into your system faster.Soluble pills are simply those which you dissolve in a glass of water and drink.
Effervescent tablets will dissolve in water, but have added carbon dioxide so will fizz up. These effervescent pills can cause nausea., There are some so-called ‘hangover pills’ that claim to include elements that tackle all your hangover symptoms at once. Perhaps try one of these, but be aware that scientific studies have concluded that their effectiveness is at best limited.Nothing truly cures a hangover except time and hydration."

Get rid of beer in your home.,
Avoid tempting situations.,
Spend time with supportive people.,
Stay active.,
Refresh yourself with something else.,
Reward yourself for not drinking beer.",How to Stop Drinking Beer2," If you have a fridge full of beer at home, chances are you will be tempted to drink it. Give away or throw out any beer that you still have in the house. Ask anyone else living with you or visiting you to respect your efforts by not bringing any more beer into your home., If you find yourself too tempted to drink in certain places or situations – for example, at parties, sporting events, or bars – then avoid those situations if you can. If you are unable to avoid going somewhere where you know you’ll be tempted, make a plan to help yourself resist the urge to grab a beer.Try asking a supportive friend to go with you as an accountability buddy.
Step outside for a few moments if you find yourself too tempted to drink.
If you have to, make an excuse to leave early.

, Hang out with friends and family who respect your desire to give up beer. If you know someone is going to offer you a beer, give you trouble about your decision not to drink, or tempt you by drinking in front of you, it may be best to avoid that person for awhile., You’ll be less tempted to drink beer if you’re keeping yourself busy doing other things. Use the time that you would otherwise spend drinking by doing something that you enjoy or working towards something you’d like to accomplish. Try picking up a new exercise routine, working on a creative project, or learning a new skill or hobby., If you feel tempted to drink beer, treat yourself to some other kind of refreshing treat or beverage. Try fruit juice, herbal tea, or an electrolyte-rich sports drink. Alcohol-free beer is also an option, if you really crave the taste of beer but want to avoid the alcohol content. However, keep in mind that many “alcohol removed” beers do contain a very small amount of alcohol.

, If you reach a major goal (like 30 days without a drink of beer), treat yourself. Use the money that you saved by not buying beer to buy yourself a nice gift or have a fun (and beer-free) evening out."
"
Talk to your doctor.,
Talk to a counselor.,
Join a support group.,
Get help from friends and family.",How to Stop Drinking Beer3," If you’re having trouble giving up beer on your own, your doctor may be able to help. Set up an appointment with your primary care physician to talk about your concerns. They might be able to refer you to an addiction specialistor even prescribe a medication to help reduce your desire to drink., Mental health specialists, such as psychologists, psychiatrists, or licensed clinical social workers, can provide excellent resources for helping you quit drinking. Your counselor may suggest a support group, offer practical advice and strategies for quitting and staying on track, or simply be there to listen while you talk through any frustrations and anxieties you have surrounding your drinking habits., Support groups can come in the form of group therapy (led by a trained counselor or addiction therapist) or peer-based support groups (like Alcoholics Anonymous and other 12-step programs). Support groups have the advantage of offering the support of peers who are going through the same things that you are.Ask your doctor or therapist to refer you to good support groups in your area.

, If you’re feeling discouraged or tempted to drink, it can help to reach out to someone who cares. Pick up the phone and call someone you trust, or schedule some quality time together to talk about what you’re going through or just hang out."

Eat soothing food.,
Eat apples and bananas.,
Make eggs.,
Eat tomatoes.,
Eat coconut.,
Try some Bouillon broth.,
Use cabbage.",How to Treat a Hangover2," Your stomach will probably be rolling like you’re on the high seas throughout the day, but eating foods that replenish your vitamin stores and settle your stomach will do you nothing but good.

, Apples and bananas contain nutrients that will eliminate your headache and restore minerals lost during your wild night out. In particular, these two fruits are excellent for regaining potassium.

, Scramble them, fry them, soft boil them--whatever way you prefer your eggs, they are certain to help with your hangover. Eggs contain an amino acid called cysteine which helps counter the effects of acetaldehyde, a side effect of excessive alcohol consumption.

, Tomatoes can refresh and revitalize you. Slice them up and add a little salt and pepper, or juice them. Tomatoes contain fructose which helps along the metabolism of alcohol in the body. Add a little lime juice to tomato juice to heighten the results.

, Coconuts are packed with potassium--something your hangover-riddled body definitely needs. Alternatively, drink coconut water if you don’t feel like finding a coconut to split open with a rock., Bouillon broth is a great food to consume when you have a hangover as it provides water and electrolytes, both of which act against dehydration. Bouillon also replaces salt and potassium lost while drinking all of those whiskey sours.

, Cabbage can also act as a wonderful healer of the hangover. Extract juice from a cabbage and mix it with a little tomato juice. Cabbage helps stabilize blood glucose levels.

Drink lots of liquids.,
Drink flat ginger ale.,
Drink pedialyte.,
Drink sports drinks.,
Munch on some ice pops.,
Drink juice.",How to Treat a Hangover3," As mentioned above, re-hydrating yourself is a key player in your battle against the dreaded hangover. Some liquids will help to restore your electrolytes, rehydrate you, and settle your stomach more quickly than others.

, This is a perfect time to clear your fridge of that flat bottle of soda you’ve meaning to throw out. Drink it instead--ginger ale is a great way to soothe your stomach.

, While you may be thinking, ‘isn’t pedialyte for children?’ your body will be feeling better in no time. Pedialyte contains more sodium and less sugar than sports drinks, so it re-hydrates you quickly. It is also rich in vitamins and tastes pretty darn good (which is why parents give it to their kids). Your inner hungover child will thank you., While you may not have just gone on a 10K run or played a game in the NBA, your body probably feels like you did. Sports drinks like Gatorade are meant to rehydrate and replenish lost nutrients., If you can’t bring yourself to drink anything, ice pops are a great way to begin the re-hydration process. They will also keep you from feeling bloated (like some people do when they chug a whole lot of sports drink when they first wake up after a night of drinking.)

, Your body is craving vitamins and juices such as orange, pineapple or mango are a great way of going about restoring your health. Just remember to drink slowly--you don’t want to chug a whole carton of OJ.

Try some herbal remedies.,
Use milk thistle.,
Dive into some honey.,
Try lemon.,
Chew on some ginger to settle your stomach.,
Boil five or six crushed thyme leaves in water.,
Take activated charcoal pills.",How to Treat a Hangover4," While you may feel like a witch stirring her brew, herbal remedies can help replenish lost nutrients.

, Milk thistle is recommended for individuals experiencing liver problems. You are currently one of those people. Some people say they that they feel better after consuming milk thistle. You can purchase milk thistle pills or tea., Honey, bee’s gift to humankind, can help treat hangovers. Honey helps up your fructose levels. Try boiling some water and adding honey to it for a more diluted (and less sweet) way to consume honey.

, Lemon helps detoxify your body. Prepare some lemon tea to settle your stomach and start the detoxification process.

, You can buy ginger candy at the store that works well. Alternatively, you can boil 10 to 12 pieces of fresh ginger root in four cups of water. You will get a ginger tea that you can add nutrient rich things like lemon juice and honey to.

, Simmer the mixture for about five minutes and then strain the tea. When warm, drink this tea. Thyme soothes aching muscles (a side effect of the evil hangover) and also helps to settle your stomach.

, Do not just crush up charcoal you have laying around the house. You can find charcoal pills at your local pharmacy. Activated charcoal is an absorbent, which means it attacks bad molecules and then carries them out of the body.

"
"
Take a vitamin B pill.,
Take a vitamin C pill.,
Take supplements.",How to Treat a Hangover5," Vitamin B, particularly B12 (also called Cobalamin) plays a large part in the functioning of the nervous system and brain. Give your body a boost by taking a vitamin B supplement.You can also eat vitamin B rich food. Some of the most useful foods include whole grain wheat, cold milk and citrus foods like orange.

, Vitamin C is an antioxidant. Alcohol depresses your immune system, leaving you wide open to colds and other viruses. As alcohol metabolizes and our body detoxifies itself, a substantial number of free radicals are released into our body. Vitamin C's antioxidant qualities help fight free radicals in our body and generally alleviates headaches.Emergen-C and other powered and flavored vitamin C formulas are great ways to up your vitamin C levels while also drinking something that basically tastes like it will kick your hangover’s butt.

, Supplements like n-acetylcysteine work to replenish your depleted stores. N-acetylcysteine works against acetaldehyde toxicity, which is a major reason hangovers suck as much as they do."

Understand how alcohol impacts your life.,

Pick a good time.,
Be honest.,
Apologize for your past wrongs.,
Consider writing a letter.,
Outline your plan.,
Expect questions and emotions.,
Explain to children, too, if need be.",How to Tell Your Family About Your Alcohol Addiction," Before you sit down with your family, take some time for self-reflection and explore how alcohol affects your life and your personal relationships. This will help you to understand yourself better, but also help you explain in words how alcohol has taken over your life.For example, you might try writing out a list of all of alcohol’s negative effects on you and your family. What has the addiction cost you and your family already? What might a drinking problem cost you in the future, in terms of finances, career, and relationships?
What areas of your life does alcohol affect? Does it affect your social life? Has it touched your emotional and spiritual wellbeing? Has it hurt your health yet?;
, Try to learn more about alcoholism and addiction as an illness. You can do this on your own, using resources online like the Mayo Clinic or Cleveland Clinic, or by contacting an addiction specialist. They can help you understand your behavior and also options for treatment. You might try opening up with your normal doctor about the problem. She should be able to refer you to an addiction specialist or even to a treatment center.
There are over 3,500 board certified doctors that specialize in addiction in the US. You can also search for a specialist in your area with the American Society of Addiction Medicine website’s search tools. The American Academy of Addiction Psychiatry also has a referral program.

, How will you approach your alcohol problem? Treatment for alcoholism should involve short term and long term goals and can use a variety of approaches. Do you need detox, for example, or to spend time in a residential rehab facility? Will you seek psychological counseling and join a support group in seeking long-term sobriety? These are all questions you’ll need to address.Ask a doctor or addiction specialist to help you form a plan, with short-term and long-term goals. Short-term goals might be to detox and complete a rehab program for several months. Longer-term goals may include learning healthier behavior patterns and getting to the root of your use with a psychologist, or supporting your sobriety in a group like AA.
Think about practicalities in your plan. For instance, how will you get to a treatment facility? How can your family help in the transition? It is also possible that your family will need separate treatment, too, with a support group for families of addicts.
You can also call the US Department of Health and Human Services’ National Drug and Alcohol hotline at 1-800-662-HELP (4357) for advice on how to move forward with your treatment.

, You may feel like admitting your alcohol problem is a very hard thing to do. You may be afraid of how your loved ones will react or that they will judge you. But reaching out is still worthwhile as a step toward recovery. Chances are that your family already knows something is wrong, too, whether from a gut feeling or from your behavior.Ask your family for a sit-down talk. Addiction is not something to casually mention but a discussion you should give plenty of time. Pick a moment when your family members are free from distractions, like after dinner or in the evening after work.
For example, you might say, “Hey guys, I have something serious I want to talk to you about. Could you sit down with me and listen for a while?”
Try to have the conversation at home in or a private place. Telling your family about your addiction may be emotional and you’ll need privacy to open up.

, You’ve admitted the problem to yourself and chosen to seek help. Those are the key first steps toward recovery. But you won’t help anyone if you sugar-coat the problem or aren’t completely honest with your family about the alcoholism and its severity. Be honest so that your family can help you as best they can.Tell your family members that you’re an alcoholic, i.e. “Mom, I have a serious problem with drinking” or “Dad, I think I’m an alcoholic.”
Your family also deserves to know the extent of the problem, i.e. “I’ve been struggling with this for the last three years” or “My drinking started to spiral out of control last summer and lately I’ve been drinking a six pack a day or more.”
Be honest about the situation at present, too. If you are still drinking, tell your family. People think they can hide addiction better than they actually can, and your family probably already knows that something is very wrong. Don’t insult their intelligence.

, Alcoholism affects the addict as well as the people around the addict. Your attitudes, behavior, and actions may have caused your family a good deal of distress and anger, whether emotional, physical, or spiritual. Acknowledge this and apologize. Acknowledging errors can begin the process of healing relationships.Say something like, “I know that I’ve done very hurtful things to all of you and I’m sorry” or “Please forgive me for the choices I’ve made and the things I’ve done to you.”
Tell your family that you care about them and don’t want or mean to injure them. At the same time, though, ask for understanding: i.e. “I just want you to know that this behavior isn’t who I really am – it’s the addiction and the alcoholism.”

, If you are struggling to express your feelings and to talk about your alcoholism, try writing an open letter to your family. This is not a replacement for having a sit-down talk. Think of it instead as an aid. You can write out what you want to say beforehand and then read it aloud, or have your family members read it in your presence.


The letter can be as short or as long as you need it to be. But be sure to include an acknowledgement of your problem, the fact that you want your family’s help, and, if need be, an apology.
Bring the letter to the talk with your family. Say something like, “I wrote something down that I’d like to read to you.” Or “Mom, I wrote what I want to say down in a letter. Could you read it, please?”

, The point of talking with your family is to acknowledge your alcoholism but also to show willingness to get better. You’ll need to show your family that you’re ready to get help now – today – and that you want to start a treatment program. Here’s your chance to talk about a plan and how they can help.Ideally, you have already put some thought into how to get help. Let them know what your vision is, whether it’s rehab, detox, Alcoholics Anonymous, or some combination of treatments.
Having a “blueprint” will help you stay on topic, i.e. getting help, and not get sidetracked by emotions or anger. You may not have all the answers for how, when, or where you’ll start treatment, but you’ll convey that you’re serious about getting help.

, Your family will probably have questions for you. They might also have conflicted emotions, including anger, hurt, confusion, or resentment. Try to be patient and avoid becoming defensive or angry. Above all, remember that your family loves you and wants to see you get better.Try to answer your family’s questions as best you can. Be ready to talk about what you think fuels the addiction – what behavior, attitudes, actions, and circumstances contribute to it. This information can help your family members avoid “enabling” the addiction or unwittingly supporting it.
Tell them how they can help you in concrete terms: is it finding a treatment program? Taking you to an inpatient rehab facility? Supporting your morally and emotionally?
If any family members get angry, make it clear that you aren’t asking them to support your alcoholism. Just to support you in recovery.

, Talking about your addiction to small children or your own kids could be very hard. But even small are affected by addiction and can sense that something is wrong. Whether or not you decide to explain your alcoholism and treatment to children, the most important thing is for them to have stability and routine in their daily lives.Infants and small toddlers will not understand a conversation about addiction. But you should try your best to make sure they have love, emotional support, and stability. If you can’t offer that right now, consider enlisting a sibling, parent, grandparent, or good friend to help with care while you get treatment.
Children over 3 should usually understand the idea of illness. You can explain your treatment in terms of being sick – that you have an illness and have to go away for a while to see a doctor. This may ease a child’s feelings of self-guilt and let them know that you will return.
By grade and middle school, most kids have an idea about drugs and substance abuse and will be able to understand a conversation about alcoholism. Explain it again in terms of an illness that needs proper medical treatment.
While using age-appropriate terms, be honest and focus on the idea of addiction as an illness. That way, kids won’t worry that they somehow “caused” your alcoholism.

Help your partner ease into the conversation and talk about the “process” first and what you’re hoping to walk away with at the end of the discussion. Once you’ve done that, bring up the specific issues surrounding your addiction. End the discussion by asking for help from your partner and how he or she can best support you.Having a format in mind can help keep the conversation on track, minimize distractions, and stay goal-oriented.
It’s up to you what you want to share or keep from your partner. If something brings you great shame or embarrassment, think about whether now is the time to discuss it or not. However, if there are big things involved, such as pregnancy or medical problems, it may be best to include them in this discussion.;
, Before the discussion, you may want to think about how you’d like your partner to contribute to your recovery. Some people may want to take charge of your recovery for you, while others may completely distance themselves from you and your addiction. Know what kinds of things you want help with beforehand. For instance, say that you don’t want to hear your partner bribe, threaten, or preach to you. Above all, recognize that you are the only person who can make changes to your addiction. Support is appreciated, but having a dictator as a partner may not be appreciated.If you’re going to make changes, make them together. For instance, if you plan to dump out alcohol bottles, do it together. Tell your partner it’s not okay for him or her to make changes without letting you know first.

, Know that your partner may react strongly to finding out you have an addiction. He or she may be shocked, angry, or sad. They may even be embarrassed or ashamed. Remember that you are sharing something that may come as a surprise, so the initial reaction may be in response to the news, and not a response to you personally.Allow your partner to react as he or she sees fit. Don’t immediately jump to the conclusion that this reaction is personal or offensive.


Allow your partner time to process the discussion. He or she may need some time or space. Once your partner has worked through the emotions, he or she may be better able to support you.

, Pick a time and a place to discuss your addiction. Choose a time when both of you are available and allow for enough time to have a thorough discussion. Don’t choose a day when both of you are really busy or have things to rush off to afterward.Choose a location that makes you feel comfortable and that does not include many distractions.

, Once you’ve set aside time to have the discussion, you’re ready to begin. Starting this kind of discussion can be the most difficult part. For this reason, you may want to practice what to say beforehand or know what you want to say to open the conversation. Talk about why it’s important to have this conversation and what you’re hoping to get from it.For example, say, “There’s something I want to share with you, and it’s not easy for me to talk about it. I’d like you to listen to me and understand me as I tell you about what’s hurting me right now.”
Another option you can say is, “I’m struggling and I’ve realized I need to get help. It’s not easy for me to admit these things or talk about them, so please listen to me. I’d like to have your support.”

, Express to your partner how your addiction is affecting you. You may even have mixed emotions about having an addiction yet not feeling ready to stop.Talk about what emotions the addiction makes you feel, and how you cope with them. Talk about how you feel when you think about quitting or seeking treatment.


Say, “I’m scared it’s got to this point and that I don’t feel like I can do this on my own.”
You can also say, “I feel so lost and confused. I never thought I could be addicted to alcohol. When I think about treatment, I want it, yet I’m scared of what will happen if I stop drinking.”

, Talk to your partner about why you are concerned about your alcohol addiction. Say what is hurting you and the impact it has on your life. Addictions can affect many aspects of your life, including your social life, emotional well-being, and physical health.You can include some examples that you can comfortably share with your partner.For example, say, “Since I’ve started drinking regularly, it’s getting harder and harder to go to work, and my manager has become suspicious that something is up.”
Say, “Alcohol is affecting my ability to finish school, and I’m nervous I might flunk out. I want to finish my education and succeed in my life.”

, Addictions can cause distance between partners and lead to unhappiness in the relationship. Alcohol addiction can lead to fights and disagreements in relationships, and sometimes can lead to violence.Take responsibility for how your addiction has affected the relationship. You may also choose to apologize for how your addiction has negatively impacted your partner and the relationship.


For example, your addiction may have led to embarrassment from your partner, financial problems, or shirking responsibilities at home or with children.

, If you also struggle with mental health issues, you can share these with your partner and how they affect you and your addiction. You may never have mentioned mental health problems before, so it can be scary to bring them up. Yet, it’s important for your partner to understand what you are going through. Your mental health may influence your addiction, and vice versa.Ask your partner to support you in your struggles with mental health. This may mean helping you find a therapist, going to a treatment center, or getting medications and taking them regularly.
If you suspect you may have mental health problems yet have never received a diagnosis, ask for help in seeing a therapist or psychologist to receive an official diagnosis and treatment.

, Discuss together what kind of treatment to pursue. Does it make sense to go to residential treatment? Should you find a local therapist? Should a medical doctor be involved? Have you considered self-help groups or group therapy? Think about what options to pursue, and ask your significant other to help you with these choices.


Say, “I’m wanting professional help for recovery. Can you help me find treatment?”
You can ask your partner to accompany you to appointments or participate in treatment with you. Think about what would be most supportive for you, and make a request.

, Ask your partner to encourage you to seek treatment. Tell your partner that you want support in facing recovery, not judgment or shame. Tell your partner how you would like to be encouraged.Gently remind your partner that nagging does not help you.


For example, you may want encouragement to do healthy activities such as visiting friends or doing activities that don’t involve alcohol.

, You may want your partner to specifically help you in certain ways. For example, you may want help in going to social events or engaging with certain people, or getting to and from therapy sessions. If you’d like your partner to participate in specific ways, let him or her know. Communicate your wants and needs clearly.When asking for help, make the request recovery specific. Say how the request will benefit you (and the relationship) as you work on recovery.

, While it can be hard to be in a romantic relationship with an addict, ask your partner for patience. While you are making steps forward, remind him or her that changes cannot happen overnight. If you relapse, ask your partner to be patient and kind, not angry and judgmental.Remind yourself that this is not easy for your partner. It’s important for both of you to be kind and compassionate during this time.

, Recovery is a process that can take a long time. It may be a bumpy road with ups and downs and lots of in between victories and upsets.Let your partner know that while it may be difficult, you are committed to recovery and to the relationship.


Say, “Are you willing to go through this process with me? I’d like your support.”

Avoid friends who drink too much.",How to Tell Your Friends About Your Alcohol Addiction," Recovery is much easier if you have a support network, so you will need your friends to help you get through.Consider if you know people who are sober or who don't drink very much, as they may be especially supportive and willing to show you ways to have fun without alcohol.


This may be a hard step to make. Admitting your addiction to others may make you feel embarrassed or uncomfortable, but it is an integral part of your recovery process.
Being honest with your friends will also help you be honest with yourself and work through your addiction.;
, Most people have many different groups of friends. You may only choose to tell your closest friends about your addiction. You may also want to tell the friends you often go out with so they know that you will no longer be drinking.


You don't have to tell all your friends together, either. If you want to do it on a one-on-one basis instead, or in small groups where you are all friends, you can decide that at this point as well.

, It's unfortunate, but you need to prepare yourself for the possibility that you may lose some of your friends, especially if they're really more ""drinking buddies"" than friends.They may say something like, ""What? You're quitting drinking? But why? You're so much fun when you're drunk!"" They may also initially offer support, but fade from your life as you stop going to bars or partying as much.If your friends have their own addictions (which they may or may not be aware of), it may be uncomfortable for them to hear you admit that you have a problem. They may see it as a commentary on their own use, and it may bring to light things they are not ready to face — they may think, Wow, if you think you're an alcoholic, what does that say about me? I drink as much as you do... Maybe more. But your decision to quit drinking is not about anyone else — it's about doing what is best for you.The thought of losing these friends may be frightening and seem lonely, but it is often necessary to avoid a social circle that parties so that you don't have a relapse. If all you have in common with those people is drinking and partying, then these friendships may end., You shouldn't go into your meeting with your friends without knowing what you are going to say. Put together a list of things you want to say or prepare a speech beforehand. This will give you time to think through what you really want to say and hope to accomplish during this conversation.It may help you feel more at ease when you tell your friends.


You can even make note cards with your talking points on them or read out your prepared speech, especially if you are extremely nervous.
Another method is to write a letter and present it to your friend or friends. They can read the letter and then ask you any questions they might have.
You may want to start by telling your friends, ""I need to discuss something serious with you."" This will prime them for the hard discussion that follows.

, You should also plan how you will respond to acquaintances when they offer you a drink or ask why you are not drinking alcohol.Though you may try to avoid situations where alcohol is available, this may be unavoidable at times. Preparing and practicing a few stock responses to the question, ""Would you like a drink?"" will help you build confidence and be firm when you say ""No.""Keep your responses short, clear, and firm. You don't need to give an excuse or explain yourself. A simple ""No thanks"" should be enough for most people.Look the person directly in the eye when you speak, don't hesitate, and try to remain friendly and respectful.If someone presses you, you may need to give a more assertive response, such as, ""No, thank you. I don't want to,"" ""No thanks. I don't drink,"" ""Actually, I'm not drinking because my doctor advised me not to. Thanks, though."", When you tell your friends about your addiction, you want to make sure it is the right time and place. Make sure it is a neutral location or one where you feel comfortable and that it's not during a time when people will be preoccupied.Make sure it is a place where you can have privacy and speak honestly with your friends.


Also make sure it isn't a place that serves alcohol, which may be tempting for you.
For example, ask your friends to meet you at your home. If it isn't big enough, ask one of your friends if you can use his place. Just make sure it is somewhere you feel comfortable.

, Telling your friends will be a stressful experience for you. Although you are on your way to recovery, you may be tempted to deal with the stress by drinking. However, this will set back your recovery and not help the situation.


Even if extreme stress is one of your drinking triggers, avoid drinking anything before your discussion with your friends., Be as honest and candid as you can be, but remember that you don't have to say more than you need to, or tell anyone you don't want to tell.You may want to tell your best friend about the repercussions of your drinking, which may include some scary or embarrassing moments, but remember that this process is about you and your sobriety, and you don't need to disclose anything more than you want to.


You can share how you ended up realizing you needed help with your addiction, but only if you are comfortable sharing this information. This can help your friends understand where you've been. You may want to share a story such as, ""I realized I needed help when I almost crashed my car into a telephone pole while I was drunk;"" or, you may want to leave out those details and say something more vague, such as ""It was making my life really difficult.""You don't have to tell each of your friends exactly the same thing. Tell each friend as much as you need to, based on the closeness of your relationship or how comfortable you are with your friend., One way for your friends to understand your particular situation could be to explain exactly how you are working through your addiction, if you wish to share that information. This can give them an example of your commitment to your recovery.


You can discuss the specific programs you are working with, any support groups you've joined, or any other behavioral change you are making to aid in your recovery.

, You need to explain these stipulations to your friends so they can understand how your behaviors will change or what they will have to do to comply with them.


For example, you will likely not allow alcohol in your home.This is important for your friends to know for when they come to visit or for when you have get togethers at your home. Tell them, ""I may get to a place where I can be around alcohol in the future, and I may be able to deal with others drinking if I'm at a get together at one of your houses, but I can't allow it in mine. It would be too hard to resist.""
This could also mean that you will no longer be going to bars or places where drinking is a major component of the atmosphere. Talk to your friends and find out if they would be willing to do other things with you besides drinking — like going for hikes, to the movies, or to museums., An important part of recovery is acknowledging how your actions have affected others. You should do this on a separate occasion than your original disclosure of your addiction and when you are solid in your sobriety.This can be difficult, but start with phrases such as, ""I know I have hurt you, and I'm sorry for that.""
It may take some time to make amends with some friends that you have harmed with your addiction, and it is generally not recommended you do this until you have some sobriety under your belt. This is because you may not like the reaction you get from the person — What if she refuses to accept your apology? What if she flies off the handle and says something cruel and hurtful in response? — and this may be hard to deal with when you are newly sober. Once you have some coping skills that don't involve drinking, it may be a good idea to start making amends., Once you disclose your alcohol addiction to your friends, you should ask them not to drink around you.This is important in the early stages of your recovery in order to help you stay strong in your dedication.


This may change after you have been in recovery for a long time., You may need to your friends' help with keeping you away from your danger zones that may cause you to possibly relapse. These can be physical locations, times of days or particular days of the year where you are likely to relapse.Your friends can be helpful by keeping you away from these places when you go out together or giving you someone to call if you find yourself in these places.If you know you are likely to drink at a certain time of day, or you find yourself craving alcohol, call or text your friend to keep you distracted.If you have certain days of the year that might be hard for you, such as an anniversary of the death of a loved one, you may ask your friend to spend that day with you.

, Most people in recovery have a sponsor who can help in tenuous situations.However, you may want to have some backups in case you need help and your sponsor is not available. It may also be good to have a support system when you are hanging out with your friends.


This can help you by making you feel more secure because you have a larger support system.

, Just like for alcoholics, there are support groups for friends and family of alcoholics. This is especially helpful for your close friends who spend a great deal of time with you. This will give them the support they need and resources with which to help you.


These organizations help your friends understand what it is like to be part of recovery and how best to help you during these hard times.
These organization include Al-Anon and SMART Recovery Family & Friends., It may be difficult, but there may be situations where you have to cut ties with some of your friends.If you have friends who refuse to stop drinking around you or who may also have a drinking problem, you need to stop being around them for the safety of your recovery.


This may be difficult at first, but you have to do what is best for your own recovery."

, If sleep is not in the cards, try getting a bit of exercise. Go on a brisk walk, a light jog, or to swim a few laps. If nothing else, exercising will boost your endorphins, helping you to get out of the black mood your hangover has thrown you into.


Some believe that exercise helps to up your body’s ability to metabolize the alcohol that you’ve consumed. When your body starts metabolizing properly, your hangover will start to go away., Hangovers increase your sensitivity to light and sound. To minimize your pain, close your blinds, avoid loud music, and place a cool washcloth on your head. If you have to go outside, wear sunglasses or a hat.

Choose to not feel ashamed.,
Don't isolate yourself.,
Find people who are dealing with the same, or similar issues.,
Focus on your own strength.",How to Survive Living with an Alcoholic1," Shame is a self-imposed feeling. No one can ""shame"" you. Remember YOU are not the alcoholic. Make sure that you have friends who know, and who care about you for who YOU are.;
, Isolating only causes us to feel different from others. Instead of isolating, join groups or activities that you find to be interesting or fun.

But this can set you up to drink more alcohol then you expected or want. Limiting yourself to one drink or less per hour can reduce your risk of getting a hangover.Drink in moderation. Keep in mind that the recommended amounts are one drink per day for women and 2 drinks per day for men. One drink is equal to 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or 1½ ounces of 80-proof liquor., One way to pace yourself is to have one glass of water for every alcoholic drink you consume. This can help keep you hydrated and drink less alcohol., Alcohol contains chemicals called congeners, which are a by-product of fermentation process. Alcoholic beverages that are high in congeners can make a hangover worse.Light colored drinks including vodka have less of these chemicals than darker beverages such as bourbon.


Choose clear liquors such as vodka and gin. White wine and light beers such as pale ale are also lower in congeners.
Limit or avoid from darker liquors including brandy, whiskey, bourbon, dark beers and red wines. These can make you more prone to a bad hangover.

, Some people take over-the-counter pain relievers before they start drinking to prevent hangover symptoms. You should do this with caution and speak to your doctor to ensure it’s safe for you.

According to Gaebler Ventures, Resources for Entrepreneurs, DUI schools are not marketed to the people who must attend the school. Most people arrested for DUI do not know what is required and must be advised by law enforcement officials or legal counsel. Thus, the smart plan is to market your DUI School directly to local police and lawyers in your area who specialize in DUI.

, Study the programs offered by well regarded DUI schools that are recommended by local law enforcement offices.


DUI schools use various techniques, including instruction from certified educators and educational films to teach drivers in the dangers of alcohol use and driving under the influence. Some schools refer to programs like Alcoholics Anonymous that offer counseling for drunk drivers.

,,


In the state of California, for example, a school must first apply to the county's Board of Supervisors. Upon approval, the board will then submit the application to the Department of Alcohol and Drug Programs. Schools are approved when they show they have the fiscal and administrative means to run a DUI program. They must also show that their program is drug and alcohol free and works within all local legal regulations.

Each drink will take your body about an hour to metabolize, so until you stop putting more alcohol in your system, you have no chance of sobering up.Simply put, the sooner you stop drinking, the sooner you will be able to sober up.


If you are still out, but you decide you want to try and sober up, switch to water to help rehydrate yourself.
If you start drinking water while you are still out, you may also lessen the effects of your forthcoming hangover.;
, Eating that kebab on the way home will not have a significant effect on your attempts to sober up. Research has shown, however, that drinking alcohol when you have an empty stomach does result in the body taking up to 45% longer to clear alcohol from your system, than if you had eaten a meal beforehand.


Some researchers think that the liver is helped in its task to digest and clear alcohol after eating, because more blood flows to the liver when you have eaten.Keep in mind that eating before drinking will only delay the alcohol getting into your bloodstream, not actually stop it., Bats who eat fermented fruit can get drunk from the alcohol that is present in their food. Scientists, who study these bats, noted that the bats that ingest fructose after eating fermented fruit sober up faster than those that ingest glucose or sucrose-rich foods. While this doesn’t translate directly to humans, you can try to put together your own fructose snack to help you sober up.Good sources of fructose are honey and fruits.
Fresh fruit and dried fruit are both rich in fructose., When you drink alcohol you deplete the levels of vital vitamins in your body. In particular your levels of magnesium, vitamin C, and vitamin B-12 are depleted by alcohol consumption. One way to tackle this, and attempt to sober up, is to replace those lost vitamins. The most effective way to do this would be through an IV drip, with the relevant cocktail of vitamins, although of course this is not a possibility for most people.More simply, you could take some vitamin tablets.
You could consume food high in vitamins. For example, if you want to replenish your depleted vitamin C, you could eat a kiwi fruit or a grapefruit.

, There are some products on the market which claim to make you sober up relatively quickly. Some of these are based on replenishing depleted vitamins, and giving you a boost of fructose. For example, fructose-rich honey is one of the key in these products. The effectiveness of these products is open to question, but you might find they help you sober up faster., Alcohol poisoning can be fatal. If you suspect that you or someone you are with might have alcohol poisoning, call emergency medical responders. People with alcohol poisoning may show some or all of the following symptoms:


Paleness or have a blue tinge to their skin.
A body temperature that is too low.
Confusion.
Throwing up.
Seizures.
Slow or irregular breathing.
Passing out. If someone has lost consciousness, his or her life is in danger., Although there are a number of methods cited to help sober up you, for the most part it is simply a matter of waiting for your body to process the alcohol. The human body needs an hour to metabolize the alcohol in one drink. One drink is equivalent to:A 12 oz beer.
An 8-9 oz malt liquor drink.
A 5 oz glass of wine.
A 1.5 oz drink of hard liquor.
If you are mixing drinks, they may be stronger than one serving of alcohol.

, There are a number of factors that influence the speed at which your body will process the alcohol you have drunk. Some of these you will have some influence over, others you won’t. The rate at which you process alcohol will vary depending on:


Your health.
Your size.
Whether you drank on a full or empty stomach.
The speed at which you drank.
Your tolerance level.
Whether you are also taking any drugs, including prescription or over-the-counter medications. Always follow any warning labels on medication and avoid mixing medications with alcohol., Caffeine is a stimulant and will may make you less sleepy, but it won’t improve your coordination, reflexes, or counteract the alcohol.Coffee will actually make you more dehydrated, and could worsen your hangover and further impede your decision-making., You might think taking a cold shower, or repeatedly splashing your face with cool water, might help you sober up more quickly. These actions might wake you up and give you the feeling that you are more alert, but they won’t contribute to the rate at which your body processes the alcohol.Your body does not regulate temperature as well when you are drunk, so if you have a cold shower you may feel cold afterwards.
A cold shower is a considerable shock to your body, especially when you have been drinking heavily.
The shock of the cold water can cause you to lose consciousness, which is very dangerous in the shower., If you have been drinking very heavily, and are at risk of alcohol poisoning, you should be aware of the dangers of losing consciousness if you fall asleep. If you consumed more drinks shortly before falling asleep, your blood alcohol level will continue to rise as it is absorbed.If you suspect you or a friend has alcohol poisoning, lie him or her on their side, in the recovery position.
Do not lie down on your back.
Do not leave someone alone if you think they are suffering from alcohol poisoning., You might think taking a walk and getting some fresh air will help you sober up, but, much like a cold shower, the effects are more mental than physical. You may feel more awake or more composed, but your body will still be processing the alcohol at the same speed. If you go for a long walk and feel more sober afterwards, it has more to do with the time that has passed than the activity of walking itself.If you are extremely drunk, your coordination and reflexes will be slow, which could put you at a higher risk for falling and injuring yourself.
If you suspect someone has alcohol poisoning, do not try to walk them around. Lay them on their side in the recovery position., If you are drunk and you think you can vomit out the alcohol and thus sober up quicker, think again. Once the alcohol has reached your small intestine, vomiting will not expel it. It might reduce the amount of alcohol in your stomach, but it won’t change the amount you have already absorbed. The amount you have absorbed is what you are trying to sober up from. Vomiting will not lower your blood alcohol level faster.


Do not encourage somebody who is semi-conscious to vomit, as this could be dangerous.
Vomit can cause choking and/or asphyxiation., If you think you have a problem with alcohol and want to quit, the first thing to do is go and talk to your doctor. You can enroll in a detox program and begin on the road to sobriety. A doctor will help manage your withdrawal symptoms as your body goes through detoxification.


It generally takes two to seven days from the time of your last drink.
Withdrawal will likely be at its worst about two days into the process. If necessary, the doctor can give you a sedative to help you through it.
Drink plenty of water and eat regular meals to keep your strength up.
If you decide to detox at home, see a doctor for regular monitoring., Depending on your condition and circumstances, a doctor may decide to prescribe certain medication to help you fight your alcohol addiction. A doctor can prescribe the following medications for you:Acamprosate (Campral) can help you stay sober by reducing the craving.
Disulfiram (Antabuse) can help prevent relapse by making you feel sick if you drink. Drinking alcohol on this medication causes nausea, chest pain, throwing up, and dizziness.
Naltrexone (Revia) prevents the positive effects of alcohol, making it less enjoyable to drink. It doesn’t make you sick. This medication is also available in an injectable form which can be taken once per month., Battling an alcohol addiction is a serious undertaking, and you will most likely benefit from a strong social support network. There are many different options so you can find what works for you. Some people like to talk to friends and family, others find it more helpful to speak to those going through a similar experience. Some steps to consider include:



Joining Alcoholics Anonymous.
Attending a support group.
Getting counselling or going to group therapy.
Going to family counselling to get help repairing damaged relationships.
Making new friends who don’t drink., Alcohol abuse and dependency is often linked with other problems, such as depression and anxiety. To really try to get over your alcohol problems it will help you to try and deal with any other issues too. This may include medications, counselling, or both.Speak to your doctor and ask for advice on what to do.
Consider cognitive behavioral therapy to help you identify and deal with situations or feelings that trigger your drinking.

, Some situations, activities, and emotions can make you feel like drinking. These internal and external motivations to drink are called triggers.It is important to familiarize yourself with those situations and find ways to cope with them or to avoid them entirely. This may make it easier to prevent a relapse.

If being around certain people makes you want to drink, then you may need to limit your time with these people or try to avoid them for a while. For example, if you have a friend who drinks heavily and encourages you to do the same, then you might want to cut down on the time you spend with this friend.
If you find it hard to go to a bar and not have a drink, then you may want to avoid bars for a while. Try asking your friends and family to meet you for dinner somewhere that does not serve alcohol, or arrange to meet them for coffee or breakfast for a while.
If you find that your desire to drink is stronger when you are feeling stressed, then you may benefit from learning some relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing, meditation, or progressive muscle relaxation.

Understand why you drink.,
Commit yourself to permanent abstinence from alcohol.,
Objectify your booze brain.,
Respond to your booze brain by saying ""never"" whenever you hear it asking for a drink.,
Enjoy your recovery from alcohol dependence.",How to Quit Drinking without Alcoholics Anonymous," Before you can use the CORE process effectively, it’s vital that you recognize the problem. In Alcoholics Anonymous, alcoholism is viewed as a disease which only a Higher Power can help you with; outside AA, however, there are other models of alcohol dependence. One useful way to look at a drinking problem is to view it in terms of survival instincts. The brain is divided into two basic parts, which we will call the human brain (you) and the animal brain (it). The animal brain is concerned only with survival, and when you are chemically dependent on alcohol, it falsely thinks that you need alcohol to survive. Because of this, you could call it the ""booze brain."" If you don't understand how the booze brain works, it can easily trick the human brain (you) into drinking.;
, You do not need alcohol to survive. Make a plan to quit for good. When you're ready, say the words ""I will never drink again."" Pay attention to how you feel. If you are scared, panicked, angry, depressed, or feeling badly in some way, that’s the booze brain at work. And, in all honesty, you WILL feel bad at first. Your body has been operating with this chemical for...however long. It thinks it needs it. It has to learn how to operate without it now, and learning has a curve. Give it time to learn.


Your neurons, which have been dulled by booze for quite some time, and now are all a-buzz with activity, which means that resting and sleep will probably be hard to get for a couple of days. In the meantime, your booze brain will tell you lies; call it a liar and watch late-night TV till it passes!

, The human brain is much smarter than the booze brain, which doesn't understand that you can live without alcohol. You can outsmart your booze brain by learning to think of it as something other than yourself as well as hear when it’s speaking to you. Objectify it by saying ""it wants a drink"" instead of ""I want a drink."" When you objectify the booze brain, you realize that it has no power over you. You are in control and it is an outsider. All it can do is try to trick you into drinking, but you can outsmart it every time.


It will try anything to get you to drink because it falsely believes that you need to drink to survive. If you are feeling bad, it will tell you to drink to feel better. If you are feeling good, it will tell you to drink to party or celebrate. In fact, it will try to use any event in your life (good or bad) as an excuse to drink. Whenever you have any thought or feeling that suggests drinking, that is the booze brain trying to trick you.

, This causes the booze brain to back down because it recognizes that it is not in control and there is no way it can force you to pour alcohol down your throat. It will try many different ploys to trick you into drinking (especially at first), but now that you have this information, you will know what it is up to every time. Remember, any thought or feeling that suggests drinking at any time is the booze brain at work. When you recognize it, just tell it ""I never drink"" and continue with whatever you were doing. Don't argue with it; just tell it that you never drink.


If your friends offer you a drink, say ""No thanks, I'm quitting."" You can also say ""I'm slowing down"" or even just ""No, thanks"" if you don’t want to get into it. However, if the people in your circle tend to drink, it’s probably best that you be up-front with them so they can support you by being discreet. If they don’t support your decision, find new friends.
Your booze brain will get more and more discouraged as time goes on, bothering you less and less. Before too long, you'll be an expert at dealing with your booze brain, making it easy to stay sober.

, When you decide to quit drinking forever, one of the first difficulties you will face is simply dealing with the day-to-day reality without alcohol. If you sit at home with nothing to do, your booze brain will pester you for a drink and it will be very difficult to make it stop because your human brain is idle. This is why you will need to develop something to occupy your human brain. Find (or rediscover) hobbies that give you something to show for your time. Get in shape, fix up an old car, or start a new relationship. Learn to cook, play an instrument, decorate, or go out with (sober) friends. Write helpful articles on wikiHow. Set aside the money you used to spend on drinking and watch your piggy bank grow. Celebrate every sober anniversary whether it’s a week or a decade: things are going to keep getting better from here on out.


Don't be afraid that you’ll slip or relapse: that fear is the booze brain at work trying to give you an excuse to give up.
Eventually, the CORE process becomes automatic, meaning you won't have to make a big effort to stay sober. You may feel bad, angry, sad, or depressed at times, but that's normal. If the booze brain tries to use these feelings as excuses to drink, you’ll know what it’s up to and how to deal with it. You’re better, smarter, funnier, wittier, and even taller when you stand up to your booze brain!

Start to learn about and change any patterns in your daily life that may act as triggers or contribute to your loved one’s destructive behavior.,
Look for fellowships.,
Be supportive.",How to Prepare for an Alcohol Intervention," Many people who have an addiction often live in denial of it. Knowing what signs to look for can help you in your efforts to get them the help they need. Some common signs of alcohol abuse include, but are not limited to, the following:


Irritability
Mood swings
Relationship problems
Complaints from coworkers and teachers
Legal trouble,
Increased tolerance to alcohol
Drinking to cope with life or to feel normal
Neglecting responsibilities.;
, Drinking switches from a social activity to a problem when it starts to take over aspects of a person’s life, such as work, personal relationships, responsibilities, and safety.

, Personal appearance can also start to decline due to poor hygiene habits one can experience when addicted. They may not shower for several days in a row, or have wrinkled, musty clothing. They may also start to drink earlier in the day or before driving, and usually by themselves.

, Showing withdrawal symptoms such as trembling, nausea, headaches, anxiety, jumpiness, or fatigue after going without a drink for a period of time indicates that they have grown physically dependent on the alcohol.If you start to notice several of these symptoms together, it may be time to consider hosting an intervention.

, It’s also a good idea to look into your insurance plan and see what type of treatment they will cover, if any. From there, you can start looking into different treatment facilities and programs, as well as fellowships in your area that will be able to be a support system for your loved one.


The more you know about what your loved one is doing and where they can find the best help, the better. Be wary of treatment places that offer a “miracle cure” or a “quick fix”. Make sure you have fully and thoroughly looked into each place you are considering.

, Based on the information you have been able to gather, you should plan where, when, and who will attend the intervention. Consulting with a professional interventionist is recommended, they can help with any and all of the above steps, and may even be able to attend the intervention itself. The more you know and prepare, the smoother the process will go.

, When thinking about people who will attend the intervention, you should ensure that they are aware of the situation, are willing to stop enabling the addiction of the loved one, and that their presence will not distract from the main purpose of the intervention in any way. You also don’t want to overwhelm your loved one with a large group of people. Invite a small group of five people or fewer.


If there’s someone you believe your loved one should hear from, but they are not able to make it or you believe their presence would be a distraction, you can have them write a letter that someone in attendance can read out loud for them.

, The intervention should also take place in a private place, with no outside interruptions or diversions. An intervention is not something that should be a public forum or a spectacle for outsiders to witness. It should be a private, intimate meeting of family and close friends expressing their love, support, and concern for their loved one and encouraging them to get help.


It is also very helpful to meet with those attending the intervention (minus the loved one in question) beforehand to go over specific talking points and who will say what. You can even write notes on what you want to say and keep them with you for the intervention.

, Whatever way the intervention ends you will have to have a plan in place for after the fact. Making travel arrangements, including who will travel with your loved one to the treatment facility you decided on after the intervention, is always a good idea. It helps ensure that your loved one doesn’t have time between the intervention and leaving for treatment to run away, hide, or use again.


You can also make the necessary arrangements for anything in your loved one’s life that needs to be taken care of while they are away, i.e. pets, children, house sitting, etc. Have a plan in place for all those details that might make them nervous to leave, or that might give them an excuse to stay, so that they can go to treatment and know that everything is being taken care of back home.

, Some examples may include asking to move out if they still live with you, taking away visiting rights with children, or refusing to lend them money unless you know for sure that it's money for treatment.

, Without telling your loved one why, invite them to the pre-determined time and place and start the intervention. Let them know of your concerns and love for them, and present them with the treatment plan you have created. Do not tell them what you will do if they don’t go unless you are really willing and able to follow through on it.

, Do not say things that would make your loved one feel guilty or that would open up past arguments. Stay focused on the plan and on letting your loved one know you care and that they have a place to go and get help if they so choose.

, If they’re in treatment, make sure to keep up on their progress and make yourself available for any family therapy the facility may ask you to participate in.

, You can also seek out therapy and support of your own to help you through this difficult time.

, There are fellowships for families in the same position as you. You can seek them out and get the support and understanding you need while learning everything you can about relapse prevention, including what to do if your loved one experiences a relapse. Have a plan in case such a thing were to occur.

, Through it all, continue letting your loved one know you care and will support them in their recovery journey. Know that by taking care of yourself through seeking support and knowledge, you are better able to help them.

Start the day with a pleasant bath rather than a shower.,

Go to be early.",How to Recover After a Big Girl's Night Out," Forget the cleaning; either you ought to have done that the night before last night or you'll get onto it tomorrow night. It isn't going anywhere.;
, This is a great cleanser and it doesn't taste too bad either. Give it a go.

, That way, you can lie back and relax and plan the rest of the day's pampering. Add some aromatherapy oils to the bath; good oils to use include a few drops of neroli essential oil, or a few drops of rose absolute essential oil, or a few drops of jasmine essential oil. There are others you can use too; basically whatever smells perfect for right now will be good. And don't forget to exfoliate with that loofah. And when you hop out, get the blood flowing again with a good body brush prior to dressing in soft, billowy and loose clothing.

, What could be more pleasant than adding a delicious facial pack to your face and lying down again in room with gentle light and sweetly playing music in the background? Look for a refreshing citrus or other uplifting scent that will wake your skin up and cure the puffy eyes.

, Have fresh fruit, yogurt, eggs, fruit smoothies, oatmeal and wholegrain toast for breakfast. Use fresh ingredients for everything and avoid anything sugary or processed.

, Exercise? Aw, really? Yes! Get out and invigorate your body with exercise. A fast walk will kick-start your energy again and help your blood flow. And that better flowing blood will flow to your poor liver that is trying to release the toxins you overwhelmed it with the night before.

, Read the paper, a novel, the latest gossip mag and relax in the sun or in a comfortable spot. This should give your body enough time to have started to come back to normal by lunchtime.

, Nothing too stodgy, fatty or sugary. Try a salad, fresh bread, soup or light pasta dish. If you are still feeling nauseous, have a fresh ginger stir-fry; the ginger is very stomach-calming. And drink water.

, By now the self-pampering should be having some good results. You probably feel tireder than normal, so don't push yourself but do try to do something more involved than lying around on the couch. Go shopping with a friend, see a movie, visit the local museum etc. Keep dinner light and...

, Tomorrow is another day and you need your beauty sleep. Your body will thank you for it.

Let the person know in advance.,
Discuss their triggers.,
Talk about their recovery.,
Brainstorm alternatives.",How to Include a Recovering Alcoholic in Social Events with Alcohol1," Whether the person is a recovering alcoholic or not, if you want them to attend the event, you’ll need to invite them. When you would like to include a recovering alcoholic in an event with alcohol it’s definitely a good idea to talk to them about the event first.This way, you’re inviting them and also giving them a chance to make an informed decision about whether or not they want to or able to attend.


For example, you might say,” I’d like for you to come to an event with me but there will be alcohol there.”
Or, for instance, you could try, “There’s a party I’d like us to attend but they’re going to be drinking. How do you feel about that?”;
, Triggers are events, situations, people, or places that may cause a recovering alcoholic to want to drink again.If you are close to the person, ask them about things that might tempt them to drink. Knowing what their triggers are will help you and them plan for a fun, but safe event for everyone involved.


You may need to ask if they are aware of any triggers they might have. For instance, you might ask, “Do you know of any situations that might make you want to drink?”
For example, the holidays, birthdays, or anniversaries may be hard for some recovering alcoholics.
You can ask, “Is there anything about this event that you think might be a trigger for you to drink again?”

, Although this might not be an easy discussion to have, talking about where they are in their recovery process will help you include them in the event while being sensitive to their needs. Find out if they are at a point in recovery where they can handle being around alcohol.You might ask, “Do you feel that you are at a place in your recovery where you can handle this?”
Or, you might try saying, “There will be alcohol there. How do you feel it might impact your recovery?”
Be aware that some people that are early in the recovery process may feel that they can handle being around alcohol, but aren’t actually ready for that yet.

, If the person is just beginning recovery or has had a recent relapse, consider other ways to include them in the event without them being directly around alcohol.Even though you may not want them to miss out on the event, you also don’t want to risk their sobriety.


For example, if your uncle just started recovery a few weeks ago after years of alcoholism, you may want to reconsider inviting him to an open bar reception. Consider having an intimate, dry get-together for him and a few others before the main reception.
Or, for instance, if you are attending a baseball game and want your friend to come along, consider attending a ‘family day’ game where alcohol won’t be served.

"
"
Have non-alcoholic options.,
Focus on other things.,
Be discreet.",How to Include a Recovering Alcoholic in Social Events with Alcohol2," It will be much harder for a recovering alcoholic to avoid temptation if that’s all there is at the event to drink. Make sure that there are several non-alcoholic beverages available for them to choose from.This simple act can eliminate a lot of stress for you and the person.


Try to offer a variety of non-alcoholic drinks if you are the person hosting the event. For instance, you might have juices, soda, and water on hand.
For example, if everyone is drinking flutes of wine to toast the new couple, you might offer the person a flute of sparkling grape juice or ginger ale.
If necessary, consider bringing non-alcoholic beverages with you.

, Unless the event is a wine-tasting or something similar, there should be many other things to do besides drink. Focusing on those things rather than the alcohol at the event will make it much easier to include a recovering alcoholic. It will also keep the focus on the reason why you are there – to experience the event and create memories you and the person can share.


For example, rather than playing drinking games at a party, you might stick to games that don’t require drinking alcohol.
Or, for instance, if you are at an art showing, focus on the works that are being displayed rather than getting the drink waiter’s attention for another glass of wine.

, Although the person is a recovering alcoholic and some considerations need to be made, a public service announcement doesn’t need to be made about their sobriety at the event. Do what you can to maintain the person’s privacy and respect to make sure that they feels comfortable at the event.For instance, there’s no need to announce to everyone that the person is a recovering alcoholic. Just introduce them as you would anyone else.
Try to avoid asking them things like “Is that alcohol in that cup?” or making statements about their sobriety around strangers.

"
"
Build a support team.,
Monitor your intake.,
Check-in every now and then.,
Develop an emergency plan.",How to Include a Recovering Alcoholic in Social Events with Alcohol3," Having other positive people at the event to help support the person can make it easier to include a recovering alcoholic. All of the people at the event don’t have to be aware the person is overcoming a drinking problem, but it can be helpful to invite others that won’t be drinking or that know the person well enough to offer support and encouragement at the event.For instance, if you are going to a family reunion, you could invite other family members that choose not to drink.
Or, for example, if you are going to a dinner party where they’ll be serving wine, you might ask the person’s sibling to come along with you guys to help provide support.

, It will be hard for you to be supportive of a recovering alcoholic at an event with alcohol if you are inebriated yourself. Although you don’t have to completely abstain from alcohol at the event, make sure that you are monitoring how much you drink.It will make it easier for you to be supportive.


If you are consuming alcohol make sure that you are drinking water and limiting the amount of alcohol you drink.
You may want to consider not drinking if there’s a chance that you might have too much.

, Although you don’t need to follow the person around like their shadow, checking on them every now and then can give both of you peace of mind. It will let the person know that you care and will help you make sure that they aren’t drinking.


You can simply ask them, “Is everything going okay” rather than asking “How are you handling having alcohol around?”
Use your observation skills to notice if they seem like they may be drinking at the event. For example, if they are starting to act out of character, it might be a sign that they have had a drink.

, You may not want to expect or plan for something negative to occur, but it’s always good to have a plan in place in the event that it does. Talk with the recovering alcoholic about how you all will handle it if the alcohol at the event becomes an issue.Discussing this upfront will take stress off of you and allow you to have a better time at the event.


Talk about how to handle it if the person wants to drink. For instance, you might say, “What will be our plan if you feel you want a drink?”
Consider developing a code word to use if the person is feeling tempted and needs some support. For example, you could say, “Ok, if you say ‘I’m thirsty’, I’ll know it’s a sign that we might need to leave.”
Discuss what you should do if the person does drink. For example, “If you have a drink, we’ll call your sponsor and go meet him for coffee.”

Even after rehab, it is recommended that you speak with your doctor to schedule your alcohol consumption (this depends greatly on the person and the program).


Medical assistance can be useful in helping you plan and track your progress. It is also very important to receive a physician’s advice on the variety of changes happening to your body on a cellular and physiological level.
Professionals can help relieve some of your withdrawal pain by either providing appropriate medication or protocol for the variety of potential withdrawal symptoms you could be having. Medication can help calm panic and other strategies can show you what to do in case of extreme anxiety.;
, Alcohol contains a lot of calories, yet does not supply all the resources your body needs to thrive. Nutrition is very important for adequate recovery; make sure you give your body the proper nutrients it requires to make transitioning into a sober lifestyle as easy as possible.

Schedule your meals so you receive the necessary amount of calories and nourishment. Alcoholics have been found with deficiencies in calcium, zinc and vitamins B and D (amongst other health problems). Talk to your doctor to gain more knowledge on vitamins and minerals recommended specifically for you.






Always keep water and food at hand. Fighting against urges is hard and it is only magnified by feelings of thirst and hunger. Suppress these feelings and urges by making sure you drink plenty of water and eat enough food.







, A good way to maintain sobriety is to keep your mind occupied with topics other than alcohol. Find local events or schedule fun things to do with your family. You can also take up a new sport or hobby to occupy time in a productive manner.

, For most people, family relationships play a huge role in the choice to abstain from alcohol. Surrounding yourself with people who love you will increase your happiness and drive to stay sober. Your journey to sobriety is a good time to reform and strengthen your relationship with family.


Engage more with your family by going to certain events with them or just spending more time with them. Watching movies, playing board games, or celebrating holidays are all great things to do with your family.
Reconnecting with your family will not only aid you in recovering from weak points in your life, but also help you celebrate the high points. They will be with you through the ups and downs, helping you get up and stay up throughout all of them. You may also find yourself needing to speak with somebody while in a rough emotional time, and family members are great people to turn to in times of need.







, Friends can be great resources as they can remind you during times of urges that you do not need to drink alcohol and can help you abstain from drinking.

Friends, like family, are also there to help you emotionally in times of need.

, Recovering from alcoholism is hard enough. Trying to life alcohol free when surrounded by people who constantly drink or who are not entirely supportive of your choice puts more unnecessary strain on you. Attempt to spend less time around alcohol and more time near individuals who encourage you to stay sober.

, Everyone has different reasons for wanting to continue to live alcohol free. Though most people share somewhat similar patterns, every individual’s reasons are specific to him/her.

Never forget the reasons you wanted to quit. Did you hate the feeling of a hangover? Did you notice an absence of your presence in family life? Whether it was because of economic or family issues, make sure you remember your reasons. If you’re even in danger of drinking, fall back to your core values and recall why you quit alcohol to begin with. Recount all the negative feelings you had when you lived your life as an alcoholic, and use that as motivation to continue your abstinence.







, Creating a list of thought provoking and motivational sayings are a great resource for situations when you want to drink. You can save them on your phone and look them up during times of need. They will help you remind yourself of your goals and help provide a small boost of motivation any time you need it.

, Reflecting on how far you’ve come so far, is a powerful method for continuing to abstain from alcohol use. Once you look back and realize you don’t want the life you had while drinking, it makes it much easier to avoid alcohol as you associate negative times with the act of drinking. Conversely, the enjoyable, sober moments you have will encourage you to remain sober., It will constantly prompt you to remain sober and can help suppress urges to drink during times of need. It’s a manifestation of your current progress and the time of abstinence you have remaining.

Become sober.,
Get your family involved.,
Ask for intervention.,
Get involved once you're in rehab.,
Prepare yourself for withdrawal.,
Have faith.,
Love yourself.",How to Overcome the Temptations of Drinking when You Are Sober," Becoming sober is the first step. You can’t handle all this if you can't get sober to begin with.;
, Or everyone that is close to you or cares about you immensely. Get them to do the little details that help you, like throw away all the temptations of alcohol like beer, whiskey , margaritas, etc. Throw away all the things that represent alcohol, posters, t-shirts, pictures with you drinking alcohol. That will help you distract yourself from the fact that alcohol exists in the world, even though you will still feel the effects of withdrawal. Every little bit helps, though.

, If you continue to drink or those little things are not helping with the temptations, have your family or close friends intervene. Allow them to take you to a safe place where they can tell you that they are worried about you to the point that they are willing to do anything to help you, even if that means putting you in rehab. You can feel free to disagree, but it will help you overcome the temptations if you know that your loved ones are worried about you, that they care about you and that they want the best for you.

, Daily activities will keep your mind focused on the treatment and not on drinking. Take part in family therapy and get them to tell you how they feel when you drink and how much it worries them. If you have no family, get your friends involved in your case, too. You need support, you can’t do this alone, and there is always someone willing to give it, even if you don't expect that.

, If you are a strong alcoholic, or maybe even a weak one, meaning that you don’t drink a lot but you experience physical discomfort whenever you don't drink, you will go through withdrawal. They are not the funnest thing to go through, but it is worth it in the long run. Drink other fluids, exercise, talk to your therapist, family or friend to keep your mind busy. The more you have to do then the less you have the chance to drink.

, You can do this. Your life will be a better one. During the withdrawal process, you may think that it's not worth it or you don't have much to look forward to. Understand that these thoughts are inspired by the chemical imbalance in your brain caused by the withdrawal. They are not true. Find spiritual guidance if you are a religious person. If you are not, speak to others who are further down the same path. They know what you are going through and will show you honestly how valuable the outcome is.

, You are not a bad person. You are being responsible and changing your life and the lives of those you love for the better. Take pride in that, even if you are still standing at the beginning of your path.

Determine what resources work best for you in your recovery. Not all resources will work for every person.


Avoid slipping back into bad habits. You will never be completely cured of your alcoholism. Be aware of the desire to slip back into social or casual drinking, as that can easily lead you down the road to a relapse. If you are having these urges, speak to your sponsor.

, Make sure you continue to attend counseling or meetings regularly, making your attendance a priority in your life.It is not uncommon for people to stop going to meetings if they feel like they have beaten their alcoholism. Even if you feel like you are doing well, it is still important to continue to go to meetings. It is okay to scale back on the number of meetings, but keep that resource open for yourself.

Don’t fall into old traps.,
Learn to manage emotional triggers.,
Avoid consuming any amount of alcohol.,
Contain “slip ups” before they become relapses.,
Keep yourself occupied.,
Replace alcohol with “positive addictions.” For abusers of alcohol, drinking can provide a way to pass the time and temporarily mask disappointments or sorrows.,
Live healthy so you can fend off temptations.,
Envision each relapse temptation to its bitter end.,
Seek out professional help.,
Surround yourself with reliable friends.,
Talk with others facing the same challenges.,
Start the process anew each day.",How to Prevent Alcohol Addiction Relapse," When you decide to give up alcohol, you also decide to give up parts of your life. One of the strongest “triggers” for alcohol relapse is returning to situations that you associate both with pleasure and with alcohol consumption. No matter how long it’s been since your last drink, it can be very easy to fall back into old habits.Does this mean you have to stop going to nightclubs or tailgate parties altogether? Perhaps, depending on your individual circumstances. You have to be strong enough to cut out certain places, activities, and people in order to maintain your advantage against relapse.;
, If you used to drink when you were sad, or happy, or stressed out, or bored, you may be especially tempted to drink whenever you experience those emotions again. You can’t avoid or ignore your feelings, but you can learn to manage them.Many recovering addicts find undergoing Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) with a trained professional to be helpful. CBT can teach you tools to handle emotional triggers. For example, in CBT you might learn how to identify signs that you are at risk of a relapse and develop a protocol for these situations, such as calling your therapist., Many relapses have begun with the person thinking or saying “Oh, one little drink won’t hurt me.” No matter how long it has been or how little you take in, consuming alcohol in any amount puts you at significant risk for relapse.If you have a friend or loved one who is recovering from alcohol abuse, one of the classic signs of an impending (or ongoing) relapse is if he or she says that drinking just “a little bit” or only “every once in a while” is OK because things are “under control.”
Some people find that medications help to reduce the urge to consume any amount of alcohol. Some drugs, such as Naltrexone, strictly help reduce cravings, while others, like Disulfiram, make you feel physically ill if you consume alcohol even in small amounts.

, No recovering addict has a perfect record of sobriety. But relapse is a process just as is recovery, and the process can be halted before it goes too far. A “slip up” is not a failure, it is a challenge. Don’t give up and give in; instead, get to work.Seek out your support network immediately. Call your therapist. Talk to your sponsor or a trusted friend. Go to an AA meeting. The sooner you accept what has happened and respond to it in a constructive manner, the better your chances of warding off a looming relapse.

, No matter what you think of the old adage “idle hands are the devil’s playthings,” there can be no doubt that boredom can foster a powerful urge to have a drink. Instead of sitting around and obsessing over what you’d like to have but know you shouldn’t, get up, get moving, and keep your mind and body too busy to notice such passing urges.Create a regimented daily schedule full of healthy forms of mental and physical stimulation. Go for a run. Join a book club. Learn to play piano. Call your mother. Leave as little unaccounted “free time” as possible.

, When you quit drinking, something needs to fill that void, or the lure of a relapse will be hard to ignore. Make sure your replacement is a positive choice, though.“Positive addictions” may seem like an oxymoron, but what is meant by the term is finding beneficial habits to replace the time and function of negative compulsions. You could focus your energies on getting in shape, doing charitable work, fixing up your house, learning to play guitar, or any number of other alternatives to picking up a bottle.

, The worse you feel — emotionally and/or physically — the easier it is to descend into relapse. When you are rested, relaxed, energetic, and have a positive attitude, you will have greater willpower and less reasons to rationalize taking a drink.By practicing “self care,” you will improve your health, your mood, and your ability to remain sober. Work on getting enough sleep, exercising regularly, improving your diet, cutting out other bad habits like smoking, and using meditation or other relaxation techniques. Talk to your doctor, therapist, and other members of your addiction recovery team for advice.

, When you’re working hard every day to stay sober, it’s easy to be tempted by half-memories or clouded visions of the joys of drinking. You might see yourself laughing at the bar, getting ready for the big game at the tailgate, or just relaxing in your patio lounge chair. Remind yourself, however, that this is only a small snippet of the bigger picture.When you have these temptations, force yourself to carry the vision through. What happens the next morning after that night at the bar, or afternoon at the tailgate? How many drinks will you probably have while sitting in that lounge chair? Do these supposedly “happy” memories end with you passed out on the floor, fighting with loved ones, or in a jail cell? When you can see the entire story, the temptation is unlikely to be as strong.

, You can become addicted to alcohol without much help, but quitting and preventing relapses requires ongoing assistance. If checking into a rehabilitation center or entering therapy helped you break your addiction, continue to rely on professional resources to maintain your sobriety. If not, don’t assume that you don’t need any help to stay sober. The more allies you have in your fight, the better your odds of ongoing success.Working with a specialist in addiction therapy can offer many benefits for a recovering alcoholic. A good therapist can help identify your relapse determinants, which can be immediate (such as situations that serve as your triggers) or covert (such as stress and other lifestyle factors). From there, you can work together to enhance coping skills, make lifestyle adjustments, and develop urge-management techniques, all of which can help you to avoid and manage relapses., When you give up alcohol, you may find that you need to give up some of your friends as well. Anyone who is not supportive of your efforts or understanding of your need to avoid situations that can trigger a relapse may need to be phased out of your life. However, truly supportive and understanding friends and loved ones can be your daily guides to continued sobriety.Developing or acting upon a strong desire to reconnect with the “old gang” (and the environment that comes with them) can often be a sign of relapse in a recovering addict.The best friend to the recovering alcoholic is someone who is full of encouragement, willing to speak up when you need guidance, understanding when you slip up, and who also follows and supports in you a healthy lifestyle free of alcohol.

, When you’re dealing with any sort of addiction, sometimes you just need to talk to other people who know just what you’re going through. Go to meetings or other events where you can talk to other recovering alcoholics, and keep going regularly, even during times when you feel as though you are managing your recovery well.Wherever you live, you should be able to find meetings for Alcoholics Anonymous or similar addiction support groups nearby. The internet also provides ample opportunities to connect with others like you.

, Recovering from alcohol addiction never ends, and relapse is never more than a few drinks away. It may be a sports cliche, but the notion of taking things “day by day” is essential when it comes to preventing a relapse. View each day you complete without a relapse as a victory, and the next day as a new challenge.This “day by day” perspective also means that a slip-up or relapse is not a permanent failure. You can move past it and start the next day fresh. The only way you can fail is if you stop trying."

Recognize your drinking patterns.,
Notice changes in personality or morals.,
Consider whether you are living a “double life.” Another quality of the functional alcoholic is the ability to compartmentalize your drinking from other aspects of life.,
Check for tolerance or dependence.,
Listen to your excuses.,
Know how to recognize ""healthy"" drinking habits.,
Use the CAGE questionnaire.,
Recognize that rock bottom isn’t a requirement for treatment.,
Understand how denial stands in the way of recovery.,
Admit you have a problem and you’re not in control.,
See a doctor.,
Check for comorbid disorders.,
Attend therapy regularly.,
Participate in alcoholism support groups.",How to Know if You're a High Functioning Alcoholic," No matter how well you seem to be handling life, you’re “at risk” of becoming a functional alcoholic if you consume more than three drinks a day (or seven a week) as a woman and more than four drinks a day (or fourteen a week) as a man. Another way to identify a high-functioning drinker is through their drinking patterns and habits.


Do you find yourself having strong cravings after only one alcoholic drink? Do you drink as a reward, to relieve stress, or when upset or angry? Do you find yourself impatiently waiting for your first drink of the day? Do you tend to obsess about alcohol? All of the above reflect the drinking patterns of high-functioning alcoholics.;
, If you are a high-functioning alcoholic, or HFA, you can probably sustain personal relationships in spite of your drinking habits; however, one tell-tale sign of a problem is displaying remarkably different personality or behavioral quirks when under the influence.


For instance, if you are typically reserved in personality, you may become rambunctious and impulsive while drinking.What’s more, these extreme changes in behavior and personality may also result in you saying or doing things that you later regret. You may feel shame or guilt the next day after drinking., During normal hours, you may defy the alcoholic stereotype by performing at work or school with minimal issues. To others, you may appear to be managing life rather well.


A red-flag to compartmentalization is hanging with different people when drinking or hiding episodes of drinking. For instance, you may compartmentalize by going to bars alone or you may decline visits to your home so your drinking habits are not exposed., However good a functional alcoholic may be at hiding the negative consequences of a drinking habit, there are generally easy-to-spot physical signs that point to alcoholism.


One of these is developing a tolerance for alcohol, meaning that you start having to drink more and more to get the same effect as before.This can be demonstrated when you say you will only have two drinks, but, more often than not, you break this rule and drink more. To hide the fact, you may try to drink privately before joining in on a social occasion.
The other physical indicator of alcoholism is physical dependence. Dependence signifies that you no longer have control over how much you drink. You may try to stop, but be unsuccessful. Withdrawal is a clear sign of dependence in which you may experience undesirable symptoms when you wait too long to drink or try to stop. These symptoms may include shakiness, anxiety, upset stomach, and sweating., One of the most distressing aspects of functional alcoholism is the lengths the person will go to deny having a problem. Like others around them, HFAs may refuse to see their drinking as a problem because they don’t fit the typical picture of an alcoholic.


Not convinced you’re in denial? See if any of the following excuses sound familiar to you. If you are a high-functioning alcoholic, you may only drink certain kinds of alcohol or very expensive brands as a way of deluding yourself into believing you don’t have a problem. You may also come up with excuses for excessive drinking, such as stress at work or rewarding themselves after a productive week.While non-alcoholics may share some of the same traits like drinking to relieve stress, if you're a high functioning alcoholic, your excuse-making is generally coupled with other signs like hiding drinking behavior and experiencing extreme changes in personality when drinking.

, Being concerned about whether you are a functional alcoholic could lead to you over-analyzing drinking habits that are reasonably adaptive in nature. Not all drinking is unhealthy or a sign of alcoholism. Here's how to spot the difference.


Low-risk drinking characterizes those who drink alcohol in moderation. For healthy men under the age of 65, this translates to an average of two servings per day or no more than four servings in any day. For women in the same age group, healthy drinking habits mean an average of one serving per day and no more than three servings in any day.One serving of alcohol is equivalent to 12 ounces of regular beer, 5 ounces of wine, and 1.5 ounces of 80-proof distilled liquor., One of the most common tools used in clinical practice when diagnosing hazardous levels of drinking and alcohol dependence is called the CAGE questionnaire. CAGE is an acronym of the most likely behaviors that increase the risk for alcoholism: C is for “cut down,” A is for “annoyed,” G is for ""guilt,"" and E is for an “eye opener.” You can do a self-test by asking yourself four questions.Have you ever felt you should cut down on your drinking?
Have people annoyed you by criticizing your drinking?
Have you ever felt bad or guilty about your drinking?
Have you ever had a drink first thing in the morning to steady your nerves or to get rid of a hangover (eye opener)?
If you answer yes to two or more of the above questions, this indicates a problematic relationship with alcohol.

, In order to truly find recovery from alcoholism, you and your loved ones must be willing to accept that not being at rock bottom doesn’t mean there’s not a problem. It may only be through sheer luck that you haven't experienced major losses or negative consequences due to your drinking habits; however, you may see this as a sign that you are doing okay.


Clearly being hung-over or intoxicated with rocky relationships and poor finances is not the only picture of alcoholism. Estimates say that as little as 20% and potentially as many as 75% to 90% of all alcoholics meet the criteria for the high-functioning type, which means you could be in need of help even though you “seem” to be managing., Being in denial about alcoholism is a common construct of alcohol abuse. Furthermore, denial is often a significant barrier keeping you from getting help. It may not just be you, the functional alcoholic, that's in denial. Your friends and family may also come up with excuses for your behavior, such as stress, illness, or depression., Denial is a mechanism that protects a person’s ego from a harsh reality. Because you are probably high-achieving and successful, it can be difficult for you to admit the problem. Many times, it is friends and family members who start to see cracks in your otherwise well-put-together exterior.If a loved one points out your problem, have the courage to admit that you are no longer in control. Acknowledging the problem is the first and most necessary step to recovery.
Mental health providers outline three stages to breaking through denial. Recognition, which requires admitting the problem; acceptance, which requires taking action to change the behavior; and surrender, which is a genuine commitment to becoming sober.In some cases, admitting the problem becomes impossible for you and your loved ones are forced to stage an intervention. This process allows family and friends to share concerns with you about how your drinking affects them. During an intervention, your loved ones will also encourage you to seek recovery treatment., Once you have come to terms with denial and admitted the need for help, it’s important to take action right away. For support, request that a loved one accompany you to see a doctor. You can merely mention your drinking habit to your doctor during a routine visit or schedule a special appointment to discuss it.


Your doctor will conduct a thorough interview to assess the severity of your drinking, understand any symptoms you may experience, and evaluate your medical and family history. Your doctor may also complete a physical examination and a mental health evaluation.
Depending on the severity of your drinking and associated symptoms, you may be admitted for detoxification or referred to a specialized center for alcohol recovery.

, As you get started in the recovery process, your mental health provider will also assess for comorbidity — that is, the co-existence of a psychiatric disorder. It is very common for alcoholics to struggle with other mental health conditions such as depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, or anxiety.


If it is determined that you are experiencing a comorbid disorder, your team of providers will work with you to develop a personalized treatment plan for dual diagnosis. Depending on where you live and your access to recovery treatment, you may be able to get help for both conditions simultaneously, or your team will treat the alcoholism and then focus on the underlying mental illness., Whether you are getting recovery services inpatient or outpatient, you will probably receive counseling services. While detoxing from alcohol is necessary for recovery, addressing the problematic behaviors that led to alcohol dependence is an important component for lasting change.


Therapy, particularly cognitive-behavioral therapy, has been shown to help alcoholics develop successful coping skills to manage life problems and prevent relapse. CBT may also be effective at treating any comorbid psychiatric disorder that may play into alcoholism., Having a network of people to support you through your recovery is vital to long-term success.In addition to the support gained from your mental health providers, family, and friends, it can be practical to join a local or online support group of people who are also recovering from alcoholism.

Support groups allows each member to share details about their recovery journey. This fosters a deep sense of connection and makes each individual member feel less alone in their own recovery. There is Alcoholics Anonymous and SMART recovery, was well as a host of support groups to consider for teens, children of alcoholics, and families."

If you spend a great deal of time with a recovering alcoholic, it is of utmost importance that you do not drink around them.,
Do not take them to bar and grill restaurants.,
Let them know you stand by their decision and that it is the best decision.,
Make sure the recovering alcoholic knows that they can depend on you in moments of weakness.",How to Help a Recovering Alcoholic," If you are a social drinker, do not drink around them. If you drink daily, it is important that you do not drink around a recovering alcoholic. It's the equivalent of saying ""I don't care that you're in recovery, I don't have the problem you have."" This can definitely give a bad impression to someone who is in recovery.;
, The bar is usually the first thing you see when you walk into these places, filled with happy people blowing off steam after work or school. This serves as a reminder to the recovering alcoholic. Not to mention the sights of full glasses and pitchers.

, Alcoholism is called a disease, and for good reason: It affects the internal organs in a harmful manner and contributes to conditions such as cirrhosis of the liver, kidney problems, etc. As we are all aware of, alcohol also affects our reasoning and other cognitive abilities, which in turn affects families, friends and jobs. The greatest way to overcome alcoholism is having a support team, the ones that will be there to say ""It's been 4 days! You are doing great!""

, Let them know if they feel they are about to fall off the wagon, you are never more than a phone call away. This could be hard on you, and Alcoholics Anonymous uses a similar support system, albeit with a stranger. Some people are not particularly excited about inviting a stranger into their life, so it will be good for them to know they can turn to you when the going gets tough.

Acknowledge you have a problem which you are not willing to solve.,
Make sure you are sober when you go to work.,
Always keep your promises.,
Before you leave your home, apply fresh deodorant, brush your teeth and floss.,
Driving under the influence is very dangerous and people die as a result.,
Practice your speaking while drunk.,
Give your phone to someone else when you're drinking or put it where it's not easily accessible.,
Realize that when you feel ""buzzed"" your alcohol level is probably higher than the legal limit because you've built up a tolerance.,
When you get home from work, very quickly try to complete a few essential tasks related to keeping your job or the roof over your head.",How to Function in Life as an Alcoholic,";
, Going to work drunk can get you fired, or your professional accreditations revoked. Always make sure that you are sober at work.

, Even drunk promises... If you can remember what they are. People judge, and blackouts equal alcoholic.

, The major contributor to bad breath is remains of food stuck between your teeth. In addition to mouthwash, it is a pretty good idea to brush the tongue and soft palette to cleanse the breath. Cologne/perfume may be used, but in normal doses only. Excessive use will attract attention.

, ""I was drunk and didn't know what I was doing"" is not an excuse.

, Good luck! Others notice you slurring while you do not.

, This will help you avoid ""drunk dialing"" or ""drunk texting."" Also consider staying away from the computer to avoid e-mailing or instant messaging people while you're drunk. You may say things you don't want them to know or things you will otherwise regret saying.

, So, don't even consider driving when you're ""just a little buzzed""

, For example, quickly do your monthly rent transfer over the net, or quickly pen down a few solid points for an upcoming meeting at work. Do this over a ten or fifteen minute period whilst drinking a cup of coffee so that you delay hitting the bottle immediately, and get essential things done. Make it a non-negotiable rule that you need to pause in this way for twenty minutes when you get home from work each day."

Reflect on your reasons for drinking.,
Dress for the occasion.,
Get your team ready.,
Pick a good drinking spot.,
Set your limits ahead of time.,
Raise your glass.,
Eat something.,
Drink non-alcoholic beverages, too.,
Evaluate your symptoms.,
Do things that you enjoy.,

Consider the long-term dangers of drinking.,
Do not drink if you are underage.,
Consider your family's history with drinking.",How to Enjoy Being Drunk," You might be thinking, ""I don't need a reason to get drunk! Now, where's my bottle opener?"" But drunkenness is best experienced on a rare basis and mainly for celebratory reasons.


Perhaps you just got accepted into your top-choice grad program or earned a great promotion at work. If you have worked hard for something, then go ahead and celebrate (just don't make it a nightly or even weekly habit).
Don't drink to drown your sorrows. If you have just gotten dumped or are going through a major loss in life, alcohol will only make things worse as it is a depressant.;
, If you are planning to get roaring drunk, you should wear comfortable clothes that will be easy to navigate. If you are very drunk, you might find it hard to walk, so don't make this even harder with tall heels.


Wear clothes that will be easy to navigate when you go to the bathroom (which alcohol will make you frequently do). Consider donning an easy, one piece dress or a comfortable pair of jeans and a cute top. This is not the time to try out that complicated, one piece jumper. Dark clothes will also be preferable because they won't show stains from spills as easily.

, Do not get drunk at home alone in the dark. That's just sad. And research has shown that people who drink in groups generally make less risky decisions than when they drink individually. You should have supportive friends with you who are up for having a good time. Tell them ahead of time you plan to drink a little more than normal.
Don't bring that friend who always starts a fight when you're drinking or the one who talks at 10 decibels louder than normal. Most importantly, don't be that person yourself.
If you are drinking in public, make sure you have a safe way of getting home. One of your friends might be a designated driver, or you should plan to get a taxi/Uber ride home.

, Drinking at home has its advantages as it is generally cheaper and you won't have to worry about getting home after a long night out.


Try to drink in a place you are familiar with or in an area of town that you know well. This will help minimize any disorientation you might feel when you get drunk.
Organize a special night out. Is there a new bar or cocktail place you've been wanting to try? Don't just stumble into the first watering hole you come across. If you're going to get drunk, it should be at a place you enjoy.

, The number of drinks you can consume before experiencing the dangerous effects of alcohol depends on a number of factors, such as your height, weight, and gender.Even if you are drinking with the aim of getting tipsy, try not to exceed more than one drink per hour (especially if you will be drinking for more than a few hours).
Women generally shouldn't exceed more than 4 drinks in any single evening; men should not exceed more than 5 drinks. If you consume more than this, you are heading into dangerous ""binge"" territory and are likely to suffer unpleasant hangover consequences the next morning.
Keep in mind the following measurements for a drink. One beer = 12 oz; one glass of wine = 5oz; one drink of hard liquor = 1.5 oz.

, Your first drink should be something you can really enjoy and savor. Don't start off with a shot as this will throw off your pace for the night (one drink per hour). Instead, pick a beer you really love or try a new cocktail.


Enjoy your drink. Alcoholic drinks can have wonderful, complex flavors. If you drink them too quickly, you might miss out on this.

, It's never a good idea to drink on an empty stomach as this can prompt you to get too drunk too quickly (so you skip over that slightly buzzed phase and go straight to puking on the bathroom floor).Any food in the stomach will help mitigate the potential of a hangover, but there are a few things that can especially help. Alcohol depletes your body's store of Vitamin B-12, so you might want to eat foods that are rich in this, like hummus. Alcohol also diminishes the amount of salt and potassium, so consider eating a broth-based soup at dinner., If you know you will be drinking over the course of hours (for example, at dinner and then going out to a bar afterwards), be sure to also constantly drink water. This will help you keep a good pace with your drinking and lessen your risk of a hangover.

, A good, moderate level of drunkenness is when you generally feel carefree and relaxed, but still have a normal grasp on your surroundings.


If the room starts to spin or if you find you are having a hard time walking without bumping into things, sit down and stop drinking alcohol. Switch to water, eat a snack, and sit until you feel the effects of your last drink wear off. If nothing changes after an hour, you need to ask someone to help you get home.

, Alcohol is most enjoyable when you can associate it with other things you love. Maybe you really like to go dancing or listening to live music. Perhaps you love watching cheesy horror movies with your friends or playing party games. Do something so you're not just solely preoccupied with the next drink.

, Of course, your fun night out can quickly turn into a dangerous or illegal activity if you are not careful. Never drive when you have been drinking; if you get behind the wheel of a car, you could kill yourself or others.Drinking while you are pregnant can also cause harmful birth defects in the fetus.
Excessive drinking over a short period of time can also lead to alcohol poisoning. It can make the drinker fall into a coma or even lead to death., Chronic excessive drinking can lead to some very serious health concerns such as high blood pressure, heart disease and damage to the liver. It can also contribute to depression and anxiety.You should not drink excessively if any of these conditions are current health concerns for you.Talk to your doctor about the appropriate amount of drinks you can have each week.

, If all your friends drink, or if you are on a crowded college campus, underage drinking might seem normal to you. But you can be arrested and jailed for underage drinking. It's not worth jeopardizing your future.

, Alcoholism has been shown to have genetic links. If alcoholism runs in your family, be careful about drinking in any excessive way as you do not want to form a dependency on it."

Go classic with a hip flask.,
Paper-bag beers and pint bottles to keep them hidden in plain sight.,
Keep beer cans in a cozy.,
Hide your alcohol in other bottles.,
Put alcohol in a Camelbak, or other portable ""water"" container.,
Consider the ""wine rack."",
Hide booze in food bags.,
Mix your drink ahead of time.",How to Hide Alcohol1," The easiest way to make a small amount of liquor portable and keep it in your pocket, bag, or purse is to transfer it into a hip flask. These usually hold about 8 oz. of liquid, are available in stainless steel and other materials, and are relatively cheap to buy. They're usually made to fit comfortably in the interior jacket pocket of a men's coat.


To clean out a hip flask, rinse it with hot water and leave it open on the counter overnight to dry. Never put soap in a hip flask, because it can be very difficult to clean out thoroughly, and you might leave a soapy residue around for next shot of scotch.;
, If you want to sit in the park and enjoy an adult beverage, ask for a paper bag at the liquor store. In most places, it's illegal to drink in public, but ""brown-bagging"" a beverage is often enough to avoid giving police probable cause to search you, meaning–even though it's obvious what you've got in there–most police departments are happy to leave well enough alone and focus on other concerns as a departmental policy. Research the open container laws in your town to find out for sure.


Please note that this method involves negotiating a legal gray area. It's illegal in the United States to consume alcohol in public, technically, and many small-town cops might take pleasure in inventing probable cause to search you if you appear drunk or disorderly. If you want to brown-bag, you'll do so at a risk.

, Novelty beer cozies can help keep cans of beer cold, and also make them look an awful lot like cans of soda. Like brown-bags, cozies big enough to obscure the brand label on the can will keep people off your back if you want to have a few cold ones without hassle.


Make a soda can cozy to keep beers in. If you don't have a cozy, snip the top inch or so off of a soda can, slot your beer into it, and voila. It'll look like you're drinking Dr. Pepper.

, One of the best ways to mask the presence of alcohol and hide it in plain sight is to pour it into an inconspicuous bottle, then carry it as if it were water, soda, or some other beverage. No one need be the wiser. Opaque Nalgene bottles, or other all-purpose water bottles are perfect for hiding booze.


Put vodka, gin, and other clear spirits in water bottles. Make sure you leave the cap on at all times, when you're not drinking, to avoid the strong smell attracting attention.
Hide wine in Nalgenes, in fruit-drink bottles, or Vitamin Water containers. These colored liquids should look similar to the color and texture of wine, making it pass an initial eye test.

, CamelBaks are backpacks designed for hiking and transporting water, for hiding booze on the down-low. These can be excellent for porting any kind of illicit liquid. They usually feature a long rubber straw clipped to the shoulder-strap, which you can use to drink from.

, Similar to the Camelbak, the wine rack is so hidden it's under your clothes. A basic sports bra that features as much as 20 oz. of space to hide liquid, and an accompanying straw, the wine-rack is perfect if you don't mind drinking, uh, body-temperature booze from your own brassiere. They're commonly sold at places like Urban Outfitters and other novelty stores.

, While a bottle of Jack Daniels will draw glares if your'e in public, a bag of Doritos usually won't. If you're somewhere you can have a cooler and some food handy, use an empty bag of potato chips, or some other snack of choice, to cloak the bottle. Drape it over the liquor upside down, then cut a little hole in the bottom of the bag for the neck to fit through. No one walking by your picnic will be the wiser., One of the best ways to hide alcohol in plain sight is mixing up a mixed drink like a rum and coke, or a whiskey and ginger, but doing it in the can or bottle of the soda you're using as a mixer. The color will be basically the same, the smell won't be as strong, and you'll be able to bring sodas with you into most places.


This works just as well for fountain drinks. If you've got a Big Gulp going, spike it and enjoy your mixed drink without hassle.

Educate yourself.,
Sustain your support.,
Avoid certain behaviors.,
Don’t take things personally.,
Be available to listen.,
Express honesty.,
Offer to help.,
Handle crisis situations.,
Set limits.,
Stage an intervention.",How to Help an Alcoholic Who Doesn't Want Help," Addiction is a chronic problem that leads to poor decision making and problems at home, work, and social life.Many addicts think they can control their behavior yet struggle to do so. They may actively seek escape from stress or worries of life and may not know how else to cope outside of alcohol.


Alcoholics are not bad people, they are people who struggle to cope with daily life.
Before you decide to help someone, consider whether they show signs of being an alcoholic. These may include trying to cut back and not being able to, spending a lot of time drinking or recovering from hangovers, engaging in risky behaviors due to drinking, having issues with family and friends because of their drinking, or having to drink more than they used to.The effect of alcohol is biphasic, which means that when BAC (blood alcohol concentration) levels are rising, the stimulant properties of alcohol are more pronounced; when BAC levels are falling, the depressant effects of alcohol are more pronounced. When you are approaching a person who has been drinking they likely will have two different reactions: they may feel positive and stimulated when BAC is rising and may feel alone, depressed, or even suicidal when BAC is dropping.;
, Affirm any positive choices they make. Point out positive behaviors and steps forward the person makes, even if it doesn’t involve treatment. Stay positive in your interactions with the person. Let the person know that they can count on you for support and positive feedback.


Recovery is often an ongoing process. Even if the person agrees to get help, they may change their mind or experience slip-ups. Support the person in their ups and downs, and support them attending meetings, treatment, and support groups., If someone has made it clear to you that they do not want help, don’t force the issue. Don’t constantly bring up conversations about alcohol. Don’t pressure the person, either. While you may interpret the situation as dire, the person may still be in denial about their problems, and your pressuring will likely make them feel more justified in their actions.While it can be difficult to engage with someone who is resistant to help, don’t avoid the person, either. It may be easier to remove yourself from their life, but you may want to be available for when they are ready to talk.
Instead of getting down on the person, say, “We care about you and want you to get help.”

, If the person makes yet another broken promise or lies to you, don’t take it personally.Especially if the person is irrational while using, don’t get upset or fight with the person. Alcohol can change the person’s behavior and make them act in ways that aren’t congruent at all times.


Remind yourself that you love this person and that they are not in a position to be rational.

, Be available to listen when this person needs a friend.Even if the person does not want help now, they may want some support in the future. Let them know that while you don’t approve of their alcoholism that you are available to talk and listen if they need it.


Communicate that you are willing to be a friend when they need friendship.

, Share your thoughts and feelings honestly with the addicted person, letting them know how you feel. Put the focus on you and not on them, as this can cause guilt or shame. For example, instead of saying, “You’re destroying yourself and making bad decisions” say, “I don’t get to see you anymore, which makes me sad. I miss having you as a part of my life.” Let the person know you are worried and are impacted by their drinking.Express your willingness to be supportive as well. Say, “I really don’t like how alcohol has impacted our relationship. While this is painful for me, I want to support you because I care about you.”

, If the person expresses interest in seeking treatment, offer to help them however you can.Help them look up treatment facilities, detoxification programs, support groups, or whatever else they are interested in exploring. Offer to drive them to appointments or support them in certain life changes.


If the person isn’t quite ready for help, make one offer, then wait for them to ask you. If you constantly offer help, the person may become off-put by you and your good intentions.
Get informed on local resources for alcohol addiction. For example, look up community groups for alcoholism, treatment specialists, and treatment programs. That way, you can be ready to share information with the person., If the person is a danger to themselves or others, call emergency services immediately.The person may be acting recklessly or endangering their life or the lives of others. If this is the case, get help immediately. Even if the person does not want help, immediate intervention may be necessary.


In the USA, call 911; in England, call 999; in Australia call 000.

, If this person’s behavior negatively impacts your life, be clear in setting limits for what is and is not acceptable. For example, do not lie on behalf of the person. Tell the person not to call you or come to your home if they have been drinking. Let them know that you will not give them money under any circumstance.Communicate whatever limits feel appropriate to you.


While it’s difficult to watch someone you care about be destructive, do not enable the person’s behavior. Decide how you will be in the person’s life and make clear boundaries for your role.

, Interventions can be a highly effective way of showing the addict that they have a problem and that people are concerned about them. They can help the addict realize that there is a problem and who people care. An intervention can also provide hope by outlining treatment options and facilities available to the person.While some interventions may be beneficial in a one-to-one setting, having the presence of many people who love and care about the person can be impactful.


Meet with an intervention specialist to help you plan and carry out an effective intervention.

Get past the gate.,
Act natural.,
Use code words with your friends.,
Take care of your trash.,
Try to drink at an odd hour.,
Go early to your event.",How to Hide Alcohol2," If you want to sneak some alcohol into an event, or into a location that you're not supposed to have it, your first goal will be getting through the door. This will vary, depending on the venue itself, but there are a few tips to keep in mind to avoid getting caught before you can even get your drink on. Please note that sneaking alcohol into places where it is forbidden can get you kicked out of school or in trouble with the authorities. Do so at your own risk.


To get past the security guard or gate at a dorm, hide booze in a backpack, a packing box, or at the bottom of a big bag of groceries. If you can, split up beers into multiple bags, to avoid that noticeable clinking and clanking. If you're in a big group, split up, and look grim and humorless, not as if you're about to party on the down-low.To get booze into the movie theatre, pick something that won't have a strong smell, mixing some liquor into a big bottle of soda or bringing some wine in other sorts of bottles, and sneaking them in purses. Cans or bottles of beer make noise challenges, as well as an awkward trash situation at the end, and straight liquor will have your neighbors crinkling their noses.
To get alcohol into a festival or music venue and drink on the cheap, it's important to figure out the security beforehand. Often, bags and purses will be searched, and outside drinks will be confiscated, making the vodka water bottle a no-go. Most venues and festivals, however, won't frisk people or search people hard, not carrying bags, so it's a better idea to go the hip-flask route.

, If you're drinking somewhere you're not supposed to, the number one rule of the day is to chill out. No loud, thumping bass in the dorm room, no yelling while passing the flask down the aisle at the movie, and no conspicuous swigs from your illicit bottle snuck into the concert. Unless you want to get kicked out, you've got to treat it like business as usual.


Ask super-drunk or loud-drunk friends to leave, and cut them off. Aside from being irritating, conspicuous drunks are much more likely to get you caught and attract attention. Make a quiet and calm affair, not a raucous party.

, If you're drinking in a friend's basement or dorm room and need to keep the boozy chatter to a minimum, invent code words to use so no wandering resident assistants, nosy neighbors, or little brothers will hear the buzzwords. Instead of shot, say you're going to take a button, or call a beer a biohazard. It'll be fun, and you'll keep it safe.

, Sneaking booze into the dry zones is all fun and good until someone leaves a wizard staff of PBR cans out on the floor in plain sight. Whoops. Make sure to keep close tabs on all the garbage and dirty glasses that come from a night of drinking. Cups reeking of vodka are just as likely to get you caught as an empty bottle.


If you're in the dorm, try to keep some black plastic garbage bags lying around for just the occasion. You won't have to worry about sneaking out bottles a few at a time if you've got an opaque bag to sneak them out in plain sight.

, Sneaking a couple beers into the movie theatre, or having a beer bash in your dorm room will be a lot easier if you're doing it during matinee hours, or a Tuesday, as opposed to prime time on a Saturday night. Busy, packed theaters are much more likely to get you caught, and the RA is probably a lot more likely to be on alert during party hours, ready to crash yours. Stay ahead of the game and do it when they'll least expect it.

, Some events will have their door security start only when things start to get busier. Going early can have things go more smoothly."

Consider your options.,
Hide alcohol in the toilet tank.,
Hide it behind books in your bookcase.,
Stuff bottles in your shoes.,
Hide it at the bottom of your laundry.,
Learn the habits of the person who's looking.",How to Hide Alcohol3," Sometimes you might need to hide a quick bottle or two from some judgmental person, but sometimes it might be you who needs to open your eyes and look around. If you're taking steps to hide alcohol in your own home, this can be a sign of a serious drinking problem. If you're struggling with alcohol dependence, stop hiding it, admit you have a problem, and seek help immediately. Hiding alcohol won't help in the long run.

, A cool and out of the way hiding spot for a bottle or two of booze? Try the toilet tank. The water that comes into the back of the tank is clean, meaning you won't have to worry about germs, and as long as your toilet is running properly, most people are unlikely to open up the tank to take a look.


You can tie the neck of the bottle to the ball joint in the toilet, to keep it from rattling around much. Make sure the toilet still functions properly, or you'll get caught more quickly.

, If you've got a lot of books or DVDs lined up, slip a few bottles behind them, and pull the books to the front of the shelf to create enough space. It's good feng shui anyway.

, Winter boots, Uggs, and cowboy boots are perfectly shaped for slotting illicit bottles into. If you've got a lot of shoes, you can sneak a bottle or two into them and keep them at the back of your closet for safe-keeping. Just remember where you put them, so you won't jam your foot in accidentally.

, Most RAs will be unlikely to dig through your dirty laundry to look for contraband. If you need a good place to slip a bottle, try the bottom of the dirty clothes hamper. As long as your'e the one who does your laundry, it's a solid hiding place.

, If you need to hide booze in your house, try to get a read on the person doing the searching. If an RA comes knocking every Wednesday, don't worry about finding a hiding place, just get the booze out of there before Wednesday. Problem solved. If your mom cleans your room, start cleaning it yourself so you won't have to worry about being straightened up on.

Tolerance occurs when your body becomes accustomed to consuming a certain amount of alcohol with recurring frequency, meaning you may need six drinks instead of three or four to feel intoxicated.Do you find that you need to drink more alcohol to experience the same effects?
Take note of how much you drink on a given occasion, and on how many occasions you drink in a given week.
The good news is that you can decrease your alcohol tolerance and its subsequent health risks fairly easily on your own. You can do this by either moderating the quantity and frequency of your alcohol consumption, or taking a break from alcohol altogether for a few weeks.;
, There are many health risks associated with alcohol abuse. These health problems may be physical, mental/emotional, or both. Talk to a qualified medical professional if you've experienced any of the following as a result of drinking alcohol:


nausea
vomiting
diarrhea
excessive sweating
mood swings
depression
anxiety
insomnia
chronic fatigue
blackouts (not remembering what you said/did while drinking)
high-risk behavior
frequent falls, injuries, and accidents
other substance abuse problems (including heavy tobacco use)
seizures
tachycardia (abnormally rapid heart rate), After health problems, social problems may be one of the most prevalent effects in your life if you have a drinking problem. Some of these may not be immediately noticeable to you, but they will most likely be noticeable to your friends, relatives, and coworkers. Assess your social and professional relationships to determine if you've ever experienced any of the following:


traffic accidents
workplace-related problems (performance problems, tardiness/missed work, etc.)
family and domestic problems
interpersonal violence, Many people with alcohol problems eventually face legal repercussions as a result of their drinking. You might be ticketed or arrested for public intoxication, carrying an open container in public, urinating in public, driving under the influence, or even engaging in violence because of your drinking. All of these citations/crimes can have serious repercussions on your ability to drive or be qualified for certain job opportunities.


Have you ever been arrested or ticketed by police for actions you committed while under the influence of alcohol?
Has anyone ever brought a lawsuit against you for actions you committed while under the influence? This may include property damage, harassment, or acts of violence.
Have you been through court-mandated alcohol counseling and/or rehabilitation?

, Some people who abuse or misuse alcohol can reduce their alcohol consumption to a safe, responsible level. However, many individuals with more serious alcohol problems, including dependence/addiction, will need to give up alcohol entirely. Only a qualified medical expert can advise you on whether it's safe for you to drink alcohol responsibly in the future, or whether you should quit altogether. If you are told by a medical expert that it is safe for you to drink in the future without risk of alcohol abuse problems, it's imperative that you drink responsibly and in moderation.Set drinking limits for yourself.
Count your drinks and monitor your drinking behavior.
Try switching to drinks with less alcohol, slowing down your pace of drinking, or spacing your drinks further apart.
Alternate alcoholic beverages with nonalcoholic beverages. Try drinking a glass of water (slowly) after you've finished an alcoholic beverage, and wait until you've finished your water before ordering another drink.
Don't overindulge. The U.S. government recommends limiting yourself to no more than one or two drinks per day in order to maintain a safe level for alcohol consumption.Never drink and drive. Have a designated driver or plan on an alternate transportation method, such as walking or taking a taxi.
Limit your weekly drinking habits. Stick to 9 or fewer drinks per week for women, or 14 or fewer drinks per week for men.
Consider quitting alcohol altogether. Even though abusing alcohol is not necessarily the same as an alcohol dependency/addiction, abuse can quickly lead to those and other health problems over time.

, Many people may not realize that they are at risk of developing an alcohol addiction before ever consuming a single drink. Your genetics and family history play a huge role in your potential risks of developing an addiction to alcohol, and it's important to have a serious talk with your doctor to determine your risks.People with mood disorders or mental health problems, such as depression and anxiety, are at a higher risk of developing a drinking problem.
Low self-esteem and/or feeling ""out of place"" are commonly associated risk factors for developing problems with alcohol.
Anyone with parents who had alcohol dependency/addiction is at a very high risk of developing a drinking problem.

, Most people do not become an alcoholic after their first drink. Problems with alcohol tend to come on much more gradually, which can make it all the more difficult to observe yourself sliding from one stage to the next. Learning the stages of alcohol use disorder can help you better assess where you are on the spectrum and what your potential risk might be at a given point in time.Stage one is having access to alcohol. In this stage, it's important to minimize the risk factors that make you more likely to use/abuse alcohol.
Stage two is experimentation with or occasional-to-weekly use of alcohol. This stage may involve binge drinking, drinking on a regular basis, or both.
Stage three involves an increase in the frequency of alcohol use. In this stage, a person with a developing alcohol use disorder may drink daily or almost daily, and may begin stealing to acquire alcohol.
Stage four is marked by an established and consistently frequent consumption of alcohol. People in this stage tend to become preoccupied with drinking/intoxication and are likely to experience social, educational, vocational, or family problems caused by drinking.
Stage five is the final and most serious stage of alcohol use disorder. In this stage a person only feels normal while drinking and is highly likely to engage in risk-taking behaviors.

, The biggest test to determine if you're dependent or addicted to alcohol is evaluating how much you drink alcohol and how often. The World Health Organization has developed an assessment called the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) for medical professionals around the world to evaluate how advanced an individual's drinking problem might be. Talk to a qualified medical professional about your results to determine if you have a drinking problem and are in need of treatment.How often do you have a drink containing alcohol? (Answer: never, monthly, two to four times a month, two to three times a week, or four+ times a week.)
How many drinks containing alcohol do you have on a typical day when you're drinking? (Answer: 1 or 2, 3 or 4, 5 or 6, 7 to 9, or 10+.)
How often do you have six or more drinks on a single occasion? (Answer: never, less than monthly, monthly, weekly, or almost daily.)
How often in the last year have you been unable to stop drinking once you'd started? (Answer: never, less than monthly, monthly, weekly, or almost daily.)
How often in the last year did you fail to do what was expected of you because of drinking? (Answer: never, less than monthly, monthly, weekly, or almost daily.)
How often during the last year have you needed a drink in the morning after a night of heavy drinking? (Answer: never, less than monthly, monthly, weekly, or almost daily.)
How often during the last year have you felt guilt or remorse after drinking? (Answer: never, less than monthly, monthly, weekly, or almost daily.)
How often during the last year have you been unable to remember what happened while you were drinking? (Answer: never, less than monthly, monthly, weekly, or almost daily.)
Have you or someone else been injured because of your drinking? (Answer: never, yes but not in the last year, or yes during the last year.)
Has a relative, friend, or health care worker been concerned about your drinking and advised you to cut back? (Answer: never, yes but not in the last year, or yes during the last year.)Talk to a medical professional about your results to see whether treatment is right for you.
If you answered ""almost daily"" to any of the above questions or answered that someone has been injured because of your drinking, seek treatment immediately.

, Withdrawal symptoms occur when your body has become so accustomed to consuming alcohol that it exhibits physical reactions to the sudden lack of alcohol when you quit drinking. You may have a serious alcohol dependency or addiction if you've ever experienced any of the following:


nervousness
nausea
shaking/tremors
cold sweats
hallucinations
seizures, If you've experienced withdrawal symptoms, drink in excess and on frequent occasions, or recognize that you have advanced in the stages of alcohol use disorder, you probably have a serious drinking problem. The first step to getting help and seeking treatment is to admit that you have a problem and that that problem is affecting your life in negative ways.


Recognize that the problems caused by your drinking will only increase and get worse without treatment.
There is no shame in admitting that you have a drinking problem, but that admission has to come from you. Though others may try, ultimately no one else can make you realize you have a drinking problem.
As with any addiction, admitting you have a problem is the first step on the road to recovery.

, Detoxification (also called detox) will help you manage your withdrawal symptoms until your body becomes used to functioning without alcohol or drugs. A detox program is typically held in a medical facility and will incorporate close monitoring, medical support, and may include prescription medications.Chlordiazepoxide (Librium) or clonazepam (Klonopin) are often prescribed during detox to reduce the symptoms of withdrawal.
You may also be prescribed Naltrexone (Trexan, Revia, or Vivitrol). This medication decreases your cravings for alcohol by blocking your body's euphoric response to alcohol consumption.Similar to Naltrexone, Disulfiram (Antabuse) reduces cravings by actually producing a negative reaction to drinking.
Medications like Acamprosate (Campral) can help reduce future cravings in people who have already stopped drinking but are at risk of a relapse.
Find a detox program near you by searching online or checking your local phone book.
You can ask your primary care physician to recommend a good detox program near you.
If you don't have a doctor, you can call or visit your local hospital and ask someone there for information on detox programs near you.

, Psychotherapy may be recommended in conjunction with detox or instead of it. Only a qualified medical expert can properly evaluate your level of alcohol abuse and determine the best course of action for you. However, psychotherapy has very high results because it gives you the tools to continue living a sober, healthy lifestyle after you've completed rehab/detox treatment.One-on-one or group substance abuse counseling - focuses on short-term behavioral goals to help discontinue alcohol use altogether.
Cognitive-behavioral therapy - teaches you how to recognize what factors tend to precede and follow instances of alcohol use to avoid or better cope with those factors.
Motivational enhancement therapy - encourages you to want to participate in therapy by setting goals, outlining the risks of not staying in therapy, and showing you the rewards for success.
Stimulus control therapy - teaches you to avoid situations, activities, and people associated with alcohol use and replace those factors with more positive, healthy activities/situations.
Urge control therapy - helps you change the patterns of behavior that might otherwise lead to relapsing alcohol use.
Relapse prevention therapy - teaches you methods for recognizing problem behaviors and correcting/amending those problems.
Social control therapy - involves family members to help prevent them from enabling alcohol use/abuse.
You can find psychotherapy options in your area by searching online, checking the phone book, or asking your primary care physician for a recommendation/referral.

, There is a high incidence of relapse among recovering alcoholics. This is not a sign of weakness or failure; rather, it's simply a fact of addiction, which is a medical ailment. If you are at risk of relapsing, it's important that you take steps to build a support network and avoid situations involving alcohol in the future.Approximately 70% of people with alcoholism who complete treatment are able to decrease or eliminate their alcohol consumption and improve their health within six months.
Most people with moderate to severe alcohol-use disorder who complete treatment end up having one or more relapse during the first 12 months after treatment.
Recognize that alcoholism is a life-long disorder that requires continued effort and support.
Having a relapse does not mean that you've failed or that you're weak, but it's important to re-commit to sobriety after you relapse.
Be patient and dedicated, and seek support from family and friends.

, If you've committed to quit drinking for good, it's important to enlist the support of your friends and family members. These people closest to you will be your strongest support network, as they know you and they know your history.


Inform your family/friends of your decision to live a sober lifestyle. Ask them to avoid having/using alcohol around you, and make sure they never offer you an alcoholic beverage.
Ask your family and friends to give you words of support and encouragement. You should also ask them to withhold any criticism or negative judgments.
Ask your family to hold off on giving you new demands or responsibilities until your life is more stable and you've settled into a sober lifestyle. Stress can easily trigger a desire to resume drinking in a recently-sober person.
Educate your friends and family on what your former triggers were that led you to drink, and ask them to help you avoid the people, places, and situations most likely to cause a relapse.
Find new and rewarding ways to spend your time that don't involve alcohol, and invite your family/friends to join you in these new hobbies and social groups., Support groups can help you bond with others who have recovered (or are currently recovering) from addiction. These groups create a safe space in which you can talk about the temptations to drink, recall the problems caused by your drinking, and ultimately remember why you've committed to living an alcohol-free life. You may need to try out several different support groups before you find one that feels comfortable and helps you, so don't give up if you don't fit in with the very first group. Keep trying and remain patient. Some of the most common support groups include:


Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) - 212-870-3400 (check your phone book or search online for local chapters)
Moderation Management (check your phone book or search online for local chapters)
Secular Organizations for Sobriety - 323-666-4295

Friends and family members are likely to be more forthcoming than about the person's drinking habits, so request to tag along during the visit and, if prompted, offer your perspective to the doctor.


An alcoholic may only be willing to tell their doctor part of the problem. Without all of the information, their doctor may have difficulty developing a treatment plan. When the doctor is able to see the full scope of your loved one's addiction, your loved one is more likely to receive the help they need.Tell your loved one something like, ""I know this is hard for you, but I think it would be a great idea if you saw a doctor. I can join you and be your advocate in this situation.""
Doctors often assess for alcoholism using the CAGE acronym. CAGE stands for a series of questions that the doctor asks to see if alcohol is a problem. These questions include:

C= Do you feel a need to cut down?
A= Do you ever get angry from consuming alcohol?
G= Do you have feelings of guilt after drinking?
E= Do you need an eye opener in the AM?

;
, Your loved one's physician may perform tests to determine what damage the body has suffered as a result of the drinking. These can range from bloodwork to a psychological examination to imaging. After running the necessary tests, the doctor may also recommend treatment options, resources, and information about how to stop drinking., Once your loved one has seen a doctor it will be necessary to decide on a course of action for treatment. Help your loved one decide which alcohol treatment option is best for their case. The two types of treatment are generally inpatient or outpatient.


Typically, inpatient detox involves staying at a facility and receiving treatment and support 24/7 for weeks or even months. Outpatient treatment is often available through hospitals, mental health clinics, and the like, and offer support and encouragement. Attendance requirements often vary.No matter which type of treatment your loved one chooses, detoxification generally lasts between 2 and 7 days. During this time, your loved one will be under the supervision of a healthcare team that is experienced with treating alcohol use disorder. In treatment, your loved one will take medication that minimizes withdrawal symptoms, receive education about alcohol treatment, and learn behavioral techniques to manage cravings., Understand that quitting alcohol isn’t a quick fix. Battling cravings and addiction may be something your loved one has to do for their entire life. Your support is needed to help them stay clean.


Suggest that your loved one attend a support group, undergo individual or group therapy, or take medications. A combination of these approaches may be required for your loved one to stay clean from alcohol for the long term.If you offer to take part in therapy, this can also be influential in your loved one's treatment. For example, if you are in a romantic relationship with the person undergoing detox, couple's therapy may be beneficial. Family therapy is a sensible choice for relatives of an alcoholic. Show your loved one just how committed you are by participating in the treatment process.
Offer to stay with your friend or family member for a short time to help out with household responsibilities and to help them resist cravings for alcohol.

, Realize that abstaining from alcohol without a team of medical professionals to help is not only extremely difficult, but can be dangerous as well. Since the craving to drink is so intense, not having encouragement can make falling back into the habit easy. Encourage your loved one to get professional help first.


Additionally, heavy drinkers can suffer through extreme withdrawal symptoms, and not having a medical professional around while experiencing these symptoms could be life-threatening.Patients can suffer from a condition called Delirium Tremens, which is a psychotic condition that is typical during withdrawal in chronic alcoholics.
Patients can also suffer from seizures and should be on anti-seizure prophylaxis like benzodiazepine.

, An important step in preparing for and committing to alcohol detox is limiting your loved one's access to alcohol. Throw away any alcohol in them home, or even any products that may contain alcohol, such as perfume or mouthwash.


Not only does doing so prevent the person from having access to alcohol, but it can also keep them safe. Certain detox medications can have dangerous reactions to alcohol. Your loved one's doctor may even require them to breathe into a breathalyzer periodically while taking detox medication, and having even a slight bit of alcohol in their system can skew the results., Know that detox may be the most difficult thing your loved one will ever experience. They can't do it alone, and neither can you. Call in reinforcements. Ask friends and family to help you support them through this process, especially during detox, when they may need someone around to offer supervision and ensure they aren’t experiencing life-threatening reactions.Building a support team gives you the opportunity to delegate responsibilities as you help your loved one detox from alcohol. Having more hands on deck may also help you prevent their old drinking buddies, if any, from coming over as well as stop your loved one from visiting them during this vulnerable time.
Alcoholics may have to change their social circles completely. In a lot of cases, alcoholics hang around other addicts and alcoholics; therefore, a change in support might be necessary to avoid relapse.

, Whether from people or places, your loved one will need accountability from you to support their sobriety long-term. Suggest that they tell friends about their decision, and avoid spending time with people who drink. Also, they should stay away from places where they used to drink or businesses that sell alcohol.Tell your loved one, “If you want to stay clean, you may have to take a break from your friendship with Carlos for a while. Are there any sober friends that I can call over for you?”

, Understand that your loved one's body will suffer a great deal of turmoil during the detox process, so helping them take care of themselves can make the experience more manageable.


Recommend that they eat light foods that are easy on the stomach and have water or sports drinks that contain electrolytes to stay hydrated and fend off nausea or vomiting.
Alcoholics should take folate and thiamine supplements to reverse damage and prevent Megaloblastic Anemia and Wernicke's Encephalopathy, respectively.
Exercising may also provide a welcome distraction during detox. Join in with your loved one on a walk or run in order to help manage your own stress., Educate yourself on how the brain and body responds to long-term alcohol use. Knowing the scientific and biological process that your loved one's body is experiencing may help you understand why they feel the way they do when abstaining from alcohol.


Excessive daily drinking disrupts the brain’s neurotransmitters: the brain chemicals that transmit messages. When drinkers stop drinking, the neurotransmitters that were suppressed aren’t anymore, and the body often responds with serious and unpleasant effects., Know that when your loved one stops drinking, their body will likely respond negatively for a few days to a few weeks. Not everyone experiences all of the symptoms, but many who go through detox do.


The signs and symptoms of alcohol withdraw include vomiting, seizing, sweats, tremors, anxiety, hallucination, paranoia, agitation, and nausea.Seek immediate emergency care if your loved one is experiencing severe symptoms of withdrawal. Talk to your loved one’s doctor about a prescription for benzodiazepine to help prevent seizures.

, Understand that some who stop drinking alcohol, especially those who have been drinking heavily for a decade or longer, are prone to developing delirium tremens. About 10 percent of those who experience DTs may die.


Symptoms of this reaction include grand mal seizures, intense hallucinations, severe agitation and confusion in addition to elevated blood pressure, pulse, and temperature.If you notice symptoms of DT, take your loved one to the hospital immediately.

, Use a calm tone of voice and speak to him without using harsh or derogatory words.For instance, avoid calling him “drunk” or an alcoholic in the moment. Avoid arguing with him and instead deflect the statements in a calm and assertive way.


If he starts to become angry or wanting to fight, calmly respond that now is not a good time, and that you can talk about it later.
Avoid arguing with him at all costs. He may become physical. Don’t respond back in anger, no matter how hard it is.

, Instead of deterring him away from alcohol, steer him toward food and non-alcoholic drinks.Encourage him to eat or to hydrate with water. Distract him with these things so that he is less focused on the alcohol.


When he asks for alcohol, deflect by offering him soda.

, If he insists on having something or going somewhere, find a compromise.It isn’t worth arguing with him because he isn’t thinking clearly, yet you don’t want to escalate the agitation. Find something that will make him happy without making you unhappy.


If he really wants to eat ice cream but you have none, offer him candy or another sweet treat.
If he wants to go outside in the pouring rain, tell him firmly that it’s raining and perhaps he can bring an umbrella or stand under an awning.

, If the alcoholism is negatively affecting you, set limits with your husband.Be clear that no discussions about you as a couple can happen when he drinks, and you refuse to try to solve problems while he’s under the influence.


Tell him he cannot drink in the home or around the children. You can choose not to spend time with him when he is drinking, or that you refuse to argue when he has been drinking.
Set limits based off of your own needs. When you set limits, communicate them with your husband and make sure he understands them.

, If your husband is drunk, acting aggressively, and you fear for your safety, have an escape plan. Have someone you can call late at night that can offer you a safe place to stay. If you are scared to leave with the car, ask your friend or family member to pick you up at your home. Calmly let your husband know that you are seeking a safe place for the night and will return the next day.


If your husband becomes angry, say that you can have the discussion later. Right now, you are prioritizing your safety.

, Chances are, you’ll feel uneasy bringing up this topic and talking it over with your husband. Don’t let the fear of discomfort dissuade you from expressing what you need to say. Remember that your current situation also makes you uncomfortable.Accept that discussing your husband’s alcoholism is going to feel uncomfortable, no matter what. Be brave and take the step.

, Don’t try to have this conversation when he is drinking or about to drink. Instead, choose a time when both of you are sober.Make time to have this discussion and not have things to rush off to afterward.


Don’t try to talk about the alcoholism when you are angry or upset. If you become frustrated when he opens a can of beer, now is not the time to have this discussion.
Wait until both of you are in a calm and neutral state before opening the discussion. You may need to schedule time to talk.

, While it may be way easier to come from a place of judgment, anger, and disappointment, be compassionate. You are not chastising your husband, you are asking him to get help, for the betterment of himself and his family.Communicate your love, concern, and support to your husband.

, You may feel second best to alcohol when your husband turns to drinking before turning to you. You may even feel like you cannot compete with the relationship your husband has with alcohol.While your husband may support your family financially, tell him if you feel like you feel under-supported emotionally or with the family. If you feel difficulty in emotionally connected, tell him this, too.


Be honest with your feelings and disappointments.
Say how the drinking not only affects you, but others as well, like kids, friends, or family., Instead of blaming onto your husband for his drinking, state your feelings.Keep statements focused on you and your feelings, not on him. Instead of saying, “Drinking makes you distant and detached” say, “It hurts me that you feel so far from me, and I miss the connection we shared.”


Instead of saying, “You don’t spend any time with the kids” say, “I’m struggling to give the kids all the attention they need on my own and I’d like your help.”

, Let your husband know that you love and support him, and want to see him healthy and happy. Ask him to seek treatment for his alcoholism.You can say that alcoholism is difficult to treat alone, and that seeking treatment will help both him and you deal with the alcoholism. Benefits of treatment include addressing psychological problems and addiction behaviors that interfere with living a happy, fulfilling life.


You may want to do some research ahead of time to discuss different treatment options. Call your insurance and see what treatment programs are available. Check into an individual or family therapist, inpatient, and outpatient programs so that you can discuss all options with your husband.
You can stage a formal intervention, including friends, family, and other people that care about your husband. You can seek the support of an interventionist if need be. Be careful, however, as interventions can send your husband into anger or defensiveness., You may want to hear how he will stop drinking, that his harmful action will never happen again, and that he wants to change. This may all be true, but it also can be a way to escape an uncomfortable conversation. Create a plan after both of you have had time to digest the discussion and reflect.After your initial conversation, plan a time to discuss things further, once you’ve both had time to reflect on the first discussion. You can meet back up and discuss action steps to take as a couple, such as ridding the house of alcohol.

, If you’re upset after trying to talk to your husband only to get nowhere, take heart. See your words, actions, and support as stepping stones to your husband acknowledging his addiction and seeking recovery.However, keep in mind that you cannot control his actions and he is ultimately responsible for his decisions.

, It’s common for alcoholics (especially high functioning alcoholics) to have loads of excuses for their behavior suggesting that there is no problem with alcohol. Instead of trying to fight the denial with rationality, approach your husband by compassionately opening a dialog of your concerns.If he denies having a problem, gently tell him how he disrupts your (or the kids’) sleeping at night, is aggressive or mean, or any other ways that his alcoholism affects you.

, If your husband continues to drink even when he knows it causes you harm, tell him that is drinking is interfering with your relationship. His relationship with alcohol affects your ability to have a relationship with him. If you tell your husband clearly that the drinking creates distance in the relationship, it may impact him and you., Make sure you take care of yourself. Have people in your life you can talk to and that support you. Don’t keep your husband’s alcoholism a secret; make sure you have at least person you can talk to about your struggles. Having emotional support is important when dealing with life’s difficulties.Talk to your parents, siblings, friends, or in-laws. Don’t just focus on the alcoholism, but make sure you have people to talk to about whatever you may need to talk about.

, If your husband refuses to get help and you have serious doubts that things will get better, you may want to consider your relationship and ask yourself if staying with him is in your best interest. If you feel like you’re married more to the alcohol than to a man, it’s time to consider your options. You may want to consider your quality of life, your safety and the safety of your children when making this decision, and ask yourself “what is my best option in which I respect myself and my family?”


If your husband is abusive, prioritize your safety. You deserve to be treated with respect at all times, and abusers rarely stop the abuse, as the abuse can become cyclical., When you drink around your husband, it may make it much more difficult for him to quit.Avoid consuming alcohol in the presence of your husband at all costs. Instead, attend non-alcoholic social events. Request family or friend get-togethers to be sober occasions.


You may need to change social plans or social groups a bit. Instead of going to bars or sipping on wine with friends, have more game nights or movie nights. Engage in activities that don’t typically serve alcohol.

, Groups like Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) exist to help support people struggling with alcoholism. Members stress the importance of senior members supporting the newer people to the group by providing support and mentorship. Check out http://www.aa.org to see if there is a chapter near you.

, You more than anyone else know how hard it is to live with an alcoholic husband. It can be hard to feel like you have to keep the house and family together on your own with little or no help of your husband. It can be a relief to share your frustrations with other people who know exactly what it feels like. They can also support you and give you advice on how to cope, and how they got through the tough times.


Al-Anon (http://http://www.al-anon.org/) is a nationally recognized support group that offers family support to those who have a family member who is an alcoholic.

, If your husband is hesitant to get his own therapy, mention that getting therapy together would be helpful to both of you, or that you want family therapy. A therapist can help with treatment and recovery, and provide support to both you and your husband throughout the process. You can obtain a referral through your primary care physician or through your insurance provider.You may want to seek out a therapist who specializes in addiction or alcoholism. Therapy may include dealing with underlying causes of addiction, working through stressors in a more positive way, and may also include medication.

, A treatment center is beneficial for more intense alcoholism or when alcoholism is coupled with a psychiatric diagnosis (such as depression or anxiety) or a medical diagnosis. Programs exist through inpatient and outpatient treatment, which may vary based on your insurance coverage.Choose the level of care most appropriate for your your family and your husband. If your husband has experienced severe stress or trauma or has a psychiatric illness, a treatment center may be better suited than outpatient weekly therapy.

, Enact a plan to handle any potential relapse.It’s common for someone who struggles with alcoholism to feel tempted or to relapse during recovery. Agree upon a plan with your husband and/our his treatment team to have a plan ready to go if your husband relapses.


This may include removing him from the situation or calling his therapist or mentor.

, When your husband does engage in treatment and makes growth, acknowledge each step that is taken.If you see him making an effort, praise it. Find all the good things he is doing and make sure he knows that you recognize the good work he is doing.


Celebrate even the smallest steps forward. Be your husband’s cheerleader and let him know you’re behind him all the way.

Rehydrate.,
Take a painkiller.,
Eat crackers, toast, or other mild-flavored carbohydrates.,
Don't drink alcohol to cure a hangover.",How to Cure a Hangover1," Hangovers are a sign that your body is extremely dehydrated.Staying hydrated will alleviate the headaches, dizziness, and lightheadedness that result from a hangover. It is especially important to load up on fluids if you are vomiting.


Drink plenty of water.
Drink coconut water and/or sports drinks, both of which are rich in electrolytes. Most headaches secondary to alcohol consumption are caused by both dehydration and an imbalance of electrolytes. Specifically, sodium balanced by magnesium, calcium, and potassium are vital for a happy-feeling brain. Look at the ingredients list for magnesium and calcium salts and choose a sports drink that will not only rehydrate you, but also provide the nutrients that your alcoholic beverages have stripped from you.
Avoid coffee or caffeinated teas. Many people drink coffee in order to ""wake up"" from a hangover, but the caffeine will only make matters worse by further dehydrating you.
Try ginger ale. If you're feeling nauseated, the ginger helps calm your stomach.;
, Avoid Acetaminophen, due to liver-damaging reactions with alcohol metabolites. Aspirin or ibuprofen are both fine choices if you have a headache. Be sure to read the instructions and take only the recommended dose.


Note that excessive use of these medications may cause long-term damage to your liver, especially when used in conjunction with alcohol.
If you can't keep the painkiller down, don't take another dose. You'll just have to ride the pain out until your body recovers enough to accept painkillers.

, These foods alleviate nausea and help your body soak up the alcohol in your system.


Avoid foods that are acidic or spicy, since they are more difficult for your body to digest.
Avoid foods that are heavy or oily, since they increase the feeling of nausea.

, Alcohol may temporarily make you feel better, but it will ultimately dehydrate you and leave you feeling worse later on in the day. If you decide to have a drink, stick with a Bloody Mary or a cold beer, and do not overdo it. You need to give your body a chance to recover.
Only drink if you have no obligations, like work or school, for the rest of the day.

"
Cut down on your drinking if it is safe.,
Avoid triggering situations.,
Consider quitting.,
See your doctor.,
Attend a meeting.,
Talk to a counselor.",How to Deal With Drinking Too Much1," Give yourself a trial to see if you can maintain a lower level of alcohol consumption for two or three months. Keep track of what you are doing in a journal in order to remember what worked and didn’t work at the end of the trial. Before beginning, you should determine if you have a physical dependency on alcohol; if this is the case, it can be dangerous to reduce your alcohol intake without the help of a physician.


Signs that you have a physical dependency on alcohol include anxiety; nausea; abdominal pain; vomiting; irregular heart rate; increased blood pressure, body temperature, and respiration; and mood swings. Severe side effects can actually be fatal and include hallucinations, fever, seizures, severe confusion, and agitation. If you experience any of these symptoms, consult with a doctor before attempting to cut down on your drinking.If you are not physically dependent, cut back a little each day. Have one less drink per day for a week. Then reduce the amount by another drink per day over the next week, and so on until you are within safe drinking limits.Decide which days you will drink and how many drinks you will have.For example, you may know your office is going out for happy hour on Tuesday. You don’t want to avoid it, so you will go and have two drinks.
Give yourself only a certain amount of money to spend on drinks.Drink only with dinner. Pairing wine or beer with food can enhance the enjoyment of your meal, and is a way to set a time limit on your drinking.Drink a smaller-size drink, or a drink with a lower percentage of alcohol in it.;
, Avoid places or people that make you want to drink. If you find yourself feeling stressed out, or another emotion that triggers your drinking, find other alternatives to help you handle those emotions instead.For example, you may want to go over to a friend’s house to watch the game, instead of your favorite sports bar where you are more likely to drink too much.
If you always come home from work with a powerful craving for a drink, make a detour to the gym on the way home and work out to release your stress.
Let your friends know you are trying to cut back, and propose alcohol-free activities instead.

, If you have given yourself a couple of months to try to reduce your drinking, but are still struggling, it is probably best that you consider quitting drinking. You can develop an alcohol addiction and some serious health problems from drinking too much. Other reasons you may wish to quit include:


Pregnancy.
Taking a medication that interacts with alcohol.
A family history of alcohol problems.
Have a condition (physical or mental) that gets worse when you drink., Talk to your doctor about your concerns about your drinking. Your doctor can put you in touch with other people who can help you and help you consider courses of treatment, as well as give you a medical examination to make sure you do not have any physical problems related to your drinking.

, Consider attending an Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meeting to find support. AA has meetings all over the world, and is the best known resource for recovery for alcoholism and alcohol problems.To find one near you, try searching at http://www.aa.org/pages/en_US/find-aa-resources.
You can also contact your local community health agency or religious institution to find a meeting.
If AA isn't right for you, there are other support options. Look into SMART Recovery, Secular Organizations for Sobriety, or Women for Sobriety., Find a counselor who can work with you on addiction issues, managing the problem behavior, as well as addressing the underlying causes. You may have an employee assistance program through your employer that can help you find a counselor in your area. If you are a student, contact your school’s student health service for assistance.

, Hangovers cause hypersensitivity to light and noise. Wear sunglasses if you are leaving the house, and avoid listening to loud music.


If you are having trouble getting out of bed or are continuing to vomit, consider calling in sick to work or school. While you wouldn't want to make this a habit, you are probably not going to be of much use at work if you are constantly running to the bathroom.

, The endorphins released during exercise can help improve your mood, which is important if you are feeling anxious as a result of being hungover. Exercise also speeds up the the process of metabolizing the alcohol, helping it leave your system faster. Be sure to properly hydrate both before and after exercising to prevent further fluid loss.

Don't mix different types of alcohol.,
Stay away from sugary mixed drinks.,

If you forgot or were unable to have water in between drinks, be sure to drink a glass or two of water before going to bed.

, Stick with one, be it wine, beer, or a certain type of hard liquor. Mixing different types is a surefire way to end up with a hangover.

Drink less Units.,
Drink Slowly.,
Take 1 capsule Alcotox for added support in reducing acetaldehyde.",How to Cure a Hangover5," This is the best way to prevent hangovers. Remember that alcohol is converted to acetaldehyde, which is the primary underlying cause of not only hangovers but also almost every known alcohol related health complications from liver disease to oral cancer. Acetaldehyde is a class 1 carcinogen, a potent neurotoxin and also implicated in alcoholism itself. Google it.

, The liver can only eliminate the acetaldehyde in one unit of alcohol per hour on average. So alcohol is metabolised more slowly than it is consumed.

, Take 1 capsule for every standard drink consumed. Clinical results show 1 capsule of Alcotox is capable of reducing 86% of acetaldehyde contained in 125ml serving of 12.5% proof white wine.

Stay busy.,
Learn to say no.,
Minimize activities that may involve drinking.",How to Deal With Drinking Too Much2," Let your family, friends, or religious community support you as you take steps to reduce or quit drinking. They can celebrate your successes, help you on hard days, and do things with you where alcohol will not be present.


Be honest about what you are facing. If you have decided to stay sober, make sure you let your friends and family know. Try saying, “You may know that I am trying to stop drinking. So next week can we go to the movies instead of out to lunch? If we go to out to eat, I’m going to be tempted to get a beer.”

, Fill your time with other activities that do not involve drinking. Consider exercise, learning a new skill, or playing a new game.Try to get other friends and family involved in new activities to help hold you accountable to them. You could say, “Hey, remember how you mentioned you wanted to train for a 5K last year? Do you want to do that with me? It would be great for me to get in shape, and it would help me keep my mind off drinking.”

, Practice saying no to alcohol until you feel comfortable doing so. People, especially friends with whom you’ve shared many drinks in the past, may not understand your change of heart.


Just say no. “No thanks, I’ll stick with coffee.”
Change the subject. For example, “No, I’m good. So, where did you say your sister was going to school next year?”
Make a joke. Try saying, “I’ve got to lose this beer gut! I’ll pass.”

, Until you know you can resist the lure of a drink, it might be best to stay away from places you know alcohol will be served.If you have a group of friends that likes to spend long hours at the bar, you might want to look for another group of people to spend time with, at least until your drinking is under control.
If many of your hobbies go hand-in-hand with drinking (getting a beer after a softball game, bowling, book clubs), it may be wise to avoid these activities or find new ones until you are better used to saying no to alcohol.
Once you feel confident you can say no to a drink, it is okay to slowly re-enter these environments. Make sure others around you are aware of your resolve so that they can help you avoid the temptation.

Consider the amount you are drinking.,
Take the CAGE questionnaire.,
See if you meet the criteria for alcohol use disorder.,
Pay attention to your physical health.,
Ask your family and friends.",How to Deal With Drinking Too Much3," The amount of alcohol considered low-risk is different based on your sex. Your alcohol use may be considered “heavy” or “at-risk” if you are drinking:


More than four drinks on any day or fourteen per week if you are a man.
More than three drinks on any day or seven per week if you are a woman.Make sure you are measuring standard-sized drinks. You may be drinking more units than you realize. A standard serving is 12 ounces of beer, 8 – 9 ounces of malt liquor, 5 ounces of wine, and 1.5 ounces of liquor. In order to know how much you are drinking, try keeping a log of your drinking behavior over a period of a week or two. Keep track of both the number of drinks you have and how many days a week you are drinking.

, There are several different self-administered tests available online that can help you determine if you, or someone in your life, is drinking too much. One simple test is the CAGE questionnaire, which is used around the world to help identify alcohol addictions.Note that answering yes to one question indicates there may be a problem, and yes to more than one question indicates that you need to get help.Have you ever felt you should cut down on your drinking?
Have people annoyed you by criticizing your drinking?
Have you ever felt bad or guilty about your drinking?
Have you ever had a drink first thing in the morning to steady your nerves or get rid of a hangover?

, There are specific criteria outlined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), which is a manual used by mental health professionals, that mean you have alcohol use disorder, or AUD. This diagnosis can only be given by a mental health professional, but the guidelines may be helpful if you are unsure whether or not you have a drinking problem. Ask yourself if, in the past year, you have:Had times when you ended up drinking more, or longer than you intended?
More than once wanted to cut down or stop drinking, or tried to, but couldn’t?
Spent a lot of time drinking? Or being sick or getting over the aftereffects?
Experienced craving — a strong need, or urge, to drink?
Found that drinking — or being sick from drinking — often interfered with taking care of your home or family? Or caused job troubles? Or school problems?
Continued to drink even though it was causing trouble with your family or friends?
Given up or cut back on activities that were important or interesting to you, or gave you pleasure, in order to drink?
More than once gotten into situations while or after drinking that increased your chances of getting hurt (such as driving, swimming, using machinery, walking in a dangerous area, or having unsafe sex)?
Continued to drink even though it was making you feel depressed or anxious or adding to another health problem? Or after having had a memory blackout?
Had to drink much more than you once did to get the effect you want? Or found that your usual number of drinks had much less effect than before?
Found that when the effects of alcohol were wearing off, you had withdrawal symptoms, such as trouble sleeping, shakiness, irritability, anxiety, depression, restlessness, nausea, or sweating? Or sensed things that were not there?
If you answer yes to one or more of these questions, speak with your physician or a mental health professional about being evaluated for AUD.

, You may be experiencing some physical side effects to drinking that are beyond typical hangover symptoms. These symptoms can start to occur when your drinking still may seem quite “normal” to others, but can indicate that your liver is having a difficult time processing the excess alcohol. You may notice:


Looking tan in spite of staying out of the sun. This can be a sign of mild jaundice.Forgetfulness. This goes beyond forgetting how much you drank or blacking out, and includes mild day-to-day forgetfulness. Alcohol disrupts a chemical in our brains that helps with memory. Cravings. If you experience a strong need or urge to drink, you may be dependent on alcohol.Poor sleep. Insomnia is extremely common among heavy drinkers, because alcohol interferes with neurotransmitters that help us sleep.Diarrhea. Loose, watery stools can indicate that your liver is not processing fat efficiently; it is too busy processing the alcohol., Perhaps your family and friends have previously indicated to you that you are drinking too much. They also can help you hone in on any problem drinking behavior.


For example, you could ask, “Can you tell me honestly if you think I drink too much? I had a rough weekend, and I’m beginning to get concerned I have a problem.”
Ask them to tell you about your behavior while you are drinking. You might not be aware if your behavior is obnoxious, aggressive, or depressed.
You may also not be aware how much you are drinking. Since alcohol lowers your inhibitions and impairs your judgement, you may not realize that your plan for two drinks at the bar easily turned into four."

If your liquor cabinet is always stocked, you can easily be tempted. If there is a half-drunk bottle of wine or a six pack is chilling in the fridge, it's going to be tough to avoid drinking. The first step to avoiding alcoholism is to keep it out of your house when it's not serving an immediate social purpose. If you don't want to stop drinking but just cut back to a healthy amount, not surrounding yourself with it is a good place to start.Stock your kitchen with other tasty drinks you can substitute for alcohol when you want something comforting to drink. Tea, sparkling water, lemonade, root beer, and soda are better for you than alcohol.If you have a party and there's a lot of leftover alcohol, give it away to friends. If no one wants it, pour it down the drain. Don't get trapped into thinking you have to finish it because you don't want it to go to waste.;
, Drinking when you're bored, lonely, stressed, sad, or feeling any other negative emotion can lead to a dependency on alcohol. Since alcohol is a depressant, it can actually make things even worse.Try drinking only on social occasions, when everyone's having a good time and there's a reason to celebrate.


Don't fall into the trap of making every day a day to celebrate. Make sure you save drinking for truly special occasions when someone has something worthy of celebration.

, If you tend to guzzle your drinks, you'll be more likely to drink too much on any given evening. Slow yourself down by sipping your drinks slowly, taking more time to finish each drink. You can help this by ordering your drinks straight, so the taste of sweet mixers doesn't mask the alcohol and make you think you aren't drinking any.You should also drink a glass of water or a soft drink for every alcoholic drink you consume.Drinking water will help fill you up and keep you hydrated. You will be less likely to guzzle drinks if you are properly hydrated and feel fuller.
Do not engage in beer drinking contests or any activity that involves chugging excessive amounts of alcohol in a short period of time.

, Since the purpose of bars is to sell drinks, you're automatically going to feel pressured to buy one. The low lights, the smell of alcohol mixed with perfume and cologne, and the sexy vibe everyone's exuding present an atmosphere that may be hard to resist. Since the whole environment is geared towards drinking, it's best to avoid bars altogether when you're trying to cut back.If you're invited to a social function that takes place at a bar, like happy hour with your boss and coworkers, try ordering club soda or another nonalcoholic drink. If the place has a food menu, order yourself a treat so you'll still feel like you're indulging.
When you do go to bars, choose places that have more going on than just drinking. Go to a place with pool tables or bocce ball, for example, so the focus isn't solely on how much alcohol you can keep down. You may find it easier to drink less when there are distractions.

, People spend a lot of time in bars when they could be doing something more active. Suggest alternatives to your group of friends next time you have a get together. You could play a pick-up sport, go for a walk or bike ride, go to a movie or play, or go to a music show or art opening. Choose a venue that doesn't sell alcohol or an activity that isn't conducive to drinking.


This will not only make you cut back on your drinking, it will make you healthier overall by getting you more active., Some people are going to insist on drinking, even when you invite them to activities outside the bar. They'll brown bag it at the movie theater or pack a flask to bring on your hike. If you're seriously trying to avoid alcohol, make plans with other people who are in the same boat. That way you won't be faced with the presence of alcohol every time you want to have a little fun.


This may mean cutting people out of your life if it becomes a problem. If you really like the person that drinks all the time, learn to say no instead when they are around. Just because he is drinking doesn't mean you have to.Maybe they will pick up on your attempts to cut back and do the same.

, Exercising is a great way to help yourself kick an alcohol habit. Drinking makes a lot of people feel slow and sluggish, and it can also lead to bloating and weight gain.If you make it a goal to be physically fit, you'll soon get frustrated with alcohol's effect on your progress.


Try signing up for a 5K or joining a community soccer or basketball team. You'll soon find yourself passing on alcohol the night before you need to be at your physical best.
Along with exercise, make sure you're eating well, getting sleep, and generally taking care of yourself so you'll be less prone to drinking.

, If you cut back significantly on your alcohol consumption, you may start to experience some withdrawal symptoms. There are both physical and mental withdrawal symptoms that you might experience. Withdrawal causes trembling hands, irritability, shaky and tired feelings, difficulty sleeping, poor concentration, and bad dreams.


If you were a heavy drinker, you may experience some additional symptoms, such as sweating, nausea, headache, lack of appetite, vomiting, and palpitations., Avoiding alcoholism is more difficult for some people than it is for others. Some are able to drink on a daily basis without negative repercussions. For many, daily drinking increases tolerance to the point where it's difficult to have just one, which can lead to heavy drinking and eventually alcoholism. You should also try to stay within the moderate daily drinking range.


According to the USDA, moderate drinking is defined as up to 1 drink per day for women and up to 2 drinks per day for men. Frequently going over this, especially for a sustained period of time, puts you at greater risk for alcoholism.Keep in mind that more than 7 drinks per week for women and 14 drinks per week for men in considered heavy drinking. Try to stay well below this limit.
Having a family history of alcoholism, mixing alcohol with medication, and having depression can all put you at greater risk for developing a dependency., If you've decided that 3 drinks a week is your max, write it down: ""I will not drink more than 3 drinks a week."" Make a commitment to yourself to stick to what you wrote down.Place the piece of paper on your mirror or in your wallet so you have a daily reminder that you've resolved to cut back or quit.


You can also write down the reason you want to cut back, such as: ""I want to be healthier."" or ""I want to stop alienating my family and friends.""It's not going to be easy, but putting your promise to paper can help.

, One of the best ways to understand how much you drink is to keep track of each one. You can carry a drink tracker card that you use to note each drink you have a week. You can also note it on a calendar or notepad around your house. If you drink a lot while you are out, you can use a notepad or app on your phone to keep track of how much you drink. Review it each week. You may be surprised once you see it written in one place.Being accountable for each drink can help you be more conscious about how much you drink and help you cut back.
If you find that you drink a lot more than you expected, you can create a journal and log every time you have a drink. You should also write about why you decided to drink, what feelings you experienced before taking a drink, and how you felt afterward. This will help you look for patterns in your emotions.Write down your triggers and situations that make it extremely difficult for you to avoid drinking. As the weeks progress, you should start learning what to avoid., Determine to stop drinking alcohol for a week or two. This will give your system a break and free you from your regular routine for awhile. You can also do it in smaller doses and choose at least two days a week not to drink.For example, if you've been in the habit of drinking a glass of wine every night, taking a break will change things up so you'll no longer feel you need that daily glass.
If you are a heavy drinker, this can cause withdrawal symptoms. Pay close attention to how you feel and the way your body reacts to the change. If you have serious reactions to this step, see your doctor as soon as you can.

, Throughout the process of cutting back, take notes on your progress from week to week. Assess if you think you have control of your drinking habits, if you have been successful in cutting back your consumption to the amount to which you committed, and if you are able to cope with your urges and cravings.If you feel that your drinking is out of hand, even though you've made a serious effort to nip it in the bud on your own, it might be time to seek outside help.


If you can't limit your consumption to a low level without feeling withdrawal, you can't say no to a drink, you have blackouts, or you experience other signs of alcoholism, you should seek help right away.

, You need to seek help immediately if you determine that your drinking is out of control. If you experience certain problems, you may be abusing alcohol, which puts you at great risk for developing alcoholism. You are at risk if you can't have a drink without eventually drinking more and getting drunk or you use alcohol while driving or operating machinery, even though you know that using alcohol in this way is illegal and extremely dangerous.


If you have morning and evening cravings, develop irritability, have mood swings, drink alone or in secret, chug drinks, are depressed, or experience shakiness, you should seek immediate help.
You should also seek help if you neglect your responsibilities due to drinking. You could be neglecting them either because you're busy drinking or because you have hangovers that prevent you from going to work or school.You are at risk if you've gotten in legal trouble because of your drinking, such as being arrested for public intoxication, getting into a fight while drunk, or getting a DUI.
You should be concerned if you keep drinking even though people in your life have expressed concern. When your drinking has gotten problematic enough that other people notice, you should seek help.
You should not use drinking as a coping mechanism. It is extremely unhealthy to use alcohol as a way to cope with stress, depression, and other problems. If you tend to do so, you should seek help., Going through a 12-step program, such as those facilitated by AA, has helped many people who abuse alcohol find a way to cope.Even if you don't think you're a full-blown alcoholic, going through the program can help you prevent your problem from getting worse. You'll attend meetings and get an AA sponsor who you can call when you're experiencing cravings or losing your way.You may learn that you cannot drink safely anymore, and it will be important for you to have a support system in place to help you deal with that reality and help you eliminate all alcohol and negative influences from your life.
You can search online to find a nearby AA support group in your area.
AA is a faith-based organization, so only try this method if you are comfortable with this. They use religious passages and messages to help guide recovery and rely on sponsors and group meetings to back up their teachings., If you are not interested in AA, you can try SMART Recovery. It is a program that uses cognitive-behavioral approaches to pinpoint emotional and environmental factors that have led to your addiction and help you respond to them in new, productive ways. It focuses on recovering from your addiction without thinking it is a disease.


This is an abstinence based program, meaning that they teach the complete removal of all alcohol from your life. Despite this, SMART Recovery welcomes those who are ambivalent about quitting drinking.This program is for those who do not need too much structure and who can be personally motivated to quit drinking. Cognitive-behavioral approaches rely on self-actualization instead of group or sponsor related help like AA. This program relies heavily on your own motivation and participation., If you are not interested in faith based 12 step programs like AA, there are some other alternatives you can try. Secular Organizations for Sobriety (SOS) is a non-structured program that has guidelines for sobriety that focus on you taking responsibility for your drinking habit and making sure members do not drink at all. It is an abstinence based approach like AA and SMART Recovery.


You can also use programs like LifeRing Secular Recovery (LSR), which is a secular organization that upholds three tenets, sobriety, secularity, and self-help. The believe that inner motivation is the best way to stay abstinent from alcohol and have group meetings for encouragement and help when your self-motivation is lacking. This is similar to AA in that they have group sessions, but their beliefs are not steeped in Christianity.For more information about support groups that might be right for you, go to Faces and Voices Recovery's Directory of support groups. They have options for support groups based on gender, religion, type of addiction, and age. They also provide listings of groups that meet in person, provide medical assistance, meet online, are friend and family focused, and that are 12 step., Having individual attention from a therapist is also a good idea when you are struggling with a drinking problem. Your drinking might stem from deeper issues that you need to address before you're able to stop. If you're drinking due to trauma, extreme stress, mental illness, or another reason that a therapist could address, then getting this kind of one-on-one help will be essential to recovery.


A therapist can also help you if you are worried about social pressures to drink, don't know how to avoid triggers, or have guilt over any relapse. She can help you get over the guilt of these situations and help you get stronger in your recovery., Giving up alcohol is extremely difficult to go through alone. Tell your loved ones and friends that you're getting help to stop drinking. Ask them to support you on your journey by not inviting you to bars or giving you alcohol. This will help you be more accountable for you choices because you will have more people looking out for you.Ask if you can do activities together that don't involve drinking.

, If you start walking around, you will draw attention to yourself and likely trip or fall. People will probably not notice how drunk you are if you hide your lack of coordination. If you must walk, move briskly to your destination. Forward momentum will keep you from staggering.

, People often space out when they are drunk. They get lost in their own thoughts and ignore everything around them. Remain engaged with your environment. Listen to friends’ conversations, watch what is happening around the room, and respond if someone tries to get your attention you.

, Slurred speech, bragging, repetition, and inappropriate statements are tell-tale signs of drunkenness.Alcohol impairs your judgement, so you won’t hear how drunk you sound. Don’t let your crazy talk give you away. Limit your end of conversations to short answers.

, Complicated thoughts are hard to express when you are intoxicated, and trying to explain what you mean could be a giveaway that you have had a few (or several) to drink. Fight the urge to express any ""fantastic thoughts"" you just came up with: a new business idea, your desire to marry a woman you met fifteen minutes ago, etc. They may sound mind-blowing right now, but chances are they aren't.

, Natural fatigue often resembles intoxication. If someone asks if you are drunk, provide plausible excuses for your behavior. People will likely give you the benefit of the doubt.

, Alcohol dries out your mouth and encourages bacterial growth.People have come to associate the smell of an unhealthy mouth with the smell of alcohol. If you can’t mask the smell of alcohol with strong foods, clean your mouth instead. Brush your teeth, rinse with mouthwash, and drink plenty of water to rehydrate.

It may seem like a very difficult undertaking, but it can save your life.",How to Be a Good AA Member and Recover from Alcoholism," So, do you think you're an alcoholic? It doesn't matter if someone else thinks you are and it doesn't matter what the people at your local meeting think. Only you can determine if you're an alcoholic. If you think you are and you want to give AA a try, here's a little how-to.;
, If you are afraid of going to your first meeting...that's okay. Most people are. It's important to just bite the bullet and go. If you are really tired of the way you are living, you won't regret it. People at the meeting will not look down at you-in fact, just the opposite. You will undoubtedly find acceptance and support because we are all alike and suffer from the same malady. Do yourself a favor and say a little prayer and just go.

, Alcoholism makes people very very lonely and isolated. It's time to feel a part of something and start living! Try asking around for some people of the same sex that have been sober awhile and stick with them. Go out to eat with them after the meeting if possible. At least get their phone numbers and maybe make arrangements to go out after another meeting. (if you go to AA and start hanging around someone of the opposite sex who's been sober 2 months you probably won't get sober). Anyway, sober friends are very important. You'll want to find someone of the same sex who's been sober at least a year and who has worked and understands the 12 steps. Very important. You will need a good sponsor; someone you trust. Someone who you can talk to about anything. It might take awhile to find such a person, so at least get a temporary sponsor.

, If you're shaking from needing a drink and find it hard to concentrate, that's okay, they've all been there, but just try to listen and relate to what's being discussed. If it's a discussion meeting and it comes around to you, just introduce yourself and pass. It's that easy. If you feel you are an alcoholic, you can safely introduce yourself as such. If you're not sure, you can say that you're not sure.

, If you get a Big Book, read it. It could save your life. There's a lot of wonderful information in there about recovering from alcoholism, and it actually instructs you as to how to precisely recover from alcoholism. You'll want to read it a few times before you and your sponsor work the steps.

, It may be hard to believe early on, but people want to get to know you! Stick around and help clean up a little. Clean the coffee pot! Doing little things like this will help you feel involved and ""a part of"".

, Get some phone numbers, and if/when you feel like drinking call someone first. If you do what is suggested in the Big Book, after a while that desire to drink will go away, and someday you will be giving someone your number, and they will be calling you, and you will be sponsoring people! Believe it!

This also means some of your base instincts may be revealed. If you are holding back a temper it may flare up out of control when you are intoxicated. If you know you have an issue like that, you need to work not only on your self-control, but also try to change your natural inclinations.


If you are an angry drunk, you may find that you tend to be mad during the day. If that's the case and you want to act sober, you may consider anger management classes. There it's possible to learn techniques to avoid becoming angry in the first place.

, When your judgement is impaired by alcohol, your sober friends may be able to tell your state by your tells. Ask them to recount changes in your behavior. See if they would be willing to give you examples. Commit these changes of behavior to memory. You will need to work on hiding them to act sober.


One way to ask your friends about your drunken behavior is to asky what type of drunk you are.Even if they do not have specific examples of your odd behavior they may have an overarching sense of how you are. Happy drunks tend to be very jovial the more alcohol they consume. Angry drunks tend to be mean and problematic. There are many other types but this would get the conversation going.

, You likely know how you normally behave too. If you record yourself when you are drunk, you may see more than your friends do. This could allow you to confirm your friends' observations if you think they are unbelievable. Furthermore, you will have clear documentation of your odd behavior. This will give you a good starting point when trying to identify your tells.


You don't have to do this by yourself or even much of the time. You may have a friend record you with their phone when you aren't looking. You may even use your phone to take an audio recording to see how you sound later when you are sober.

, If you don't want people to know you are drunk, you have to stop acting abnormal. Drunk people can often be identified by their unique behaviors.Asking friends about your odd behavior or viewing/listening to a recording will give you information. Your goal is to identify your tells and write them down. This gives you a list of things to work on.

, Some tells you can avoid through practice. You have to maintain some level of non-drunkenness though. Once you have a list to work on, get drunk. In your drunken state, try to act as normal as possible. You will have to look at your list of tells and avoid doing any of those abnormal behaviors. If that's too difficult, you may be too drunk. Scale down your drinking for now until you get the hang of acting sober at a lower state of drunkenness.


Keep in mind that the more drunk you are, the harder it will be to hide your tells. If you keep drinking, eventually you will not be able to hide it.
Not all tells can be avoided.You will want to avoid giving people the opportunity to observe those aspects. For exampleIf you know you have alcohol on your breath, don't get too close.

Practice overcoming your tells while drinking.,
Keep your context in mind when trying to act sober.,
Practice field sobriety tests.When you are pulled over there are certain tests the authorities may use to test your sobriety short of a breathalizer.,
Avoid scenarios where it's impossible to pretend to be sober.",How to Act Sober3," You can push your limits. If you find yourself too drunk to avoid showing your tells, practice overcoming them. You may ask your sober buddy to evaluate you. Practice acting sober while drunk until you can pull it off successfully to your sober buddy.

, Not all venues are conducive to your acting sober. Acting sober at a bar is far different than acting sober at a traffic stop or in front of angry parents. If you push your limits, you may not be able to act sober at the same rate in every scenario. When you know you are potentially moving to a new scenario, let your drunkenness wear off a little more before attempting to act sober.

, Many of these tests are designed to be increasingly difficult the more drunk you are. The novelty of these scenarios means if you are not practiced, you may find yourself too nervous to act sober.


Be sure to have a sober person evaluate you. Let them study the behaviors a law enforcement agent will be looking for. Then they can accurately tell you what you are doing wrong to the best of their ability.

, Some bodily behaviors give you away because they are unavoidable.Even when you learn to control yourself enough to act sober, your body may not act as sober as you want it to. A breathalizer test may reveal that your body has not metabolized alcohol as fast as you wished it would. The vocal cords, eye muscles, and legs may not perform the way a sober person's would. Whenever your body is acting beyond your ability to hide your drunkenness, avoid scenarios where they may give you away.


If you are pulled over by a police officer, you should submit to their requests.Refusing to perform a field sobriety test or blow into a breathalizer is generally a bad idea. By acquiring your license you may provide implicit consent. Refusing to cooperate with law enforcement may earn you additional citations.

Eat before you drink.,
Keep a close eye on your drink count.,
Alternate drinking alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages.,
Have a sober buddy.,
Increase your drinking tolerance in a healthy way.",How to Act Sober4," This will buffer your stomach so alcohol won't be absorbed into your blood too quickly. This could cause a spike in your drunkenness. Spikes like these may temporarily leave you unable to act sober. The goal is to not get to that point. Acting sober is largely a matter of maintaining a level of drunkenness that does not prohibit you from controlling your behaviors.

, This is an objective way to keep from getting too drunk to act sober. You need to know your limits. When you start drinking, make a mental note of the time. Then keep a count of how many drinks you have had since that time. If you know you are no longer able to act sober, remember how much you had drunk and try to stay below that next time.


How your body deals alcohol will vary by drink count, time, weight, and biological sex.Your body will metabolize alcohol continuously but only at a certain rate. If you keep up with your drinks over a period of time, you can calculate your blood alcohol level (BAL). This can later help you identify a BAL at which you are no longer able to act sober. Stay below that.
Drinks come in roughly standard sizes. A can of beer will have about the same amount of alcohol as a glass of wine and a shot of liquor. If you are at a party drinking beer, save the bottle caps or aluminium tabs to keep a count of your drinks. If you are at a bar, ask the bartender how many drinks you've had.

, This will help not only keep from getting too drunk but also reduce the severity of a hangover. The goal is to help keep the alcohol diluted in your blood by continuously adding water to your body. Alcohol will cause your body to lose water. This helps keep your body from becoming dehydrated.

, You may find that having a designated driver will help you avoid drunken behaviors. For example, getting lost going back to your car. There are some mobile phone apps that can help with some of these situations.However, a sober buddy can also let you know when you've had too many. They can tell you when you are no longer able to act sober. Have them keep an eye on you so you will know your limits. This way you can keep your alcohol consumption to a level that allows you to act sober.

, Our bodies develop a tolerance for alcohol over time. If you've been sober for a while, you may notice it takes fewer drinks to get an effect than it has in the past. Regular drinking will increase your tolerance. This increase in tolerance will allow you to drink more over a period and continue to successfully act sober.


Of course, don't just drink for the sake of building a stronger tolerance. Doctors recommend a daily limit of two alcoholic drinks for men and one for women."

Inability to remain standing or sitting up straight
A marked desire to lie down or roll over
Questionable walking technique or stumbling
Unusual, loud, inappropriate, or embarrassing behavior
Violent reactions
Bloodshot, glassy, or watery eyes
Trouble remembering things
Extreme and sudden changes in behavior or mood;
, The amount of care your drunk friend or acquaintance will need will depend on how much he or she has had to drink. Each individual's situation will need to be evaluated according to context and circumstances, but the main point is to be prepared to care for him until he's out of danger.


You should never leave someone who has been drinking heavily alone to ""sleep it off."" This could be extremely dangerous for the drunk person, who could injure himself or stop breathing., Try distracting the intoxicated person from having any more alcohol.Get him away from the alcohol – take him to the front yard for a breath of fresh air, suggest that it's time to call it a night and phone a taxi, or simply sit with him away from the drinking area and talk. Find somewhere quiet and not too bright.


If he wants drinks, take responsibility for delivering drinks that won't harm him. Offer water or hand him a coke or fruit juice. If he's insistent on getting an alcoholic drink, you can claim that it contains vodka. Chances are he won't even notice, especially if you're distracting him in other ways such as talking or watching TV together.
Don't give the person coffee. Coffee can further dehydrate a person and irritate the stomach, which an already drunk person doesn't need to deal with.
If someone tends to overdrink, but has not yet drunk too much, suggest weaker drinks such as beer, and drinks which may be less appealing to drink in large quantities, such as full-flavored (bitter) foreign beer, instead of mixed drinks and liquor. This can make the level of intoxication easier for the drinker and friends to monitor. However, it is not a substitute for eventually stopping drinking.

, Remain calm and reassuring at all times. The intoxicated person may be particularly moody or upset when he's drunk, so it's your job to keep a cool head.Try to avoid ""you"" statements, like ""You've had too much to drink."" Instead, try light-hearted statements that don't sound accusatory, like ""You're looking a little green in the gills. Why don't we slow it down for a bit?""
Read How to keep your friend from driving drunk for information on stopping a determined drunk from driving.

, Alcohol affects your judgment and balance, so the person may have trouble walking or moving properly.Help the person to a safe seat or to the floor. If the intoxicated person begins to heave, try to help him to an appropriate place to vomit.


If a person is lying down when he begins to heave or vomit, place him in the recovery position, on his side with the higher knee bent. This is to prevent choking. Put something behind his back to prevent him from rolling back onto his back or stomach; vomiting in either position can cause him to choke or drown. If he is lying on a couch, ensure that he is facing AWAY from the back of the couch so that any vomit does not pool around the person's face (especially on leather couches).
If the person has fallen down, or you find him on the floor and are unsure whether or not he fell down, you MUST take him to get medical attention. Head injuries can easily be incurred in falling down, and intoxication can hide the usual signs of concussion or more serious head injury.
Lack of coordination will make walking very difficult, so don't suggest this as a way of ""sobering up"".
If the intoxicated person needs to visit the bathroom, accompany him and wait in the bathroom. It's all too easy for an uncoordinated drunk person to slip and bang a head and get knocked out on the hard surfaces in bathrooms.

, Stay in the room with him. Watch a film or TV, read a book, or clean up after the party, but keep him in the room with you. If you take him home, ensure a responsible person will do the same.If you can't be with him, or you can't be sure someone else will keep an eye out for him, get on the phone to someone you know who will care enough to do this, such as a parent, guardian, sibling, or friend. Explain that it is urgent and that you have seen how wasted the person is. At the very least, keep watch over the drunk person until the changeover of responsibility.

, Say his name loudly, ask him firmly to open their eyes, prod him and look for a response. Watch the chest or abdomen for breathing movements. A rate of 12- 20 breaths per minute is normal., If breathing becomes slow (8 breaths per minute or less or irregular with 10 seconds or more between each breath), and the person is unresponsive to being prodded and pinched firmly, this suggests alcohol poisoning. Other possible signs include:Passed out or stupors – unconscious or semi-conscious, cannot be awakened
Blue lips and fingertips
Dehydrated
Rapid pulse
Vomiting while asleep and not waking up even when vomiting
Cold clammy hands/ feet.

, If you're on campus, call the campus security or university police. Explain the situation clearly.You will not get into trouble for calling for help. Authorities prefer to keep people alive than to scold for irresponsible behavior. Drinking age laws and campus policies are in place to stop lives being endangered, not to cause people to abandon one another during a medical emergency. Treat this like it is – a medical emergency, not an offense.
Many campuses have a ""medical amnesty"" policy that will eliminate or reduce legal consequences for students in emergency situations due to alcohol., Keep him warm and continue to monitor breathing. If a qualified first aider is available, call on her for help while waiting for the ambulance.



Don't panic. Stay calm. Although you're likely to be upset and afraid, it won't help the patient if you transfer this fear and anxiety to him. Reassure him, and in doing so, reassure yourself.
If the person is awake or conscious, do not touch or prod him without explaining what you're about to do; they may react violently.
If someone else is present, send her to direct the ambulance paramedics to your position.

, Every person reacts to alcohol differently, so just because you can knock back six beers and feel fine doesn't mean that others can.Don't assume that because you and a friend have had the same amount to drink that you are both okay., By the time a person is very drunk, it's too late for food to ""sober"" him up. People who are intoxicated may also have dulled gag reflexes and could choke on food.If your friend is hungry and asks for food, you can give him something to eat, but monitor him closely to make sure he doesn't choke.

, Strong coffee, exercise, and a good slap in the face may be popular folk remedies, but they don't work. In the person's current drunk state, they could even be dangerous. The only thing that will really help the intoxicated person at this point is time (and hydration)., When a person's drunk, his reflexes are blunted. Pouring water over the person to try and wake/sober him up could actually cause him to choke or drown."

Remove all temptations from your life.,
Lean on your support system.,
Stay committed.,
Reward yourself for not drinking.,
Stay busy and active.,
Remember that you won't be able to ""just have a few beers"" again — not ever.",How to Stay Sober," That means every last one. Place yourself only in situations that will help you. Don't tempt yourself. If you just quit drinking, it's not a good idea to go out to bars, pubs, or nightclubs around town, let alone to be in the same room with alcohol.


Get rid of all the alcohol in your home, if you haven't already. Even if you have an expensive bottle of scotch or a fancy bottle of cabernet, it won't do you any good — ever. If you feel guilty about throwing nice alcohol away, give it to your friends or family.
Ask friends who tend to drink alcohol often to tone down their drinking while in your company. If they refuse, you may not want to spend time with them while they drink. The less you are around alcohol, the less you will be tempted to break your resolve.
Ask your friends to not drink around you completely. This is the easiest way to avoid temptation.
Avoid events that will be alcohol-heavy. This means weddings, concerts, 30th birthday parties, and any other raucous affairs. Though you may be able to attend these without being tempted one day, if you're struggling to stay sober, don't make it harder for yourself.;
, Whether it comes from friends, family, or recovery groups, you can't overcome alcoholism alone. Find people who will support your decision to sober up, and tell them about the goals you have set for yourself. If you think you might be tempted to have a drink or waver in your fastidiousness, call them immediately and talk to them about your urges. They will calm you down, help you through your withdrawal, and boost your confidence.


Attending a weekly support group like Alcoholics Anonymous can also be beneficial. By connecting with other current and recovering alcoholics, you can find sympathetic voices who will guide you through the process of overcoming alcoholism. AA is a fantastic resource, but it's not for everyone. If you decide not to join AA or another recovery program, make sure you have a strong enough of a support system to stay sober without it.Find a close friend, or even an acquaintance, who has struggled with staying sober in the past. Ask for advice.
Open up to a family member. Your family will love you unconditionally, and will be a great support system.
Get rid of any judgmental or negative people in your life. If they're not with you, then they're against you. This especially means other people who enable your drinking.

, Don't talk yourself out of your decision. It's easy to have your doubts when you first quit drinking. But don't lose confidence in yourself! If you truly believe you can stop drinking, then you can. Never doubt your ability for real self-improvement.


It's important to remind yourself of the problems you had while you were drinking and how much your family and friends will appreciate your sobriety and newfound health.
If you're feeling weak, don't keep it to yourself and don't be alone. Spend time opening up to a friend.
Write a list of all the reasons you want to quit and keep it framed above your bed or desk.
Write another list of all of the awful things you did when you were drinking. Accept that this was your behavior — whether it was alcohol-induced or not. Tell yourself that you will never act this way again, and that you will never drink again because you don't want to hurt the people closest to you as well as yourself. You can keep this list hidden, but in an easy-to-find spot.
Don't give up if you relapse. You might have had a bad night or two, but don't be discouraged. This is only natural, and what's important is that you keep trying.

, Breaking an alcohol addiction is an incredible achievement, and you should recognize the hard work you've put in. Don't forget to remind yourself how tough you really are by rewarding yourself.


Separate the money that you would have spent on alcohol. Noticing the amount of money that you save by not drinking will only help your determination through this rigorous process. You can use it for something fun, or save it up for a ""dream gift"" to yourself.
Give yourself a treat every week. For every week that you stay sober, eat your favorite treat, whether it's a fudge sundae or a steak from your favorite restaurant. Though you shouldn't become an unhealthy eater, a treat once in a while will make you feel stronger.
Keep a calendar that marks every day that you are sober. Tell yourself that every time you pass thirty more days without a drink, you will do something special, whether it's hiking in your favorite mountains, or spending an entire Sunday rewatching all the episodes of your favorite childhood show.

, If you spend all of your time alone in a dark house, it's likely you will feel lonely and depressed and will want a drink because you won't have anything better to do. If you fill your life with the things you love, you'll be less likely to want to drink. Here are some things you can do:


Stay healthy. Commit yourself to eating three balanced meals a day, and exercise for at least 30 minutes a day.
You can even commit yourself seriously to one sport. Start running a few times a week and work yourself up to a 5K or a 10K. Your body will feel better, and so will your mind.
Find a new hobby. Learn a foreign language, or take a ceramics or creative writing class. You'll be able to expand your mind and will make some friends in the process.
Stay busy by setting goals. Tell yourself that you will run fifteen miles in one month, write twenty poems in two weeks, or that you will finish your first oil painting by the summer. Set up a schedule and stick to it.

, You might have gone five years without having a drink and are feeling in great shape, mentally strong, and proud of the healthy relationships you've been maintaining. Someone offers you a glass of wine and you shrug and accept it. That's okay, right? No way.


You may be on top of the world, but you and alcohol do not mix. Why risk everything you've worked so hard for?
Drinking is a slippery slope. Soon one glass of wine will turn into a few glasses, which will turn into...what happened last night?
Unless you are a superhero, you won't be able to enjoy alcohol again in moderation like many of the people around you. It's okay. You have been working on being a well-rounded person and have so many amazing interests that it shouldn't matter.

Keep a drinking journal.",How to Stop Binge Drinking1," One sign that you have a problem with alcohol is that it’s started to affect areas of your life such as work or school, your personal relationships, or your health.A pattern of drinking that causes these issues is called “alcohol abuse,” and left to go on, it can turn into alcohol dependence, or alcoholism. Ways alcohol can impact your life include:


Not being able to fulfill responsibilities at school, work, or home
Feeling unable to do things you enjoy doing because of side effects (hangovers, black outs, etc.)
Drinking even when your friends don’t, or drinking to feel accepted
Increased feelings of anxiety or depression
Getting into unsafe situations because of alcohol (risky sex, driving while intoxicated, etc.)
Experiencing withdrawal symptoms after a binge episode, such as difficulty sleeping, nausea, vomiting, sweating, irritability, shakiness, anxiety, or depression;
, The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism defines binge drinking as a “pattern of drinking that brings blood alcohol concentration (BAC) levels to 0.08g/dL.”For men, this usually takes about 5 drinks (8 alcohol units) in 2 hours. For women, it usually takes 4 drinks (6 alcohol units) in 2 hours. Other warning signs of binge drinking include:You tend to drink quickly
You regularly drink more than the moderate consumption guidelines (1 drink/2-3 alcohol units per day for women, 2 drinks/3-4 alcohol units per day for men)
You drink to “get drunk”
You sometimes feel unable to control how much you drink, or you find it hard to stop drinking once you’ve startedYou drink more than you intended to, or you lose track of how much you’ve drunkYou have developed a tolerance for alcohol so you have to drink more than you once did to feel “buzzed”

, For many people, drinking is an all or nothing kind of deal: one drink is too many and 20 are never enough. If you’ve tried to cut back on your drinking and failed, or if you suspect that you’ll never be able to “just have one,” it might be better to channel your efforts into quitting altogether.


Alcohol abuse can become alcohol dependence, or alcoholism, especially if the abuse continues long-term.If you enjoy drinking socially and want to distance yourself from abusing alcohol, you can learn how to change your relationship with drinking so you can comfortably have a few without going overboard.

, Whether you think you simply need to cut back your alcohol consumption or eliminate it entirely, setting clear goals for yourself can help you. Keep these reasonable: remember, significant change doesn’t happen overnight.It can help to set these goals in stages, too.


If you’ve decided to cut back on alcohol consumption, set yourself days when you will drink, and set aside days when you won’t. For example: “I will drink only on Saturday night and Wednesday afternoon. The other days I won’t drink.”
Make sure to set a limit on the number of drinks you will have, too. Write it down on a little card and keep it in your wallet or purse. For example: “On Saturday night, I will have no more than 3 beers. On Wednesday afternoon, I will have one cocktail.”
If you want to quit drinking altogether, set a deadline for yourself. For example: “By July 31, I will not be drinking any alcohol.”
If you’ve been a heavy drinker, be aware that stopping “cold turkey” can produce dangerous side effects. Withdrawal symptoms include anxiety, depression, irritability, fatigue, nausea and vomiting, insomnia, sweating, shakiness, headache, loss of appetite, hallucinations, confusion, seizures, fever, and agitation.“Tapering off” your alcohol use may be easier for you to maintain as you work toward your “no-alcohol” deadline.Some studies suggest that drinking a little every day (no more than 1 drink) may reduce your likelihood of bingeing., If you believe your drinking is a problem, you should speak with your healthcare provider. Your doctor can help you determine what will be the safest way for you to reduce or stop your drinking. S/he can also refer you to an alcohol specialist, such as a counselor or psychiatrist, if you decide that would be helpful. Before you see your doctor, put together some information:How often and how much you drink. Be honest; it isn’t your doctor’s job to judge you, and s/he can’t help you unless you are honest about your habits.
Any symptoms you experience, such as headache, nausea, depression, etc.
Personal information, such as any major stresses or life events (e.g., divorce, starting college, a new job, etc).
Medications, supplements, and vitamins you’re taking.

, As uncomfortable as the truth might be, if you’re struggling with your drinking and suspect you might need to quit, it’s important that you tell your close friends, family, and loved ones that you need to make a change. Surrounding yourself with supporting friends and loved ones will help keep you accountable and be a good first step in admitting that you've got a problem you need to work on.Tell your drinking friends that you're worried about your fun developing into a more serious problem. Emphasize that you aren’t judging anyone or asking anyone else to change their behavior. Ask them for their support, and express that you still want to socialize -- you just won’t be drinking (or drinking as much). For example: “I’m not liking some of the effects of my drinking. It’s interfering with my life in ways I don’t want, so I’m going to cut back for awhile. This decision is just for me. I still want to hang out with you guys; I’ll just have a Coke instead of a cocktail.”
If other people in your family also drink alcohol, consider whether having alcohol in your house would be an insurmountable temptation. If so, discuss your options with your loved ones. It may be necessary to completely remove alcohol from your home, especially if your goal is to completely stop drinking. If you convey the importance of this issue to your loved ones, they’ll probably be very supportive of whatever helps you.If your drinking feels more serious, ask your friends and loved ones to socialize with you in places that do not serve alcohol. Hanging out with friends in a bar if you really want a drink can be too much pressure.

, If you drink with the intention of becoming very drunk on a regular basis, it's important to confront the causes of that desire, so you can start healing yourself and avoiding temptations. What makes you want to drink? Does a particular event, person, or emotion make you want to get drunk?Peer pressure is a common trigger for binge-drinking, especially among younger people. About 90% of the alcohol consumed by people under the age of 21, for example, happens during binge-drinking.It can be tempting to drink to “fit in,” or to keep up with hard-partying friends. Friends who do not have a problem with their drinking (or who don’t recognize that they do have a problem) may pressure you to have “just one drink.” If your friends continue to binge-drink around you or pressure you to drink with them, you may need to stop socializing with them.Stress leads many people to drink. If you struggle with looking to alcohol to escape stresses of home life, or relationships, or of work, you might need to take serious steps to relax and find other more productive ways to channel that stress and control your emotions, rather than looking to drink for relief.
Boredom can cause lots of people to drink. If you're drinking alone on Friday nights not because you're depressed but because you can't think of anything else to do, or if you're constantly drinking to liven up regular activities like going to the grocery store, filling your time with more healthy and productive activities will become important.

, It may sound corny, but many of these questions can be tough to answer if you're a regular drinker and frustrated with yourself. Drinkers are often also in denial, and it's hard to figure out what makes you drink. Making a point of writing regularly about your drinking habits, though, can reveal information about you that you might not have been able to uncover just by thinking about it.


The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism has an “Urge Tracker” form that can help you record your urges, how you responded, and what you plan to do next time.
Think back to the last time you binged and write about what went on that day. What do you remember about the evening? What led up to it? What did you do the next day? How did you feel?
Keep track of how many times you drink over the course of a week. When did you want to drink? When did you think about drinking? Why did you want to drink? Stay focused on keeping track of your impulses so you can learn more about how you think.
You can also find mobile apps, such as the MyDrinkAware app, that will help you track your alcohol consumption. These can be helpful for when you’re out and about.

, After you've decided that you should cut back on alcohol or quit altogether, you need to set a concrete goal.If your goal is to quit completely, write out ""I will stop drinking alcohol on this date."" Set a specific date on which you will quit. This will give you a tangible target to aim for.
Perhaps you don't want to quit entirely, but for health reasons you decide you'd like to only drink on Friday and Saturday. This is called ""harm reduction."" Write out a goal like, ""As of this date, I will only drink on Fridays and Saturdays."" Again, it is important to set a concrete date for when this will start. Build up your ability to be aware of how many drinks you have consumed and how you are feeling in a given amount of time. Rather than choosing how many drinks to allow yourself, increase your ability to be aware of when you are drinking too quickly or drinking more when around strangers. The more you know about your drinking, the better you will be able to control it.
If you only plan on reducing your intake, you may or may not need a full detox. Depending on how heavily you currently drink, detox may still be necessary. Any significant reduction in an addictive substance can lead to withdrawal.

, Let the people around you know of your plans. This way, you can start building your support system for when you begin detoxing.Let the people around you know what you will require of them. It may be as simple as asking them to not offer you drinks, or you may need them to not drink around you at all. Whatever your needs are, make sure you are up front about them.
It is especially important to make your goals clear to friends who you used to drink with. Peer pressure causes many people to cave. If these people do not support your goal and pressure you to drink, you may need to distance yourself from them.

, When you start experiencing withdrawal symptoms, you may not be able to control your cravings. Avoid this temptation by keeping no alcohol in your home., Find and attend an Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meeting to gain support for quitting and to find others with similar issues. You can start going to meetings before you begin the detox, and continue attending throughout the process.

, Detoxing can be very dangerous if done improperly, so you should consult your doctor before proceeding. He will be able to tell you if self-detoxification is a good idea in your particular case. If you are a severe alcoholic, you may need medical attention in order to detox. Your doctor can also prescribe medications or suggest vitamins and supplements that will aid in your detoxification.Your doctor can also write a letter for medical leave to ensure you do not lose your job.

, A detox should absolutely not be done alone. There are a number of dangers associated with a detox and you may need medical help. While some people plan on detoxing alone and calling 911 if they need help, this isn't a safe plan. Withdrawal symptoms can progress very quickly and you could lose consciousness before you can reach the phone. This means you'll need someone there in case of emergencies. He will have to stay with you 24 hours a day for the first 3 days at least, and will have to check in on you regularly for the rest of the week., Detoxing won't be a pleasant experience. For heavy long-term drinkers, it can even be fatal if done improperly. You and the person staying with you should be prepared for the following symptoms to occur within a few hours of your last drink and last until day 3 or so. They can even last up to a week.Severe headache.
Night sweats.
Rapid heart rate.
Nausea and vomiting.
Dehydration.
Shaking.
Mental symptoms like confusion, irritability, depression, and anxiety.
More severe symptoms like hallucinations and seizures.
Delirium tremens (DTs)- These usually occur between 24 and 72 hours after the last drinks and are characterized by extreme agitation and disorientation, and body tremors. They most often affect people who have been heavy drinkers for a decade or more., The person staying with you should know when it's time to reach out for medical help. If you experience any of the following, your partner should either call 911 or take you to the emergency room.A fever of 101 or higher.
Seizures or convulsions.
Visual or auditory hallucinations.
Severe, constant vomiting or dry heaves.
Extreme agitation or violent outbursts.
DTs.

, You may not feel up to leaving your home, and your partner shouldn't leave you alone for the first few days. It's very important to have several days' worth of fresh food in your house along with several gallons of water for times. Freeze small dishes to make meals easily when you aren't feeling well. You'll want healthy foods to replace the nutrients you're losing by detoxing. Some good choices when shopping are:Fresh fruits and vegetables.
High-protein food like chicken, fish, or peanut butter.
Oats, to help control blood sugar.
Soup. People often lose their appetites during withdrawal, so soft foods like soup are good to have around.
Vitamin supplements. It is common for heavy drinkers to have vitamin deficiencies, so to stay healthy you'll have to replace these nutrients. Some good choices are vitamin B, C, and magnesium supplements. Only use supplements your doctor has approved.

, You will be in no shape to go to work while detoxing. It may take up to 7 days for the worst of the symptoms to subside, so if you begin on a Saturday, you should be prepared to stay home for the following business week.If your doctor thinks this is necessary, get him or her to write a letter for medical leave.

, In the early hours of the detox, you can write a letter from your drinking self to your sober self reflecting why you want to quit drinking, and your hopes for the future. When the physical withdrawal symptoms make the process tough, you can read this letter for motivation.Who do you hope to be? What are you ashamed of? Don't push away negative emotions. Write out who you are quitting drinking for, who you have hurt, how you have hurt yourself and those you love. Write out the values you'd like to live by and why.

, ""Grounding,"" which is similar to mindfulness, is a series of research-backed techniques that can help you get through extreme cravings by focusing on the present moment.When a craving hits, use your senses to ground yourself by noticing what's right in front of you. Keep going for as long as it takes for the craving to pass. You can rotate among several techniques if one isn't working. Practice the following techniques:


Describe the details of your environment without judging them. For example, you could notice that the carpet is thick and soft, the walls are blue, there's a crack in the ceiling, and the air smells fresh.
Distract yourself by naming items in a category, such as types of fruit or countries in alphabetical order.
Ground yourself physically by doing a simple exercise or running your hands over a textured surface.
Think pleasant thoughts: name your favorite foods or your favorite TV characters.
Think or say aloud a statement that helps you cope, like ""I've got this.""

, Withdrawal often causes vomiting and diarrhea, which can easily dehydrate you. Be sure to drink enough water to replace lost fluids. You could also drink sports drinks to replace lost electrolytes, but you or your partner should limit these to one or two a day at most. The high sugar content in these drinks can make symptoms worse in large doses., Although you will probably not have much of an appetite, you still need nutrients to get you through this. Don't force yourself to eat large meals- this could make you sick. Continue regular nutrient intake and eat the small frozen dishes if you are too weak to leave the house. Rather than snacks, focus on foods that will replace the nutrients you've lost while going through withdrawal., Staying locked inside for days will probably make you feel sicker. Sitting outside for just a few minutes and getting fresh air and sunlight can help you feel much better., You won't be in any shape to run a marathon or lift weights, but you should move around as much as you can. Staying sedentary is bad for your mental and physical health. Physical activity releases endorphins that help fight the depression and anxiety detoxing causes. Take short walks and get up to stretch once in a while to keep your body moving., Keep talking with your partner and let him know how you're feeling. This will not only pass the time, but it will let him know if he should consider getting medical help for you.

, Due to the physical and mental symptoms of alcohol withdrawal, people often cave during the detox process. This does not mean you're a weak person. It just means that you need to try again. If this is the case, you may require specialized supervision. Consider attending a rehab or detox facility to help you get through the process., Although your withdrawal symptoms should be gone in a week, you could feel some effects for several weeks. These include irritability, headaches, and insomnia., Recovering alcoholics often suffer from depression, anxiety, and numerous other psychological issues. It is therefore very important to address these problems with a therapist or counselor. If you detox physically but fail to address your mental health, your chance of relapse is very high.

, Although you've successfully detoxed, you'll need to build a support network to help you get through your continuing battle with alcohol. In addition to friends and family, a support group is a great resource. Many people in these groups have been through what you've been through, and can offer advice and support. Call them if you're feeling a craving or need any help., Your past activities probably included alcohol, so living a healthy life means finding new activities to replace your old ones.Think about activities you used to love but haven't done in a while. Reviving these old hobbies can be a great way to put you in a positive state of mind.
Also consider hobbies that give you a sense of purpose like volunteer work.

, Recovering alcoholics frequently replace alcohol with another substance like caffeine or tobacco. These addictions can be just as harmful. Instead of replacing your addiction, you need to focus on living your life without the addiction.

, You will inevitably experience cravings for alcohol. There are a few things you can do to properly manage this and avoid relapse.Avoid your triggers. If certain people, places, or situations give you the urge to drink, you should avoid them. If old friends always pressure you to drink, you may have to cut them out of your life.
Practice saying ""no."" You won't always be able to avoid every situation that involves alcohol, so you should prepare yourself to turn down a drink if it's offered.
Distract yourself when having a craving. You can do this by taking a walk, listening to music, going for a drive, or any other activity that helps you forget about the alcohol craving.
Talk to people. Be open about your cravings and don't try to hide them. If you have a sober sponsor or mentor, talk to him whenever you have a craving or are feeling weak.
Remind yourself why you quit drinking. When you get an urge, think about how hard it was to quit drinking and your reasons for doing so.

, Unfortunately, relapse is common among recovering alcoholics. But slipping up once doesn't mean you've failed. Use all the skills you've learned in this journey to successfully overcome this setback.Stop drinking right away and get away from wherever you were drinking.
Call your sponsor or a supportive friend and tell him what's happened.
Remember that this minor setback doesn't have to ruin all of your progress.

Pay attention to energy your energy level after you eat foods containing gluten.,
Examine your mental and emotional status after eating wheat or products containing wheat.,
Notice when headaches develop after a meal.,
Observe changes in your extremities.,
Watch for symptoms associated with poor digestive health.,
Make note of fluctuations in weight.,
Pay attention to prolonged changes in mental status.,
Keep detailed notes about any rashes that develop, including eczema.,
Keep track of women’s health issues such as irregular menstrual cycles, premenstrual syndrome (PMS), severe menstrual cramping, miscarriage and infertility.,
Make an appointment with your doctor to rule out celiac disease and gluten allergy.,
Speak with your doctor and inquire about diagnostic tests that can detect conditions related to gluten intolerance.,
Eliminate all gluten containing foods from your diet for 2 to 4 weeks.,
Keep a symptom tracker journal to note any changes that occur over the course of the diet.,
Reintroduce gluten into your diet after the elimination period has ended.,
Eliminate gluten permanently from your diet once you have discovered a likely gluten intolerance.",How to Recognize Gluten Intolerance," Occasionally, energy levels may slightly dip after consuming a large meal, while your body works to digest the food.


Because gluten intolerant individuals have to work harder to try to fight the effects in the digestive tract, they commonly feel fatigue after eating.

Unlike the occasional lethargy that may occur from time to time, people suffering from gluten intolerance may be completely exhausted after their meals.


, Many individuals suffering from gluten intolerance complain of irritability after eating.


Irritability may be related to fatigue or can occur as a result of feeling run down in general, similar to how one feels when sick with a cold or flu.

Some people with gluten intolerance report having a ""foggy mind"" right after they eat. In other words, they easily lose their train of thought and find concentration difficult.


, Headache symptoms are non-specific, and can mimic migraines, tension headaches or cluster headaches. While there is no specific type of headache associated with gluten intolerance, the headache pattern consistently occurs within 30 minutes to an hour after eating for many individuals.

, Often, people with gluten intolerance experience joint pain, and they sometimes experience numbness or tingling in their arms and legs.

, While people with gluten sensitivity tend to have more non-gastrointestinal symptoms than people with celiac, they can still experience GI discomfort. After a meal, they may experience bloating, gas, diarrhea, constipation and stomach pain., Gluten sensitivities are most notably associated with weight loss, but gluten intolerance can also result in unexplained weight gain over time.

, The onset of depression, behavioral changes or mood fluctuations can be caused by gluten intolerance. Include all details associated with your mental symptoms, including the severity of your symptoms and how often they occur.

, Photograph the rash if possible, and measure its circumference if the rash is in a localized spot. Make the following notes for yourself:


Describe the appearance and characteristics of the rash. Is it raised, flat, circular or blotchy? Do you notice blisters?
How does the rash feel? Is it itchy, painful or inflamed?
Which conditions make it worse? In other words does tight clothing, hot showers or baths, or humidity make the rash more irritating?

, Some doctors now routinely investigate the possibility of a gluten sensitivity in couples who are unsuccessfully trying to conceive and are suffering from unexplained infertility.

, These are 2 serious conditions that can cause long-term health complications if left untreated.



Gluten allergy: Symptoms include itching, swelling and irritation around the mouth; itchy rash or hives; nasal congestion and itchy eyes; cramps, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea; difficulty breathing and anaphylaxis. Gluten allergies are most common in children and are usually outgrown by the age of 5. A skin test or blood test can identify gluten allergies.Celiac disease: Celiac disease is an immune reactions that progressively destroys the nutrient-absorbing villi in your small intestine. Your body may not absorb nutrients properly, and your small intestine can become permeable, meaning that its contents leak into your gut. Celiac disease can be identified with a blood test and an intestinal biopsy.
If both tests are negative and you suspect you may be sensitive to gluten, a gluten intolerance may be the underlying cause.

, Although the tests cannot confirm a sensitivity to gluten, they can confirm the presence of some conditions that commonly occur as a result of gluten intolerance. Some related conditions include:


Low iron levels
Fat in the stool
Poor dental health due to malnourishment
Poor calcium absorption
Delayed growth in children

, Be on the lookout for hidden sources of gluten in salad dressings, condiments, soups, sauces and even cosmetics. Even vitamins and supplements can contain gluten. Always check ingredient labels on all food and cosmetic products.

, Revisit the symptoms pages and notice whether any of the listed symptoms have improved or disappeared since eliminating gluten from your diet.

, Pay attention to how you feel when you begin eating gluten again. If vanished symptoms return after you reintegrate gluten and you feel worse than you did when you were on the elimination diet, you may have confirmed a gluten intolerance.

, To correct the conditions that develop as a result of a gluten intolerance, you will need to eliminate the cause and not just treat the symptoms.


Replace gluten-containing foods such as wheat, barley, rye, semolina and spelt with comparable replacements that do not contain gluten, such as arrowroot, peanut flour, quinoa, rice flour and soy flour. Try these tips from the National Institutes of Health to learn what you can and can't eat.

Unlike a gluten allergy, which may improve eventually over time, a general intolerance to gluten is a permanent condition in most individuals.

Establish drinking ground rules for yourself.,
Get a sense of what “one drink” looks like.,
Slow down and make each drink last longer.,
Stay busy.,
Make yourself drink four times as much water as alcohol.,
Only drink with meals.,
Make it difficult to drink more.,
Set rigid time-lines for your drinking.,
Make other plans.,
Practice saying “no, thanks.” You will probably find yourself in situations where you’re offered a drink you don’t want, or encouraged to drink on a day you’ve set aside as a “day off” from alcohol.",How to Stop Binge Drinking2," It’s important to keep the goals you set in mind if you want to reduce your alcohol consumption. You can help yourself stick to these goals by setting ground rules that will guide your behavior whenever you’re in a situation where you may encounter alcohol. Every drinker's rules are different, and you have to find what works for you. Some guidance rules that might help the binge drinker become more casual include:


Never drink before parties or other social gatherings (i.e., no “pre-gaming”)
Never drink more than the “low risk” guidelines set by National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism:For women: no more than 3 drinks on a single day, and never more than 7 drinks per week
For men: no more than 4 drinks on a single day, and never more than 14 drinks per week


Only drink with other people, not by yourself
Stick to the limit goals you set for yourself (e.g., “only 2 beers on Saturday”)
Avoid drinking with others who binge-drink or have problems with alcohol
Never drink to relieve stress

, The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism has set standards for what counts as “one drink,” which will contain roughly 14 grams of alcohol. However, many people have no idea what a standard drink looks like. If you don’t know what 5 ounces of wine looks like, use a measuring cup with colored water to get a sense. Remember that the alcohol-by-volume (ABV) level determines what counts as “one drink,” so if you regularly drink things like “high-gravity” beer (which often has ABV ranges from 6-9%, but can be as high as 12%)calculate how much you’ve had by the alcohol content. One drink counts as:


12 ounces of regular beer or cider (5% ABV)
8-9 ounces of malt liquor (7% ABV)
5 ounces of wine (12% ABV)
1.5 ounces (1 shot) of hard liquor (80 proof)

, If you become quickly intoxicated and end up slamming back a bunch of drinks to ease your nerves, or if you're just a ""thirsty drinker,"" it can be very helpful to slow down and make each drink last longer. You will enjoy the taste of your drink more, and you will have fewer drinks over the space of your socializing.Aim to have no more than one drink per hour, depending on your tolerance. (For example, men can often drink more than women before they feel the effects of alcohol.)
Use a straw to sip cocktails. It will take you longer to drink them this way.
If you’re used to ordering pints, order a half pint instead. Sip it slowly rather than chugging it down.
Order your drink “on the rocks.” As the ice melts, it will dilute the drink. You’ll end up taking longer to finish it, and you’ll get a little extra water.Your body absorbs alcohol into your bloodstream much faster than you can metabolize it. The quicker you drink, the more time that alcohol spends buzzing around your body, doing damage that you’ll really regret during next morning’s hangover., A big reason for continuously drinking from whatever is in front of you is lack of activity and sitting or standing next to a drink. What else are you inclined to do if you are not moving about or participating in something? Dancing, talking, playing pool or darts, etc. can all keep you occupied over and above the drinking. Once you remove alcohol as the focus, you're less likely to drink as much.


Have a plan made in advance for what you will do if you can’t find something to keep you busy. For example, if you can’t distract yourself, determine whether you will politely excuse yourself and leave, find someone to chat with, or do something else to take your mind off drinking., Alcohol is a diuretic, meaning it dehydrates you. Your body can expel four times as much liquid as you consume in an alcoholic beverage.Drinking water will also mean that your alcohol consumption slows way down. The added hydration cuts down your chance of having a hangover the next morning, too.


For example, if you have a cocktail that has 2 ounces of alcohol, drink at least an 8-ounce glass of water before you have another alcoholic drink.
Try a “spacer” beverage between alcoholic drinks. Sipping a club soda or Coke between alcoholic beverages forces you to go more slowly, while giving you something to drink and fiddle with., ""Going out for drinks"" is a loaded proposition, because it means that you basically have to drink. It's what you went out for, after all. But, if you only allow yourself to drink with meals, it'll mean you can still enjoy the ritual of going out to bars and restaurants with friends, but with a limit on it for the length of a meal. Have a glass or two of wine with dinner, or drink a beer with your BBQ, but call it a night when your plate is clean.Drinking on an empty stomach makes a hangover much more likely. Eating a healthy meal before or during drinking slows down how fast your body absorbs the alcohol, giving your body more time to metabolize it. Fats and complex carbohydrates are especially good.When the meal's over, switch to coffee or sip water and call it a day. Don't continue drinking when you're done. If you're at a busy restaurant, it might be time to give up your table anyway, or you'll start getting dirty looks.

, If you've got to meet friends at the bar and are worried you won't be able to control yourself, take steps to actively make it impossible to drink more than you want to allow yourself to drink. Getting in your own way can help you stick to your goals even when your motivation wanes.


Only bring enough cash to pay for two drinks and leave your card at home. Look up the menu ahead of time and find out exactly what you'll be able to afford and only bring enough to pay for that, then call it a night.
Drink more expensive alcohol. For one thing, more expensive brands of alcohol have fewer congeners, a chemical that can contribute to hangovers. In addition, you won’t be able to have as many drinks if they’re pricier than what you usually spend.Don’t keep alcohol at home. If you're a regular after-work drinker and want to avoid plowing through a six pack every night, stop buying them and bringing them home with you. If they're sitting there in the fridge, it can be difficult to resist, so don't put them in the fridge.
Buy smaller glasses. It can be easy to overindulge if your glasses are too big. For example, a wine glass could actually hold far more than the 5 ounces that counts as “one drink.”You’re more likely to pour too much if your wine glass is wide, or if you hold the glass rather than setting it on a table., If you're going out with friends and have a tendency to want to always order one more, stay another hour, and push your drinking in the wee morning hours, an effective way of cutting back can be to set very rigid times for your drinking. If you're going out around nine to meet friends, don't stay out any later than midnight or one. Make it a particular time that's your ""pumpkin hour,"" or choose a particular number of hours that you can be out.


Setting a limit doesn't mean you should slam as many drinks as possible before your pumpkin-hour rolls around. Remember the end goal, or your goals aren't serving you.

, Fun doesn’t always have to involve alcohol. Instead of going out for drinks with your friends, suggest that you do something else. If you're worried you won't be able to resist at the bar, try to arrange to go to a movie, or check out a concert, or doing something else active instead of just hanging around the bar., Practice saying “no” in a polite but firm way.Make eye contact when you refuse the drink. This can help reinforce that you mean what you say.Keep your answer short and simple. Long winded answers or excuses tend to be unconvincing to others. Say something firm and to the point, such as: “No, thanks, I don’t want to” or “No, thanks, today’s my ‘day off’ from alcohol and I’d be really disappointed in myself if I broke that promise.”

Get rid of your access to alcohol.,
Expect physical side effects from withdrawal.,
Tell your loved ones about your goals.,
Talk to your doctor about disulfiram and other ""warm turkey"" methods.,
Find a drink replacement.,
Don't argue about quitting with people.,
Find a support group.",How to Stop Binge Drinking3," If you've got a full liquor cabinet, get rid of it. Pour out all the alcohol, recycle the bottles, give away your barware. Reminders of alcohol can trigger the desire to drink.If you always hit up the same bar on your way home from work, start taking a different route so you avoid it. Head straight home instead, or find another place to go to blow off some steam after work, like the gym.
Avoid the places you used to drink and get your friends to help you avoid alcohol for the time being. You may get to a place where you don't mind being in bars while your friends drink, but give it some time first. Avoid temptations as much as possible.

, You don’t need to drink every day to have developed a physical reliance on alcohol. Considerable binge drinking, even on an uneven basis, can lead to physical side effects if you stop drinking altogether. Even if you cut back, you may notice a variety of warning signs that, if you’re not careful, might lead you to stress out and drink to excess again. If you’re a regular binge drinker, it’s likely that you’ll experience any of the following physical symptoms:Sweating
Nausea
Headaches
Dizziness or shakiness
Insomnia

, You’ll need the support of family and friends to help you through this process. Let them know that you’re worried about your drinking, you don’t feel like you can drink “in moderation,” and you need to stop drinking entirely.If you face peer pressure or encounter friends who don’t support you, consider distancing yourself from them while you work on your drinking problem. Being around people who have their own problems with alcohol can make it very hard for you to stay on track., Disulfiram is a prescription drug that's designed to make drinking undesirable by producing hangover-like symptoms almost instantaneously by blocking the liver's ability to process alcohol.It can be extremely effective in fighting the desire to drink. Other mood-altering drugs are sometimes recommended by doctors, to help you manage stress and deal with your cravings. Talk with your general practitioner and find out what's a good idea for you.


If you struggle with other kinds of addiction, be careful when trying to stop. Quitting certain drugs, including cocaine, crack, heroin, and certain prescription drugs, must be managed under medical supervision. Drastic or sudden alterations in your consumption of these substances could cause severe medical complications, or even death., If you're psychologically tied to having that after-work beer, replace it with a healthier drink. Pour iced tea into a beer glass like you used to do and sit in the same spot and enjoy the same ritual, just without the alcohol. Soda, tea, coffee, smoothies, and other drinks can be healthier alternatives.

, If you decide to quit drinking entirely, it's likely that your friends–particularly friends that you drank with–will try to convince you that you don't have a problem, or want to debate the issue with you. It's best to avoid getting sucked into any kind of debate or discussion about whether you're ""overreacting"" or whether or not you really have a problem. It's nobody's business but your own., It's very difficult to quit on your own. Learn to lean on others and surround yourself with supportive friends and loved ones who will support you in your desire to quit drinking and will make the process easier on you.



Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is the most famous and one of the most successful ways of quitting drinking. Even if you don't consider yourself an ""alcoholic"" strictly speaking, going to a few meetings can be an excellent way of finding support and concrete steps to quitting.

Admit to yourself, and remember it, that there is absolutely nothing in your life more important than this one thing.",How to Quit Drinking Alcohol," If you choose to start the path to recovery alone, bear in mind that alcohol withdrawal can potentially be deadly. If you start experiencing severe withdrawal symptoms (panic attacks, severe anxiety, the shakes, rapid heart beat) you should seek immediate medical assistance. The condition could potentially deteriorate to delirium tremens, which is deadly, if left untreated.


Don't feel like you need to quit alone. You are carrying a heavy burden, but plenty of people (including people with medical degrees) want to help you. It's often easier to quit with the help of medical intervention than it is to try it cold turkey.
Doctors treating withdrawal from alcohol often prescribe benzodiazepines to help with symptoms.Benzodiazepines, which include alprazolam (Xanax), clonazepam (Klonopin), diazepam (Valium) and lorazepam (Ativan), are psychoactive drugs used to calm anxiety and quell panic.They are relatively safe and are rarely fatal when overdosed.;
, Remember, you're not being forced to give up a good friend who has treated you well. Instead, you are finally ridding yourself of an enemy. Adjust your attitude so that quitting is made easier. Your better half wants you to quit; your selfish half wants you to stay the same.

, Be ambitious, but reasonable. If you are very heavy drinker you must first slow down to avoid withdrawal symptoms (in this case it is best to have your doctor help you plan your quitting date).

, Don't feel that just because you are having guests over you need to offer them a beer, wine, or cocktail. It is perfectly fine to offer people tea, lemonade, coke, or the like.

, Cry when you need to. Laugh when you can. Eat when you are hungry. Sleep when you are tired. This is going to be really weird at first, but embrace it. You haven't felt your feelings for a long time. You will have a learning curve.

, There's an old saying about ""Playgrounds and Playmates"" — look at yours. You may need to leave some of your old drinking buddies and watering holes behind. That being said, it can be quite a revelation to find out that the friends you used to drink with were drinking with you only occasionally and were having two beers or two glasses of wine to your five.


Don't do anything you don't feel ready to do. If going to the beach is a time when you drank a lot, don't go this year. If going to a certain friend's home for dinner is a time when you drank a lot, get a rain check this time. Protecting your sobriety is the most important thing you are doing right now. Take care of you! Don't worry about everyone else right now.

, Rome wasn't built in a day. You're probably not going to kick your habit in a week, either. That's perfectly okay. Small victories beget bigger ones. In the beginning, simply try to reduce the amount of alcohol you consume. Going straight from a heavy drinker to cold turkey is a recipe for physical and emotional disaster.


Imagine that due to excess alcohol, you are vomiting and having paralyzing headaches. If you've felt this way before while drinking, try to summon those memories. The pain you feel is good: it's a willingness to change your habits, and that's the first step.
Even if you only reduce your daily drinking by one drink, it's a success. No step is too small at this point. A mistake here is getting comfortable only curbing your drinking by one drink. Keep working on reducing the alcohol you consume. Every week, cut down the total number of drinks by at least one. If you want to be more ambitious, try halving the number of drinks you allow yourself each week.

, Eating a meal before drinking will reduce your interest for drinking. It will also make it harder to get drunk. If you do this, don't trick yourself into letting your body get as drunk as you would have if you hadn't eaten — although very clever, that's what we call cheating!

, Water will help keep you hydrated, make you feel better, and help flush out toxins from your body. Men are advised to drink 12 cups (3.0 liters) of water a day, and women are advised to drink 9 cups (2.2 liters)., This will make it harder for you to justify having alcohol in your house. Use non-alcoholic sparkling wine instead, or cut that part out of the recipe.

, Most people do not drink like alcoholics do. They are not like us and therefore they cannot understand the fact that we truly have a problem with alcohol. Of course, there are others who have the problem too. Either way, people will say ""You don't have problem!"" When you do quit drinking, just say ""No thanks, I'll have water — I'm trying to watch my weight."" If you hang out with them very much they'll figure it out — and they'll think ""Good for him!""

, If you religiously start drinking right after work or when you go home, change your routine to involve another activity. Visit your parents or a friend. A little change of scenery will help break the cycle of addiction.


Buy a planner and plan activities during the times when you would normally drink. Idle hands are the devil's workshop, right? If you plan activities with other people, it'll be harder to get drunk. If you write those activities down in a planner, you'll be more likely to do them.

, Many people will find excuses like, “I’ve been drinking for so long, it probably won’t make any difference,” or “I’ve tried so many times, I just can’t do it.” Some will feel hopelessly defeated if they find that they have something highly progressive like cirrhosis of the liver. Quitting drinking can extend life no matter what’s going on. How long it extends is entirely up to you. Don't justify not quitting to yourself. Quitting justifies itself.


You should remind yourself that if you were willing to try quitting so many times in the past, you have the ability to try again. There is no age limit nor is it ever too late to try to quit drinking. Even if the last thing that you do is quit, the victory of quitting pays for itself and gives hope to other people.

, Some people will feel a sense of foolishness and guilt over not having done something sooner. Don’t pass blame on anyone. Alcohol is the enemy. It has been whispering in your ear and telling you that it’s more important than anything else in your life. There is nothing more important than you. You are of no use to anyone if you die. Hence, you must overthrow the oppressive rule of alcohol and start fresh, just as any country in revolution.


Feeling guilty is only half of the equation. If you're just getting sober because you feel guilty, you're getting sober for the wrong reasons. You should be getting sober because you care about yourself, you care about the happiness of your family and friends (who care deeply about you), and you care about leaving an impact on the world. Guilt is only half the reason you should be quitting.

, Whenever you think about buying a bottle or a drink, put that amount of money in your sober wallet. It will literally shock you. Staying sober is all about seeing the tangible benefits of sobriety, which we too often don't get to see. Getting a sober wallet will help make those benefits more tangible.


Use the money in your sober wallet for healthy stress relief: get a massage, visit to a day spa, join a yoga class. If you're not into those things, buy yourself a healthy distraction like CD box set, a new set of furniture, or some gifts for your friends.

, Get a ring or bracelet, or henna your hand, or indulge in a special manicure to remind yourself that your hands no longer buy or touch alcohol.

, Alcohol affects the ability of the body to absorb these vitamins, specifically thiamine.Deficiency can cause severe cognitive impairment, including Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome or wet brain., Without involving alcohol, make a list of ways to ""do"" all the things you did when you used to get drunk. Make a list of ways to celebrate. A list of ways to have a romantic dinner. A list of ways to relax and unwind. A list of ways to be sociable. Many people live fulfilled lives without using alcohol as a crutch; convincing every fiber of your body that it's possible makes that jump so much easier.

, Do you really want to be that person again? Don't fall into the mindset that you're forever going to be that person. You will forever be an alcoholic, but that doesn't mean that you can't be a happy, sober, and well-adjusted alcoholic. That's your goal.

, Embrace how good it feels to go to sleep at night without slipping into a coma, only to awaken at 3 in the morning with a desert for a mouth and a splitting headache. Embrace how good it feels to remember the people you met the previous night, and to recall their happiness at meeting you. Embrace how good it feels love yourself for who you are, not punish yourself for who you have become.

, Cherish your reasons. We don't always have reasons for acting the way we do — you may not have had very many when you were struggling — but when we do, they give us meaning and make us principled. That's a good thing. What are your reasons for staying sober?


""I never want to miss work because I have a hateful hangover again.""
""I never want to embarrass my child in front of her friends again.""
""I never want to be ugly to my spouse because I've had one too many again.""
""I never want to get a DUI (again).""
""I never want to drunk dial my friends and relatives and act like an idiot again.""
""I never want to hide bottles all over the house again.""
""I never want to have to pretend I remember what happened the night before when I don't recall anything after X o'clock again.""
""I don't want to lose this marriage the way I lost my first marriage to the ravages of alcohol again.""
Or ""I wonder what it would be like to feel good again.""

, Instead approach them with a good attitude and remember that you can have a good time without drinking. On the other hand, if you know the temptation will be too great, don't put yourself in a situation where you are likely to slip up. Be smart about your limitations — everyone has them.

, Memorize a prayer, poem or something (i.e. Hamlet's speech ""To be, or not to be"") to repeat to yourself when you are losing your mind; remembering and reciting it will keep your head together sometimes.


Here are just a few inspirational quotes that you might find help you calm your thoughts:

""Health is the greatest gift, contentment the greatest wealth, faithfulness the best relationship."" - Buddha

""Believe you can and you're halfway there."" - Theodore Roosevelt

""I believe that laughing is the best calorie burner. I believe in kissing, kissing a lot. I believe in being strong when everything seems to be going wrong. I believe that happy girls are the prettiest girls. I believe that tomorrow is another day and I believe in miracles."" - Audrey Hepburn



, In the beginning, this makes a bigger-than-expected difference. Wrap the presents up (or don't, it's your call!) and give them to a friend or family member you trust for safe-keeping. Check in with your friend when you've completed one hour, or day, or week of sobriety and redeem your present. Allow your friend or family member to share in your joy.

, Do meditation regularly especially in the morning. At the end of the session, vow not to drink alcohol. Remember your calm mind of meditation later when you feel like drinking. It will distract you.


Pick up yoga! It will help you deal with stress and calm your mind. Best of all, yoga can be done in a group setting where you can feed off of the energy of other people. Embrace that positive energy.

, It may be the hardest part of your path to recovery, but telling your family or spouse what you are going through and what you are trying to achieve is a huge step. Like it or not, few people achieve sobriety alone, and even fewer sustain it alone. Don't feel inadequate about telling your family and friends what you are dealing with.


Set guidelines for what you'd like your friends and family to accept. If you're game, ask them to take alcohol from you if they see you drinking it. Ask them to be your better half and help you get back closer to sobriety.

, But do not feel guilty or defeated if you do not find AA to be a fit for you. It is not for everyone. Most people who quit do so without the help of AA. The vast majority of people who have quit drinking and put that phase of their lives behind them have done so by making a conscious commitment to themselves to stop drinking once and for all - and never look back.


AA, however, can be extremely effective in helping you stay sober once you've decided that's the lifestyle you want to chase after. One study found that recovering patients attending AA and NA programs had an 81% abstinence rate, compared to a 26% abstinence rate among non-attendees.That's a difference of over 50%.
Consistency of attendance matters. The more you attend programs like AA, which teach total abstinence from alcohol, the less likely it is that you'll relapse.Abstinence programs almost become a routine that members are addicted to, except that this addiction is sustainable and life-affirming.
Abstinence programs fit you with a sponsor. A sponsor is someone, preferably not your ""friend,"" who you can lean on whenever your sobriety is being threatened. A sponsor should be able to tell you when you're making a mistake and not mince words. Addicts with sponsors find it exponentially easier to stay sober than addicts without sponsors., After 90 days of complete sobriety, your whole outlook will be changed and your body will be in full recovery mode. You will likely have lost weight; you will likely feel more energized and happier about who you are. You will be like a completely different person.

, Anytime you feel weak, tempted, or pessimistic, reach out to someone you know you can trust. (It's really hard to swallow and talk at the same time.) Lean on them. Maybe it's a sponsor, maybe it's a friend; maybe it's mom. Whoever it is, learn how to open up to your feelings and overcome them instead of stifling your feelings and never truly dealing with them.


Once you're ready, share your experiences with other people in need. Maybe you agree to talk to high-school children about your addiction and its aftermath. Maybe you write a heartfelt message and post it online. Whatever you do, try to pay all the help you were given forward. Even if you only get through to one person, you've done more than enough.

, Your life depends on it. All the people you love share in it. You, yourself, deserve it.

"
Make yourself accountable.,
Avoid people who make you want to drink.,
Surf your urges.,
Manage your stress levels.,
Find new hobbies and interests.,
Start exercising.,
Reward yourself for periods of sobriety.",How to Stop Binge Drinking4," Find a way to keep yourself honest. Drinkers are often adept liars, often making lots of excuses to rationalize excessive drinking. Doing things like keeping an alcohol journal and setting clear, specific goals will help you keep yourself on track.


Keep track of any slip-ups. For example, if you drank on an “off day” or had more than your set limit of drinks, note it down.
Tell a particular person, a close friend who you'll trust to not judge you, but who you know you can't hide things from. Confide in this person.
Go to support group meetings regularly. Knowing you’ll have to be accountable to your group friends may help keep you on the wagon.

, If you used to drink a lot socially, or used to hang around people who drove you to drink to excess for whatever reason, you might need to sever ties completely, or at least significantly restrict your access to these people.People you might need to avoid include:


Heavy drinkers
One-up drinkers, or competitive drinkers
Stressful friends
Toxic relationships

, Sometimes, you will experience the urge to drink, and there’s no way around it. Rather than fight the urge, accept that you’re feeling it and then ride it out. Remember that the urge can only rise so far before it breaks and falls, just like a wave.Accepting your urge doesn’t mean giving in to it. Instead, it means that you’re not struggling in vain to “make” yourself have a different feeling.
Take a physical inventory. Take a few moments to breathe deeply and focus your attention on your body. Notice where you feel that craving, and how it manifests. For example, maybe you feel your craving most strongly in your mouth and nose, or perhaps your hand feels twitchy.
Focus on one area where you find yourself experiencing this urge. Pay close attention to your physical sensations. Make statements that describe how you feel, but keep them judgment-free: you’re not here to make yourself feel bad, just to understand what your body’s doing. For example: “My mouth feels really dry. I feel like having a beer would be so cold and refreshing. I keep swallowing and I’m imagining the bubbles going down my throat.”
Repeat this process with each part of your body that’s experiencing your craving. With time and practice, your urge may not go away, but you’ll be much better at understanding how to wait it out.

, Find healthier ways to process your stress that don't involve drinking alcohol. Stress can be a reason that we drink, and can act swiftly and powerfully in forcing us to give up our principles and take a drink. You might have several months on the wagon, but one terrible day at work or a bad argument with your partner can make a beer sound awfully good. Find other ways to process that stress and that frustration without turning to the bottle.Recognize when you’ve got a craving for a drink, based on a stress-induced situation. If you’ve just gotten off a long and frustrating shift at work after getting chewed out by your boss, it might be tempting to swing by the bar on the way home. Instead, find another activity to do when confronted with the same scenario. Maybe you head to the park and shoot hoops, or head to the gym and lift heavy stuff, or head to the basement and throw darts at an effigy of the boss. He’ll never know.
Instead of drinking, call your supporting friend and talk about how you want to have a drink. Be accountable before you slip. Talk out your craving and help make it disappear together. Come up with a distraction and get distracted. The craving will pass.

, If you used to spend a lot of your free time drinking with friends, sobriety can seem kind of boring at first. What else is there to do? Find new hobbies and productive ways to spend all that time you used to spend drinking.


Take up creative projects you've always meant to get down to. Write that book you've always wanted to write, or pick up the guitar, or learn how to knit. Develop a new creative skill that will get you enthusiastic and motivated to do other things.
If you can, try to join social groups that will allow you to spend time with people in a social setting that doesn't involve drinking. Join a hobby club, or a bowling league, or a kickball group. Make new friends doing a joint venture together.

, Getting physical can make the idea of drinking to excess seem terrible by comparison. If you get excited about getting in shape, getting sweaty, and losing weight, you'll hardly waste any time thinking about taking a drink.


Moderate-intensity aerobic exercise has been shown to have positive effects for recovering alcohol abusers.Aerobic exercise also improves symptoms of anxiety and depression, which can be triggering for alcohol abuse.Mindfulness meditation is also helpful for people who are recovering from alcohol abuse.Mindfulness meditation focuses on observing what your body and thoughts are doing in a non-judgmental way. It can help you acknowledge urges without having to automatically follow through on them.
Competing at team sports can provide a healthy distraction. If you're shooting hoops with your friends, or playing tennis, or swimming, you can spend quality time that doesn't involve drinking.

, Set up a series of rewards for yourself for given periods of sobriety. At the end of the first week, take yourself out for a great meal. At the end of the first year, tell yourself you'll take that trip abroad that you've always wanted to take. Give yourself an incentive to get to the next rung on your sober ladder.

Observe symptoms that indicate an allergic reaction.,
Follow these guidelines to recognize allergic reactions


It is commonly believed that peanut allergies tend to be more severe that other food allergies.,
Write down all the foods that the person ate in the hours leading up to the reaction, including amounts and ingredients.,
Check ingredient labels.,
Visit an allergist or immunologist.,
Go through allergy testing.,
Take a skin prick test.,
Take a blood test.,
Take an oral challenge.,
Use the double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge as a last resort.,
Get a prescription for an Epipen.,
Talk with family members, caregivers, and school officials about the allergy.,
Read labels carefully.,
Expect a peanut allergy if the individual has an anaphylactic reaction.,
Get immediate medical attention with anaphylaxis.",How to Recognize Peanut Allergies," Peanut butter is a staple food for school age children because of it's nutritional values and low cost. It's important to determine if your child is allergic before sending them to school where exposure is likely unless precautions are made in advance.


A young child with no family history of food allergies does not need a formal medical food allergy test regime.

Children of peanut allergic siblings were studied and assessed with an ImmunoCap study to check for the allergy to peanuts. The study indicated that a peanut allergy was markedly and significantly increased in siblings of peanut allergic patients.Allergies are believed to not appear until the 2nd exposure or later. Upon the first exposure the body may determine if the food is 'safe' or not, so small and gradual food introduction over weeks time may be the best approach, just like introducing any new food to a baby.
The mucus membranes may be sensitive if the person is highly allergic, so eating the food is not always a requirement to test. First check to see if you child has an aversion to the odor (sinus pain or sneezing), any skin reaction on the back of the hand, or any burning or tingling with the food on the lips.
With any high risk, top-8 food it's best to take it slow, because once the allergen is in the stomach, you aren't going to get it all out even if they vomit.;
,
Some allergic responses to food can happen within about two hours of eating the food.Others, such as anaphylaxis, can happen within minutes.
If the allergy symptoms are on the mild end of the scale, track how much time elapsed between eating the food and developing the symptoms.

,


Pay attention to other allergies. Between 25% and 35% of those allergic to peanuts have allergies to tree nuts as well. If the individual is presenting allergy symptoms when he eats tree nuts he may also be allergic to peanuts.

, If you suspect a peanut allergy, check the labels on foods that have been recently consumed. Peanuts are often included in processed and prepared foods or certain batches of food may be exposed to cross contamination in the factory.

, If you or your doctor suspects you have a peanut allergy, you should make an appointment with an allergist or immunologist right away. This professional will first obtain a thorough history and physical. The focus of this appointment will be the response you experience when you encounter peanuts or tree nuts.


Accommodating food allergies can have a profound effect on lifestyle, quality of life and mental health. It is important to be prepared for a possible allergic reaction, but to also not live in fear based only on tests which may have false positive results.
Ask about possible desensitization treatments called Immunotherapy to reduce the risk of a severe reaction from a small accidental exposure. There are several different Immunotherapy protocols, some of which are still in clinical trials.

, There are several immunologic tests that can be administered to provoke the IgE response. This response will help assess the scope of the peanut allergy, but ultimately the only way to be absolutely certain is with an Oral Challenge test.


If the patient has had anaphylaxis previously the doctor may choose to start with blood testing to avoid the risk of triggering that reaction again. Typically skin prick testing is the first to be performed.

, This test involves exposing you to a potential allergen. The possibility exists that you may experience anaphylaxis. Therefore, this test is done under close supervision of a skilled allergist and immunologist who are also skilled at treating anaphylaxis.


The allergist will perform an initial diagnostic, exposing you to common allergens. A small amount of calibrated solution will be placed on the skin and a special tool will painlessly make a shallow scratch.
The allergist will diagram the scratch sites, to keep track of which area is injected with which allergen.
You will be monitored for any acute and dangerous response that requires immediate attention. Otherwise, the injection sites are checked for the presence of a “wheal,” or raised itchy area, which would indicate an allergy.

, The allergist will draw blood to be used for IgE response testing. This type of test has the benefit of causing no potential risk to the patient, as the patient is not exposed to the potential allergen. Blood testing tends to have some false positive results.


Ask if newer RAST or ImmunoCap blood testing for Peanut is available. The ImmunoCap test is a second generation RAST test that measures a person’s IgE levels to an allergen.

These tests may not yet be covered by your medical insurance. Ask if you can pay out of pocket if you are interested or if your health clinic will not perform the test ask where else you can go to get tested.
The peanut protein is presented in the laboratory with the patient’s blood sample. Radio labeled human IgE human antibody is added and the antibodies will combine to the allergen. RAST testing is ranked on 0-6 scale. With zero indicating no sensitivity and six is highest sensitivity.
A RAST of 3 or less requires more specific testing such as an oral challenge to confirm the allergy.


It is important to ask about the rate of false positive results during basic blood or skin prick testing.

, This is the only way to be absolutely certain an allergy does not exist. Since most Peanut allergies are severe with a high risk of anaphylaxis this testing should only be done in a supervised medical environment that can provide emergency treatment if required.


You will start with small doses of the allergen, starting with exposure to only the lips before swallowing. After each dose there is a waiting period, then the next dose is increased until a certain threshold is reached or until a reaction occurs.
After the last dose you will need to wait four hours to ensure there is not reaction before you are released.

, This test, called DBPCFC for short, is used to confirm a specific allergy. This is also the testing used to determine eligibility to participate in clinical trials. This test is costly and time-consuming.


The patient will need to go through two oral food challenges that are at least one week apart. In one challenge the patient is given allergen and in the other a placebo. Neither the patient nor the allergist knows which capsule has the allergen, which helps to eliminate the potential for false reactions. It can be useful for avoiding unnecessary elimination diets by pinpointing the exact allergen that affects a person., An Epipen auto injects epinephrine to counteract an anaphylactic reaction. If there is the possibility of anaphylaxis, get a prescription for this medical device.


Be sure to always have your Epipen with you. For children, it is useful to have one at school and the other at home to bring with them wherever they go. Adults and adolescents should carry their Epipen with them at all times.
Discuss with your doctor the proper technique for injection.

, It’s vital that you cultivate a community that can protect the individual with the peanut allergy. Take special care at school. A substantial proportion of food allergies occur in school, and these reactions can be fatal. Over a two-year period, schools can expect that approximately 18% of students with food allergies will have at least one reaction at school.Educate the school nurse, family members, and caregivers as to the prompt use of the Epipen in the event of possible ingestion of peanuts.

, It’s important to become very familiar with how to read labels. Manufacturers are required to include peanuts on food labels if there is any exposure. This includes phrases such as “may contain peanuts” or “made in a facility that shares equipment that processes peanuts.”, Anaphylaxis can be caused by more than just peanut allergies, such as bee stings.Food allergies comprise the leading cause of anaphylaxis in children under age four who are given emergency medical help.Assume that a person has a peanut allergy until he can be tested by an allergist.


In the United States, there are roughly 30,000 episodes of anaphylaxis, 2,000 hospitalizations, and 200 deaths per year., If an individual has an anaphylactic reaction, she should be taken to the emergency room immediately. She will also need an immediate injection of epinephrine from a medical device like an Epipen. The doctor may perform one or more of the following procedures on the affected individual. In 90% of cases, these procedures will prevent the patient’s death from anaphylaxis.


The individual will receive an IV of epinephrine in the emergency room.
The patient will be placed on a ventilator if she is experiencing respiratory failure or laryngospasm, which indicates that respiratory failure is forthcoming. It is crucial that the person is intubated (a tube will be placed in the trachea) before the larynx begins spasms and will not permit intubation.The patient may receive H2-blockers such as Pepcid or Zantac via IV, which will decrease a histamine response.
The patient may receive blood pressure support with vasopressors if need be. Delays in recognition of anaphylaxis were associated with delays in administration of epinephrine. Even in cases where anaphylaxis was quickly identified and the patient was quickly treated with epinephrine injection, 10% still died.The person will likely be observed for several hours either on the medical wards or in the ER after the reaction, as a second, delayed response may manifest in a few hours. This observation period is vital to ensure a safe discharge.

Identify first if you have a shopping addiction.,
Identify next if that problem extends into a credit card addiction.,
Weigh your different treatment options.,
Take additional personal steps toward your recovery.

,
Make a shopping list when you go out, and only purchase what you need and what appears on that list.

,
Get rid of the majority of your credit cards.,
Only go window shopping after the stores close for the day, and if you feel the need to do so while open, then leave your wallet at your house.

,
Avoid the shopping networks on television.

,
Create a substitute behavior for when the urges hit you.",How to Treat a Credit Card Addiction,"


Shopping addiction occurs when your purchases start to become inappropriate, excessive or out of control.
Shopping addiction stems from a lack of impulse control.
Shopping addictions often elicit feelings of a high or a rush. This happens when the endorphins and dopamine in the body kick in, which can in turn reinforce the behavior because addicts want to get to that state or feeling again.
Other warning signs are spending over your budget, compulsive buying, if the problem persists over time, hiding the problem, purchasing and then taking items back out of guilt, or if the problem is impairing your relationships.;
,


Look at your credit card use. Are you using credit cards for most all of your purchases?
Are you only making the minimum payment on your credit cards?
Are you hiding your credit card bill from your significant other?
Are you juggling your credit card balances and your interest rates to stretch out the time in which you need to pay?
Do you make a habit of purchasing items and then returning them? You buy them on impulse but realize when you get home that you can't afford them. Then the guilt drives you to take them back.
Do you shop when you are in a bad mood?
Have you been unsuccessful when you try to stop your compulsive spending?

,


Consider one-on-one personal therapy. This can be the most costly option, but a counselor can help address your impulse control issues and give you alternate suggestions for when you are feeling the urges.
Try a support group. Debtors Anonymous is a support group set up to help people recover from compulsive debt issues.
Seek financial counseling. This step should and can be done in conjunction with other treatment methods, particularly if you have amassed a large amount of credit card debt. Knowing how start making payments appropriately can help alleviate fears, and it can be a starting point to healing wounds within families caused by debt and deception.

Schedule exercise at regular intervals.,
Experiment with different types of exercise.,
Exercise while breaking your addiction.,
Add exercise to other addiction treatment methods.,
Don’t be intimidated.,
Set realistic goals.",How to Use Exercise to Help You Overcome Addiction," Walking can boost dopamine levels. Dopamine is the neurotransmitter that the brain produces when experiencing pleasure. When you engage in addiction behavior, your dopamine production increases – what’s why it feels good to “get high.” But you can also feel good by walking around the block or hiking in the woods.Walking about can also produce new brain cell growth to replace the ones that were killed during your addiction behavior.;
, Strength training basically involves lifting weights. Free weights, bench presses, and weightlifting machines can all help you burn fat. And most importantly for you as an addict, strength training can help you adjust your sleep schedule. Addicts often suffer from insomnia due to their addiction. Strength training can help you reset your sleep cycle so that you get a good night’s sleep., Yoga is a form of exercises that improves strength and balance. It also increases dopamine levels. Yoga can help you by making you less stressed, less anxious, more focused on overcoming your addiction.Traditional yoga, which focuses on a series of strength-building poses and actions is helpful. But you might find restorative yoga useful, too. Restorative yoga incorporates meditation into the mix, helping you become more mindful and reflective on your own addiction experience, and helping you find ways to center yourself to fight cravings.Look in the yellow pages for yoga centers in your area, or ask a friend for a recommendation.

, Sports teams will help you rebuild the social circle that you may need to abandon when you give up your addiction. Contact your local community athletics or public health department to find out what sort of team sports are available in your municipality. If you’re in school, you could contact the coach of the team you’re interested in and inquire about trying out for the team., Even if you don’t join a sports team, you can still play team sports. Find friends or family who don’t use drugs (or who won’t influence you to engage in addiction behaviors) and invite them to a game of soccer or rugby.Finding ways to bond with others that don’t involve addiction can help you forge new relationships and feel more a part of society.

, Addicts often have poor sleep schedules. You may have even developed insomnia.Exercise can realign your sleeping habits to ensure you get a better, more fulfilling night’s sleep. If you’re an addict looking to correct your sleeping habits through exercise, your best bet is to engage in some moderate-intensity aerobic activity like walking or riding your bike., A common side effect in addicts is anxiety, though some people become addicts in order to cope with their preexisting anxiety.In either case, exercise can help you treat the anxiety you may experience alongside your drugs addiction.There’s no specific form of exercise that will help you cope with anxiety, so do whatever you enjoy most. However, you may find your anxiety reduced if you become more mindful of what you’re doing during exercise. For instance, if you’re playing baseball, feel the sun shine on your face. Keep your eye on the ball as it comes toward you and note the direction of its spin. Feel the impact as you catch it in your glove.

, One of the common side effects of quitting drugs or other substances is weight gain.In order to avoid this unhappy result, you should use exercise to keep your weight down. All you have to do is know how many calories you need, how many calories you’re taking in, and how many calories you’re burning.Talk to a doctor if you’re curious about whether or not you’re at a healthy weight. If you are, you should still exercise regularly, but you don’t need to adjust your weight.
If you’re overweight, simply calculate the number of calories you eat in a given day. You can do this by finding calorie totals in the nutrition facts label on the side of packaged foods, or looking up calorie values for fresh foods online. You could also get a fitness tracker like FitBit to help you count your calories.
Count the amount of calories you burned. Use a fitness tracker or an exercise calorie counter like the one available at https://www.healthstatus.com/calculate/cbc to figure out how many calories you expended during exercise.
To lose weight, the calories you take in each day must not exceed the calories you burn through exercise and other activities.

, Just as addiction behavior occurs at regular intervals, so too should you get regular “doses” of exercise. The number of doses you require to help you overcome your addiction depends on you. You should aim to get at least 2.5 hours of exercise weekly, but you might require more. For instance, perhaps exercising 5 hours each week will help you better overcome your addiction than exercising 2.5 hours each week.Experiment with different exercise schedules. Perhaps you can start out by exercising one hour each week, then increase the time devoted to exercise to two hours each week, then three hours each week. Monitor your feelings relative to your addiction at each commitment level. If you find that more exercise is making it easier to overcome your addiction, increase your level of exercise until you’ve conquered your addiction.

, Depending on your personality and addiction, you might find that different forms of exercise affect how well you can overcome your addiction. For instance, if you ride a bike, you might have little to no need to engage in addiction behavior. But if you go for a swim, you might find that your urge to engage in addiction behavior is only slightly decreased. Try a mixture of activities and record your reactions as they relate to your addiction behavior and urges.Emphasize physical activities that help you significantly, and minimize or avoid physical activities that don’t help you as much.

, Don’t use exercise merely to help you cope with addiction after you’ve already kicked your habit. Instead, incorporate exercise into your routine as one part of your addiction treatment program.As you gradually begin to wean yourself away from your addiction behavior, exercise just before you feel that you are about to give in to your addiction cravings. You might be less interested in your addictive behavior if you go a long period without engaging in your addiction and then exercising.
For instance, go about 15 hours without smoking a cigarette, then run or ride your bike for 15 minutes., Your best bet to overcoming addiction is not to rely on any particular method to overcome your addiction. Don’t go exclusively to group meetings, don’t exclusively attend therapy – and don’t exclusively exercise. Instead, make exercise one outlet among an array of others that help you overcome your addiction.If you need help figuring out how to devise a personalized drug treatment program, talk to your physician.

, You might think that in order for exercise to be useful in your fight to overcome your addiction, you’d have to do a whole lot of it. But in fact, exercising even a little bit can help you overcome your addiction. Try to walk for 15 minutes each day. Gradually increase your speed until you’re running 15 minutes each day. Then gradually increase the length of time you run for.Try to get at least 2.5 hours of exercise each week.

, Any effective exercise regimen begins with setting realistic goals. If you set unrealistic goals – for instance, running five miles each time you engage in your addiction behavior – you won’t be able to meet them. But if you set realistic goals based on an honest assessment of what you’re able to accomplish, then exercise can be a useful way to reaffirm a sense of self-control and self-confidence."

Acknowledge that the relationship will change.,
Determine what you want to say.,
Be prepared for all reactions.",How to Tell Your Partner About Your Gambling Addiction1," Prior to telling your partner, understand that the relationship between the two of you will be different after you tell them. Depending on the extent of your gambling addiction, you may have done things that you are not proud of and that will hurt your partner. Just be prepared to face any relationship changes.The change doesn’t necessarily have to be negative. However, you may have to work through some hurt and distrust from your partner.
Before you tell your partner, make a commitment to the relationship and making it stronger as you both deal with your addiction.;
, Telling your partner about your addiction may be a very stressful situation for you. To help you when you are telling them, prepare what you want to say ahead of time. Practice what you want to say with a trusted friend, family member, or your therapist.Write down what you want to say. You can write an entire speech, or you may want to make bullet points of things you want to make sure you cover. Writing down your ideas and having them with you may help if you get in the heat of the moment and are too upset to think straight.

, When you tell your partner about your reaction, you should prepare for any reaction. Because gambling addictions can lead to serious financial and legal consequences, your partner may have a negative reaction. Your partner may have feelings of shock, outrage, concern, fear, or confusion. Whatever the reaction, be prepared for them.Your addiction affects both of you, so you should respect and be understanding of your spouse’s reaction.
Your partner may not be understanding or what to help you at first. Realize it may take awhile for your partner to come to terms with your addiction.

Know who is at risk.,
Watch for shortness of breath.If you have mitral valve regurgitation, the backflow of blood through your mitral valve will compromise effective circulation and oxygenation throughout your body.,
Take note of your energy level.In addition to shortness of breath, the decreased effectiveness of circulation from mitral valve regurgitation can lead you feeling more tired than usual.,
Tell your doctor if you are experiencing ""palpitations"" (unusual heartbeats).Palpitations are sometimes felt as unusually forceful heartbeats.,
Look out for swelling of your lower legs, ankles, and/or feet.Another possible sign of mitral regurgitation is swelling of your lower extremities.,
Be aware that you may present with no signs or symptoms.Many cases of mitral regurgitation have no observable signs or symptoms.,
Have your heart listened to with a stethoscope.If you have mitral regurgitation, your doctor may be able to hear a heart murmur (the sound of blood flowing backward through your mitral valve) when he listens with a stethoscope.,
Opt for a chest x-ray.If you present to your doctor with symptoms related to your cardiovascular and/or respiratory systems, she will most likely order a chest x-ray.,
Receive an echocardiogram.The most accurate way to diagnose mitral regurgitation — as well as to assess the severity of the condition — is via an echocardiogram.,
Ask your doctor for other investigative tests as needed.An echocardiogram is usually sufficient to diagnose mitral regurgitation and to delineate the degree of regurgitation.,
Classify which type of mitral regurgitation you have.,
Opt for ""watchful waiting.,
Go for repeat echocardiograms to monitor the status of your mitral valve.The key part of ""watchful waiting"" is regular monitoring.,
Take medication to reduce symptoms and risk factors.While you are in the process of ""waiting"" (for if and when you will need mitral valve surgery down the road), your doctor will likely offer you some medications.,
Have surgery on your mitral valve.The only definitive treatment for mitral regurgitation is to have surgery to fix the valve.",How to Diagnose Mitral Regurgitation," Age-related wear on the heart puts older adults at risk for mitral regurgitation. Those with other heart conditions, such as congenital heart disease, or who have already experienced complications with the mitral valve are at higher risk. Other risk factors include high blood pressure, high cholesterol and use of intravenous drugs.If you have any of these risk factors and experience signs and symptoms of mitral regurgitation, contact your doctor for evaluation.;
, As a result of getting less oxygen with each heartbeat, you may feel short of breath. Your shortness of breath may worsen with exertion, such as when running, walking, or going up stairs.


Shortness of breath may worsen with time as mitral valve regurgitation progresses.

, Tell your doctor if you have been experiencing an unusual level of fatigue compared to what is normal for you. It may be a sign of a heart or lung problem such as mitral regurgitation.

, Other times, you may have the sensation that your heart is ""fluttering"" in your chest. Palpitations may be a sign of mitral regurgitation, or of another heart problem. It is important to inform your doctor if you are experiencing heart palpitations so that appropriate investigative tests can be ordered.

, This is because the backflow of blood through your mitral valve can lead to a pressure build-up of blood in your heart. This makes it more difficult for blood to return to your heart, thus leading to the pooling of blood in the veins of your lower legs and/or feet.

, They can, however, be detected via tests that examine your heart, such as an echocardiogram.

, Although this in itself is not diagnostic of mitral regurgitation, it is suspicious of a heart problem that may very well be related to your mitral valve.

, A chest x-ray provides a more detailed view of your heart and lungs. If you do in fact have mitral regurgitation, the chest x-ray may show an enlarged left atrium or left ventricle. It may also show signs of fluid in your lungs (called ""pulmonary edema"") which can be caused by the backflow of blood through your mitral valve and the subsequent buildup of pressure in your heart and lung area.


A chest x-ray can also be used to rule in or rule out other heart or lung conditions that may present similarly to mitral regurgitation.

, (Note that an echocardiogram, also called an ""echo,"" is different than an electrocardiogram, also called an ECG or EKG.) Initially, you will most likely receive a TTE (""transthoracic echocardiogram""), meaning that the ultrasound probe is placed on the outside of your chest and an image of your heart is projected in real time onto a screen. Doctors can usually tell if there is any problem with your mitral valve with a TTE. They can also assess the pattern and direction of blood flow through various chambers of your heart, helping to determine the extent of the regurgitation.


If a TTE is insufficient to make the diagnosis, you can receive a TEE (""transesophageal echocardiogram"").
This is where, rather than having the ultrasound probe placed on the outside of your chest, a tube-like ultrasound probe is inserted into your esophagus.
Since your esophagus is located much closer to your heart, a TEE can provide an even more detailed view of your heart and mitral valve than a TTE can.

, It can also help doctors to decide if and when surgery is necessary. In some cases, other investigative tests are needed both to further assess the mitral valve, as well as diagnose any other issues with the heart including atherosclerosis in the cardiac blood vessels so a treatment plan can be formulated addressing all the cardiac issues. If this is the case, your doctor may consider the following:


A cardiac MRI
An exercise stress test
Cardiac catheterization
A CT angiogram

, There are two types of mitral regurgitation: primary or secondary. If you suffer from primary mitral regurgitation, there is an issue with the mitral valve itself; if it is secondary mitral regurgitation, then the issue is with the surrounding structures and not the valve.Primary mitral regurgitation may be caused by the following: ruptured chord, valve prolapse, endocarditis (infection), rheumatic fever, valve calcification, or certain drugs.Secondary mitral regurgitation may be caused by the following: coronary artery disease, heart failure, complication of a heart attack, or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (thickening of the heart muscle).,""Mild cases of mitral regurgitation do not need immediate surgical treatment. Instead, your doctor may advise ""watchful waiting."" In this approach, you may be given medications to help reduce your symptoms and/or your cardiovascular risk factors, and you will be asked to return for regular tests, including echocardiograms, on your mitral valve.


Note that, eventually, most cases of mitral regurgitation do need surgery.
It is just a question of when surgery is needed, which is usually not until further along in the course of the disease.

, This is ideally done via repeat echocardiograms to assess the function and integrity of your mitral valve. As previously mentioned, an echocardiogram allows for a structural view of your heart and valves, and it can also identify the direction of blood flow as the heart pumps to evaluate the extent of regurgitation.


The frequency with which you will need to receive echocardiograms for your mitral valve will depend upon the severity of your condition.

, These may include:


A diuretic (""water pill"") such as Hydrochlorothiazide or furosemide to reduce leg swelling, if you have been experiencing this as a symptom of mitral regurgitation.
A blood thinning medication such as Warfarin (Coumadin) to prevent blood clots, particularly if you have concurrent atrial fibrillation.
A blood pressure medication such as Ramipril if your blood pressure is elevated, as high blood pressure tends to worsen the symptoms of mitral regurgitation.
Other medications such as statins (to lower cholesterol) to diminish any other cardiovascular risk factors that you may have.

, A valve repair (fixing the valve that is already there) is usually preferable to a valve replacement surgery (where either a biologic or a mechanical valve is inserted in the place of your old mitral valve). The surgeon will go over the options with you to decide which procedure is most suited to your particular case.


Valve repair is usually preferable to valve replacement, as there is lower risk of complications (including stroke and infection), and improved rates of survival and preservation of heart function. Valve replacement requires long-term (or even life-long) use of an anticoagulant drug; this is not necessary with a valve repair."

Limit your TV viewing to one room.,
Use TiVo or DVR.,
Cover your TV when not in use.,
Cancel your cable.,
Unplug your TV when not in use.",How to Watch Less TV1," At some point in recent history, it became popular to put televisions in every room of the house. But having access to TV everywhere you turn only leads to unnecessary viewing. Limit your TV watching to one room of your house to reduce temptation and ultimately watch less TV., Using a television recording device, like TiVo or DVR, can allow you to save the TV shows that you like. Having your favorite TV shows saved will reduce the time you spend aimlessly browsing and flipping channels, causing you to watch less TV., Keeping your TV in a cabinet (with a door that closes) or simply placing a tapestry over it when it is not in use can lead to a reduction in your TV time. When you can’t see the TV, you are much less likely to turn it on., Many people today are ditching their cable in favor of internet television services, like Netflix or Hulu. Once again, this practice eliminates the ability to mindlessly flip channels and leads to less time in front of the TV., If you make it more difficult for yourself to watch TV, it gives you a better opportunity to exercise some willpower. One way to achieve this is to unplug your TV when it’s not in use. Keeping your TV plugged in actually wastes quite a bit of energy, so pulling the plug is also a great choice for your pocketbook and the earth."

Commit to caring for your health.,
Establish set times for meals and snacks.,
Eat nutritionally-dense foods.,
Prioritize sleep.,
Develop an exercise routine.",How to Use HALT in Addiction Recovery1," During recovery, your body heals along with your mind. Commit to giving yourself the rest and nutrition you need during this time, even if it isn’t always convenient. Work on making changes and building new habits that you can sustain for years to come.A good way to start is to make a small change every week. For instance, this week you could give up soda, and next week you could start going to bed half an hour earlier.;
, Eat at regular intervals throughout the day, so that your blood sugar stays level. Don’t rely solely on your physical cues to tell you when to eat, or you may end up getting too hungry and losing your self-control.Aim to eat three meals a day. If you get hungry between meals, plan to have one or two snacks as well.

, What you eat is just as important as how often you eat. Avoid foods high in sugar and refined flour, since they can make you feel moody and tired. Instead, fill your plate with complex carbohydrates, protein, and fresh vegetables and fruit.Oatmeal, brown rice, beans, lentils, and potatoes are some examples of complex carbohydrates.
Increasing your omega-3 fatty acid intake may help keep your mood stable. Fish, flaxseed oil, and walnuts are a few good sources of omega-3 fatty acids.
Drink plenty of water, especially if you are still detoxing.

, Adjust your schedule so you can get at least eight hours of sleep every night. Practice good sleep hygiene, and make sure your bedroom is quiet, dark, and comfortable.Try avoiding caffeine during the second half of the day, turning off your electronics an hour or two before bed, and creating a relaxing bedtime ritual.
If you have frequent insomnia, talk to your doctor about possible solutions.

, Regular exercise is important for lasting physical and mental health. What's more, a good workout can help you sleep better at night and boost your mood. If you take your workout to the gym or outdoors, you may even make new friends or find a workout buddy to keep you accountable.

Try working out at least 30 minutes on most days of the week. If working out in the evening affects your ability to go to sleep, schedule your workouts in the morning or afternoons."

Let your partner know about any other addictions.,
Share your triggers.,
Suggest therapy.",How to Tell Your Partner About Your Gambling Addiction2," When you decide to tell your partner about your partner about your gambling addiction, you should make sure that you do it at a good time and place. You need to make sure there is plenty of time to go into everything or answer any questions that your partner has.Choose a private place where you won’t be interrupted. Remove all distractions from the room.
Talk when both of you have time. The conversation may take a long time, so make sure you don’t have to go to work or an appointment around the time.

, You should be honest about your gambling addiction. Tell your partner about how you have gambled, debt you have accrued, and lengths you have gone to gamble. You may not want to reveal everything at once, but don’t lie or try to hold things back. This is a moment for you to get everything out into the open.Say to your partner, ""I have a gambling addiction. Because of this, I have gotten into some debt.""
Talk about the emotions that go with your addiction as well. This may help your partner to feel some empathy for you and be more understanding. For example, you might say something like, ""Gambling is an escape for me. When I am feeling sad, frustrated, or lonely, I want to go to the casino. It helps me to ignore these feelings for a while, but they are still there after I leave.""

, Your partner will probably have a lot to say after you tell them about your addiction. You should actively listen to them without judgment. Your partner may express fears, have questions, or voice concerns. Your partner may get angry or be confused. Listen to what they are saying.When your partner has questions, answer them to the best of your ability. Show them that you understand what they are saying.

, Your gambling disorder may have caused a lot of hurt for you and your family. You should acknowledge any problems you have caused or hurt you have caused for your partner. Apologize for things that you have have done to them.Don’t ignore past hurts because you are embarrassed or they are painful. Acknowledge them now so you can move past them, you both can start to heal, and not dwell on them in the future.
For example, you can say to your partner, ""I apologize for my actions due to my gambling. I am sorry I caused you any pain.""

, You should tell your partner the treatment plan you are on to help your gambling addiction. Explaining that you are getting help, or you want to take the steps to get help, will help show your partner that you are serious about making a recovery.


Your treatment may include rehab, support groups, psychotherapy, and lifestyle management techniques. Also let your partner know if you take any medication.

, Many times, gambling addiction comes along with other addictions, such as substance abuse. If you are suffering from something else, like alcohol abuse, share that with your partner at the same time. Explain what you are doing to treat and recover from that addiction also., You may have certain situations that cause you to want to gamble. These triggers may be situations, people, places, or substances. You should make your partner aware of these triggers so they can help you avoid them and manage if you have to face them.You should also discuss how you have eliminated triggers or what measures you take to deal with triggers when you encounter them.
For example, your triggers may be stress, boredom, or having cash in your pocket.

, Because of any problems due to your gambling, you may benefit from going to couples counseling. Couples therapy can help you work on issues in your relationship that need to be resolved. A professional counselor can help you if you are having trouble moving forward in your relationship on your own.You may also suggest that your partner go to a support group. They can try a Gambler’s Anonymous meeting, or find a meeting in your area for the loved ones of those facing addiction.

Develop a plan for relapse.,
Ask for support.,
Set boundaries.,
Ask for help with your debt.,
Prepare for them wanting to separate the finances.,
Spend more time with your partner.",How to Tell Your Partner About Your Gambling Addiction3," A gambling addiction may bring up a lot of distrust and issues in the relationship. One thing you should do to help resolve the issues in the relationship is to demonstrate a commitment of to your treatment. This is includes going to all of your therapy sessions, meetings, and following other lifestyle changes.Your partner may be skeptical that you will follow through with your treatment based on your past behavior. The more you follow your treatment and continue down the road to recovery, the more reason your partner will have to trust you.

, With an any addiction, a relapse is possible. Slip-ups and minor lapses are common during the road to recovery. You and your partner should talk about the possibility of a relapse. If you have a relapse, there should be a plan in place, including treatment, rehab, and financial matters.Discuss what a relapse will do to your relationship. Ask your partner if they will stand by you in a relapse, and what boundaries should be put into place should a relapse occur.

, Recovering from addiction is a very difficult process. It is difficult to do it alone, so you need your partner’s support to help you get through the tough times. Ask your partner if they would be willing to support you and be there for you as you work through your recovery.Discuss how you will need your partner and what role your partner will play if you have a slip-up or lapse.
Being accountable to your partner can help you want to fight harder to recover and overcome your addiction.
You may want to say, ""I could really use your help while I recover. It’s not going to easy, but I hope you will be there for me even if I have bad times or slip-up.""

, You and your partner may need to set boundaries due to your gambling addiction. These boundaries may include open access to your financials and check-ins to discuss your accounts to check for debt. Your partner may want you to let them manage all the finances, including your own, until you have successfully gone through recovery.Your partner and you may agree that they will not help you if you get into any more debt or legal trouble due to your gambling. They will help you work on a plan for you to pay your debt, not bail you out or pay your debt for you.
You might set a boundary by saying something like, ""If I gamble again and get into financial trouble, I do not want you to help me out. If I ask you to help me out, please tell me ""no"" and remind me that I asked you not to help me.""

, Because of your gambling addiction, you may be in a lot of debt. When you tell your partner about your addiction, you may want to ask for help coming up with a plan to pay your debt. Avoid asking for money. Instead, ask for helpful suggestions and solutions for your problem.Though your partner may be angry or hurt by your past behaviors, ask them to be part of the solution. Ask for their input about things and how they think you should proceed.
Ask your partner to help you seek legal or financial advice if needed.
You may say, “I would like you to help me come up with a plan to repay my debt. I think your input would be valuable.”

, Because of your financial troubles, your partner may want to set up separate finances. This may include cancelling any joint credit cards or bank accounts and taking over the payment of the bills.Your partner may need to first take care of debt accrued in their name or on joint accounts.
Try to understand that your partner is looking out for their needs as much as yours.

, As you are working through your recovery, you should make a vow to spend more time with your partner and your family. This can help you stay away from situations that may trigger you, or to get into situations that may lead to gambling.For example, you may agree to spend every Saturday together, or you may decide that weekends are set aside for family time.

Track your TV time.,
Set a daily time limit.,
Use TV as a reward.,
Avoid eating in front of the TV.,
Use some willpower.",How to Watch Less TV2," You have probably heard that the first step to tackling a problem is to admit that you have one. If you suspect that you might be watching too much television, take a week to prove it. For one week, watch as much television as you normally do, but keep a log. At the end of the week add it up, and astonish yourself with how much time you’ve been wasting in front of the screen.Once you have your weekly amount, think about all the other things you could have done with that time.
It could have been 10 hours studying, 15 hours at the gym, or 20 hours practicing guitar.

, One popular tactic is to allow yourself only a certain number of hours (or minutes) of TV time per day. Start by limiting yourself to one hour per day. Then, once you are comfortable with that amount, maybe try to do half an hour per day, or one hour every other day., Rather than simply giving yourself TV time each day “for free,” you may want to use TV as a reward. For example, if you work out for 45 minutes, maybe this earns you 45 minutes of TV time. If you finish that letter you’ve been meaning to write, maybe this earns you another 15. This way, you’re still getting your hour to unwind in front of the TV, but you’ve also completed some important tasks in the process.You may want to create a list that details the number of TV minutes certain tasks are worth.
You may still want to enforce a daily cap (such as 1-2 hours).

, Eating in front of the television is an addicting habit. Not only has this been shown to have negative effects on your waistline, but it encourages longer and more frequent TV watching. Break the habit! Focus on eating your food when its time to eat, and pay close attention to the TV when it is time for TV., You can use any trick in the book, but ultimately your choice to watch less TV is going to come down to willpower. Willpower is like a muscle: the more you exercise it, the stronger it becomes. Watching less television is an important lifestyle adjustment that can have very positive benefits for you. Try to be strong and follow the goals you have set for yourself."
"
Exercise.,
Call a friend.,
Play board games.,
Listen to podcasts.,
Go to the movies.",How to Watch Less TV3," Exercise seems to be the answer to everything, right? Well studies have actually shown that people who exercise regularly have a lowered desire to watch TV! So not only will getting active distract you and give you something else to do, but if you commit to do doing it regularly, it will lessen your TV addiction., It is common for people to flip on the television anytime that they feel lonely. If you find yourself in this position, turn off the TV and phone a friend instead. That conversation will definitely be more uplifting and better at countering feelings of loneliness than another episode of Mad Men.

, If you and the people you live with are huddled up around the TV every night, try changing the scene and pull out some board games. Board games can be a lot of fun for people of all ages. Depending on the game, they encourage interaction, cooperation, strategy, critical thinking, and having a sense of humor. Start up a game and then look around: you are sure to see a room full of smiles., If you really craving some form of passive entertainment, try listening to a podcast. Podcasts exist on almost any subject and in a variety of genres (comedy, storytelling, non-fiction, etc.) But listening to podcasts still helps you reduce your screen-time. Best of all, podcasts are totally portable! You can tune in from your car, the bus, or walking down the street.Find podcasts through a podcast app, the iTunes store, or through a basic internet search.

, If you really have the itch to take in some audio-visual entertainment, take yourself to the movies instead of lounging on the couch. Going to the movies is a great way to get out of the house, it’s a fun activity to do on a date or with a friend, and it creates a much more immersive experience than watching TV at home. Plus, a movie is presented in a limited quantity: you’ll only watch those 90 (or so) minutes, and then you’ll be done.

Decide when to stop taking Bupropion.",How to Use Bupropion to Quit Tobacco," Bupropion is a safe and cost-effective way to quit smoking and tobacco use.It is easy to take and does not contain any nicotine. Bupropion can help with cravings and withdrawal symptoms from tobacco.It can also help reduce weight gain for some people after quitting.


Using prescription medication should not be taken lightly, so be invested in your decision to quit smoking or using tobacco.
Bupropion is prescribed for people over the age of 18 and is not prescribed for women who are pregnant. Bupropion is not intended for people with a history of seizures, kidney failure, excessive alcohol use, eating disorders, bipolar disorder, or serious head injuries.;
, Bupropion is a prescription medication, meaning that you must obtain it through a prescriber. Set up an appointment with your prescriber to discuss taking Bupropion. Your physician will likely ask you about your health, smoking or tobacco habits, and review any medications, supplements, or vitamins you currently take.


You can say, “I am ready to quit tobacco, and want to know if Bupropion is a good option for me.”
Check with your insurance to see whether medication is covered by insurance or not.Always discuss your medical history and medications truthfully.
Try using the START acronym to help you quit smoking. In this acronym, S = Set a quit date; T = Tell your friends and family; A = Anticipate challenges and difficulties; R = Remove all tobacco products from home, work, and car; and T = Talk to your doctor for more support and treatment.

, As with all prescription medications, Bupropion can have associated risks, and it’s important to discuss these with your prescriber prior to taking medication. Discuss any medications you currently take and ask if they interact with Bupropion.


Say, “I currently take these medications. Are there any risks I should be aware of? What are my options?”
Bupropion rarely causes seizures and can interact with antidepressants, antiarrhythmics and antipsychotics., Common side-effects of Bupropion include dry mouth and insomnia. These symptoms are also associated with withdrawal. About half of people taking Bupropion experience these side-effects.Other side-effects can include headache, shakiness or nervousness, and weight loss.Contact your prescriber if you have major difficulty with side-effects and ask how you can get relief safely. Say, “I’m experiencing some side-effects, and I’d like help managing them. Is there something I can take for insomnia? What about for the headaches?”

, Once you have discussed your options and concluded alongside your physician that Bupropion is a safe medication for you, your physician will likely write you a prescription for Bupropion. Ask if you will need refills or need additional appointments. Once all of your questions have been answered, you can pick up your prescription at the pharmacy. Some physicians will write you a prescription while others may call or email a pharmacy.Your pharmacist can help you understand any side-effects or interactions to avoid with Bupropion.

, Set a date to quit using tobacco. Keep the date realistic and not too far in the future. You may want to avoid choosing a time that is especially stressful, such as moving, starting a new job, or traveling. Creating a quit plan will help you stay on track and keep you focused.Choose a time when you do not anticipate many stressors. Decide why you are quitting. Is it to save money, be healthier, or for your loved ones? Identify your triggers (such as stress, not getting enough sleep, fights) for and use them to fight cravings. You may also want to reward yourself for your progress, such as taking the money you’ve saved from not buying cigarettes and having a nice meal or seeing a play.

, Begin your dose of Bupropion approximately 1-2 weeks prior to quitting tobacco.This will help the Bupropion build up in your system.This requires a bit of planning. Refer to your plan to quit and set the day to start medication based off of that plan.


Discuss starting the medication with your physician and/or pharmacist.

, Most people take one 150mg tablet, once or twice each day.Some physicians may recommend you take one 150mg tablet in the morning for the first three days, followed by two tablets (once in the morning and once at night) for the rest of treatment.Take only the dose you are prescribed. Do not change your dose without approval from your physician.


Zyban is the sustained release formulation of wellbutrin, and its dosing will last longer. The initial dose should be for 150 mg for the first three days, and then increase to 150 mg twice daily for seven to 12 weeks. Therapy should begin at least one week before your expected quit date. If significant progress has not been made within seven weeks, then success is unlikely and treatment discontinuation should be considered.
Medication is meant to be taken whole. Do not crush, chew, or divide tablets.If you feel you need to change your dose, discuss it with your physician first. Do not change your dose on your own unsupervised.

, Bupropion can be safely used with a nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). Some common nicotine replacement products include nicotine patches, gum, and lozenges, which can be purchased over-the-counter. Nicotine inhalers and nasal sprays can be purchased once a prescription is obtained.Decide on your own or with the help of your prescriber which option will work best for you.


Some people want the nicotine out of their system while others want to lower the risk of withdrawal symptoms or reduce cravings during early use. Prior to starting Bupropion, decide which option is best for you.

, Stop taking medications immediately if you start having thoughts of suicide. If you experience changes in behavior (such as anger, agitation, aggression, or depressed mood) talk to your prescriber. He or she may tell you to stop using the medication.If you are suicidal, seek emergency care immediately. Go to your local hospital’s emergency department or call emergency services.

, Bupropion is recommended for 7-12 weeks, and can be taken for six months to one year.Discuss with your physician when to stop medication. Your physician may ask you to watch for medication withdrawal symptoms or any changes in behavior. If you withdraw medication and notice any significant changes in your body or behavior, contact your physician immediately.

Realize that the upper arms may also be affected.,
Check whether or not the skin feels cold to the touch.,
Be aware that the causes are not well understood.,

Consider hormonal changes.",How to Diagnose Lipedema," The only way to have lipedema diagnosed is to visit your doctor. If your normal doctor is not trained in this area, they may refer you to a specialist who will examine your condition to determine if it is lipedema or another similar fat disorder.


The symptoms of this disorder make some people feel embarrassed to discuss the matter with their doctor. Try to remember that there is nothing to be embarrassed about, and if it is lipedema, the earlier you catch the disorder, the more treatable it will be.;
, As with many disorders and diseases, lipedema is often more treatable in the earlier stages than in the later stages. There are four stages of lipedema.In stage 1, the skin will still be smooth, and swelling may increase during the day, but disappear with rest. During this stage, the disorder responds well to treatment.
In stage 2, there may be indentations in the skin, and lipomas (fatty lumps) may develop. You may experience eczema or skin infections known as erysipelas. Swelling may still appear during the day, but likely doesn’t go away completely, even with rest and elevation of the legs. At this stage, your body may still respond well to treatment.
During stage 3, you may experience a hardening of the connective tissues. At this stage, the swelling is unlikely to go down regardless of whether you are resting or elevating your legs. You might also experience overhanging skin. It is still possible to treat the disorder, but you may be less responsive to various treatments.
In stage 4 you will likely experience a worsening of the symptoms present in stage 3. At this stage, the disorder is referred to by some experts as lipo-lymphedema. As with stage 3, treatment is still worth trying, but you may not respond to some treatments.

, The best way to diagnose the disorder is through visual inspection of the affected area. The doctor may feel the area to check for nodules that characterize this disorder. Additionally, your doctor will likely ask you about whether or not you are experiencing any pain, and to describe when/if the swelling increases or decreases.Currently, there is no blood test that will allow a doctor to determine if you have lipedema.

, This is the most common and obvious symptom of the disorder. The swelling will typically be in both legs, and may include the hips and buttocks. The swelling may be gradual or you may have a very distinct difference between your upper half and your lower half.For example, some people suffering from lipedema are very thin above the waist but appear disproportionately large below the waste.

, The swelling may be isolated to the legs and stop just at the ankles. This gives your legs a column-like appearance.Note that the symptoms are not always exactly the same. Your entire leg may not be swollen or you may have swelling from the tops of the ankles all the way to the hips. Some people experience only a small pocket of fat just above each ankle.

, Though most people experience symptoms in the lower half of the body, it is possible to experience the same symptoms in the upper arms. Fat in the arms will be similar to in the legs. This means that you might experience an accumulation of fat that occurs equally in both arms.The fat may create a column appearance that stops abruptly at the elbows or the wrists.

, People suffering from lipedema report that the skin of the affected area feels cold when they touch it. The skin might also feel soft and dough-like.Additionally, it may be painful to the touch, and you may find that the affected area bruises very easily.

, Though there are some suspects, doctors still aren’t sure what exactly causes lipedema. Unfortunately, not knowing the cause can make this disorder difficult to treat.


Providing your doctor with as much information about your health and genetic history as possible will aid your doctor in determining possible causes and treatments., In many cases, there appears to be a genetic component to this disorder. This is because a person suffering from lipedema sometimes has family members who are also dealing with the disorder themselves.For example, if you are suffering from lipedema it is not unlikely that one of your parents is also suffering from the disorder., Many doctors believe that lipedema may have a link with hormones. This is because the disorder occurs almost exclusively in women, and is often found to occur during times of hormonal change such as puberty, during pregnancy, or menopause.Though the cause of the disorder may not seem important, it could be helpful for your doctor when deciding upon good treatment option.

Watch for pain.One of the defining features of renal colic (kidney stones) is that they can cause severe pain when they get stuck and cause an obstruction.,
Look for blood in your urine.Blood in the urine is another characteristic of renal colic (kidney stones)l however, there is one caveat to noticing it: the blood may or may not be visible to the naked eye.,
Take note of other urinary symptoms.In addition to blood in your urine, many people with renal colic (kidney stones) experience other urinary symptoms.,
Consider your risk factors.Your likelihood of having kidney stones also increases in proportion to your risk factors.,
Have a ""urinalysis"" (urine test).If your doctor suspects that you may have kidney stones, she will perform a ""urinalysis,"" which assesses various aspects of your urine.,
Receive a CT scan.A specialized type of CT scan — a ""non contrast helical CT"" — is the imaging test of choice in the diagnosis of renal colic.,
Ask your doctor for an ultrasound.If you are someone who is advised to minimize your exposure to radiation (such as a pregnant woman or a child), your doctor may recommend an ultrasound as opposed to a CT scan to evaluate for the presence of kidney stones.,
Determine whether or not you can be ""treated at home.,
Opt for pain medications.If you are in severe pain, your doctor will most likely offer you narcotics such as codeine or morphine to get your symptoms under control.,
Ask your doctor for anti-nausea medications.If you are experiencing severe nausea and/or vomiting, you can also be given an anti-nausea medication (antiemetics).,
Receive IV fluids to stay hydrated.If you are being treated in hospital, you will most likely be hooked up to an IV where you will receive all necessary fluids, calories, and many of your medications (including pain medications and anti-nausea medications).,
Have a procedure to remove your kidney stone if it is too large to pass on its own.Your doctor may advise ""shock wave lithotripsy"" to break up the stone into smaller fragments, or ""percutaneous nephrolithotomy"" for larger or more complex stones that need to be removed surgically.",How to Diagnose Kidney Stones," The pain is usually located in the ""flank"" area (on your side, between your rib and your hip). It may also be located in your lower abdomen. It may move toward your groin with time.


The pain of renal colic characteristically goes in ""waves"" of being a little bit better and then worse again, continuing in this pattern.
Often, it is more painful for people to sit still or lie down; the pain may be somewhat alleviated by moving around.;
,


If it is visible, your urine will likely be a pink or reddish color.
If you do not see any changes to your urine color, but are experiencing pain and other symptoms suggestive of renal colic, your doctor can test your urine and pick up microscopic traces of blood in it that may not have been visible to the naked eye.

, These may include:


An urgent need to urinate
Pain with urination
Nausea and/or vomiting
A ""gravel"" appearance to their urine, which may indicate the passage of small stones

, These include:


A personal history of kidney stones in the past
A family history of kidney stones
Being overweight
Dietary factors — if your diet is particularly high in protein, sugar, and/or sodium, your risk of kidney stones increases
Dehydration, which predisposes you to the formation of kidney stones
Certain gastrointestinal diseases and or surgeries that affect nutrient and water absorption (such as Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, chronic diarrhea, or having received gastric bypass surgery)
Other medical conditions (such as hyperparathyroidism, cystinuria, renal tubular acidosis — a form of kidney disease, as well as taking certain medications and/or having certain types of urinary tract infections)

, If the results are suggestive of possible renal colic, your doctor will proceed with specific imaging tests to look for a kidney stone that may be causing an obstruction and leading to your pain.

, This is because it provides the best view of kidney stones, if they are in fact present and causing an obstruction, and allows your doctor to confirm the diagnosis of renal colic.


A CT scan can be done in the Emergency Department, usually within a few hours of your arrival (when a condition is deemed ""urgent,"" a CT scan can normally be received right away without needing to go on a wait list).
You will be lying down for your CT scan, and you will be in a large, circular machine for a few minutes while the images are being captured.
There is plenty of space in a CT scanner (unlike an MRI, which is very enclosed), so problems with claustrophobia are rare when receiving a CT scan.
You will not feel anything while the images are being taken; the images are taken via radiation so it is a completely painless experience.

, While an ultrasound is not as effective as a non-contrast helical CT scan at locating and diagnosing kidney stones, it can detect them in most cases of renal colic and is oftentimes sufficient to make the diagnosis.


If the diagnosis remains unclear after receiving an ultrasound exam, your doctor may recommend that you proceed with the CT scan anyway.

,""If your pain and/or nausea is severe, you will most likely be treated in the hospital setting. You will also need to be treated in the hospital if you have a fever, due to the risk of an infection that could spread to your bloodstream (and potentially be life-threatening if not treated as quickly as possible). If none of these things are the case for you, however, you can proceed with home treatment as follows under close guidance of your physician:


Oral pain medications such as Ibuprofin (Advil, Motrin) are commonly recommended to ease your pain, if and when needed.
Tamsulosin is another medication that is often recommended to increase the speed at which your kidney stones pass.
Your doctor may ask that you ""strain"" your urine so that, when the stone passes, you can collect it and bring it into your doctor for examination.
Determining what the stone is composed of (oxalate, uric acid, calcium, etc.) can help your doctor to come up with preventative strategies for you, that will decrease your risk of developing future kidney stones.

, The pain of renal colic can be very debilitating, so pain medications are given promptly to ease your suffering.

, Examples include ondansetron (Zofran) or dimenhydrinate (Gravol).

, This is because, if you are nauseous and in pain, it will be very challenging for you to eat or drink anything. Therefore, having all of these needs met through an IV line will keep things much simpler and ensure the fastest recovery for you.


If you begin to show signs of an infection, you may also be given antibiotics through the IV to ensure that the infection does not progress to your bloodstream.

, ""Ureteroscopy"" may also be done as a procedure to remove a kidney stone. The method of choice will depend upon the size and location of your kidney stone.

Find healthy ways to express your emotions.,
Practice mindfulness.,
Stay connected to others.,
Set boundaries.,
Do things you enjoy.,
See a therapist regularly.",How to Use HALT in Addiction Recovery2," Don’t bottle your feelings up. Anger and other negative emotions can trigger a relapse if you don’t address them. Go for a long walk, clean your house, or vent in a journal when you feel your emotions building up., Mindfulness can help you process the emotions of recovery without letting them control you. To become more mindful, focus on what’s happening right now, both inside and outside you. Observe your sensations, thoughts, and feelings without judging them.Meditation and yoga are two good ways to develop the habit of mindfulness.

, For many people, loneliness is a big trigger for relapse, so don’t isolate yourself. Talk to your family members, friends, therapist, and other people in your support network frequently. If you aren’t already a member, consider joining a group like Alcoholics Anonymous for extra support.If you don’t feel like seeing other people, make yourself do it anyways. Start small. Pick up the phone to call a friend, or ask a family member to get coffee with you.

, Think about what kind of new, sober life you want to build. Ask yourself what you need from other people and what kind of influences you don’t want to spend time around anymore. Let the people close to you know about your new boundaries, and decide what you will do if someone does not respect your boundaries.For example, you might set the boundary that you will not spend time with your old friends who are still addicted to drugs.
Be polite but firm about your boundaries. Say something like, “No, I can’t hang out with you. I need to put my recovery first right now.”

, Make time to have fun on a regular basis. Rediscover the activities you liked to do before you became addicted, or pick up a completely new hobby that you’ve always wanted to try. Give yourself something to look forward to every day.For instance, you could express your emotions through painting, teach yourself a foreign language, or join an adult sports league to make new friends.

, Therapy is an essential part of recovery. A therapist can help keep you accountable, and they can help you learn new ways to cope with your emotions without turning to alcohol or drugs. A therapist can also help you problem-solve difficulties in your life using the HALT concepts, such as identifying triggers and figuring out mood changes.Even if you have already completed a residential therapy program, your aftercare should include some kind of counseling.

Know what your personal triggers are.,
Avoid your triggers whenever possible.,
Figure out where your discomfort is coming from.,
Have a plan.,
Practice urge surfing.",How to Use HALT in Addiction Recovery3," Think about which feelings, places, or people make you want to relapse. Take these triggers seriously. If something was a trigger for you in the past, it will probably remain a trigger in the future.Besides HALT, a few common triggers for relapse include seeing people you used to drink or do drugs with, feeling overly confident about your recovery, and feeling scared about how sobriety will change your life.

, Don’t try to test or tempt yourself. If you know that a certain place or situation is likely to trigger you, stay away from it.Set boundaries that will help you avoid your triggers, such as not going to bars anymore.

, When you feel stressed or have a craving, pause and evaluate the feeling. Ask yourself what you’re struggling with or trying to avoid.For instance, you might discover that your urge to relapse is rooted in your feelings about a recent argument with your partner.
If you practice mindfulness regularly, you’ll find it easier to explore your feelings without acting on them.

, Know ahead of time what you’ll do when a craving hits. Think about the situations you’re likely to find yourself in, and come up with some healthy and appropriate alternatives to using drugs or alcohol.For instance, you might decide to keep some nonperishable snacks in your car, call your sponsor if you’re feeling lonely, and practice deep breathing exercises to calm down if you’re angry at someone.
Make your healthy coping strategy as easy as possible to carry out.

, Urge surfing is the practice of waiting a craving out instead of giving in to it. Instead of trying to ignore or get rid of the craving, focus on how it makes you feel. Pay attention to the sensations it creates in your body. Eventually, the craving will fade by itself.Urge surfing is essentially a form of mindfulness.

Look for changes on the skin of your palms.,
Assess the function of your fingers.,
Identify any risk factors you may have.,
Prepare for your appointment.,
Allow your doctor to inspect and test your hand.,
Do a tabletop test.,
Assess how the condition is progressing.,
Try steroid injections.,
Get enzyme injections.,
Discuss the option of surgery with your doctor.,
Use stretching in combination with other treatments.",How to Diagnose Dupuytren's Contracture," The first sign of Dupuytren's contracture is a change to the skin on your palms. It will cause lumps and pits to develop on the surface of the hand. These lumps and pits are tough areas and they usually form very gradually.This condition commonly affects both hands but may be more severe in one or the other.;
, As the condition progresses it will impact your ability to straighten out your fingers. If your ring and pinkie finger are curling up and it is difficult to straighten them out completely, you may have Dupuytren's contracture.You may also be able to feel thick cords developing under the skin between the palm and one or two of your fingers. These cords are what is causing the loss of finger function.

, Dupuytren's contracture does occur more often in men of Northern European descent who are over the age of 40. Additionally, it often runs in families, so if you have relatives with the condition you are more likely to get it.There are also other risk factors, such as smoking and diabetes. If you are a smoker or if you have diabetes you have a higher chance of getting this condition.
Knowing your risk factors for this condition can help you to assess whether it is likely that you have it. For example, if you have none of the risk factors for Dupuytren's contracture then any symptoms that you have may be caused by a different condition.

, Before you see your doctor you should know what they will ask you, so that you can be prepared to answer. First, you should be able to tell your doctor about all of your symptoms and the risk factors you have for Dupuytren's contracture. You should also try and remember when your symptoms started and if they have changed over time.When making the appointment to see your doctor tell the receptionist about your symptoms. This will allow the doctor to do a little research about conditions that might be causing your symptoms before meeting with you.

, In most cases, a doctor can diagnose Dupuytren's contracture just by looking at and feeling the hands. They will look at the surface of the palms and feel around deep into the palms.When inspecting the hands, the doctor will be feeling for the thick cords inside the hands that are causing the fingers to curl and tighten.

, Your doctor may have you do a tabletop test to assess the extent of your Dupuytren's contracture. With this test you will simply place your palms against the top of a table to see how flat you can get your fingers.During the tabletop test, if the joint closest to your palm is curved more than 40 degrees or the joints further down the fingers are curved more than 20 degrees, then the condition is considered advanced. With fingers this curled, your doctor will likely suggest surgery., In cases of Dupuytren's contracture that are not progressing very quickly and do not inhibit movement or function, it is likely that your doctor will suggest simply keeping an eye on your symptoms. Until the symptoms get bad enough to impact your life, treatment is usually held off.There is no non-invasive treatment for Dupuytren's contracture. This means that all treatments involve injections or surgery in the palms.

, If your condition is early in its progression then you can try steroid injections. They are strong anti-inflammatory medications, so they can help break up nodules early in their development.Steroid injections are more helpful in the early stages of this disease because they cannot break down more thickened tissue and they will not straighten out fingers once they have curled up.
Steroid injections will need to be done repeatedly. They are usually done monthly but with a break of several months after three to six treatments., If the condition is impacting the function of your hands, then you can try enzyme injections. These injections are designed to improve the function of your fingers, allowing you to straighten them more.Enzyme injections are more helpful for those that have advanced Dupuytren's contracture, as they work to release the tension that is curling the fingers in.
As with all treatments for Dupuytren's contracture, this treatment may not result in full functionality. Also, there is a risk that the symptoms could return even if they are minimized by the treatment initially.

, If your condition is advanced and injections are not helping to minimize it, then your doctor may suggest surgery, and you will be referred to an orthopedic hand specialist if you haven't been already. The surgeries used for this condition include open surgery to remove portions of the thickened bands and needle aponeurotomy, which uses needles poked into the palm to break up the tightened tissue.Needle aponeurotomy can be done in a doctor's office, while open surgery needs to be done in a surgical room. Also, open surgery requires more time to recover.
Before surgery, the surgeon should discuss realistic goals and possible risks of the procedure. These include the fact that Dupuytren's contracture cannot be eliminated completely and even if symptoms are minimized, they may return over time. Additionally, there are risks associated with any surgery, including infection at the incision site and a bad reaction to medications that are given.

, When getting other treatments, your doctor may suggest specific stretches to do to increase their effectiveness. While stretching on its own may not do much to increase the flexibility to fingers affected by Dupuytren's contracture, it can be useful when used in combination.Be sure to discuss with your doctor what stretches you should do and when to do them after treatment. While stretches can be done relatively quickly after injection treatments, you should wait until your doctor says it's okay to do stretches after surgery.
If your doctor suggests physical therapy after treatment, stretching will be a key part of that therapy.

Check for lumps on your body.,
Notice if you feel feverish, weak, and have a lack of appetite.,
Check for weight loss and skin rashes.,
Let your doctor do a physical exam.,
Allow your doctor to test your blood and your urine.,
Get X-rays done.,
Have a biopsy done on your lymph nodes.,
Discuss treatment for unicentric CD with your doctor.,
Determine the treatment options for multicentric CD.,
Schedule a follow up appointment.",How to Diagnose Castleman Disease," The localized form of Castleman Disease (CD) may appear as a lymph node or nodes that are swollen or enlarged. Check at the back of your neck, by your groin, and in your underarm area for lumps. You can also develop lumps on your chest or abdominal area as a result of CD.If you notice any lumps in these areas, go see your doctor for a diagnosis.
Lumps can be benign and are not a clear indication that you have Castleman disease. But you should get the lump checked out regardless to ensure you do not have any medical issues.;
, Some people who have CD have no symptoms at all besides a lump or several lumps on their body. Some people experience symptoms like fever, fatigue, and a lack of appetite. You may also get night sweats as a result of CD.Some people will have trouble breathing as well as wheezing and coughing due to enlarged nodes in their chest area, which will then press on the windpipe. There may also be a feeling of fullness in your chest area due to a lump in your chest.

, CD can cause weight loss, often due to a lack of appetite. If you notice dramatic weight loss, you should see your doctor.Some people develop skin rashes due to CD. This is a less common symptom among those with CD.

, Schedule an appointment with your doctor and discuss your symptoms with them. Your doctor will do a physical exam on any lumps on your body, if any. They will look at the size of the lumps and how many there are on your body. They will also review your medical history and ask you about any other disorders or medical issues you may have.If you have one lump or several lumps in one area of your body that are enlarged, and no other symptoms, you have localized or unicentric CD.
If you have more than one lump in several areas of your body and common symptoms, you have widespread or multicentric CD.

, Your doctor will run require blood and urine samples from you. They will then test these samples to rule out any other infections or diseases.The blood and urine tests can also show any anemia or abnormalities in your blood proteins that could be a sign of Castleman disease.

, Your doctor will also suggest getting X-rays done to detect enlarged lymph nodes on your body, including in your liver or spleen. CT scans or an MRI may also be done on your neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis.Your doctor may suggest getting a positron emission tomography (PET) scan done to diagnose Castleman disease.

, Your doctor will take a tissue sample from an enlarged lymph node on your body as a biopsy. This may be done under local anesthesia or through more extensive surgery, depending on where the enlarged lymph node is located. The biopsy will then be tested to determine if you have CD.The biopsy will also help to rule out other types of lymphatic tissue disorders like lymphoma.

, The treatment for CD depends on the type of Castleman disease you have. If you have unicentric CD, the diseased lymph node will be removed through surgery. If the lymph node is in your chest or abdomen, you will need major surgery.If the diseased lymph node cannot be removed with surgery, the doctor will recommend medication to shrink it. Radiation therapy on the lymph node may also be an option.

, Due to the number of diseased lymph nodes involved in multicentric CD, you often cannot get surgery to remove them. Instead, your doctor will recommend medications and therapies to control cell overgrowth. These may include monoclonal antibodies, chemotherapy, antiviral drugs, and corticosteroids.Your doctor may suggest a combination of these treatments to help reduce the size of the diseased lymph nodes. If the lymph nodes do not shrink, you will need surgery to remove organs that have been affected.

, If you get surgery for unicentric CD, you will need to schedule follow-up exams and X-rays. This will allow your doctor to check if you have a relapse and to help prevent the development of enlarged lymph nodes.If you are getting treated for multicentric CD, talk to loved ones and lean on them for support. Often multicentric CD can be a difficult diagnosis, as it usually develops along with other medical issues like HIV/AIDS. Speak to your doctor about additional support as you need it.

Ask your healthcare provider to rule out other conditions that share fibromyalgia symptoms.,
Have your doctor test all four quadrants of your body for constant pain.,
Have your doctor test for tenderness on certain parts of your body commonly associated with fibromyalgia.",How to Diagnose Fibromyalgia," You may be at higher risk for developing fibromyalgia if you are a woman, have a family history of fibromyalgia, are middled-aged, or suffer from a rheumatic disease such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus., Widespread muscle pain is often characterized as a constant dull ache that lasts for at least three months on both sides of your body, and above and below your waist., Fibromyalgia is often accompanied by fatigue and decreased energy levels all day long, even if you’ve had a full night’s sleep.

, Feelings of mental fogginess, also known as “fibro fog,” can indicate you have fibromyalgia.

, Stiffness and soreness are signs of fibromyalgia.

, Having adverse reactions to the above factors can indicate you have fibromyalgia.

,, Feelings of tingling and numbness, along with feelings of phantom swelling in limbs are common signs of fibromyalgia.

,, Common abdominal symptoms associated with fibromyalgia include bloating, nausea, constipation, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and frequent, urgent bouts of urination., Factors that commonly trigger fibromyalgia symptoms include sudden changes in the weather, too little or too much exercise or inactivity, depression, stress, and anxiety., The best time to contact your doctor is immediately upon verifying whether you’ve been suffering from chronic muscle pain and overwhelming fatigue that interferes with everyday life.

, Conditions that exhibit symptoms similar to those of fibromyalgia are HIV, hypothyroidism, Lyme disease, degenerative diseases of the spine, and some cancers. Your doctor can perform a series of tests to rule out these other conditions, such as blood tests, X-rays, and biopsies.

Identify problems with excessive bleeding and lack of clotting.,
Think about genetic risk factors.,
Rule out other factors that could make blood thin.,
Make an appointment with your doctor.,
Discuss the condition with your doctor.,
Have testing done.,
Get appropriate treatment.,
Make lifestyle changes.,
Monitor the condition.",How to Diagnose Hemophilia," The main symptom of hemophilia is that you have a hard time clotting after you start bleeding. Clotting does not usually happen instantaneously but if you have a small cut or a small nosebleed it should begin within a few minutes. If you can't seem to get even a small cut to stop bleeding, then you may have hemophilia.To get a cut to stop bleeding, apply pressure to it with a sterile bandage. Once the bleeding slows down, do not remove the bandage. Simply continue pressure and keep the bandage on so that the clot does not get pulled off the injury.;
, Since hemophilia is a genetic disorder, it is usually passed down from parents to children. If your parents have hemophilia, you are at greater risk of getting it. Additionally, hemophilia occurs in males more often than in women.Ask your parents if they have it or if any of their relatives have it. In many cases, you will already know if your parents have hemophilia. If they do, you are more likely to have it.
Hemophilia is a mutation that occurs on the x-chromosome. Men have both x and y chromosomes, and women have two x chromosomes. This means that to have hemophilia, men only need one mutation in the x chromosome whereas women would require two--one on each x chromosome.So while hemophilia appears more often in men than women, women can carry the gene and pass it on to their sons.

, There are some reasons you may bleed a lot that have nothing to do with hemophilia. Before you assume that you have this condition, you should rule out possible other causes.


For example, if you are taking anticoagulant drugs, which limit clotting, you will bleed longer. There are many medications that can make you blood thin and inhibit your ability to clot, including warfarin (Coumadin, enoxaparin (Lovenox), clopidogrel (Plavix), ticlopidine (Ticlid), aspirin, and NSAIDS, such as Ibuprofen.Other types of anticoagulants include factor Xa inhibitors (Xarelto, Eliquis, Arixtra) and thrombin inhibitors (Angiomax, Pradaxa). Consult with your doctor or pharmacist about whether the medications that you are taking might thin your blood and limit clotting.If you are having unexplained bleeding it could be due to foods that contain salicylate, which naturally thins the blood, or even excessive intake of alcohol.High doses of of garlic, ginger, fish oil, and vitamin E supplements may also act as anticoagulants., If you are concerned that you might have hemophilia, then you should consult with your doctor about it. Don't just assume that you can manage a bit of excessive bleeding on your own. Hemophilia needs to be managed medically, so get a professional diagnosis and treatment plan.Hemophilia can be a very serious condition, so when you call to make the appointment tell the medical personnel what you think is going on. They should get you in to see the doctor relatively quickly.

, Explain your symptoms and why you think they might be connected to hemophilia. Be prepared to discuss other possible reasons for excessive bleeding with your doctor.


If you bring up hemophilia with your doctor they are likely to do an extensive family history with you to figure out if you have a history of the condition in your family. This is because the condition is so connected to genetic inheritance.Make a list of all of your symptoms and when they occurred before you go to the doctor's office. Bring that list with you when you see the doctor. Symptoms include bleeding gums, dark urine, bloody nose, blood in stool, and easy bruising.

, If your doctor thinks it's warranted, you will have testing done to evaluate how quickly your blood clots, what your level of clotting factors are, and whether you have clotting factors as all. Tests will show whether you have hemophilia, what type you have, and how severe it is.Getting a diagnosis of hemophilia requires a blood test. The blood test looks at the levels of factor VIII and factor IX in the blood, which are the clotting factors in the blood.
If initial blood tests show low levels of clotting factors, then your doctor will most likely move on to genetic testing to identify the hemophilia mutation.There are two types of hemophilia. Type A, which accounts for about 80% of cases, is a deficiency of blood clotting factor VIII while Type B is a deficiency of blood clotting factor IX. Both have identical symptoms, but a blood test can determine which type you have., Once you have been diagnosed with hemophilia you will need to get treatment for the disease. Hemophilia can cause excessive bleeding outside and inside the body, so treatment is important to your health.The main treatment for hemophilia is replacement therapy. This is a process in which human blood from donors is processed and has its clotting factors removed. These clotting factors are then put into the hemophiliac's blood stream.
Replacement therapy can be done on a regular basis to prevent bleeding in people with severe hemophilia. It can also be used once in awhile to stop bleeding in people with less severe conditions.

, Once you are diagnosed with hemophilia it's important that you make changes in your lifestyle that will prevent bleeding problems. In addition to treatment, you will need to avoid activities that could cause you bodily harm and avoid medications and foods that could promote bleeding.Taking precautions to avoid injury is a large part of the changes that will be needed. Avoid sports or activities that could result in a bruise or a cut. For a hemophiliac, these things can be life threatening.
Also avoid taking medications or eating foods that can thin the blood. Medications that thin the blood include NSAIDS (ibuprofen), aspirin, and anticoagulants, such as warfarin. Foods that can thin the blood, including garlic and ginger., Follow your doctor's treatment plan, including getting replacement therapy, and make sure to get regular medical care and monitoring. If you have hemophilia, it is important that you keep abreast of your condition, instead of ignoring it and hoping it will go away on its own.Part of ongoing care is preventing illnesses that could be a threat to your health. You will need to have regular vaccinations and preventative care to reduce your risk of diseases that could be very serious for someone with hemophilia. For example, get a flu shot yearly to ensure that you do not get the flu."

Visit your doctor.,
Take a GH or IGF-I measurement.,
Take a glucose tolerance test.,
Check the function of the pituitary.,
Undergo imaging tests.",How to Diagnose Acromegaly2," The first thing you need to do to diagnose acromegaly is to make an appointment with your doctor. During this visit, they will conduct a general physical examination. They may also ask you about problems or symptoms.The doctor should take a detailed medical and family history.
If you have pictures of yourself taken over the years, then bringing these in to show your doctor how your face has changed may also be helpful.

, You doctor may suggest that you get a specific test to measure the levels of growth hormones (GH) or insulin-like growth factor-one (IGF-I) in your blood. These are hormones, and if you have elevated levels in your blood, then you may have acromegaly. The doctor will take a blood sample and test it.For some tests, you may have to return to the doctor the next day for the test. You must fast overnight before they can do the test. This occurs if they want to test the GH levels.
If the doctor only wants to test the IGF-I levels, you may not have to fast. The doctor may take your blood right then.

, The most effective way of determining if you have acromegaly is to get a growth hormone (GH) suppression test. The doctor will measure the GH in your blood before giving you a sugar drink. The doctor will test your blood again to measure the GH in it after being exposed to glucose.If you have acromegaly, your GH level will still be elevated after drinking a glucose drink. The normal response is that glucose lowers GH levels.
This test takes around two hours.

, If the doctor confirms acromegaly after checking hormone levels and doing a glucose test, they may next check how the parts of your pituitary not affected by the tumor function. Your doctor will test your blood.The blood will be tested for pituitary hormones. Sometimes, this condition causes other essential hormones to be low or missing.

, Your doctor may order imaging tests after checking the growth hormone levels in your blood. Generally, an MRI is ordered. This test helps to locate where the tumor on your pituitary gland is. It also helps determine the size of the tumor.If no tumor is found on the pituitary gland, they may look for other tumors that could cause the elevated GH levels.

"
"
Undergo surgery.,
Take medication.,
Undergo radiation therapy.",How to Diagnose Acromegaly3," One of the main treatments for acromegaly is surgery. During surgery, the doctors will remove the tumors located on your pituitary gland. The surgeon will go in through the nose to get to your pituitary gland.Eliminating the tumor helps to level out the production of growth hormones in your body. It also helps relieve symptoms by relieving any pressure on the surrounding tissue.

, If your doctor cannot remove all of the tumor, your body will still produce too much growth hormone. To help reduce or block your GH, your doctor will probably prescribe medication.Somatostatin analogues are one common type of medication prescribed. It helps reduce the amount of GH your pituitary gland produces. This medication is injected directly into your buttocks by a healthcare professional. You will have to do this once a month.
Dopamine agonists are another type of medication. These pills work to reduce the levels of GH and IGF-I in your body. This medication can cause compulsive behaviors, like gambling.
A growth hormone antagonist works to block the GH from interacting with your bodily tissues. This is taken as an injection that you give yourself.

, If you still have part of your tumor left after surgery, your doctor may suggest radiation. This helps to destroy any remaining tumorous cells. Radiation can also help reduce your GH levels.It may take years to see results from radiation treatments.

Look for shortness of breath.,
Notice additional coughing.,
Note instances of chest pain.,
Watch for trouble swallowing.,

Note symptoms consistent with myasthenia gravis (MG).,
Look for symptoms of red blood cell aplasia.,
Examine for symptoms of hypogammaglobulinemia.,
See your doctor.,
Have your blood drawn.,

Undergo a CT scan.,
Undergo an MRI.,
Submit to a PET scan.,
Allow your doctor to perform a fine needle biopsy.,
Have the tumor biopsied after surgery.,
Have the thymoma staged and treated.",How to Diagnose a Thymoma," The tumor can press against the windpipe (trachea) causing difficulty getting air into your lungs. Note if you easily become out of breath or feel like something is stuck in your throat to cause a choking feeling.If shortness of breath happens after exercise activities note if you have a wheezing (high-pitched whistling sound) noise when breathing. This can be asthma.;
, The tumor can irritate your lungs, trachea (windpipe), and the nerves associated with your cough reflex. Note if you have had a chronic cough from months to years with no relief from suppressants, steroids, and antibiotics.If you have acid reflux from spicy, fatty, or acidic foods, it can lead to a chronic cough. If altering your diet reduces the cough, then it isn’t likely a thymoma.If you live in or have traveled to an area with tuberculosis (TB) and have experienced a chronic cough, bloody sputum (blood mucus coughed up), night sweats, and a fever, then you may have TB for which you should still see a doctor immediately., Due to the tumor pushing on the chest wall and heart, you may develop chest pain characterized by a pressure-like feeling and location only in the center of your chest. Also, you can develop pain behind the breastbone that may hurt when applying pressure to the area.If you feel pressure-like chest pain and have sweating, palpitations (feel like your heart is jumping out of your chest), fever, or chest pain when moving or breathing, then you may have an underlying lung or heart disease.Regardless of the root cause, you should see a doctor for these symptoms.

, The thymus can grow and push against the esophagus, causing difficulty swallowing.Note if you have trouble swallowing meals or you recently switched to a more liquid diet because it's easier. The trouble may also feel like a choking sensation.

, Because the thymus tumor can become cancerous and spread throughout the body (very rarely), you may experience weight loss due to the increased needs of the cancer tissue.Check your current weight against an older reading.


If you experience unintentional weight loss without any known reason, check with your healthcare provider. Many cancers have weight loss as a symptom.

, The superior vena cava is a large vessel that collects the returning blood from the veins of the head, neck, upper extremities, and upper torso back in the heart. When this vessel becomes obstructed it backs up the blood from these areas from entering the heart. This leads to:Swelling of the face, neck, and upper body. Note if the upper part of your body looks more red or flushed.
Dilated veins in the upper body. Look at the veins in your arms, hands, and wrist to see if they look more prominent or dilated. These are usually the dark lines or tunnels we see on the hands and arms.
Headaches due to dilated veins supplying the brain.
Dizziness/light headedness. Because blood is backed up, the heart and brain receive less oxygenated blood. When your heart pumps less blood to the brain or when your brain doesn't receive enough oxygenated blood, you feel light headed or dizzy and may fall. Laying down helps remove the force of gravity your blood has to fight to supply your brain., MG is the most common paraneoplastic syndrome, which is a set of symptoms that are caused by cancer. With MG, your immune system forms antibodies that block the chemical signals that tell your muscles to move. This causes muscle weakness throughout the body. About 30 to 65 percent of people with thymomas also have myasthenia gravis. Look for:Double or blurred vision
Drooping eyelids
Trouble swallowing food
Shortness of breath due to weakness in the chest muscles and/or diaphragm
Slurred speech

, This is the destruction of premature red blood cells, which leads to symptoms of anemia (low red blood cells). Reduced RBC will lead to lack of oxygen throughout the body. This occurs in about 5 percent of thymoma patients. Look for:Shortness of breath
Fatigue
Dizziness
Weakness

, This is when your body lowers production of infection-fighting gamma globulins (protein antibodies). About five to ten percent of thymoma patients develop hypogammaglobulinemia. About ten percent of patients with hypogammaglobulinemia have a thymoma.Together with a thymoma, it is called Good’s syndrome. Look for:Recurrent infections
Bronchiectasis, which includes symptoms such as a chronic cough, large amounts of spit that may contain foul-smelling mucus, shortness of breath and wheezing, chest pain, and clubbing (the flesh under your fingernails and toenails gets thicker).Chronic diarrheaMucocutaneous candidiasis, which is a fungal infection that can cause thrush (an oral infection causing white patches or milk curd-looking growths on the tongue).Viral infections, including the herpes simplex virus, cytomegalovirus, varicella zoster (shingles), and human herpes 8 (kaposi's sarcoma), which is an underlying skin cancer usually associated with AIDS., Your doctor will collect a detailed medical history, including family history and symptoms. He or she will also ask questions based on thymoma symptoms, including those related to myasthenia gravis, red cell aplasia, and hypogammaglobulinemia symptoms. Your doctor may feel for fullness in the middle lower neck for overgrowth of the thymus., There are no lab tests for thymoma diagnosis, but there is a blood test to detect myasthenia gravis (MG) called anti-Cholinesterase AB.MG is so common in those with thymomas that it is considered a solid indicator before more expensive testing. About 84% of people under 40 with a positive anti-Cholinesterase AB test have thymomas.Before operating to remove the thymoma, your doctor will also treat the MG because if left untreated, it can cause problems with anesthesia during surgery, such as respiratory failure., To visualize a tumor mass, your physician will first order an x-ray of the chest. The radiologist will look for a mass or shadow near the center of the chest on the lower neck. Some thymomas are small and will not show up on the x-ray. If your doctor is still suspicious or if an abnormality appears on the chest x-ray, he or she may order a CT scan., A CT scan will take multiple, detailed images in cross sections from the lower part to the upper part of your chest. You may be given a contrast dye to outline the structures and blood vessels in your body. The images will give a more detailed understanding of any abnormalities, including the staging of the thymoma or if it has spread.If contrast was given, you may be advised to drink plenty of fluids to flush it out., An MRI will use radio waves and magnets to produce a series of very detailed images of your chest on a computer screen. A contrast material called gadolinium is often injected into a vein before the scan to better see details. MRI of the chest may be done to look more closely at the thymoma or when you can't tolerate or are allergic to the CT contrast. MRI images are also particularly useful in looking for cancer that may have spread to the brain or spinal cord.MRIs are very loud and some are closed meaning that you will be inserted lying down in a large cylindrical space. This can give the sensation of claustrophobia (fear of enclosed spaces) to some people.
The test may take up to an hour to complete.If you were given contrast, you may be advised to drink plenty of fluids to flush it out., This is a scan that uses a radioactive atom in glucose (type of sugar) that attracts to the thymoma. The cancer cells take up the radioactive substance and a special camera is used to create a picture of areas of radioactivity in the body. The picture is not finely detailed like a CT or MRI scan, but it can provide helpful information about your whole body. This test can help determine if a tumor seen on an image is actually a tumor or not or if the cancer has spread to other parts of the body.Doctors use combined PET/CT scans more often than PET scans alone when looking at thymomas. This lets the doctor compare areas of higher radioactivity on the PET scan with the more detailed images on the CT scan.You will be given either an oral preparation or injection of the radioactive glucose. You will wait thirty to sixty minutes for your body to absorb the material. You'll need to drink plenty of fluids after to help flush the tracer from your body.The scan will take approximately thirty minutes., Using a CT scan or ultrasound machine for visual guidance, your doctor will insert a long, hollow needle into your chest and into the suspected tumor. He or she will remove a small sample of the tumor to examine it under a microscope.If you are taking blood thinners (coumadin/warfarin), your doctor may ask you to stop days before the exam and not to eat or drink the day of the procedure. If they decide to use general anesthesia or IV sedation, you may be asked to fast the day before the procedure as well.A possible downside of this test is that it might not always get enough of a sample to make an accurate diagnosis or allow the doctor to get a good sense of the extent of the tumor., Sometimes your doctor may do a surgery biopsy (remove the tumor) without a needle biopsy if the evidence of thymoma is strong (lab tests and imaging tests). Other times a doctor will need to perform a needle biopsy first to confirm it is a thymoma. The specimen is sent to the lab after surgery to confirm the diagnosis.The exam preparation (fasting, etc.) is similar to that of a needle biopsy, except an incision will be made in the skin to gain access to the tumor to remove it.

, The stage of the tumor refers to the extent of spread to other organs, tissues and distant sites of the body. Therefore, having the thymoma staged is an essential part of determining the best course of treatment. The most commonly used staging method for thymomas is the Masaoka staging system.Stage I is an encapsulated tumor without microscopic or gross invasion. Surgical excision is the treatment of choice

Stage II is a thymoma with a macroscopic invasion of the mediastinal fat or pleura or the microscopic invasion of the capsule. Treatment is usually a complete excision with or without postoperative radiation therapy in order to reduce the incidence of recurrence.

Stage III is when the tumor has invaded the lungs, great vessels, and the pericardium. Complete surgical excision is necessary together with postoperative radiation therapy so that recurrence will not occur.

Stage IVA and IV B In these final stages, there is pleural or metastatic spread. The treatment is a combination of surgical debulking, radiation, and chemotherapy.

Ask if they have a splitting headache or visual problems.,

Ask about tests for your heart.",How to Diagnose a Stroke," You need to seek immediate medical attention if you notice any of the following signs or symptoms of a stroke in people around you, or if you experience them yourself — even if they fluctuate or disappear.Call or have someone else call 9-1-1 (or your local emergency number) immediately and don't wait to see if the symptoms get better or go away. Even if they do, you will still need to be evaluated by a doctor.


Every minute counts because the longer a stroke goes untreated, the greater the likelihood of permanent brain damage and disability.
A good acronym to remember if you suspect someone around you is having a stroke is ""FAST,"" which stands for:


Face. Ask the person to smile and see if one side of the face drops.

Arms. Ask the person to raise both arms and see if one arm doesn't move or drifts downward.

Speech. Ask the person to repeat a simple phrase and see if their speech is slurred or odd sounding.

Time. If you observe any of these signs, don't waste time and call paramedics immediately.

;
, The speech centers of the brain are often affected by strokes, so one the most noticeable signs is trouble speaking or a complete inability to verbally communicate.The stroke victim may slur their words, stutter, speak gibberish or be unable to utter a sound. A look of panic often flashes on the person's face when they realize something is seriously wrong.


If a person near you has suddenly fallen silent and has a panicky or confused look on their face, ask them what's wrong and how they're feeling.
Make sure the person isn't drunk, as that condition can sometimes mimic a stroke.

, Another common sign of a stroke, and also related to damage to the communication centers of the brain, is confusion and difficulty understanding a conversation.The stroke victim may have a blank look on their face or be frowning as you speak to them. This is why asking a person if they're having a stroke is rarely fruitful — they often can't understand you or they can't speak.


Ask them simply questions that children can normally answer. In addition to asking them if they're okay, ask what day of the week it is or what their favorite color is. If they can't answer, they're suffering from some sort of brain injury.
It's important to make note of when the suspicious signs and symptoms begin because that can give paramedics and doctors an idea of how long the brain cells have been without oxygen.

, Paralysis in the muscles of the face are a common consequence of strokes because the neurons / nerves that control the muscles get damaged.It's particularly noticeable around the eyes and corners of the mouth on the same side of the face — you'll see the muscles and attached skin droop. If you suspect a person is experiencing a stroke, ask them to smile or stick out their tongue. If they can understand you, their smile will look crooked and their tongue will deviate to one side.


Paralysis from a stroke occurs on the same side of the face and body, either on the left or right side, not a mixture of both.
Strokes in the right hemisphere of the brain affect the left side of the face / body, whereas strokes in the left hemisphere always affect the right side., As hinted at above, paralysis of the legs and arms also occur with strokes, especially if the injury is in the left hemisphere of the brain — so right-sided paralysis is more common.The paralyzed leg will look and act dead, usually internally rotating so the toes point towards the opposite foot. The paralyzed arm usually flexes at the elbow and wrist, looking like it's in a sling.


Not surprisingly, walking is difficult and looks clumsy as the leg is dragged behind. Holding things with the affected hand is virtually impossible and the person is unable to write.
Due to poor balance and coordination, falling and breaking a hip or fracturing the skull is a very real among people who have had or are experiencing a stroke. Keep the person calm and still, and try to keep them from walking or moving around as much as possible.
If a person can't raise both hands over their head at the same time it's evidence of a stroke or other type of brain injury.
Related to paralysis in the limbs and face (and usually occurring along with it) are numbness (pins and needles) and weakness.

, Other common signs of a stroke that are more difficult to notice outwardly are a splitting headache and visual problems.Headaches are often described as sudden and severe and sometimes accompanied by vomiting and dizziness. Vision may become blurred or blacked out in one or both eyes. Double vision isn't uncommon either.


The headache associated with strokes can mimic a migraine. In fact, people who suffer from chronic migraines are at greater risk of having strokes.
Like all the symptoms mentioned above, visual disturbance or even blindness is not always permanent in stroke victims. Signs and symptoms can quickly resolve themselves as the blockage in the brain disappears or if treatment such as blood thinners is given in a reasonable amount of time (within an hour).

, Once you're rushed to a hospital or emergency clinic, you'll get a physical exam in order to evaluate the type of stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) and the areas of your brain affected.The doctor will give you a neurological assessment, take your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, look into your eyes, ask about your family history, any medical problems including risk factors for stroke, inquire about what drugs you're taking (especially any blood thinners), and your as allergy history.


After listening to your heart, your doctor will try to detect a whooshing sound (bruit) over the carotid arteries of your neck — it can indicate atherosclerosis (plaque build up) .
Other conditions that can mimic the symptoms of a stroke include: a severe head injury (concussion), a brain tumor, epilepsy or a severe drug reaction.

, While in the emergency department, a sample of your blood will be taken and analyzed in the lab to see how well it clots, if your blood sugar (glucose) is too high or low, whether you have an infection and if electrolytes are out of balance.All these factors may affect how you'll be treated / managed in the hospital.


Thick blood that clots quicker can make an ischemic stroke worse.
Two tests done in the lab to check for clotting ability are called the PT and PTT tests.
Low blood glucose levels (hypoglycemia) may mimic symptoms similar to those of a stroke.
High blood glucose levels (hyperglycemia) are common with diabetes and increase the risk of stroke because too much sugar in the blood is toxic and damaging to blood vessels.

, CT scans use a series of x-rays to create a detailed image of your brain, which is great for showing blockages, bleeding, tissue death, tumors, infections, congenital deformities and other conditions.Even if the physical signs of a stroke are obvious, CT scans need to be carried out to determine if the stroke is caused by a vessel blockage (ischemic) or burst vessel (hemorrhagic), as well as what part of the brain is affected most.Everyone with a suspected stroke should receive a CT scan within an hour of the event.

, An MRI uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to produce 3-D images of the brain and it too can show the location and extent of the brain injury caused by a stroke. However, the image produced by MRI is typically sharper and more detailed than an image from a CT scan, so it's often the preferred diagnostic tool to diagnose small, deep injuries within the brain.An MRI is sometimes done in conjunction with a CT scan, but it depends on the results of the CT scan and what the neurologist decides.
For people with more complex symptoms related to a stroke, where the extent or location of the damage is unknown, MRI is often more appropriate.Injected dye can also be used with an MRI to better highlight blood vessels and is called an MRI angiography or venography.

, To further investigate the carotid arteries of your neck for any blockage or bleeding, a carotid duplex ultrasound is performed. With this test, the doctor uses an ultrasound device on your neck that sends out sound waves to create detailed images of the inside of your carotid arteries, including the flow of the blood within the vessel.It can show the fatty deposits and plaque build up of atherosclerosis the best.


Getting a carotid ultrasound is especially important if your doctor detected a bruit in your neck with their stethoscope during the physical exam.
When carotid ultrasound is deemed important, it should done within 48 hours of the event for best results.Related to a carotid ultrasound is a cerebral angiogram, where dye is injected into your carotid and vertebral arteries from a long, thin catheter. X-rays of the neck are then taken to look for blockages or bleeds.

, Because blockages in your brain can originate from your heart (called emboli), your heart should be checked out also. Aside from a general chest x-ray, the two main tests to check heart function and get detailed images of it are an electrocardiogram (EKG or ECG for short) and an echocardiogram (also called a 2-d echo or Cardiac echo).An electrocardiogram is a test that shows the pattern of electrical activity in your heart, whereas an echocardiogram uses sound waves to create detailed pictures of your heart.


An EKG basically shows how fast your heart is beating and its rhythm (steady or irregular). It also records the strength and timing of electrical signals as they pass through each part of your heart.An EKG uses 12 electrical leads attached to your chest, arms and legs to record the signals.
An echocardiogram can find the source of clots in your heart that traveled to your brain and got stuck.
Ultrasound probes can be placed on your chest (called a trans-thoracic echocardiogram or TTE), or deep in your throat (trans-esophageal echocardiogram or TEE).

Serve in plastic.,
Plan the meal that you serve.,
Make special preparations for overnight guests.,
Have emergency phone numbers handy.",How to Prepare a Home for Visitors With Allergies," Bring up allergies as a general topic of discussion and ask if the guest has any personal of dealing with allergy problems. This discussion should take place a few days before you host any event so you have time to prepare your home to adjust to the special needs of your guests.;
, If possible, try to make sure that your pets will not cause any allergy problems. If your guests are allergic to certain pets such as cats, host the gathering at a location that is separate from where the cats usually reside.

, Carpets can attract dust and insects that can be a major cause of allergic reactions. Vacuum at least twice if you must use a location with carpeting, otherwise hard surfaces such as tiled floors are more suitable.

, Soft chairs such as cushioned sofas attract more dust and coming in direct contact with dust is a common cause of allergy symptoms appearing.

, Use sanitizers to wipe tables and counter-tops where you will be serving food.

, This will help keep your property clean during a party while keeping the insects outside.

, The air purifiers will keep the air clean, which is particularly important for people that can suffer from asthma due to allergies. Air purifiers reduce the amount of dust and pollen in the air to lower reactions to dust and pollen allergies.

, Dehumidifiers reduce the amount of moisture in the air, which reduces the growth of mold. Mold can be a major problem for a guest with allergies triggered by mold.

, You can serve in plastic plates and cups with plastic utensils so you don't have to worry about whether your cutlery has been washed properly.

, Refrain from serving anything that your guests may be allergic to (avoid serving peanuts, milk, egg and fish in large quantities since these are causes of the most common food allergies). You may want to consider labeling your dishes so guests know what is in them.

, You may want to use hyper-allergenic pillows and mattresses in your guest room that are specially designed to prepare a home for visitors with allergies. If you can't allergy proof your home entirely, at least make sure the bathroom as well as the bedroom that is designated for guests has been cleaned using disinfectants.

, You should try to get the contact information of a local allergy specialist who offers 24-hour emergency service. Add his or her phone number to your speed dial or put it on a sticky-pad that you can stick to your refrigerator door.

Understand that herbal remedies can take time to take effect.,
Eat a fungicidal herb such as garlic.,
Take immunity boosting herbs such as echinacea.,
Consume a detoxifying herb such as dandelion root.,
Try herbs that restore brain function, like gingko biloba.,
Take adaptogens like Siberian ginseng.",How to Naturally Recover from Toxic Mold Exposure1," Unlike allopathic or chemical cures, herbal cures work in a natural, organic and gentle way. Do not expect miraculous results within a week. Also keep in mind that you have to use them day after day in order to see any benefits - you cannot use them sporadically.


Ideally, it would take no more than two months for any evidence of fungal/mold infection to disappear, however you can continue using the herbal remedies after this point, as they will continue to strengthen your immune capacity and the resistance level of your skin.
If you are worried about any herbal contraindications or interaction with a specific drug that you are taking, you should consult your medical practitioner to discuss the matter.;
, Garlic possesses powerful anti-fungal properties and can kill fungi, molds and yeasts. While garlic is most commonly used to cure Candida yeast infection, this herb may also help you in the days after exposure to mold. Garlic is one of the most powerful anti-fungal herbs available.


Garlic is effectual in curing ear infections resulting from the Aspergillus fungus and is often used in the form of prescription anti-fungals. For patients who suffer from Candida yeast infection, garlic is effective in removing bad fungi while preserving the good bacteria in the system.
You may take 2 to 4 grams of fresh garlic per day or opt for garlic tablets (600 mg to 900mg daily) or make a garlic infusion by infusing 4 grams of fresh garlic in 150 ml of water.
Patients who suffer from hemophilia or platelet dysfunction and those who have undergone surgery are advised against taking garlic supplements as it has blood thinning properties.
Some other powerful anti-fungal herbs that can be effectual in minimizing the effects of mold exposure problems include clove, thyme and Pau d'Arco.

, Certain herbs, such as echinacea, can be effective in protecting and boosting immune function. echinacea also can help to accelerate healing from viral infections such as flu and cold, in addition to clearing fungal infections.


Echinacea stimulates polysaccharides and forms immune stimulators that boost the immune system and help it to manufacture more T cells. Echinacea is comprised of antimicrobial compounds which support the function of the immune system by combating infection and swelling.
Add 1 to 2 grams of dried echinacea to a mug of tea and drink this three times a day. Alternatively you can apply a liquid tincture of echinacea to the affected area.
Cordyceps, oil of oregano and garlic are some other popular herbs that can help to stimulate the immune system.

, Detoxifying herbs can be used to cleanse the organs and bloodstream of harmful substances. Dandelion root, in particular, acts by enhancing the flow of urine, sweat, tears and other body secretions to detoxify the body.


Dandelion root is regarded as an effective detoxifier as it helps drive out germs and impurities from body. Vitamin C rich dandelion is a mild herb and can be consumed daily without fear of side effects.
Chopped dandelion can be mixed in a salad or drink and consumed. If dandelion is not locally available then buy capsule supplements and consume a 2 gm capsule daily.
Following a case of mold exposure, milk thistle may also prove to be effectual, though animal research done on the drug is inconclusive. However, you could try taking 420 mg of milk thistle extract daily in form of a tablet for anti-fungal benefits.

, Exposure to certain kinds of mold can give rise to nervous system damage or cerebral allergy. Therefore, herbs which safeguard the function of the brain - such as ginkgo biloba - are considered helpful for recovery.


In order to enhance cognition and memory, ginkgo biloba can be useful as a supplement. It acts by boosting circulation, leading to an increased supply of oxygen to the brain. ginkgo acts directly on the brain by boosting the blood supply. As a result, the brain sends stronger signals to the immune system which helps to fight off fungal reactions.
Take 2 to 4 mg of ginkgo biloba herbal extract daily with your tea. You can also consume it in the form of a capsule.
As ginkgo biloba has blood thinning properties, it should not be consumed by post operative and pregnant patients.

, Adaptogens work to normalize bodily functions and help the body to achieve homeostasis, or a state of balance. Most of these herbs also protect the immune system and can be used for their ability to restore the kidneys, adrenal glands and other organs to their original healthy states.


One commonly used adaptogen is Siberian ginseng. This herb, when consumed over a long time, can help your body to adjust to exposure to toxic substances such as molds, physical injury and other things that cause stress.
Ginseng comes in a powdered form and you can take 2-5 gm daily, depending upon the intensity of the fungal infection.
Maca, astragalus and rhodiola rosea are some other adaptogens that produce similar effects to gingko biloba.

Take artichoke leaf extract.,
Consume foods high in omega-3 fats.,
Increase your vitamin D intake.,
Eat more foods that contain glutathione.,
Cut down on your sugar intake.",How to Naturally Recover from Toxic Mold Exposure2," According to research published in the ""Journal of Agricultural Food Chemistry"" in 2004, artichoke leaf extract helps to cancel out the effects of many kinds of fungi, including yeasts and molds.


Artichoke extract can be found in capsule form. Take one capsule containing a 320 mg dosage twice a day.

, These are a mixture of animal and plant sources. Krill oil, salmon and tuna are the best animal-based sources of omega-3, while avocado is a good source of plant-based omega 3.


Alternatively, you can take an omega-3 dietary supplement. Take one 500 mg capsule of omega-3 fatty acids daily.

, According to research, Vitamin D may be useful for preventing mold allergies. Therefore, you should ensure that the levels of vitamin D in your body are optimal.


To do this, you should eat more cheese, fatty fish (such as salmon, mackerel and tuna,) beef liver, egg yolks etc.
If you choose to increase your vitamin D intake using supplements, take one 600 IU tablet daily.

, Glutathione is referred to as the ""master antioxidant"" due to its ability to optimize the activity of every other antioxidant present in the body.


The ideal way to boost your level of glutathione is to take a high quality whey protein supplement. You can also eat lots of asparagus, avocados, walnuts, tomatoes and broccoli.
The recommended dosage of glutathione supplements is 250 mg once per day.

, Fungi, which include molds and yeasts, require the presence of sugar for survival. Therefore, it will be beneficial for you to remove or significantly cut down on your intake of sugar.


For quite some time now, low-sugar diets have been popularized in an effort to fight candida infection. It is a sensible idea to cut of the food supply for the fungi in order to put an end to fungal yeast or mold infections and regain health.
If you have diabetes, it's important to ensure that your blood sugar levels are under control, otherwise it could make the mold exposure much harder to get rid off.

Common food allergens include, but are not limited to:


peanuts
tree nuts
milk
eggs
wheat
soy
fish
shellfish
sesame;
, Some people with allergies can be around the food they're allergic to, they just cannot eat it. In this case, it may be safe to buy and prepare that food for other guests, as long as precautions are taken.Other individuals may have more severe allergies. These individuals may experience symptoms from merely breathing in the same room as their allergen.Ask your guest how severe the allergy is. Make sure they're honest and straightforward to avoid any potential problems. If the guest is telling you about the allergy, then they are asking you to understand their condition. This is the best time to ask them how they handle any reactions.
If your guest's allergy is severe, you'll need to avoid having that food out (or any traces of it left behind) when you prepare your meal. You may even need to remove that food from your home altogether for really severe allergies.

, Anytime you host a guest, you should make that individual feel at home. If your guest has a food allergy, they might feel self-conscious about that allergy. Many people worry about being an inconvenience or a burden on others, especially if they have special needs that must be accommodated.


Let your guest know that you are more than happy to make accommodations for their allergy.
Don't make a big deal about preparing a separate meal for your guest. This may make them feel even more self-conscious about their needs.
The way to make a guest feel at home is to give alternatives to all your guests. Don’t make a separate meal just for one person. You could make two dishes and just announce to all, “This is the one without _____,” That way the guest with allergies will feel at home. It will also allow guests who have mild allergies but who have not told you about them to make educated meal choices.
If the person is also a vegetarian, then another option is to prepare a vegetarian option for your guests and let the person with the allergy know that it is free of the ingredient they are allergic to. However, if the person is a meat-eater, then they might prefer to have a meat option for their meal. You can always check with them if you are unsure.
Try to offer at least a few different options to your guest. If they stay with you for a week and eat the same meal(s) every day, the meal may feel a little repetitive.

, Even with careful planning, there is always a risk that your guest could come into accidental contact with an allergen. Mild reactions can occasionally be treated at home, but severe allergies may be fatal and will typically require hospitalization.


Mild allergic reactions may include hives/rash, redness/itchiness of the skin, stomach pain (including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea), sneezing or coughing, runny nose, nasal congestion, or a strange taste in the mouth.Skin rashes and itching can be treated with creams, lotions, and antihistamines. Swelling can be treated with corticosteroids in some individuals.Signs of anaphylaxis include difficulty breathing, a tight throat, a faint pulse, pale or blue skin, swollen tongue or lips, widespread hives/redness, severe gastric reactions, or feelings of anxiety/confusion/disorientation.Epinephrine should be administered if your guest experiences anaphylaxis. If symptoms do not improve or if they return, you may administer more doses after waiting at least five minutes from the previous dose.Call emergency services (911 in the United States) for any severe reaction. While you wait for emergency services, have the individual lay flat with their legs elevated and keep the individual warm with blankets to avoid a drop in body temperature., Once you know what you can and cannot work with to prepare food for your guest, you may be able to easily modify a recipe you already know. If you cannot do this, or if you'd rather get creative in the kitchen, you can purchase a food allergy recipe book in bookstores or online. You can also find recipes online for free by searching for ""allergy-friendly recipes.""Consider using websites that are written by organizations or medical professionals. These tend to contain more reliable information than a personal blog or website might offer.
If possible, look for recipes written or approved by a licensed nutritionist.
A nutritionist's abbreviated credentials may be CNS (Certified Nutritional Specialist), CCN (Certified Clinical Nutritionist), RD (Registered Dietitian), CCN (Certified Nutritional Consultant), CN (Certified Nutritionist), or MD (Medical Doctor)., Before you purchase or prepare anything for your guest, you should read all the labels on those products. Food labels will state whether a given allergen is in that product. Labels will also say whether a product ""may contain"" a given allergen.


Carefully read the labels and ingredients of every product you purchase before making food for a food allergic guest.
In addition to the ingredients list, the label should disclose whether the food was prepared on any shared equipment that could create a cross-contact risk., For guests who are lactose intolerant or who have an allergy to dairy or eggs, you'll need to provide some type of allergy-friendly substitute. Fortunately, dairy and eggs are two of the easiest foods to substitute when cooking for someone with allergies.Nondairy milk made from rice, soy, almond, or other nuts can be a good alternative if your guest is allergic to dairy.You can also buy nondairy cheese, yogurt, and other foods.
If your guest is allergic to eggs, try scrambling tofu, using frozen yogurt, or topping sandwiches with avocado or hummus instead of mayonnaise., Seafood is an umbrella term that covers both fish and shellfish. Some people are allergic to just fish, others to shellfish, and still others to both. If your guest is allergic to any type of seafood, you'll need to get creative.


Use canned chicken instead of canned tuna for guests with a fish allergy.You can also mix olives and sun-dried tomatoes into cream cheese and serve it on a bagel as a delicious alternative to smoked salmon or lox.
If your guest has a shellfish allergy, use risotto cakes instead of crab cakes. You can also serve other meats or meat alternatives instead of shellfish., Soy allergies can usually be avoided if your guest eats meat. However, if your guest is vegetarian or vegan and has a soy allergy, you'll need to find substitutes that meet your guest's dietary needs.


Avoid soy by using seitan or a meat product instead of tofu. You can also use rice milk, nut milk, or dairy instead of soy milk., Individuals with a wheat allergy cannot eat many food staples like pasta or bread. However, that doesn't mean that you can't make a delicious meal for that individual.


Try using pasta made from corn, rice, or quinoa for guests with a wheat allergy.Search online for other alternatives or ask your guest what they usually use instead of wheat products.

, Cross-contact is the accidental exposure to an allergen that takes place during a food product's storage, preparation, or serving. Even if you don't actually cook or serve the allergen, it's still possible to expose your guest to that allergen if you're not careful.


Keep the allergen(s) as far as possible from the rest of your food and your food preparation area.
If your guest has a severe allergy, you may need to remove the allergen from your household altogether.
Ask your guest about the severity of their allergy to determine the best course of action.

, To help reduce the risk of cross-contact, you'll need to thoroughly clean your cooking and eating utensils and equipment, as well as the food preparation area. You should do this before preparing or handling the allergic guest's food and after you've handled or prepared the allergen.



Wash your hands with soap and water anytime you handle or come into contact with an allergenic food.You should also wash your hands before handling or serving the allergic guest's food.
Make sure your utensils, dishware, and cookware have all been thoroughly washed with soap and water before preparing or serving any food to your guest.
If your guest dines with you regularly, you may want to consider buying utensils, cookware, and dishware that will only be used for allergen-free foods.Dishwashing liquid alone may not be enough to effectively remove certain allergens like peanut protein from tabletops and other surfaces. Try using soap and a commercial cleaning product like bleach to ensure all preparation and dining surfaces are safe.

, If cooking food for other guests that contains the allergen, cook the food allergic guest's meal first to avoid cross-contact. That way if any cross-contact occurs, it will only be the allergy-friendly food coming into contact with the allergen. Keep the allergic guest's food covered and as far as possible from the other food which contains the allergen."

Avoid ragweed.",How to Prevent Autumn Allergies1," Pollen, such as ragweed, which blooms in late August and lasts until the first frost, is a common fall allergen. Wearing a mask, although not 100% effective can significantly reduce your pollen exposure when working outside. It is recommended that you wear a surgical-style face mask while outside during the autumn allergy season. You can buy an appropriate face mask at a local drugstore.
It is recommended that you look for a mask with an “N95” rating from the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health.;
, Most weather stations and websites will report on pollen counts during the fall allergy season. On days when the pollen count is particularly high you should avoid heading outdoors. You can also stay inside during certain times of the day. For instance, pollen counts are typically highest in the late morning and early afternoon. This will help to minimize your exposure to allergens. Warm, dry, and windy days are the worst for those who suffer from ragweed allergies. For example, weather.com is a great site that includes an allergy tracker. Just type in your location and click on the allergy tracker located in the health section.

, During the fall season, in some parts of the world, trees will lose their leaves. Wet leaves act as a perfect breeding ground for mold, a common allergen. If you suffer from a mold allergy have someone else in your household remove fallen leaves from your yard. , An allergy to ragweed, known as hay fever, is one of the most common fall allergies. Make sure that you do not have any ragweed in your own yard and minimize your contact with the plant while it is pollinating, from late August through to the first frost. Plant cover crops such as clover or buckwheat to help prevent ragweed from taking root in your yard. "

Get a portable air filter.,
Remove clothes once you get in your home.,
Avoid physical contact with grass.",How to Manage Grass Allergies2," In particular, pollen levels are highest between 5am and 10am, so limit your time outside during that part of the day. If you need to be outside, try to do it in the afternoon and also after a heavy rain. This is when pollen levels are lowest.Dry and windy days can be especially bad for allergies. Try to stay inside as much as possible on day like that.Many news broadcasts and weather apps now include local pollen and allergy information. Keep up to date on the latest information, so you can limit exposure on high-allergen days.

, Just as you should limit your time outside, you should limit the amount of unfiltered outside air that gets into your home. Keeping doors and windows closed will limit the amount of grass pollen that gets into your home.If you want some air circulation in your home, try turning on an air-circulation feature on your heating and air conditioning system, if you have one. This will allow air flow but will filter the air to get rid of pollen and dust.

, If your home HVAC system does not filter the air in your home enough, you can get a portable air filter to filter it even further. These will get even more pollen out of the air.


HEPA-grade filters can be bought online or at your local home improvement store.

, If you do spend time outside, you should remove pollen covered clothes immediately when entering your home. Launder clothes that are potentially covered in pollen and don't allow them to come into contact with indoor surfaces before they are cleaned.


You will not always be able to take your clothes off when you come inside. However, if you have outer layers that can be removed and isolated, do that.

, A person with severe grass allergies should not be mowing lawns or having a lot of direct contact with grass. For instance, do not lay on your lawn or move grass clippings with bare hands. The physical contact can place pollen directly onto your skin.


In cases of severe grass allergies, physical contact with grass can lead to red skin or rashes, in addition to cardio-vascular problems.
However, unmowed lawns can be worse than clipped lawns for those with grass allergies, depending on the type of grass. Be sure to have your lawn mowed regularly so that it does not flower and produce more pollen.If you must cut your own grass, wear a N-95 respirator mask, take your allergy medication beforehand and shower immediately afterward.

Rely on air conditioning to cool down your home.

, Ozone (O3) kills many forms of mold, fungi, and bacteria but can be toxic in high levels. Since you won’t be able to fully air out the area, an air-purifier that attracts negatively charged ions (most allergens) rather than ozone gas should be better.There are air-purifiers that come with a UV light which is effective at killing mold and mildew as well.

, Clean areas in the bathroom or kitchen that may be prone to mold and mildew. There are a number of approaches you can take. Clean areas with either:Pure white vinegar. Pour into a spray bottle and spray onto any area that may be inviting to mold and mildew — any area that may be damp, warm and dark. Leave on for 15–30 minutes and wipe away
A solution of one part bleach and nine parts water. Spray onto problem areas and let stand for 15–30 minutes and wipe away.
A mixture of tea tree oil and water. Mix 1 ounce of tea tree oil with 2 cups of warm water. Shake well. Spray onto problem areas and let stand for 15–30 minutes and wipe away. You can mix tea tree oil with carpet shampoo solutions as well. Use 1 ounce of tea tree oil for each gallon of carpet shampoo

, Cupboards and closets are good hiding places for mold and mildew. Check under sinks for leaks and any mold or mildew formation. Clean and air out these spaces as well as you can.

Keep it simple.",How to Live With Food Allergies," You may think you have a food intolerance or food allergy, but to know for sure, schedule an appointment with a licensed allergist.The allergist will conduct the right tests to zero in on your problem with food.


A food intolerance is not a food allergy; a food allergy occurs when your body’s immune system negatively reacts to a certain food, while a food intolerance is when your body is missing an enzyme necessary to digest a certain food.Though a food intolerance can trigger similar symptoms to that of a food allergy, a food intolerance is generally less serious, causing few problems beyond digestive issues.If you do have a food allergy or allergies, discuss a plan with your allergist. Food Allergy Research & Education (FARE), a leading education organization for food allergy sufferers, provides a emergency plan worksheet that you can fill out with your allergist to assess when and how to use medication in response to a reaction.;
, The only way to prevent a food allergy reaction is to avoid the food you’re allergic to. If you accidentally consume a problem food, take your medication at the first sign of reaction.


A serious reaction may be anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis can happen within seconds or minutes of eating the problem food.Swelling of lips, tongue, or throat, diarrhea and vomiting, and either difficulty breathing or reduced blood pressure are all symptoms of an anaphylactic reaction. Also look out for paleness, weak pulse, dizziness, and confused state.If your doctor prescribed you epinephrine (commonly an EpiPen or Adrenaclick), you, or a helper, should inject yourself with the medicine. Make sure you keep the medication current, though you should use it in an emergency even if it’s expired.
Even if the epinephrine has stopped your symptoms, go to the emergency room.
A mild reaction can be evidenced by hives, dry, itchy rashes, redness on the skin or around the eyes, itchiness in the mouth or ear canal, nausea or vomiting, diarrhea, stomach pain, nasal congestion, sneezing, dry cough, strange taste in mouth, or contractions of the uterus.Your allergist may prescribe an antihistamine to treat symptoms from a mild reaction.A severe reaction can be seen as swelling of lips, throat, shortness of breath, difficulty swallowing, drop in blood pressure, loss of consciousness and sense of “impending doom.”
There is some overlap between symptoms of anaphylaxis and a milder reaction. If unsure of the severity of your reaction, the benefits of using epinephrine outweigh the costs., Wearing an allergy bracelet will alert emergency personnel of your allergies so you can be treated safely. Talk with your allergist about the information necessary to put on this bracelet.The bracelet should indicate whether an EpiPen should be used.
The bracelet should have at one emergency phone number.
The bracelet should indicate any emergency procedures to be followed.,


Have with you a supply of emergency epinephrine and antihistamines/inhalers, as provided by your allergist.

, Learning how to cope with a food allergy will lead you to some, or many, lifestyle changes, which will inevitably alter interactions between you and family, friends, co-workers, and strangers.


While nutritional counseling can assist you in developing strategies for staying healthy, traditional counseling might be valuable if you’re feeling ostracized or confused by the consequence your food allergies have had on yourself and/or loved ones., How you adapt to a food allergy diagnosis will depend on your status as single, coupled, or member of a group sharing a home. If you live alone, it’s easy to institute a complete ban on problem foods; if you live with others, you may consider allowing problem foods under certain conditions.Consider the likelihood that the allergic person will come into contact with problem foods if the problem foods are in the house. (Is the allergic person a child? How old is the child? How capable is the child of taking responsibility for avoiding contact with problem foods?)
Consider the costs and benefits for each person in the household of keeping the problem foods in the house versus banning them.

, Split the respective foods by shelf and container.Clearly label the problem foods.
To avoid cross-contamination, get into the habit of cleaning all the surfaces and the appliances on which the foods come into contact both before and after preparation and consumption.
Try to limit eating to certain places to decrease the chance of cross-contamination.

, Whether you or someone with whom you’re living is looking at a food item in your kitchen cabinet or one in the grocery store aisle, you will want to know what to search for in studying the label.


All FDA-regulated manufactured food products are required by US law to list a “major food allergen” on the product label.
Major food allergens include milk, wheat, egg, peanuts, tree nuts, fish, crustacean shellfish, and soy.
Unexpected sources of allergens are not required to appear on the label.You should conduct personal research if you’re allergic to a less common allergen. Search for information on foods closely related to your problem foods. Call manufacturers or contact them through their websites to get more insight into whether your problem foods appear in a product.

, When you leave home, you necessarily lose some control over your exposure to food. Know your needs for the environment you are entering, and be sure to inform those who will be in contact with you on how best to create a healthy environment. Have your emergency medication such as epinephrine available at all times with you.

, Provide the school with your Food Allergy & Anaphylaxis Emergency Care Plan as well as a supply of emergency epinephrine and antihistamines/inhalers, as provided by your allergist.Talk to the food service director to get a sense of school-wide habits that will prevent problem foods from causing a problem, whether in the cafeteria or on the school bus.Research suggests half of children are bullied for a food allergy at school.Talk to administrators and teachers on ways to counter bullying and make the school cafeteria inclusive.

, To ensure that your lunches at work are allergen-free, try suggesting restaurants that cater to allergy sufferers.


Don’t be afraid to start conversations about your allergy with co-workers, though you’ll want to opt for a light touch when educating them.
Suggest team-building activities that don’t involve foods.
Be sure to bring your own plate at work functions and try to eat before your colleagues to avoid cross-contamination., Though you may want a spontaneous night out in the town, a little legwork will go a long way in finding a restaurant suitable to your needs.


Talk to your allergist about allergy-friendly restaurants.
Review menus to look out for problem foods.
Try to avoid restaurants predisposed to cross-contamination (i.e. buffets, bakeries, Asian restaurants, seafood restaurants).Call the restaurant at a less than busy time (2-4pm) so you can ask them questions about their comfort level and safety precautions serving people who have your food allergy.

, Nobody is as concerned about your food allergy as you are; use your concern to your advantage by coming to the restaurant informed and ready to enjoy a healthful meal.


Have a food allergy health card ready to distribute to waitstaff and the manager to inform them of your needs.Don’t hesitate to ask questions about your order. The old truism applies: better safe than sorry.
Ask to speak to the manager with whom you spoke to by phone earlier, and thank them for their consideration in delivering you a safe, delicious meal.
Show your appreciation to a restaurant that satisfies your requests by thanking the servers, manager, and staff.

, If you’re unsure about the menu, consider something like a baked potato or broiled chicken.Avoid fried foods and desserts.
While traveling, search for hotels with microwaves and/or kitchens that will allow you to make your own food."

Purge allergens from your sheets.,
Wash your bedding every week.,
Shower before bed.,
Dust and vacuum regularly.,
Declutter the room.,
Keep your windows dry.,
Exile pets.,
Use heating and cooling to your advantage.,
Invest in air filters.",How to Make Your Bedroom Hypoallergenic," Your bed is an allergen hotspot. This is because bedding uses material like feathers and because the bed itself is a haven for dust mites, microscopic creatures that feed on dead skin cells and whose feces and dead bodies cause allergic reactions like coughing and a runny nose. Be sure to secure your bed from these allergy sources.Encase your pillows, bed, and box-springs in allergy-proof plastic or knit covers. These will keep out dust and prevent mites from colonizing your bed.
Replace any feather pillows and/or comforters with hypoallergenic alternatives like cotton. Feather and wool bedding is also harder to clean, and therefore a center for dust mites.
Buy bedding that doesn’t trap dust and is easy to clean — choose washable fabrics, as well.;
, Most people only strip the bed about once every two weeks. For the allergy-prone, this isn’t quite often enough. Besides hypoallergenic covers, secure your bed by washing blankets and other bedding often, preferably every week.Wash the sheets, pillowcases, and blankets in hot water. The water needs to be at least 130°F or 54.4°C to kill dust mites and remove allergens.
Dry on a high setting (over 130°F or 54.5°C) for at least 15 minutes.
Wash your mattress cover, too. Check the label to make sure, but it should be safe to machine wash. You can vacuum your mattress while washing the cover.
While you can also kill dust mites by freezing non-washable items for 24 hours, this will not remove allergens like the dust mite feces.

, Another way that to ensure your bed is allergy-proof is to shower before you tuck in. Make a warm and thorough shower a part of your evening routine — it will be relaxing as well as better for your allergies.Showering will remove pollen and other possible allergens that you’ve picked up during the day.
Change into freshly laundered pajamas, too, and deposit your clothes in a hamper. For best results, make sure your PJs are washed with hypoallergenic detergent.

, Your bedroom harbors allergens beyond the bed, especially in the carpeting and other places where dust can accumulate. This makes regular cleaning a must. Dusting and vacuuming will remove potential allergens like pollen, dead skin cells, and pet dander.When you dust, use a dampened or oiled cloth rather than a dry one to prevent particulate matter from getting into the air.
Use a vacuum with a double micro-filter bag or a HEPA filter (High-efficiency particulate air filter) to get rid of allergens best. Stay out of the vacuumed room for about two hours, until the air resettles.
While vacuuming will remove particles like dust and pollen, it’s not as good as getting rid of dust mites. Replacing rugs and carpeting with hardwood or linoleum flooring is preferable, if you can.

, Purge clutter and objects in your room that collect dust — because if it traps dust, it will draw dust mites. Try to get rid of easily moveable objects and replace things like furniture with easier-to-clean pieces.Trash old magazines, papers, and newspapers and put away other knick-knacks. Books collect lots of dust, too, so move them to a different room if you’d like to keep them. Stuffed animals and many decorative pillows attract dust and are hard to clean, so avoid them if possible.
Replace upholstered furniture with pieces made from plastic, metal, wood, or leather. These will harbor less dust and are easier to clean.
Be aware that venetian blinds and many kinds of curtains collect lots of dust. Use washable, cotton curtains instead or washable, roller-style blinds.

, Mold and mildew is yet another source of allergens and can trigger respiratory reactions like asthma. Watch out for them especially on or around your windows, where condensation tends to appear. Make sure to keep the windows dry and uncovered.Wipe condensation from the windows and window frames regularly with a cloth.
Opt for lightweight curtains or blinds over heavy fabrics, as the latter are better at trapping in moisture and prevent air from circulating over the windows.
Keep the blinds open during the day, too, to let natural light in and promote air circulation over the windows.

, You probably aren’t allergic to your cat or dog, but they can still make your other allergies worse. Pets can transport pollen and leave dander in dead skin cells and hair, which is great food for dust mites. As much as you love them, the bedroom is not always the best place for pets.Keep your bedroom door closed at all times and teach your pet to know that the room is off-limits. Alternately, install a pet gate to block access.
Keep your cat or dog off the bed, if you do let it inside.

, Mold, mildew, and dust mites all thrive in moist and humid air. The key to reducing their levels is to keep your bedroom dry and the humidity levels as low as you can. Do this by using heating, cooling, and other systems to your benefit. In general, keep your windows closed to prevent pollens and spores from entering from outside.
Open the windows one or two times per day if your home lacks internal ventilation, however. Outside of North America some buildings are ventilated ONLY through the windows, hence keeping them shut will cause humidity to build and lead to mold and mildew growth, especially in winter.
Use an air conditioning unit when it’s warm out to keep the humidity low. You can also turn down the thermometer. Dust mites have trouble breeding in temperatures below 77°F (25°C).
Run a dehumidifier if you live in a warm and moist area. Try to maintain humidity levels at about 30% to 50%. You can track the levels with a battery-powered humidity gauge.

, The right air filter or circulation system can greatly reduce the amount of allergens in your home, and also in your bedroom. You can either add these directly to your furnace or set up a room unit. It can be costly, but it’s well worth the investment. Install a HEPA filter to your furnace if you have a forced-air heating system. Electrostatic air filters work, too, though they are less efficient than HEPA filters. Make sure to clean all filters and air ducts at least once per year.
You can also buy a room air purifier, which are available in HEPA, Electrostatic, and other varieties. These will help to scrub dust, pollen, and mold spores from the air; however, some units may also emit trace amounts of ozone — a respiratory irritant.Cover your AC vents with cheesecloth to avoid the intake of pollen from outdoors, as well.

Many times people with these chronic conditions experience weight loss when their conditions are not properly managed. This generally occurs from severe malabsorption of calories and other nutrients in addition to a fear of eating foods.Once the condition has been managed and absorption has been restored to normal, it's natural to experience some weight gain and this may even be beneficial; however, too much weight gain or weight gain that puts you into an overweight BMI category is not beneficial.
Talk to your doctor about how much weight loss would be appropriate for you and ask about what types of diets or eating plans will be safe and appropriate for your condition.
Also consider talking to a registered dietitian. These nutrition professionals frequently specialize in celiac disease and other allergies and can help you manage your condition while losing weight. Ask your doctor for a referral or search online.;
, Even with a condition like celiac or a gluten sensitivity, the best way to lose weight is to pay attention to your total calorie intake and decrease your calorie intake to help start weight loss.


To lose weight safely, which is especially important if you've had previous unwanted weight loss with these conditions, is to cut out about 500 calories a day.This will result in about a one to two pound weight loss each week.You want to aim for this slow, more gradual weight loss to make sure you're eating enough nutrients to maintain a healthy body.
Start by noting all the foods and drinks you consume in a typical day and figure out the total calories you're eating.
Subtract 500 from this number to determine a new calorie goal that will help you lose weight. Do not consume less than 1,200 or you risk gallstones, extreme fatigue, and other side effects., Although it may seem like gluten is in a wide variety of foods — and it is — many foods are actually naturally gluten-free. Most protein, fruits and vegetables are nutritious and gluten-free.Protein is essential for a well-balanced and lower-calorie diet. It helps fuel weight loss and keep you satisfied during the day.Include one or two 3-4 oz servings of leaner protein per meal. Choose a variety of these naturally gluten-free protein sources: seafood, poultry, eggs, low-fat dairy, lean beef, beans and nuts.Whole fruits and vegetables are also naturally gluten-free and are an important part of your weight loss diet. Aim for five to nine servings daily to help you meet your minimum intake.Although whole, unprocessed and minimally processed protein, fruits and vegetables are usually 100% gluten-free, always double check. For example, frozen vegetables that come in a sauce or gravy may have gluten or pre-made salads may have gluten in the dressing.

, Having either celiac disease or a gluten sensitivity may have you thinking you can never have grains or foods made with grains. However, there are plenty of tasty options that can serve as gluten-free substitutes.


Grains like wheat, barley and rye and their flours are not tolerated with celiac or a gluten sensitivity. In addition, foods made from these grains like bread, pastas, muffins, waffles, cereals, English muffins and wraps will also not be tolerated.
However, there are grains that are naturally gluten-free and can be enjoyed worry free. Many of them are also 100% whole grain and offer more protein and fiber. Try: quinoa, brown rice, millet, amaranth, gluten-free oats, corn, teff, nut flours and buckwheat.If you're choosing to have one of these grains or a food made from them, make sure to measure out an appropriate portion size. Go for 1/2 cup or 1 oz per serving.Only include two to three servings daily as most of your diet and nutrients should come from protein, dairy, fruits and vegetables.

, Whenever you're trying to lose weight, you'll need to monitor how much you're snacking and when you're snacking. Be careful with snack choices and portions to make sure you continue to lose weight.


Snacks can be a great addition to a weight loss plan or diet. They can give you a needed boost of energy, an extra shot of nutrition or carry you over until your next planned meal.However, snacks that are high in calorie, fat and sugar are not the best choices. Stick to snacks that are 150 calories or less so that you can still stay within your calorie goal.Great ideas for nutritious gluten-free snacks include: a hard boiled egg, plain yogurt with fruit, dried fruit and nuts, or hummus and cut up vegetables.Only snack if you need to. For example, have a snack between two meals that are more than four to five hours apart or have a small bite to eat before a long workout. Try to avoid snacking out of boredom or stress.

, One area that can cause weight gain and unwanted extra calories are the processed gluten-free foods that are available. Although they make a gluten-free diet easier to follow, they can easily backfire.Gluten (from grains like wheat) provides body, elasticity and stability to foods like breads, pastas or cereals. Without it, food manufacturers need to put in additives to help maintain the texture and taste of these gluten-free foods.As great as these foods may be, the result is that they are typically higher in calories, fat and other additives.
Typical processed gluten-free foods that may be higher in calories are: bread, crackers, chips, cookies, muffins, granola or pizza.
Always read the nutrition fact panel on your gluten-free items. Make sure you note the serving size you intend on eating and how many calories that is. Double check to see if this fits into your diet plan.

, Not being able to eat typical gluten-containing foods and also limiting your intake of processed gluten-free substitutes can be difficult.


Breads, pastas, waffles, cereals, wraps, crackers or sweets are a regular part of most people's diet. Having to avoid them might be difficult and not something you want to do.
Cooking from home and making things from scratch can help you include some of your favorite foods while sticking to a lower calorie diet and managing your celiac disease or gluten sensitivity.
Many stores sell gluten-free baking mix. You don't have to worry about mixing certain flours or purchasing uncommon or expensive items.
Many gluten-free baking mixes are ""all purpose"" and very versatile for a variety of recipes. You can make bread, pancakes or waffles or even pizza crust.Also, when you cook at home, you'll know exactly what goes into your foods and can limit the added sugars, fat and total calories.

, If you want to avoid those highly processed gluten-free foods, but also aren't up for baking up substitutes yourself, there are other tricks to help you out.


Swap out your bread or wraps for lettuce wraps. Obviously lettuce is naturally gluten-free, but low in calories and is a great vehicle for deli meat, tuna salad or hummus and veggies.
Instead of pasta, try using a spiralizer. This kitchen tool turns vegetables into pasta. Top with your favorite tomato sauce and gluten-free meatballs.
If you're worried about contaminated oats for your morning bowl of oatmeal, try using cooked quinoa instead. Warmed with extra milk and your favorite fruit, this is a great substitute.

, With any type of dieting plan, it's important to support your weight loss diet with physical activity.


Include regular amounts of aerobic activity over the course of the week. Aim for about 150 minutes of cardio every week.Go for activities you enjoy when you're exercising. Try: walking, jogging, hiking, dancing, swimming or using the cardio machines at your local gym.
In addition to cardio activities, get in one to two days of strength training as well. This can support long-term weight maintenance.Make sure to do strength training for about 20 minutes and include an exercise to work every major muscle group.

, Another factor that can contribute to weight gain or difficulty losing weight is stress.Both celiac disease and gluten sensitivities can be stressful to have and to manage.


Although some people lose weight when they experience stress, many people notice weight gain and difficulty losing weight. This is due to higher levels of certain hormones in your body and the craving or desire to overeat, snack and consume those typical higher calorie ""comfort foods.""Manage chronic stress as best you can. If you're feeling stressed by your health condition, there are support groups and forums where you can find support from other patients. In addition, ask your doctor or registered dietitian for additional support.
Outside of that, there are other activities that can help calm you down. Try: meditating, journaling, going for a walk, listening to music or talking to a friend or family member.

, Hitting the sack and getting enough rest every night is essential for weight loss; however, it's also important for healing, which is something you may need if you're recovering from a flare up from celiac disease or gluten sensitivity.


If you're not getting adequate sleep each night, you may find it more difficult to lose weight. Studies show that if you get less than seven hours of sleep nightly, you're more likely to be overweight.You have increased amounts of the ""hunger hormone"" when you do not sleep enough. You feel more hungry during the day which can cause you to overeat.
Aim for at least seven to nine hours of restful sleep each night.Try going to bed earlier or waking up later if you can.

Introduce your baby to the office staff at the doctor’s office.,
Arrive at the doctor’s office close to the scheduled appointment time.,
Stick with the same doctor, if possible.,
Go to the doctor as a family.",How to Make Vaccinations Easier for Your Baby1,"


Babies as young as 6 months old can recognize a familiar face over time. If your baby feels like he/she knows everyone in the doctor’s office, it will be a less scary place for him/her.
Get to know the nurses and the front desk staff so that when you take your baby to the doctor’s office, most of the people will know his/her name and can greet him/her accordingly. This will ease a lot of your baby’s tension because he/she will feel like everyone at the office is a friend and not a stranger to be scared of.;
, If you arrive too early for your baby’s appointment, you may be waiting for a while. Waiting for anything increases anxiety because it gives your older baby more time to think about what is about to occur. Your baby may become more and more anxious about his/her appointment and vaccination if you arrive too early and have to sit in the waiting room for a long time. Small babies may get overstimulated if they wait too long, leading to crankiness and tiredness.

, Don’t change doctors too often. If your baby sees the same doctor from the time he/she is born, he/she will develop a relationship with that doctor. This one step can do wonders for decreasing fear and anxiety in babies regarding vaccines and any other medical procedure. The doctor will not only know your baby well, but your baby will know the doctor well. This will make your baby feel more comfortable because the doctor will not be a stranger.

, It can be a lot easier to get a vaccination if you take your baby to the doctor with your spouse present. This way, one of you can distract your baby while the other one can focus on keeping your baby in place while holding his/her arm steady for the shot. Although some babies may not respond well to this technique, many times it can help make your baby feel a lot calmer and more comfortable.

"
"
Give your baby a distraction from the shot.,
Give your baby something sweet to eat before the vaccination.,
Numb the area where the shot will be dispensed.,
Make sure that you remain calm and cool before and during the procedure.,
Finished.

",How to Make Vaccinations Easier for Your Baby2," This is the easiest and most often used as a way to make vaccinations easier for your baby. A distraction can even make the pain non-existent for some babies, because before the baby even realizes what is going on, the shot will have already been administered. You can give your baby a new toy to play with or sing a song to him/her. You can also try telling your baby a funny story or reading him/her a book.


Another good distraction for your baby may be cartoons. If your doctor has a TV in the examination room, tune it in to some cartoons. Your baby may become engulfed in the show and may forget why he/she is even there. If your doctor doesn’t have a TV in the examination room, ask your doctor if it is okay for you to bring your own. You can bring in a portable DVD player with your baby’s favorite show or movie.

, Studies have shown that if you give your baby something sweet to eat right before the vaccination, it will help to ease the pain. This trick can be used on small babies as well, by simply dipping their pacifier in some sugary water. Older babies and toddlers can suck on a lollipop.

, Try using a skin numbing cream to help reduce the amount of pain your baby will experience. There are a few good creams out there that will help numb the skin and keep the nerves from releasing pain signals to your baby’s brain. Make sure that you apply the cream approximately one hour before the procedure to make sure it has time to work. Check with your doctor about which cream is recommended for your baby.

, Your baby will feed off of your energy and if you are overly stressed then your baby will be stressed also.


It is not necessary to try to explain to your baby that the shot is necessary, because your baby will not understand any of what you are saying in that moment.
If your baby starts protesting the shot, it is important that you stand firm and remain calm. Never become angry with your baby and always speak in a calm, soothing tone.

In addition, items are usually not labelled for shellfish if they contain mollusks such as clams, scallops, or oysters. Therefore, it's always best to read the label.It's important to check all labels. While shellfish isn't often sneaked into foods, it can be in a few things that may surprise you.Foods that have seafood flavoring, for instance, often have shellfish in them.If your allergy is particularly severe, you may even have problems with sea salt.;
, This step can be a bit more difficult, as not all non-food labels are required to list ingredients. However, some non-food items can contain shellfish, which in turn can give you an allergic reaction.For instance, lip gloss can contain shellfish.Pet foods and plant fertilizers can also contain shellfish, which can be important if you're handling it and your allergy is severe. Another item to watch is nutritional supplements., If you have an allergy, particularly a severe one, you should also avoid touching shellfish or even inhaling. In fact, an allergic reaction can even happen just if you breathe in particles from shellfish.If you're cooking for your family, skip cooking shellfish for the rest of the family even if you aren't eating it yourself. Also, try not to be in areas where shellfish are being cooked.Try to avoid the seafood counter at the grocery store, as getting too near could set you off.Not everyone's shellfish allergy is this severe. Pay attention to what you react to and what you don't.

, When you eat out, always make sure to ask what's in your food. It's best to be safe by asking rather than assuming that the food doesn't contain shellfish.Begin by telling the waiter you have an allergy: ""Hi, I have a very severe allergy to shellfish.""
Move on to talking about what you'd like to order: ""I'd like to order the chow mein. Does that have any shellfish in it?""
If the waiter says he doesn't know, see if can ask: ""Would you please check for me? It can't even be in the flavoring. I really appreciate it.""
Also ask about the oil if you order something fried. Sometimes, the same oil that's used to cook, say, your chicken, could have been used to cook shrimp., Unless you have a specific allergy to fish, you shouldn't worry about eating fish.However, if you've never eaten fish before, you should be cautions when trying it or even wait until you can be tested for that allergy, just in case. Fish is genetically different from shellfish, so you or may not be allergic to both., Most of the time, your reaction will begin within a few minutes of eating the first bite of food. However, sometimes, it can show up hours later.One symptom is a tingly tongue after eating shellfish. Other symptoms include wheezing, coughing, throat tightness, hoarseness, and trouble breathing.You also might break out into hives, have itchy, swollen eyes, or have swelling in your throat. Another symptom is stomach problems, such as diarrhea or vomiting. Finally, it can make you feel dizzy or lightheaded., If you have severe allergies, you may have what's called an anaphylaxis reaction, which is just a fancy way of saying an severe allergic reaction that could threaten your life.If you know your allergies are bad, you may need to inject your epinephrine when you first have a symptom.Otherwise, you will need to inject under one of these conditions:


You have symptoms involving your nose, mouth, skin, or stomach, as well as you are having difficulty breathing or you're feeling light-headed and dizzy (low blood pressure).You think you were exposed to shellfish, and you have two of these symptoms: skin problems/swelling lips, stomach issues, low blood pressure (dizziness), or trouble with breathing.You know you were exposed, and you start experience low blood pressure (dizziness, feeling light-headed, weakness)., If you think you need to inject epinephrine, get out your pen. If you don't think you can do it yourself, try to talk someone else through it. Each pen is a little different, so make sure you read your instructions well ahead of needing to use a pen.Basically, though, you twist off the outer holder to reveal the auto-injector. You pull off the first cap, often blue, grey, or orange. On some pens, it's marked ""1."" You may see a red tip. Do NOT put your finger in front of the tip. Pull off the other cap.Place the needle end (the red tip on some pens) of the injector on the outer part of your thigh near the top and in the middle. Make sure it is going into the muscle. You can do it through clothing. Press down until you feel the needle enter you skin. Hold it for 10 seconds, then pull it out. Look at the tip to make sure the needle is extended. If it's not, you need to try again.You will likely see leftover fluid in the pen. That is fine, and as long as the needle extended, you received the proper dose.It can be helpful to show close friends and family how to use your epinephrine injector when you are in a non-emergency situation. That way, they can help should the need arise.

, Though the epinephrine can save your life, it does not solve the problem of the allergic reaction. You still need to go to the emergency room. It is best to call 9-1-1 right away., Shellfish is actually divided into two categories, crustaceans and mollusks. Crustaceans include shrimp, lobster, and crab. Mollusks are clams, scallops, mussels, and oysters.You can be allergic to one group or both. In fact, you may only be allergic to one type of shellfish and not to others, such as shrimp.Allergies to crustacea are usually worse than allergies to mollusks., If you know you have a severe allergy, it's important to see your doctor and discuss your options. If you can, see a person that specializes in allergies, as she can help pinpoint exactly what you're allergic to.You can develop a shellfish allergy at any time in your life. Therefore, if you start to show symptoms, it's best to get checked out.If you start to feel tingly in your mouth after eating shellfish, it's time to talk to your doctor., These pens, which inject epinephrine (adrenaline) into your body, can help you survive when you have a severe allergy attack. Ask your doctor if you need one prescribed to you.Some common brand names are EpiPen and Avui-Q.Epinephrine can save your life in the event you have a severe attack.Check your pen regularly, at least once a month. If you see that the liquid is cloudy or the pen is past its expiration date, get a new one."

Minimize excess moisture in your home.There are many ways to do this.,
Clean regularly.Dust and vacuum regularly.,
Use a dehumidifier.Humidity encourages the growth of mold.,
Filter your air through your air conditioner.,
Ventilate your home.The bathroom tends to get very humid when the hot water is on, which can lead to mold.",How to Live With an Allergy to Mold1," If your home has leaky pipes, get them fixed. Clean up spills and leaks immediately.Empty and wipe out refrigerator drip pans regularly.


If water seeps into your basement during rainstorms or if your home was damaged by a flood, consult a home inspector to help you figure out how to minimize the possibility of mold.
Check your gutters to ensure they are unobstructed, and direct the drainage flow away from your home.
If you notice liquid in the bottom of your trash can, rinse it out and let it dry before putting a new trash bag in it.;
, Invest in a commercial bleach solution to clean your tile floors. Mold can thrive in the grout between tiles, so take care to thoroughly clean between each tile.


Wet paper can quickly attract mold. Discard water-damaged books, newspapers, and documents where mold spores can take root. Get rid of excess books and documents if you doubt you’ll use or read them again.
Clothes and bedding should also be evaluated regularly for mold. Rubber foam and polyurethane foam – common on bedding – tends to develop mold. If you have bedding that incorporates these materials, cover them with plastic or consider replacing them.

, A dehumidifier reduces the level of moisture in the air, which deters mold growth. A drier environment may reduce mold allergy symptoms.


More than 50% will dramatically increase the likelihood of mold growing in your home.
Drain the dehumidifier and clean the condensation coils regularly according to manufacturer directions., A HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) filter in your air conditioner will help catch any mold particles that other filters may allow to enter your home.Mold particles and spores can be filtered away from your ventilation system by using proper filters and changing them regularly.


Do not use a filtering device that involves heat, ions, or ozone to filter the air. Ozone, in excessive quantities, acts as a respiratory irritant and can be harmful to humans. Heated and ionic filtration have been shown to be less effective than HEPA filters within air conditioners., Turn the fan on when taking a shower, make sure the vent is clear, and reduce the amount of steam that collects in your bathroom. The more moisture your shower holds, the greater your chances of mold growing on shower tile, grout, ceilings and floors.


Even propping the door open when you shower or opening a window afterward can help significantly.
Open the windows in other rooms of your house as well. Excessively tight window and door seals could trap moisture and inhibit ventilation.
In dry or mild weather, open the door of your home if you have a screen door. The breeze will keep the air circulating and reduce the chances of mold taking root.

Work in a mold-free occupation.,
Minimize your mold exposure at work.,
Take precautions when outdoors.,
Stay indoors when mold counts are high.Despite how much you may want to be outside, avoid the urge when the weather is foggy or damp.",How to Live With an Allergy to Mold2," Certain lines of work may expose you to higher-than-average amounts of mold. Jobs that deal with lumber, especially, could increase your risk of an allergic reaction. Avoid jobs in carpentry, millwork, furniture repair, and logging. Agricultural work should also be avoided. Working as a dairy hand, farmer, winemaker, or working in a greenhouse might exacerbate your allergies.Bakers could also be at risk.

, Talk to your boss about your allergy and see if you can get the maintenance department to clean out potential mold sites such as overhead ducts. Bring a portable air filtration system to your workplace if possible. If you’re allowed a small plant in your office or at your desk, try English ivy, which could reduce mold counts.Keep a box of tissues handy.
Pack your nasal spray when you go to work, or leave one at your workplace. That way, if you have an allergic reaction, you’ll be prepared to recover quickly.

, Wear a mask when gardening, working with compost, mowing your yard, raking leaves, hiking in the woods, going fishing, or enjoying outdoor activities in damp or shady environments.Wearing a mask will prevent you from inhaling mold spores that could trigger an allergic reaction.

, Spending time outside immediately following a rainstorm can trigger your mold allergy. Additionally, pay attention to the weather forecast and published mold counts. When the mold count is high, refrain from outdoor activities.


Use the Weather Channel's map at https://weather.com/maps/health/allergies/moldspores to monitor mold levels in your area.

"
Use a log to track your symptoms and outbreaks.When you have an allergic reaction, record it in a logbook.,
Use nasal corticosteroids.,
Use antihistamines.Antihistamines, as their name implies, work by blocking histamine, a chemical released during an allergic reaction that causes inflammation.,
Use a decongestant.,
Use montelukast.,
Try a nasal wash.If you exhibit adverse reactions to your medication, your doctor might suggest a more mild treatment like a nasal wash (also known as nasal lavage).,
Follow up with your doctor.",How to Live With an Allergy to Mold3," Include relevant information like where you were, what you were doing, the data and time of the incident, and what you were eating. Communicate this information to your physician when seeking treatment for your mold allergy. He or she will then be able to develop a treatment plan to help you better live with your mold allergy.

, Corticosteroids are nasal sprays that can prevent and treat inflammation associated with a mold allergy. These medicines are the most effective method of combatting mold allergies, but can only be prescribed by a doctor.


Each nasal spray is slightly different. However, general guidelines recommend removing the cap and gripping the pump bottle in one hand with your thumb on the bottom. Place your index finger on one of the pump bottle’s fins, and your middle finger on the other of the pump bottle’s fins.
Tilt your head forward slightly and insert in the open end of the pump bottle into your nose. With your free hand, squeeze your opposite nostril closed. Breathe out, then breathe in while pumping the spray bottle by pushing the fins down and breathe in.Repeat once in your other nostril.
Schedule an appointment with your physician and talk to them about getting a nasal spray to treat your allergy.

, These medicines are good if you suffer from an itchy, sneezy, or runny nose in the presence of mold. You can get antihistamines from your doctor or at your local pharmacy.


Over-the-counter antihistamines include loratadine, fexofenadine, and cetirizine. These are available as pills. Directions for use vary with manufacturer. Read your medication’s label for specific use directions.
Prescription antihistamines are generally nasal sprays, and general directions for use are identical to those for nasal corticosteroids. Insert the nasal spray tube into your nostril, close your opposite nostril with your free hand, and squeeze the fins attached to the spray tube down while breathing in. Repeat on your other nostril.

, Decongestants are available over-the-counter in the form of both oral medications or nasal sprays, and are useful for relieving stuffy noses and respiratory tract congestion. Examples of oral decongestants include Sudafed and Drixoral. Afrin is a common decongestant nasal spray. Check the directions for use before using a decongestant.


Decongestants might raise blood pressure or cause insomnia, anxiety, restlessness, headaches, and a loss of appetite. Consult your doctor if you experience these or other side effects.
Do not use decongestant nasal sprays for more than three or four days; they can cause your congestion to rebound with a vengeance.

, Montelukast, known by its brand name Singulair, is a tablet that prevents allergic symptoms. It has proven useful in treating mold, and is a useful alternative if nasal sprays prove too strong for you, or if you have asthma in addition to your mold allergy.


Montelukast should be taken once around the same time each day.
You can take montelukast with or without food., You can buy a saline kit like Sinus Rinse, or assemble the necessary equipment yourself. You’ll need a bulb syringe, neti pot, or a specially designed nasal squeeze bottle.


Pre-mixed nasal washes are available at your local drug store.
If you wish to make your own saline nasal wash at home, mix one teaspoon baking soda, one cup of warm, distilled water, and three teaspoons of canning or pickling salt.Your salt must be iodine free.
Fill the device of your choice (bulb syringe, neti pot, or nasal squeeze bottle) half full with the saline solution.
Keep your head over a sink or shower, and tilt it to the left. Slowly pour the solution into your right nostril. The water should exit your left nostril.
Repeat on the opposite side. Blow your nose to get rid of excess water and mucus.

, If your conditions are not under control after three to six months of treatment, or if your symptoms become more severe and unmanageable, you should ask your doctor for alternative treatment options. Your physician might recommend that you consult a mold allergy specialist. The specialist will be able to better assist you in treating your allergy symptoms.


Use the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology’s physician database at http://allergist.aaaai.org/find/ to locate a specialist near you.
Other conditions can be caused by a mold allergy and these conditions need to be evaluated by an allergist, such as allergic asthma, allergic rhinitis, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and allergic fungal rhinosinusitis. The treatments for these conditions vary due to the degree and severity of the condition.

Book the appointment.,
Pick the appointment time.,
Prepare for the appointment.,
Know what to expect when the optometrist tests your child's vision.,
Understand that your child may or may not get glasses.,
Know what to do after the appointment.",How to Prepare for Your Child's First Eye Appointment,"

While some pediatricians will do a basic eye exam, it is important to book your child in with an optometrist around 6 months of age.At this age, your child will be experiencing sharper vision, increasingly precise colour vision, and improving eye movement.
If your child is suffering from any vision issues, it is important to catch them early for the best outcome possible.;
,

While the time of the appointment may seem of little importance to you, it is important to choose a time where you think your baby will be the most alert. As with the rest of their bodies, their eyes will get fatigued too, and this can affect the results of their vision test.
Pick a time that fits with your routine, usually in the morning or after naptime. While babies’ mood and behaviour can be hard to predict, ensuring your child is well rested will make the process easier for all involved.

,

As well as getting your usual bag and daily needs to be organised before you go, it is also important to recall your family medical history and your child’s medical history.
Make a mental list or write a list to take with you. Information on both parents’ family history should include details about vision problems such as lazy eyes, near or far sightedness, and any eye diseases such as glaucoma.
In terms of your child’s medical history, be sure to tell the optometrist if your child experiences or has experienced any of the following: Premature at birth, late motor development, excessive eye rubbing, frequent blinking, little to no eye contact, issues maintaining gaze on objects, low eye tracking skills

,

The optometrist will run a few tests to see if your child’s eyesight is developing properly.
As babies are too young to use the eye chart adults and older children are tested with, the doctor will use a variety of other tests such as:

Pupil Response Tests: Evaluate whether the eyes’ pupils open and close properly
Fix and Follow: Determines if your baby is able to fixate and follow an object (such as light) as it moves
Preferential Site: Uses cards that will attract your child’s gaze



,

If your child does require glasses, do not stress.
There are many options available for young children.
Your optometrist will work with you and your child to find a pair that is suitable for their level of activity and prescription.

,

After the first appointment, the optometrist may want to schedule a follow-up appointment, particularly if your child requires glasses.
If not, remember to get your child’s eyes re-examined before they start school to ensure they have not developed any issues that will hinder their learning.

Research the foods and drugs that contain sulfites.,
Check the product packaging.,
Avoid any processed foods, wines or beers.,
Ask about your food.,
Prepare your own food.",How to Live With an Allergy to Sulfites1," If you are diagnosed with a sulfite allergy, you will want to familiarize yourself with the long list of items that may contain sulfites. Talk to your doctor about your medications to ensure that you are not taking anything that contains sulfites. You should also determine what foods and drinks are safe for you to ingest. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration created a detailed list of common products that contain sulfites.Although you will not memorize them at first, you eventually begin to recognize what foods to avoid.
Consider printing off the list of the foods containing sulfites and carry it with you. This will help you avoid them while you are out.
You can find a copy of the FDA’s list at http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/fy731
;
, Check the nutritional label on and any food before buying or eating it. In the United States, the FDA requires products containing a certain amount of sulfites (more than 10 parts-per-million) be labeled appropriately. Be sure to check the label while you are buying groceries, that way you avoid wasting money on a product that may be unhealthy.Although some foods have naturally occurring sulfites, there have been no recorded instances of people having allergic reactions to them.In the United States, check nutritional labels for sulfur dioxide, potassium bisulfite, potassium metabisulfite, sodium bisulfite, sodium metabisulfite, and sodium sulfite., As a rule of thumb, avoid most canned or processed foods, which contain high levels of sulfites. Any pickled or preserved items will have high sulfite levels, as will most processed baked goods. Wine and beer should also be avoided since sulfites are often used to control fermentation., When you eat out, be sure to inquire about how your food is prepared. Although the FDA banned sulfites from fresh fruits and vegetables in restaurants, unlabeled products are still used. Ask the waiter or manager to check the packaging that your food came in to see if it contains sulfites.At a restaurant, avoid any potato product that has had its peel removed. It likely has high levels of sulfite. When dining out, you should only eat baked potatoes that still have their skin. , The easiest way to avoid sulfites is to buy and cook your own food. Purchase foods that are low in or have no sulfites and then prepare them at home. This will ensure that your food is not getting cross-contaminated with items containing sulfites. For those with severe allergies, this may be the only way to avoid coming into contact with sulfites.The FDA prohibits the addition of sulfites to fresh fruits and vegetables. The FDA also prohibits the addition of sulfites to red meat.Consider growing some of your own produce to eat from a home garden.

Observe skin irritation.,
Recognize digestive problems.,
Manage respiratory issues.,
Treat anaphylactic shock.",How to Live With an Allergy to Sulfites2," The earliest sign that you have come in contact with sulfites will likely be itchy skin, a rash or hives. If you notice a red blotchy area on your skin, you are likely experiencing a mild reaction or the beginning of a more severe one. If you know that you have a sulfite allergy, seek immediate medical attention in case the reaction worsens.It may help to take antihistamine medicine for the itch; however, you should seek medical attention if you have a known sulfite allergy.
Most allergic reactions to sulfites occur within 15 – 30 minutes following oral exposure., You may also develop a number of stomach issues, such as cramps, diarrhea, and vomiting. If you have a known sulfite allergy and believe you are experiencing an allergic reaction, seek immediate medical attention. It is important that you get help in case the reaction worsens.If left untreated, diarrhea and vomiting can cause serious problems like dehydration. In general, seek medical help if you experience sustained and intense stomach problems.

, In more severe cases, a sulfite allergy can cause major respiratory issues, such as wheezing, cough, difficulty breathing, and tightness in the chest. In fact, respiratory issues are the most common symptom of a sulfite reaction. Asthmatics, in particular, are susceptible to having a severe respiratory reaction. It is therefore recommended that asthmatics try to avoid foods high in sulfites and always carry their inhalers., In some extremely rare and severe cases, asthmatics suffering from sulfite allergies experienced anaphylaxis. If this occurs, you will not be able to breathe and your blood pressure will drop dramatically. If you are experiencing anaphylactic shock, use an epinephrine pen to inject yourself with adrenaline. This will quickly relax your constricted airway and raise your blood pressure.If you experience anaphylaxis, you should seek immediate medical attention.
The epinephrine pen will help you stay stabilized long enough to get to a hospital and receive treatment.

"
Visit your doctor.,
Have an emergency medical plan.,
Always carry your medications with you.,
Be proactive.",How to Live With an Allergy to Sulfites3," If you believe that you suffer from a sulfite allergy, the first thing you should do is check in with your medical care provider. In order to properly diagnose the allergy, you doctor may suggest a “challenge” test in which you ingest small amounts of sulfite. Your doctor or allergist will then monitor your vital signs and look for a drop in lung function, which signals a sulfite allergy. This test can be dangerous and should only be performed under the guidance of medical professionals.You may also want to keep a food diary and document the meals you believe caused an allergic reaction. This will help the doctor give you a diagnosis.

, Once you receive your diagnosis, it is important to create a medical plan in case you experience a severe allergic reaction. Your friends and family members will need to know how to take care of you in the event of an emergency. Tell them where your medications are and how to find them. Everyone will need to trained and capable of giving you an epinephrine injection if you experience anaphylaxis.Consider wearing a Medic Alert bracelet to let first responders know that you have a sulfite allergy., If you suffer from a sulfite allergy, it is important that you always have your medications on you. You should never leave your home without your inhaler or your epinephrine pen. Consider keeping them in a bag or backpack where you can access them easily. Having these items on you at all times could save your life in the event of a severe reaction.Some inhaled medications used to treat asthma contain sulfites. Make sure that you use an inhaler that is sulfite-free.
You may also want to carry an antihistamine medication along with you in case you develop a rash.

, Because there is no known cure for a sulfite allergy, the best course of action is to be proactive about avoiding them. Learn how to cook foods that are low in sulfites and become familiar with sulfite-free products. Find stores and restaurants that specialize in sulfite-free products. In general, try to look at your allergy as less of a burden and more of a unique lifestyle.If you will be dining at a guests home, be sure to let them know that you have an allergy so that they can plan accordingly.
Sulfite allergies do not decrease with time.

Bathe your child in lukewarm water.,
Place cool, damp washcloths on your child’s forehead and wrists.,
Dress your child in light cotton clothes.",How to Lower a Child's Fever Naturally1," The evaporation of the water will cause your child’s temperature to go down.Don't use cold water. It may seem counterintuitive, but a rush of cold water will cause shivering and will in turn raise their body temperature.;
, These will reduce your child’s core body temperature and will temporarily lower the fever., Heat is lost more easily through the skin when layers of clothing are removed, and cotton is one of the most breathable fabrics;however, if your child starts to shiver, you will want to cover them with a light blanket.

Find comfort in the fact that fevers can help fight off infections.,
Allow the fever to run its course.,
Monitor your child’s temperature consistently.",How to Lower a Child's Fever Naturally2," Fevers are not dangerous in themselves.They are the body’s natural response to an underlying condition. Many germs cannot survive at higher temperatures, so fevers are actually positive (though sometimes misery-inducing) agents.


The height of the fever does not usually correspond with a more serious illness. Higher fevers are often associated with viral infections.

, You don’t necessarily need to actively try to bring down a child’s fever. In fact, recent studies show that riding out a mild fever might be the best way to deal with one: fevers make certain parts of the immune system work harder, which can help your child get over colds faster than with medication.It can be hard to step back and recognize that there’s nothing more you can or should do as caretaker to bring down your child’s fever; however, sometimes just palliating the symptoms is enough and can go a long way to helping your child bravely endure this rough patch.

, Riding out a fever still involves a checkup of the numbers to make sure that the child’s condition does not worsen. (It's most important to know the temperature in a child under two years old.) Many different kinds of thermometers are available, since you can measure a fever a number of different ways. Typically all you need is a digital thermometer,though other options, such as the more expensive temporal artery thermometers or tympanic (ear) thermometers are also available.


Rectal thermometers provide the most accurate readings for infants.These should have a flexible tip and a wide handle.
Wait at least 20 minutes after a bath or after feeding your child to take their temperature. These are factors which could affect the reading."
"
Tend to your child’s needs.,
Encourage your child to rest.,
Encourage your child to drink more fluids.,
Don’t force your child to drink if they resist.",How to Lower a Child's Fever Naturally3," In your role as caretaker, making the child feel as secure as possible during the three to four days that it normally takes for a fever to go away will increase their comfort level.If your child is seeking company while they lay bored in bed, try to stay by their side. If they want to be alone, check in on them occasionally.
The alleviation of symptoms can take many different forms, but if you observe your child’s behavior and looks and monitor their temperature, you can be sure you are providing the best care possible.

, When your child has a fever, they should exert minimal effort. If possible, this means they should refrain from going to school, roughhousing with friends, and playing sports until the fever subsides. This way, the fever has a lower chance of being prolonged or worsened and your child has a higher shot at a much faster recovery.This also means you reduce the chance of your child spreading the infection to others.

, Fevers can cause children to lose larger amounts of water and salt, leading to dehydration.Prevent this complication by encouraging your child to take in more liquids, especially water, electrolyte solutions, or orange juice.


For infants, breastfeed or offer formula more frequently. Don't give water to babies under six months old.

, Instead, you could try giving them a cool treat like watermelon or grapes if they are old enough to safely eat them.


Low-sugar fruit popsicles, frozen yogurt, or sherbet are also appealing ways to increase hydration levels.
In some cases, however, your doctor may recommend giving young children small amounts of fluids via a medicine cup or dropper to avoid dehydration.
Offer older children a cup of diluted yarrow,chamomile,or elderflower tea.Many people recommend these as safe ways of encouraging liquid consumption.

Recognize when to call a doctor.,
Consult with your child’s doctor prior to administering ibuprofen (Advil) or acetaminophen (Tylenol).,
Check with your healthcare provider to see if they offer a free nurse hotline.",How to Lower a Child's Fever Naturally4," These could be signs of a serious or worsening condition that should be properly assessed by a medical professional. While a fever is a natural response, your child should still be seen by a medical professional if they display symptoms such as:Abdominal pain, back pain, or pain with urination
Lethargy
Excessive fussiness or unusual drowsiness
Severe cough, wheezing, or trouble breathing
Sore throat that is severe or lasts longer than three days
Ear pain
Stiff neck or severe headaches
Vomiting
Diarrhea that is frequent, has blood, or lasts more than a few days
Seizure

, The child could only have a mild fever in terms of temperature, but if they are acting lethargic or aren't as responsive, this calls for a visit to the doctor for closer examination., If you suspect your child is dehydrated, call the pediatrician right away. Moderate to severe dehydration can have significant consequences, so be on the lookout for:Excessive sleepiness, fussiness, or tiredness
Dry/sticky mouth
Thirst
Decreased urination
Dry skin
Sunken fontanelle (soft spot) in babies
In infants, no wet diapers for three hours

, A weakened immune system in conjunction with a fever can lead to additional complications. In this case, the treatment plan may differ and will likely be tailored to your child’s individual needs.Check with your child’s doctor prior to giving your child any new medications.

, While fevers will often run a smooth course, there are certainly times when it is best to contact a doctor:


Call your child’s doctor right away if a child less than two years old has a fever lasting more than one day or if a child age two or older has a fever lasting more than three days. They may encourage you to come in for an exam.
Call the pediatrician immediately if your child's temperature is too high. Specifically, see a doctor right away if you measure a rectal temperature of 100.4°F (38.0°C) or above in a child younger than three months old or if the fever rises above 104°F (40°C) for a child of any age., These medications can have side effects and their administration should be based on the child’s age, weight, and overall health.Your doctor should provide information on giving these medications at your child's routine check-ups. In that case, you can follow the instructions.

, Nursing hotlines can be extremely helpful if you are seeking advice on a particular medical concern. If so, carry this number with you and call if you have a question about your child’s health or about how to best care for their fever."

Recognize that it may be harder to find a doctor who is willing to treat your child.,
Realize that later-life catch-up is not always an option.",How to Opt out of Vaccines for Your Child," The first step in this process is to learn what your child will be missing out on if you decide not to have them vaccinated. All 50 U.S. states have mandatory child vaccination laws that were put in place to protect American citizens from deadly infectious diseases like measles and whooping cough.Inform yourself about the diseases mandatory vaccines protect against and any medically established complication risks.


Do not trust information that has no basis on facts. There are a lot of people on the internet spreading a lot of misinformation that has no medical or scientific validity. Avoid blogs, editorials, and opinion pieces when researching vaccines and stick to objective, peer-reviewed scientific studies published in reputable journals or by trusted sources like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
When learning about vaccine side-effects, pay attention to statistics. Many vaccines carry a very low risk of developing any side effects at all. Potentially adverse effects at the severe end of the spectrum are usually associated with allergies or specific medical conditions and pose zero risk to most children.Know that there is no legitimate link between vaccines and autism. In spite of recent hype surrounding the claim that vaccines cause children to develop autism, such a connection has never been medically established,and autism is better than risking death.This being the case, autism should not factor into your evaluation of child immunization pros and cons.;
, Once you know what your state's mandatory vaccines are designed to do and the likelihood and severity of potential complications, you can evaluate the benefits and drawbacks of vaccinating your child. Be sure to consider issues relevant to both your child and your community as a whole.


Make a list for each vaccine in question. While you might not easily arrive at a decision based strictly on the number of benefits versus drawbacks of a having your child vaccinated, this is a good place to start.
Take into consideration the weight of the various factors on your list. For some perspective, it may help to look up and write down the symptoms and pre-vaccine fatality rates of the diseases the vaccines are designed to protect against.
Recognize that a healthy lifestyle will not stop your child from getting vaccine-preventable diseases.Vegetables can't stop measles from making a child turn deaf.

, Many parents who choose not to vaccinate their children justify their decision based on the idea that their kids are unlikely to contract a disease or spread it if they are surrounded by others who are vaccinated -- a notion referred to as ""herd immunity.""Consider the ethical implications of depending on the immunizations of others to protect your child (and others' children) before buying into this idea.


Recognize that you are jeopardizing other people's children too. Some people, such as cancer patients,immunocompromised children,and babies not vaccinated yet, depend on herd immunity for their safety.Parents will do their best to keep immunocompromised children away from your unvaccinated child, but it is still possible for your child to infect and unwittingly disable or kill them.It is important to realize that by not vaccinating your child, you may be accidentally promoting the outbreak of devastating diseases in your own community. Herd immunity is only effective if 95 to 99% of the population is vaccinated;due to opt-outs, some places in the U.S. now have vaccination rates as low as fifty percent.Even if you decide that the weak communal protection afforded by herd immunity is reason enough to opt out of vaccinations, know that your child will always be susceptible to preventable diseases if they remain unvaccinated. This will mean, for example, that for the rest of their life, they will not be safe to travel to places where vaccines are less commonly used.

, If you are having a hard time making sense of all the information out there on child immunization, speak to a physician about the realities of opting out of vaccines. If you still decide to opt out, tell your family practitioner or pediatrician about your decision and ask her to assist you with the exemption paperwork, which in some states requires the signature of a medical doctor.Make sure your doctor is aware of the current research and scientific consensus regarding vaccines and associated risks. Even physicians can be misinformed! Get a second opinion if you feel it is necessary.
In order to get unbiased information from your doctor, keep any personal opinions about this issue to yourself during your first conversation. Your doctor may be more likely to relay just the facts if you simply tell her you'd like to learn the details of vaccination pros and cons.

, Every U.S. state has different laws regarding mandatory vaccinations and the channels available (if any) to qualify your child for exemption. Research your state's laws and determine a course of action for legally opting out (as discussed in the next several steps of this guide). This information can be found online on various websites dedicated to vaccine legislation.Regardless of the method you choose for pursuing vaccine exemption, you will need to complete paperwork that states your objection to state mandated vaccination. This might consist of anything from a simple form filled out by the parent to an application that must be signed by a physician and submitted to the state for approval.In some states, your child must have an established, doctor-verified medical reason for opting out of vaccinations. If you do not want your child to be vaccinated but they do not qualify for medical exemption, they will not be allowed to attend public school.

, Most states in the U.S. allow vaccine exemptions on the basis of religious objections, although some (like California) have recently taken away this option after witnessing large outbreaks of preventable diseases. If your faith prohibits your child from receiving medical care, you can pursue a religious exemption from state-mandated immunization.Depending on your state's laws, this type of exemption may require a clergy member or other religious official to verify that you are a member of a church that subscribes to an anti-medicine ideology.
It is unethical and irresponsible to claim religious exemption if this does not apply to you. If you are opposed to child immunization for nonreligious reasons, seek a philosophical exemption instead (discussed in a later step).

, If your child has a medical condition or allergy that would cause a serious adverse reaction to certain vaccines, your state likely allows exemption from the vaccine in question. You will need to submit verification of your child's condition from a qualified physician. Ask your doctor how to proceed with this process, as it varies by state.Medical exemptions are extremely difficult to obtain because the list of conditions that legally justify skipping out on your child's immunization is very short. If you have concerns about possible health effects from vaccines, your objection is philosophical, not medical.
Some states allow healthcare workers other than M.D.s (Doctors of Medicine) and D.O.s (Doctors of Osteopathic Medicine) to submit medical exemption forms, but this is not common.

, This type of exemption has only recently been allowed in some U.S. states and is by far the most controversial. If you opt out of immunization for your child on a philosophical basis, you are saying that you have no medical or religious reason for doing so. Only 17 states allow this type of vaccination, and some carry additional requirements such as a physician's signature or completion of a vaccine education course.Different states use different terminology to refer to this type of exemption. Alternative terms include ""conscientious"" and ""personal belief"" exemption.
This type of exemption requires that the parents (and in some cases the child) officially agree to opt out of all mandated vaccines. Currently, no state allows philosophical exemption from only one or some mandated vaccines.
It is critical that you understand the seriousness of deciding to opt out of vaccines on philosophical grounds. It is a very good idea to discuss the matter with a physician, even if your state does not require a doctor's signature to seek this exemption. Additional information about this can be found on the CDC website., This type of exemption from vaccination is only allowed in some states and only applies in situations where the child has already been vaccinated against a specific disease or has naturally contracted and recovered from that disease. In either case, a blood test report verifying the presence of disease antibodies in the child is required. See your family doctor to pursue this type of exemption.


Proof of immunity exemptions only apply to the specific disease in question and cannot be used to gain exemption from any other vaccines.
Blood testing services can be found in most family medicine clinics and usually carry a fee. Ask your doctor about whether her clinic offers these services.

, One of the social consequences of not having your child immunized against preventable diseases is that they will not be allowed to attend public school. Many private schools also will not accept unvaccinated students, so your best option may be to home school your child.


Carefully consider your finances and amount of free time. Be aware that your income and budget may not be stable (layoffs, hospitalizations, etc.), so you will need a good ""cushion"" of extra money.
Many colleges require proof of certain vaccinations as a condition of enrollment. If your child remains unvaccinated, they might not be allowed to attend the college of their choice.
If your child participates in home school group activities or trips with other unvaccinated children, they may be at higher risk for contracting the diseases they were not vaccinated against. All it takes is one infected child to easily spread these communicable illnesses to the entire group., Some anti-vaccination parents believe that a good alternative to vaccination is to let their child contract certain diseases ""naturally"" so they can gain immunity that way instead of through vaccination. This is never a safe option and should be avoided entirely, as many of these diseases are extremely deadly.


Most of the diseases prevented by childhood immunizations are (fortunately) rare in the U.S. If you do become aware of or come into contact with someone with a disease against which your child has no immunity, keep yourself and your child away from the infected individual however possible.
It is important to recognize that the reason vaccines were developed in the first place and are still mandated by all 50 U.S. states is that the diseases against which they protect us are highly contagious and were once responsible for the suffering and death of countless people.Ask yourself whether this is something you want your child to experience.

, Many countries outside the U.S. and Western Europe have significantly higher contagious disease infection rates and much lower proportions of immunized citizens. Traveling to these places with your unvaccinated child greatly increases his chances of becoming dangerously ill while abroad and bringing the infection back home to spread to others.


If you are considering a trip abroad with your unvaccinated child, find out whether any of his susceptibilities are cause for concern in your destination country. Be aware that many places in the world recommend or require additional immunizations for foreign visitors. For example, many African countries recommend obtaining a malaria vaccine before visiting.
Consider whether this is a sacrifice you are willing to make in order to have an unvaccinated child. Will your family miss out on any experiences as a result of this decision? How much risk are you willing to accept for your child?
Think about the influence your decisions now will have on your child when they are an adult. What opportunities will they be denied as an unvaccinated adult? How might their feelings about vaccination differ from yours when they get older?

, Many vaccine-preventable diseases may lead to disability or death. If you know the signs, you can recognize them in your child and take them to the hospital early on, making them more likely to survive.


Read about the symptoms of measles, mumps, rubella, and meningitis.

, Around one half of doctors refuse to see children who are not up to date on their vaccinations, because if your child is infected with a deadly disease, they may spread it to other patients in the practice.Elderly patients, infants that have not been vaccinated yet, and immunocompromised patients would all be at risk around your child.

, While many childhood vaccines may still be received later in life for somewhat lesser protection from certain diseases, others are unsafe for adults beyond a certain age. Find out what the maximum age is for 'catching up' on the various childhood vaccines.If your child is old enough to understand, explain to them that you made the decision not to have them immunized but that they have certain options for catching up on some vaccines later on if they choose to.
Speak to a physician about the increased risks associated with off-schedule immunizations.
Understand that child immunization schedules are designed to provide maximum benefits and minimum risks from vaccination. Delaying important vaccines while you decide whether or not they are acceptable to you could put your child at unnecessary risk of developing complications later in life.

See your doctor if your child has a febrile seizure.",How to Monitor a Child's Fever," Because of the risk of mercury poisoning if the thermometer breaks, the Canadian Pediatric Society and American Academy of Pediatrics recommend using digital thermometers rather than old-fashioned mercury thermometers to ensure safety.Mercury thermometers must be held as long as 3 minutes to get a reading, whereas digital readings come within seconds. For both safety and convenience, a digital thermometer is a better choice.
The AAP also recommends using a plastic rather than a glass thermometer to avoid the possibility of breakage and injury.;
, Ask your doctor which method is right for you and your child. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends measuring temperatures rectally using a digital thermometer in children from newborns to 3 years old to get the most accurate reading.Apply a small amount of petroleum jelly to the anus and insert the thermometer 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) into the anus.If you use a digital thermometer for rectal temperature measuring, do not use the same thermometer to take oral readings. Label the thermometer to keep it separate., A temporal thermometer, or forehead scanner, uses infrared to measure how hot the temporal artery in the forehead is.These thermometers can be more expensive, however, so you may wish to use a regular oral or tympanic (in-ear) thermometer.


Temporal thermometers can be used in children 3 months and older., Being sick can be scary and children always want to be held. Cuddling your child on your lap will allow you to take his temperature more easily because he will be more calm and cooperative.Breastfeeding or telling stories will calm and distract the younger child. Older children can sit with their arm around you and snuggle in.

, Oral digital thermometers provide reliably accurate (close to rectal), easily taken temperatures without causing the child too much distress.For children younger than 3, consider taking your child's temperature rectally instead.Underarm, or axillary, temperatures may be up to 2 degrees lower than rectal temperatures. This is not as reliable a method as taking a temperature orally or rectally.Oral thermometer probes are to be placed under the tongue - not bitten and not clamped down with teeth - and held in place until the probe beeps or 2-3 minutes have passed.

, Tympanic digital thermometers are also convenient and reliable for taking a child’s temperature. They work by measuring the heat of the ear canal and tympanic membrane inside the ear.Pull the ear slightly down and back to allow the ear canal to open for a better reading. Insert the probe a few millimeters into the ear and pause. The tympanic reading is quick, beeps when ready, and is usually only slightly less accurate than rectal.A child with an ear infection will have a raised temperature in that ear so the thermometer should be used in the opposite ear if possible.If the ear infection is in both ears, use a different method to check your child's temperature.

, Every 4 hours, get a new temperature rating. Record these values so you can monitor rise and fall.


A normal temperature is up to 37.2C or 99F. Low grade fevers are up to 38.3C or 100.9F and the most common fever range is 38.4C (101F) to 39.7C (103.5).High grade fevers are over 39.8C (103.6F) and should be attended to by medical professionals when they do not come down with medication, or if your child seems very ill with a high fever.

, Your temperature is lowest in the morning after a night of rest and highest before bed after a day of activity and normal work of the body. Do not be alarmed if your child’s temperature rises by a degree between these two times (when still less than 39.8C or 103.6F)., A fever can quickly dehydrate children due to the sweating and increased bodywork to fight infection. Keep their bodies at full fever-fighting capacity by having them drink a lot of fluids., Watch for chills, sweating, flushing of the cheeks, and shivering. These are all normal responses as your child’s body tries to fight off infectious invaders.Your child may also complain of muscle and joint pain, which are also normal responses as the body fights off illness.

, External cooling techniques such as a lukewarm bath and sleeping with fewer blankets are good ways of keeping your child comfortable during the flushing and sweating responses to the fever. A sponge bath with lukewarm water can make your child more comfortable.Do not make the child so cold as to shiver, as this will actually increase the body’s temperature as a default.Cooling techniques encourage heat loss but do nothing to regulate the child’s internal temperature and thus are better used as comfort measures.
You can use a fan in the room to improve air circulation, but don't position it so that it's blowing directly on your child., Your child may want to sleep a lot, which is a healthy response allowing the body to rest and focus on fighting the cause of the fever. Unusual grogginess and difficulty waking your child from slumber, as well as confusion, are cause for alarm and your child should be taken to medical attention at once., Fevers under 39.5C (103F) are generally not harmful in themselves. In many cases, fever is a good thing, as it is the body’s way of raising the temperature of the environment to be toxic to pathogens, bacteria, and viruses.Fever usually does not cause harm, is self-limiting, and medication is usually not needed. Fever usually lasts no more than a few days.
Infants under the age of 12 weeks with a fever of 38C (100.4F) or greater should go directly to emergency.The main reason to treat a fever is to make your child more comfortable. But, if the fever is high (39.8C/103.6F or higher), you should consider treating it and seeking medical attention.

, Antipyretic (anti-fever) medications work on regulating the hypothalamus, the temperature centre in the brain. Both acetaminophen (Tylenol) and ibuprofen (e.g., Motrin, Advil) work well and should reduce the fever within 1.5 to 2 hours.If your feverish child is younger than 2, consult with your pediatrician before giving any medication.Do not give children aspirin (ASA, acetylsalicylic acid). Children who take aspirin can fall ill with Reye syndrome, a life-threatening illness that causes swelling of the brain and other issues.Always be sure to give the correct dosage to a child. Children do not take the same amount as adults. Dosages are based on age and weight so read the bottle carefully to determine the right dose for your child based on the bottle guidelines. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are uncertain how much to give.There is no evidence that alternating medications reduces fever any quicker; rather, it can lead to dosage errors. This practice is not recommended in children.Do not give ibuprofen to children younger than 6 months. If your child is vomiting or dehydrated, do not use ibuprofen., Take your child to a doctor if he has a high fever (over 40C or 104F) that does not come down to 38.3C (101F) to 38.9C (102F) with medication. Also take your child to the doctor if the fever lasts over 24 hours (for children younger than 2) or 3 days (for children 2 and over) or if the child becomes dehydrated.Take your child to emergency immediately if he becomes severely lethargic (drowsy), unresponsive, has trouble breathing, has a stiff neck, has a sudden rash, or becomes violently ill.

, A febrile seizure is a seizure caused by a sudden high temperature and looks like stiffening of the body, involuntary jerking movements, eyes rolling back into the head, and loss of consciousness. A febrile seizure may last 2 minutes and looks very scary but is not necessarily harmful.If your child is having a seizure, do not hold him down, try to stop him, or stick anything into his mouth. Remove his glasses and put something soft under his head if you can. Lay him on his side if possible. Let him be and move nearby furniture or sharp objects. Time the seizure and tell your doctor how long it lasted. If the seizure lasts more than 3 minutes, call an ambulance.
Take your child for medical attention, even if he feels sleepy and wants to just rest at home. The doctor will want to ask questions to rule out any causes other than fever.
Febrile seizures are common and do not cause brain damage or epilepsy.

Contact your doctor.,
Look for a lack of energy.,
Pay attention for chest pains.,
Notice an irregular heartbeat.,
Look for irritability in infants.,
Keep an eye open for difficulty feeding in infants.,
Look for other symptoms of a potential heart problem.",How to Monitor Your Child's Heart Health1," If you believe that your child is experiencing an issue with their heart, contact your doctor immediately. It is important that they see a medical professional and receive treatment as soon as possible. The doctor will determine if there is any problem, and if so, they will attempt to find the source of the heart irregularity and prescribe a course of treatment.Irregular heartbeat (or arrhythmia) may be a sign of a number of different heart problems, many of which are benign. However, some may require immediate medical attention.
If your doctor suspects an irregularity, they may recommend an electrocardiogram or other electronic monitoring device.;
, An early sign that your child may be experiencing some heart issues will be a general lack of energy. They will be constantly tired, regardless of how rested and well fed they are. They will also be extremely weak and often lightheaded or dizzy.If they exhibit any of these symptoms, you should monitor your child’s pulse and then call your doctor.

, Get immediate medical attention if your child complains of any chest pains or any heart fluttering. This pain may be accompanied by paleness, sweating, and shortness of breath. If your child complains of chest pains or heart fluttering, do not worry about taking their pulse and go see a doctor right away.In most cases, chest pain in children is not due to a heart problem. However, if the pain is a new or severe symptom, it is still best to have a doctor check it out to rule out anything serious.

, If your child’s heart beats too fast, too slow, or includes a third or fourth sound, you should contact your doctor immediately. This may be a sign of a number of different heart conditions. It is important that your doctor is able to get a diagnosis quickly so they can begin a treatment plan.For infants (0 to 11 months), anything over 160 beats per minute is too high and anything under 100 is too low.For a child (1 to 11), anything over 120 beats per minute is too high and anything under 70 is too low. Talk to your pediatrician if your child always seems to be at the lower or upper limits of a normal heart rate.Be aware that a fever can temporarily increase a child’s heart rate, so a rapid heart rate may be a symptom a cold, flu, or other common childhood illness.
The normal sound of a heartbeat is “lub dub” and sounds like a horses gallop. A third sound would be “lub du bub” in a cadence similar to saying “Kentucky.” A fourth would be “be lup dup” in a cadence similar to saying “Tennessee.”, Because an infant is unable to articulate how their body feels, you need to be able to recognize the symptoms of arrhythmia. The first sign is a general irritability or fussiness. If your baby is particularly fussy and cries a lot, even after you have fed, changed, and burped them, call your pediatrician., Another sign that your infant may be experiencing arrhythmia is difficulty in feeding. If your baby lacks the energy to nurse, either from a bottle or breast, they may have an issue with their heart that needs attention. Be sure to talk to your pediatrician about any issues that you may experience with nursing your baby.Fortunately, because of the frequency of checkups that newborns receive, your pediatrician will likely be able to pick up on any heart conditions if they exist or develop.

, These may include general weakness, excessive sweating, and pale or bluish skin. If you notice any of these symptoms, get your child to a doctor immediately."
"
Calm the baby.,
Place them on their back.,
Check their brachial pulse.",How to Monitor Your Child's Heart Health2," If your infant is fussy, try to calm them before measuring their pulse. Because their heart rate increases when they are upset, you will not get an accurate measurement. It is important that you get a resting heart rate in order to get an accurate measurement.

, Begin by placing your infant on their back in their crib or another flat surface that they cannot roll off. You will need both of your hands to measure your child’s pulse, so you cannot be holding them. Because their heart rate increases while in a vertical position, placing an infant on their back also helps you get a more accurate pulse.

, Hold your baby’s arm out to its side and place your pointer and middle fingers in the bend of the arm on the inside of the elbow. Press firmly but gently and count the pulse rate for one minute. Repeat the process and compare your findings.Because it is difficult to get to a baby’s carotid artery, it is recommended that you measure the brachial pulse in their arm.

"
"
Have the child sit or lay down.,
Place two fingers on their carotid artery.,
Count the number of pulses for one minute.",How to Monitor Your Child's Heart Health3," In order to measure your child’s pulse, have them get in a supine position with their upper body slightly elevated. For example, you might have them recline in a recliner or lay in bed with pillows propping up their torso. This will ensure that blood is circulating properly through their body and give you an accurate measurement., Have your child slightly lift their chin so that their neck is exposed. However, they should not raise their head so much that the muscles tense. Then place your pointer and middle finger in the middle of their neck between their larynx and the sternocleidomastoid muscle., Press down slightly until you feel the pulse. If you do not feel the pulse or it is weak, move your fingers until you find it. Once you find it, count the beats for one minute. Repeat the process if you want a second set of results to compare."
"
Make sure they get enough exercise.,
Feed them a healthy diet.,
Avoid smoking.,
Get regular medical checkups.,
Discuss risk factors.,
Learn child or infant CPR.",How to Monitor Your Child's Heart Health4," In order to keep their hearts healthy, you should encourage your children to get at least 60 minutes of physical exercise each day. Limit how much television your children watch and encourage them to go outside and play. You can also encourage your kids to be active by having them do chores or participate in family hikes and other activities.Physical activities can be playing games like basketball or soccer, riding their bikes, or running around with their friends.

, With infants, you should try to maintain breastfeeding for at least 12 months to support optimal hearth growth and development. For older children, make sure that they eat a diet high in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean meats. Avoid foods that are high in saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, salt (sodium), and added sugars. These include things like dairy products, sweets, fatty meats, and most processed foods., You should not smoke around your children. Second hand cigarette smoke can increase your child’s risk for heart disease later in life. As they get older, you should also encourage your children not to smoke. This will ensure their heart health as they move into adulthood and limit their risk for heart disease and peripheral vascular disease., In order catch any heart problems before they become severe, you should take your child for regular health checkups with your doctor. If there are any problems, these checkups will help you spot them early. This will help the doctor better monitor your child’s health and develop appropriate courses of treatment., When you visit your doctor, you should talk with them about any risk factors that may influence your child’s heart health. For example, let your doctor know if anyone in your family has experienced any heart problems. After talking about these risk factors, your doctor will help you outline certain symptoms that you should be on the lookout for.


You might ask the doctor things like “What symptoms should I watch for?” or “Are there any heart problems that I need to be concerned about?”

, If your child has a medical emergency, you may need to perform CPR. You can sign up to take CPR and first aid classes online through organizations like the American Red Cross or the American Heart Association. Being able to perform CPR on your child is particularly important if they have an existing heart condition."

Keep a “must-call” checklist of symptoms.",How to Know When to Call the Doctor If Your Baby or Child Is Sick," No one wants to be the parent who calls the pediatrician over every little sniffle or minuscule fever, only to be told not to worry unless symptoms worsen. If the choice is between risking embarrassment and risking your child’s health, however, it should be a simple one.Most pediatricians and nurses are very understanding about worried parents calling over what turn out to be minor issues. Indeed, if you ever sense anything but understanding when you call with a reasonable concern, you may want to consider your medical care options.
Arm yourself with medically-sound information, and use that and your best judgment to decide when to call. Invest in a book recommended by your pediatrician, and also consult your pediatrician's website, as they usually have good information. The American Academy of Pediatrics also has a lot of good information for parents about sick children.;
, Except in the case of newborns under three months, most doctors now agree that a non-extreme fever alone — without additional symptoms — is not normally a cause for major concern. Fever is, after all, a natural process of the body in fighting off illness and infection.Newborns under three months are a special case. If a newborn has a fever at or above 100.4℉ (38℃), call the doctor or seek medical attention immediately.
For children between three months and three years of age, call the doctor if there is a sustained (more than two days) fever over 102.2℉ (39℃).
For children over three years, call if the fever is above 104℉ (40℃) or if it is accompanied with changes in behavior or activity level, or, if the fever has been present for more than 3 days of any height.

, Parents of young children quickly learn that diarrhea, vomiting, and projectile-sneezing and coughing are among the many common causes for kid clean-ups. Any of these can be signs of illnesses serious enough to warrant a call to the doctor, but more often a “wait and see” approach is appropriate. Use the following list of common illness symptoms as a quick guide.Dehydration: Urination frequency is one of the best ways to determine possible dehydration. Babies and small children should be urinating at least every six hours, and older children should urinate at least three times per 24 hours. Call the doctor if urination frequency is low and you observe dry lips, skin, or mouth; dark yellow urine; weight loss; no tear production; or a sunken look to the skin on the face or soft spot.
Vomiting: Vomiting a few times over the course of a day or two is not on its own a reason for major concern. However, call if vomiting increases or worsens over time, it is accompanied by abdominal pain, there is blood in the vomit or it is green in color, or if there are signs of dehydration.
Diarrhea: Diarrhea can last for several days without being a major cause for concern. Call, however, if there are signs of dehydration, there is blood in the stool, it occurs more than six to eight times per day, if the diarrhea lasts more than seven days, or depending upon the existence of other illness symptoms.
Colds: The common cold can last for 10 to 14 days in children. Call if cold symptoms last for longer than this time frame, are accompanied by earache or breathing trouble, difficulty feeding, or worsen after three to five days.
Congestion: Call if it causes noticeable breathing trouble — for instance, you can see the skin sucking in between the ribs during breaths or if the child is having difficulty feeding due to the congestion. Also call if any accompanying coughing is not only frequent, but nearly nonstop.Ear infections: These can be quite common in children, and your doctor may recommend that your child simply wait out more mild occurrences. Call if the pain is substantial or there is discharge, or as per your doctor’s recommendations. In babies, use tugging at the ears, in combination with congestion, fussiness, and fever, as signs of an ear infection.

, This checklist, provided by Riley Hospital for Children in the state of Indiana, rates common signs of illness by severity and the degree of concern they indicate. “Reassuring” signs indicate a wait-and-see approach, “Worrisome” signs warrant a call to the doctor, and “Serious” signs require immediate medical attention.


Appearance: bright-eyed and alert (Reassuring); sleepy, dull-eyed, expressionless (Worrisome); glassy-eyed, blank stare (Serious).
Crying: normal-sounding (R); whiny, whimpering (W); weak, moaning (S).
Activity level: normal (R); fussy, more sleeping (W); hard to awaken, no interest in play (S).
Appetite: normal (R); takes food but eats/drinks little (W); refuses food/drink (S).
Urination: normal (R); less frequent and/or dark yellow (W); little output, child looks “dry” in face, eyes, etc. (S).

, As mentioned before, when in doubt, call the doctor. Use the information available here and elsewhere to empower you to feel more confident about when you need to act, but always trust your judgment as well.For some wounds and injuries, it will be immediately obvious that a call to the doctor (or more) is necessary. For others, such as with some head injuries, symptoms may not be immediately present. Keep an eye out for emerging or worsening symptoms after any injury, and be ready to call or act as needed.

, Every child gets his of scrapes and cuts, and most of these can be treated at home with soap, water, and a clean bandage. In between these minor bleeding events and major wounds that require immediate medical attention, there are some episodes that do warrant a call to the doctor.For cuts, call the doctor if the wound is too large to be bandaged, if the wound is deep or penetrating, if the bleeding will not stop after fifteen minutes of applying pressure, or if the edges of the wound are ragged and spread apart. Also call for cuts to the face that seem large or deep.
If an existing cut shows signs of infection, such as swelling, discharge, or odor, call immediately.
For nosebleeds, call only if they recur frequently, such as several times per day, or if the bleeding will not stop after applying pressure for at least fifteen minutes (with the head faced down).

, While they have different sources, burns and rashes on the skin should be observed similarly for symptoms.


For burns and rashes, call the doctor if they cover more than a small area of the body, if they blister, ooze, or open up, or if they affect the face or genitals.
Both of these conditions can take time to fully present themselves on the skin, so check frequently for changes, and especially any signs of infection. , Many “boo-boos” are immediately apparent and the decision whether medical attention is needed can be made on the spot. Head injuries in particular, however, often require continued observation for symptoms.Call the doctor for an injury that makes moving any extremity (hands, arms, feet, legs) difficult or painful, if more than a small bump or bruise appears, or if there is a lot of swelling of the area.
With a baby, call for any falls, even if no symptoms of injury appear.
For children, call after a fall if there is a sign of injury, or if you know the child fell but cannot determine how far or what part of the body hit the ground.
After any type of fall or bump to the head, watch for signs of headache, confusion, tiredness, nausea or vomiting, blurred vision, and other possible symptoms of a concussion. If unsure, always err on the side of calling.
If your child has lost consciousness after a head injury, she should be seen right away. If your child vomits more than once or twice, or a headache is getting worse, she should also be seen.

, When you have an injured or sick child who is crying, you don't want to be stuck searching around for the doctor’s phone number. Also, whether you leave your child with a professional babysitter or your Aunt Rose, it is always wise to make important contact information readily available.Prominently display the phone number for your child’s pediatrician, the emergency phone number (such as 911), the poison control center number, and your own number.
Ideally, caregivers for your children will be trained in child CPR and first aid care. Regardless, it is a good idea to keep a small guidebook handy for them.

, For the benefit of yourself and others, you may want to post a list of “must-call” symptoms in your child. When any of them are present, call immediately. Consider the following list:Changes in color (paleness or bluish color around the lips, face, or nails; yellowish skin or eyes)
Body becomes unusually floppy or stiff
One or both eyes are red, swollen, or leaking sticky fluid
Navel is red or tender
Fever with a rash
A bite by a dog, cat, or other animal that draws blood
Difficulty breathing, swallowing, nursing, eating, or speaking
Blood in the stools or vomit
Crying for a long time, child can't be comforted
Refusal to eat
Unusually cranky or tired
Chills that make the body shake or any seizures
Loses consciousness for a period (child faints, has a seizure, etc.)
Severe headache
Nasal fluid is strange color, smells bad, or is bloody
Earache
Hearing loss
Blood or fluid coming out of the mouth or ears
Changes in vision, eyes are hurt by light
Stiffness or pain in the neck

Severe cough, cough that brings up blood, cough that lasts a long time
Very bad stomach pain
Swollen stomach
Pain in the back, pain with urination, frequent urination
Urine that is a strange color, smells bad, or is very dark
Pain, redness, or swelling around a joint, not caused by injury
Cut or scrape that appears infected (red, oozes pus, tender, swollen, hot)

Understand that you should take your child to get evaluated by a doctor, but that there is a chance of misdiagnosis.,
Help prevent misdiagnosis by having your child’s blood pressure checked twice during your visit to the doctor’s office.",How to Know if Your Child Has High Blood Pressure," Your heart and arteries are subjected to pressure 24 hours a day, 365 days each year. Inevitably, there is some wear and tear on both as we age.


However, if BP is too high, this normal wear and tear speeds up. The heart and blood vessels become more likely to undergo damage. Certain other organs also become particularly vulnerable to injury from high blood pressure - most notably the brain and kidneys. Another term for high BP is hypertension.
If BP is too low, on the other hand, the body’s organs do not receive the blood circulation they need to function properly.;
, Minimal exercise and more-than-minimal fast food are the most common cause of high blood pressure in children. The main factors that cause high blood pressure in children are:


The tendency to retain salt (sodium) and water increases the volume of fluid in the body, including within blood vessels. The greater the volume, the greater the pressure. This is why many people with high BP restrict the salt in their diet and take medications to eliminate salt via the kidneys (diuretics).
The activation of several hormones and kidney nerve signals results in the constriction (narrowing) of arteries carrying the blood. The greater the narrowing, the greater the pressure. Over time these people develop stiffer arteries, leading to greater demands on the heart, and greater need for higher pressures to propel the blood through the body.
Obese children are at greater risk. However, not all children with high blood pressure are obese, so don't discount symptoms if your child's weight is average or below average.

, In otherwise healthy children, it is not common for medications to cause high blood pressure, but it can happen.


Concerns often arise when a child taking methylphenidate (Ritalin) or other stimulants for ADHD is found to have elevated BP. Although this drug may increase BP, it is usually only a mild increase. Nevertheless, it would be sensible to test the child's blood pressure off methylphenidate to be sure it is not causing the problem.
Other, less commonly used medications can cause high BP, including the immunosuppressive drugs prednisone (and related steroids), tacrolimus, and cyclosporine.
Many other medications, over-the-counter drugs, or herbal/nutritional supplements may be able to raise BP but this more commonly occurs in someone who already has hypertension for other reasons. Be sure to give your provider a complete list of these, particularly if BP is elevated.

, Infants and toddlers can have hypertension. Identifying hypertension depends on increased parental awareness of higher risk situations, or the appearance of the symptoms described in section 3 below. Some conditions that frequently cause high blood pressure in infants and which require particular attention include:


Infants born prematurely, with complicated medical courses.
Infants who have prematurity-related lung disease.
Newborns of mothers using addictive drugs during pregnancy (from the infant’s drug withdrawal)
Infants or children with heart murmurs.
Infants with known kidney or urinary tract abnormalities.
Infants with abnormal skin pigmentation.
Any child with a family history of polycystic kidneys
Children with unexplained seizure disorders.

, If your child has high blood pressure, learn to measure it at home. Learning to monitor your child’s blood pressure at home can help to get a more accurate reading of your child’s BP if they get nervous at the doctor’s office.


This will make medical monitoring much easier and trips to the office less frequent. However, the main obstacle to this is that unless your child is adult-size, it may be difficult to find affordable monitors to use at home.
Keep in mind that measurement must be accurate. Although BP varies from minute to minute, the averages and trends are important. In people with high BP, even 4-5 mmHg makes a difference when it comes to their health risks from hypertension.

, BP cuffs that are too big or too small will give incorrect results. For most kids, an easy way to select a proper size is to measure the distance from the very tip of the shoulder to the elbow crease. Calculate ¾ of that distance. Use a BP cuff with a width that is as close to that number as possible. In cases where the number falls in between sizes, choose the larger of the two. Most cuffs come in widths of:


9 centimeter (3.5 in). (3.5 in.)
12 centimeter (4.7 in). (4.7 in.)
15 centimeter (5.9 in). (6 in.)
18 centimeter (7.1 in). (7 in.) The 18 centimeter (7.1 in) cuff (“large adult”) is usually necessary for older, obese children. Alternatively, you can purchase a “long” 15 cm (adult-size) cuff to accommodate the greater arm circumference.

, Attach the BP cuff by wrapping it around the upper arm, just above the elbow joint. It should not cover the crease on the inside of the elbow joint. Notice the arrow on the cuff - the cuff should be applied so that the arrow is pointing to the elbow crease.

, Take a manual BP by placing a stethoscope on your child's arm just below the cuff and usually in the elbow crease. This is where one of the major arteries supplying blood to the forearm and hand is located.


If you can feel the artery pulsating when gently pressing over the elbow crease, so much the better. The head of the stethoscope should be placed above this pulse, pressing down lightly.

, Be sure that the twist valve at the base of the rubber bulb of the cuff is completely closed. As you inflate the cuff by squeezing the rubber bulb repeatedly, the dial will indicate an increasing pressure.


Pump until you reach a pressure likely to be above the child’s BP; around 140 mmHg (the measurement unit) for very young kids, 150-160 for primary school age, and 160-170 for teens.

, The cuff pressure momentarily blocks blood flow in the artery. The cuff is then slowly deflated while you listen over the artery.


Just as the pressure in the cuff drops below the pressure in the artery, blood begins to flow past the cuff. This initial “spurt” can be easily heard with the stethoscope and is recorded as the systolic BP.
As the cuff continues to deflate, the sound eventually disappears. This is recorded as the diastolic BP.

, The range of what is considered a “normal” BP increases throughout childhood. So a normal BP in a 15 year old might be a “high” blood pressure in a 5 year old. The 90th and 95th percentiles are the most useful thresholds for elevated BP in any given child. For example:


90th percentile BP: about 90 of 100 normal children would be expected to have BP below the 90th percentile.
95th percentile: 95 of 100 normal children would be expected to have a BP below that level.
BP above the 90th percentile up to the 95th percentile is called “pre-hypertension”. This is the range where there is increased risk of eventually developing hypertension.
Likewise, BP above the 95th percentile is considered hypertension. You can look up the percentiles for your child using the same information available to your medical provider, but this can be tedious and you must also know your child’s height percentile.

, Although most children with hypertension have no symptoms, moderate to severe headaches may indicate a hypertensive crisis. These are throbbing and often noted in the early morning or upon awakening.

, Children with brain-related symptoms will usually have blood pressure treated in the hospital, frequently in the intensive care unit. While the blood pressure must be reduced promptly, it is essential to reduce it at a controlled rate, as there is the risk of the brain receiving inadequate blood flow when a very high BP drops too fast.


As general rule of thumb, the BP is quickly reduced by about 15-25%, after which it can be further controlled over the following days.
Although children can have hypertensive strokes, the more common symptoms caused by the brain's exposure to very high pressures are confusion, unexplained vomiting, double vision, abrupt loss of vision, and seizures.

, Chest discomfort or pain, rapid heart beat, difficulty catching the breath or shortness of breath may occur, most often because the heart is struggling to pump blood against such high pressures.

, Blood in the urine may occur due to kidney injury caused by the hypertension, particularly in those with underlying chronic kidney disorders.


It's also important to be aware that sudden and severe hypertension may occur as a result of the development of kidney disease; most of these are of the glomerulonephritis variety (with kidney inflammation).
In this case the blood in the urine is from the kidney disease, not the hypertension.

, Current pediatric care guidelines recommend the regular measurement of BP during routine check ups beginning at age 3 years. Since most children with high BP will initially have no symptoms, most cases are discovered by routine measurement during doctor visits.


Unfortunately, it also can be difficult to obtain an accurate measurement in the office, particularly in younger children. The child's level of activity shortly before measurement, feelings of anxiety (such as anticipating a “shot”), their emotional state and their body temperature will all affect BP.
When the initial office BP is compared to several others later in the visit, the first measurement is frequently higher than the rest. With so many potentially confusing factors, it may be easy to explain away or ignore elevated measurements. As a result “real” high blood pressures may be missed.

, When an office BP is initially elevated, be sure it is repeated at least twice during that visit. If repeat measurements are normal, hypertension is unlikely. If BP remains high, it should be confirmed by repeating the BP measurements several times during the following few weeks.


These should be at least two measurements during each visit and the child should be seated comfortably and quietly for at least 5 minutes before the pressure is taken.
Repeated measurements at home can be done if a cuff of appropriate size for your child is available (excessively large or small cuffs will give inaccurate results – see above).

Weigh your child regularly.,
Measure your child’s height.,
Calculate your child’s BMI.,
Recognize accuracy concerns.,
Note your child’s measurements.",How to Know if Your Child Is Too Skinny1," A good sign your child is is healthy and not too skinny is if they are steadily gaining weight as they grow.Weighing your child regularly can help you calculate things such as body mass index (BMI) as well as ensure your child is adding weight as they get taller.Use a scale that is properly calibrated. You may even want one that can weigh to fractions of a poundThis will give you the most accurate reading of your child’s weight. If your child doesn’t want to stand still, just weigh yourself while holding your child and then weigh yourself alone after you put down your child. Subtract your weight from the combined weight. The difference is your child’s weight.Recognize that your child’s weight can fluctuate during the day. Weighing your child at the same time and under the same conditions can ensure the most accurate reading.;
, In most children, there is a direct parallel between growth in height and weight gain.Measuring your child’s height regularly can help you determine if your child is too skinny for their weight. It can also help you calculate BMI, which is also a good indicator if a child is too skinny. You may also want an idea of where on the growth chart your child falls.Offer your child a small prize for allowing you to measure them. You may also want to chart it on a doorframe so that your child can watch as they grow. Turning it into a game makes it a fun exercise for you and your child.

, Plotting your child’s height and weight can give you a good idea of whether they are too skinny. However, many doctors are now using a child’s body mass index, or BMI, to determine body composition.Body mass index considers factors including height, weight, age, and sex.It can give a more accurate calculation of whether your child is too skinny.Put your child’s measurements into a BMI calculator. Organizations including the Centers for Disease Control offer online calculators for children’s BMI that use both English and metric measurements.Refer to BMI growth charts available online from organizations such as the Centers for Disease Control.Find your child’s BMI on the chart and then check the corresponding percentile. A child below the 5th percentile is considered underweight., It’s not uncommon for your measurements to be less accurate than a pediatrician’s. Your child’s doctor uses specialized instruments to get the most accurate information about your child’s growth. If you don’t notice a big difference in measurements, you probably are doing a great job of checking your child at home.Take measurements at home after a doctor’s visit. Compare your measurements to your doctor’s. This provides a good reference point when you take more home calculations.
Check your measurements by doing each twice. Check a third time if your first two measurements aren’t consistent.

, Keep a notebook with your child’s height and weight measurements. These can help you chart and watch their growth and may also provide your child’s doctor with important information about their development.Write the date before you take your measurements. Note the numbers as quickly as possible so that your information is accurate. You may also want to make additional notes about your child’s diet or sleeping habits.
Provide your child’s pediatrician with your notes if you are concerned your child is too skinny.

Pay attention to food choices.,
Look for signs of poor diet.,
Watch for symptoms of an eating disorder.,
Consider other health issues.",How to Know if Your Child Is Too Skinny2," There are some external factors, such as genetics, that can also influence your child’s weight. Taking the time to think about things that may influence or even raise concern about your child’s weight may help you better realize if your child is too skinny.Think about your family members and their bodies. Does your child look too skinny because everyone else carries a little extra weight? Were you or other family members slim as kids? If so, your child is more likely to be, too.Ask yourself if your child has other health or developmental issues that may influence weight. For example, children with developmental delays may not gain weight easily.
Recognize that children who are active in sports may be skinnier than more sedentary children., Your child is likely not too skinny if they are gaining weight steadily.Regular review of your child’s weight and BMI can indicate if there are any reasons for concern.Notice if your child has any unusual dips in their weight. These could signal that your child is getting too skinny, or they could be a sign of an underlying condition. Schedule an appointment with your child’s pediatrician to ensure that any dips don’t indicate health issues.
If you notice that your child is not outgrowing their clothes over a period of several months, then this may be a sign that your child is not gaining weight at an appropriate rate., Most children eat when they are hungry and stop when they’ve had enough. It may appear that your child isn’t eating enough, which could cause them to be too skinny. By watching the patterns of how your child eats, you can figure out if they are getting enough to eat.Offer foods from each food group at every meal. Make sure your child has a bit—or all—of each choice you provide. Mix the foods up during each meal to ensure that your child likes their choices and feels encouraged to eat.
Be a role model for your child by eating a variety of foods. For example, “Ellie, did you try the cauliflower rice with broccoli and cheese I made? It’s kinda different, but really tastes good!”

, Your child may be a picky eater, causing you to worry that they aren’t getting the nutrients for proper growth. In most cases, picky eaters grow at the normal rate. However, some may not, which a doctor can diagnose. Looking for the signs of poor diet can alert you to if your child is too skinny. You should get prompt medical treatment if you notice any of the following symptoms of poor diet, hunger, or malnutrition:Fatigue and low energy
Dizziness
Dry, scaly skin
Swollen and bleeding gums or decaying teeth
Muscle weakness
Problems learning

, Although rare, some children who are too skinny may have an eating disorder, such as anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa. These disorders may stem from a pre-occupation with thinness and dieting and can cause extreme weight loss, although children with bulimia nervosa may maintain a weight that is close to normal for their age.If you’re concerned your child is too skinny because they are not eating, watching for the signs of an eating disorder can help you and your child get prompt treatment from a doctor.Typical signs of anorexia and bulimia include:Extreme weight loss
Restricted eating or refusal to eat
Fear of gaining weight and a distorted body image
Bulimia may cause a chronic sore throat, tooth decay, or severe dehydration

, Children with certain diseases and conditions may not be able to digest their food or absorb its nutrients properly. If your child has one of these conditions, it may cause them to be too skinny. Talk to your child’s doctor about diet and nutrition if your child has any of the following diseases:Celiac diseaseCystic fibrosis
Gastrointestinal reflux disease (GERD)DiabetesChronic diarrhea
Chronic liver diseaseCleft lip or palate"

However, you may still be worried. The most accurate way to know if your child is too skinny is by seeing their pediatrician. The doctor will check your child’s measurements and calculate BMI while considering other factors such as underlying health concerns and genetics.Let the doctor know your concerns. You should also provide the doctor as much information as you can. This may include your home measurements or other notes you’ve taken about your child’s weight.
Answer any questions the doctor may ask you. You can also ask any questions you may have.

, If your doctor diagnoses your child with being too skinny, they will help formulate a treatment plan to help your child gain weight. This often includes putting the child on a high(er)-calorie diet and avoiding “empty” calories such as juices or candies. It’s important to follow any treatment plan your doctor develops to ensure your child grows and develops properly.Ask your doctor about what foods to feed your child to help them gain weight and get the most nutrients. These generally come from the five food groups and include fruits and vegetables, lean proteins, dairy, and grains.
Recognize that your child may require hospitalization to gain weight if they are too skinny and not able to gain weight.
Keep in mind that weight gain takes time, so treatment may last several months.

, Depending on why your child is too skinny or may not be eating enough, your doctor may suggest seeing a specialist or specialists. These people can not only help your child gain weight and grow properly, but may also deal with underlying issues. Your child’s doctor may refer you to any of the following professionals:Registered dietician, to figure out your child’s specific dietary needs
Occupational therapists, to develop successful eating behaviors
Social worker, if your family is having trouble getting enough food for your child
Psychiatrists or psychologists, to address behavioral issues
Gastroenterologists or cardiologists to treat underlying health conditions
Endocrinologist, if your child has been diagnosed with diabetes.

Have your kids walk to their friends' homes instead of you driving them.
Encourage your kids to run around the neighborhood.
Suggest that your kids swim in your pool or a pool in your community.
Buy your kids bicycles so they can travel around the neighborhood., While outdoor play is the cornerstone of keeping your kids active, there are also many opportunities for your kids to exercise indoors.


Construct an obstacle course for your kids indoors. This might be best for younger children, between the ages of 4 and 8.
Have your kids play freeze dance. In this game, everybody dances until the music stops, when they freeze. If someone continues to move, they're out.
Encourage younger children to play beanbag toss or a similar game.

Encourage your kids to play sports at school.,
Sign your kids up for non-school related sports and other competitive activities.,
Have your kids join organizations that keep them busy.",How to Keep Your Kids Physically Active During the School Year2," Perhaps the best way to get your kids to be physically active is to have them sign up for sports at school. These sports will not only keep your kids active, but engaged and social. Allow your child to choose a sport or team to join. Consider:


Team sports. Traditional team sports like softball, football, and volleyball will keep your kids busy and active.
Individual sports. Activities like swimming, tennis, or track and field will keep your kids physically active.
Alternative activities. Even activities like debate club, Model United Nations, or chess club will get your kids to be more physically active than going home and playing video games., While some kids might be perfectly happy playing softball, soccer, or even swimming for their school, others may be more interested in non-school affiliated activities. Consider:


Traditional sports activities like Little League baseball.
Activities like dance, ballet, and more.

, There are a wide variety of non-school related and non-sport organizations that will occupy your kids and keep them active both physically and socially. Consider:


Outdoors-oriented groups like Girl Scouts or Boy Scouts. Through organizations like these your kids will engage in activities like hiking, camping, and canoeing.
Religious youth groups. Religious youth groups, whether organized through your church or synagogue, will keep your kids busy with a wide variety of activities – many of them physical in nature."

Play sports with your kids.,
Enter competitions together.,
Lead by example.,
Schedule outside activities for your whole family.",How to Keep Your Kids Physically Active During the School Year3," By playing sports with your kids, you’ll keep yourself fit and teach them a specific sport or activity. In addition, you’ll have fun. Ultimately, there really is no substitute to playing sports with your children.


Teach your kids to play your favorite sport, like baseball, football, or volleyball.
Ask them what they want to play. Say “Hey Johnny, let’s play something outside. What are you interested in?”
Don’t require your kids to play with you. Requiring them to play may have the opposite desired effect.
Avoid insulting or being overly critical when you play with your kids. There is a fine line between constructive teaching and being an overbearing parent. For example, never say something like “You’re never going to learn how to throw a ball properly, are you?”, There are a wide variety of competitions that parents can enter with their children. Ultimately, by competing together, you’ll bond and promote the idea that physical activity is beneficial.


Enter marathons together. For instance, you can both enter a charity marathon in your community together.
Join a parent-child sports league, like a tennis league.
Take a leading role in your child’s competitive life by coaching a team they play on. For example, if your child plays baseball, find out if you can be an assistant coach., Ultimately, your kids are going to model the way they behave off the way you behave. By showing yourself to be a person who is physically fit and active, you’ll give them a model for how they should live.


Exercise regularly. If your kids observe you running or working out on a regular basis, they’ll see that it’s a good habit.
Talk to them about how important it is to be physically active. Sit them down and say something like “Jill, I know you’ve been watching TV a lot lately, but it is very important to be physically active.”
Avoid watching a lot of TV or spending excessive non-work related time on the computer. For example, limit your screen time to less than an hour or two per night., Family time is also a great way to keep your kids physically active. Thus, make sure to regularly schedule time that your whole family can be active together.


Reserve time every week or every other week for an outdoor family activity.
Have your family go hiking in a park or forest near you.
Plan family camping or white water rafting trips together on the weekend. This is a great way to get the whole family to bond and to be physically active."

Put together a schedule.,
Establish limits on the time your kids spend playing video games.,
Restrict the amount of time they watch television.,
Limit electronics in their bedrooms.",How to Keep Your Kids Physically Active During the School Year4," One of the greatest challenges of keeping kids active during the school year is balancing their many obligations. The best way to do this is to create a schedule for your kids, so they’ll be able to reserve time for everything they need to do.


Divide up after school time between all their obligations. In addition, create a flexible schedule for weekends. For instance, your kids may have trips or sports events to attend that will take a lot of time.
Plan homework time. Depending on what works best for them, you may want to reserve the first hour or two after school for completing homework. You may need to shift this if they have extracurricular activities they need to attend.
Take extracurricular activities and non-school related obligations into account.
Include time for playing outside or with friends.
Include “free time.” During this time, kids should be able to do whatever they want., For many kids, video games take the place of playing outside in the neighborhood. By limiting the time your kids spend playing video games, you’ll compel them to be more physically active.


Consider restricting video games to weekends and holidays.
On days you do allow your kids to play video games, limit their time to less than 1 or 2 hours.
Avoid purchasing new game consoles, video games, and paying for subscriptions like XBOX live., The television serves as one of the greatest time drains for kids today. However, by limiting the amount of time your kids watch TV, you’ll force them to find other uses for their time – like being physically active.


Limit your kids to 1 to 2 hours of screen time per day, including TV and video games.
Allow them to watch TV as a reward for completing their homework.
Tell your kids they are only allowed to watch TV at night, when they can’t participate in organized sports or play in the neighborhood., While you may have a good plan for limiting your kids' time on the television or computer, they may be able to skirt your rules if they have electronics in their bedrooms. In the end, the only way to make sure your kids limit their time with electronics is to make sure they can only use them in public areas of the house.


Make your kids use a computer that is in a public area of the house. This way, you’ll better be able to monitor their usage.
Don’t purchase a TV for your kids' bedrooms.
Instruct your kids to leave smartphones and tablets in public areas of the house.
Set your wireless router to block your kid’s electronic devices during certain hours. For instance, block all usage after 9 PM, for teens. In addition, block all times (like the time between the end of the school day and dinner) that you want to encourage your kids to be physically active."

First thing in the morning.
During a particular class, like gym, yoga, etc.
On the bus.
When you're supposed to be studying or working.
When you're around the opposite/same sex.
In bed.

, While it might seem like a way to satisfy sexual urges temporarily, developing an unhealthy reliance on or relationship with pornography could spiral into more and more sexual thoughts, making it very hard to get free of their grip.


Get rid of pornographic videos, magazines, calendars, and other materials in your house and, to the best of your ability, avoid watching it.
If you have a firewall guard in your computer, try to enable parental controls, and put the profile to teen so you won't accidentally stumble across any pornography. Parental controls don’t have to be just for kids, of course, and you can set them up on all your browsers and other devices., This is basically what you consider the opposite of sexy. You could try turning yourself off by training yourself to think of unsexy things when your mind drifts into sexual territory. Anything that you would consider an unsexy mental diversion could work here.


Try thinking about neutral pleasant topics like scenic outdoor views, underwater scenes, puppies, sports bloopers, or chess strategy.
You could think of cold-related topics like big and bulky clothing, snow, or winter.

, Get in your own way and don't allow yourself to think about sex by focusing on these other things. It will become second nature before too long.


Find something to do immediately as a diversion. If you're always dwelling on sex during idle bus rides, for example, make a special effort to do something else during your ride, like finishing some homework, reading a new book, or talking to a friend. Or, if you start thinking about sex at boring points in a class, a meeting, or at work, for example, you might start taking notes. By keeping your pen moving, you'll have to stay focused on the conversation at hand and not what's going on in your mind.
Keep discussion topics top of mind. If you can't run into a particular person without thinking about sex and getting embarrassed, come up with three specific things you want to ask them next time you see them. You could also come up with more thought-provoking topics that apply to most people, such as those surrounding current events, global affairs, the environment, or even politics., Make a minimum goal to curb your sexual thoughts so that they don't distract you from your other daily activities, such as work or school, and commit to it.


If you need help remembering your commitment, wear a piece of jewelry or a simple string around your wrist that will remind you to power through the temptation to get lost in sexual thought.
Tell someone about your goal. Telling a trusted friend or family member about your efforts is a good way to help you stay accountable. Have them check in with you regularly to see that you’re doing okay and to provide help or suggestions, if needed.
Reward yourself for keeping your commitment. This should be pretty straightforward. You could reward yourself with a favorite dessert, a shopping trip, or something else you like.

, Thinking about sex is a big part of adolescence and adulthood, and you don't need to feel guilty about it. The only way sexual thoughts become a problem is if you can't focus on what you want to think about. Remember that it’s not always going to be difficult, and the present urge will pass., Fill idle time in your schedule by planning things in advance. Everyone needs time to relax, but finding yourself with hours of time on your hands might lead to backsliding and thinking about sex too much. Schedule your day full with events and activities to better yourself. Leave a bit of time at the end of the day for reflection and relaxation, but not so much that you'll get bored or that your mind will wander toward sex.

, Translate your sex drive into creative energy. Take the time you'd usually spend thinking about sex and instead devote it to a creative hobby. If it's something you really enjoy, it can provide you with an alternate avenue for catharsis and satisfaction, keeping your mind busy and occupied.


Writing, including journaling.
Singing, playing a musical instrument, or spinning.
Painting, drawing, or sculpting.
Knitting or sewing.

, Getting lost in an engrossing book or movie is fun in and of itself, but it can also be an easy, low-energy way to avoid sexual thoughts, particularly in the short term.


Be sure to find a movie that won’t remind you of sex, and stay clear of steamy romance novels or sexy illustrations.
Most animated, action, adventure, thriller, or mystery films and books could work here.

, This will keep your mind occupied with other things and could be a lot of fun. Going with friends is even better as they can further distract you. Plus, you can talk with them about the event afterward and what you thought of it.


Consider attending a live performance, such as a concert, musical, play, lecture, or reading.
You might also go to a museum, a new exhibit, an aquarium, or a zoo.

, Sexual thoughts or dissatisfaction might come from another sort of dissatisfaction: hunger. So, don’t to skip meals. Try to eat three, healthy balanced meals per day, and remember to hydrate as well, particularly during hot weather. To keep your mind sharp enough to ward off sexual thoughts, try eating brain foods like celery, spinach, walnuts, sunflower or pumpkin seeds, beets, and even dark chocolate!, Obviously, exercising is healthy itself, but it also does a few specific things that help damper sexual preoccupations. Exercise can be engrossing and distracting, and when you work out hard enough, other distractions have a tendency of receding into the background.


Exercise provides a natural endorphin rush. Endorphins provide a generally good feeling, and help relieve depression.During sex, endorphins are also released, along with other chemicals like the hormone oxytocin.Ergo, exercise can be a good substitute for sexual activity.

, While playing an individual sport, you may have difficulty getting away from your own thoughts. With team sports, you’re much less likely to have this problem because they are social activities.


Choose the right type of sport and team. Of course, you may still be attracted to someone else on your team or in your league, but you should be able to determine whether the benefits of playing outweigh the risk of worsening your thoughts about sex. You might also try joining a single-sex team or a different league, for example.

, When you’re tired, you might have trouble focusing. Lack of sleep reduces your alertness and concentration, and it can affect your mood.So, you’ll have difficulty preventing your mind from wandering to sex, and it will be harder to implement the sex-free thought practices above. Make sure your bed is comfortable and that you’re getting eight hours of sleep and deep sleep or REM sleep.

, If you’re in a relationship, communication is a key part of cultivating a healthy sex life. Getting thoughts out in the open is also a good way to keep them from growing or festering in your head, and it can improve your sex life instead.


If you're sexually active, communicate with your partner to maintain a healthy and open sexual relationship that keeps you both fulfilled. Communication doesn’t have to be just verbal, either. You can write your partner notes. As a couple, you could also read a book together or watch a film that shows or articulates your thoughts.And if you’re reluctant to communicate with your partner about sex, remember that communication itself is a turn on.If you’re not sexually active, it’s equally important to communicate. If you're thinking about sex more than you'd like to even though you're not sexually active, is it because there's something lacking or frustrating about your sex life? Talk to your partner openly and truthfully. You also want to make sure your expectations are aligned with your partners. You should know if and when, for example, your partner wants to begin having sex, and he should know when you want to have sex as well.

, If you are in a relationship, use your sexual drive to act in a loving and caring manner toward your partner. Be romantic instead of strictly sexual, per se. That way, you can build the emotional intimacy you share with each other.

, With masturbation, there's nothing to feel guilty about, especially if it helps keep your sexual thoughts and urges in check. Abstaining might even worsen your urges. If you're constantly thinking about finding a sexual partner, you can date regularly yet keep yourself partially sexually satisfied through masturbation. This can help free your mind to focus on more important things. Just make sure masturbation doesn't turn into a new addiction, however.

, Any topic that you think about too much or obsess over can seem all-consuming, and while sex is important and seems omnipresent, life is not entirely reduced to sex and sexual desires. You’re a complicated, multi-faceted person. So, honor your various thoughts, interests, and abilities.

, Even though parents may seem like dinosaurs when you get to your teenage years, your parents have been there before. If you’re a teen, talking to a parent you feel comfortable with can, if not solve your problem, at least help you to feel more comfortable and normal. Thinking about sex is a common struggle for teenagers and talking about it can help.


Talk to other family members. If you do not wish to speak with your parents, consider talking to an older sibling or a cousin. They might be able to relate to you better since they’re closer in age.

, As terrifying as this may sound, it is one of the most powerful and effective approaches. If you are lucky enough to know someone who is not judgmental and will understand and appreciate your goal, talk to them about how you are doing. Having a frank conversation when you feel compelled to think or act in ways you would rather not can be a reassuring source on ongoing support.

, If you're struggling with sexual urges as a part of your commitment to a particular faith, get help from your pastor or another religious leader. This is a common issue and you shouldn't feel embarrassed to bring it up. They have heard this and much more before, and can help you keep your challenges in perspective.

, This could include psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers, or and other types of therapists.


Some specialists charge a fee, of course, but look to see if your insurance covers all or part of your visits. If you’re a student or have comprehensive workplace benefits, you may be able to consult a specialist at little or no cost. Whether you pay or not, your visit and specific concerns will be kept confidential, and your therapist can explain confidentiality further with you. Knowing how to address any obsessive thought, sexual or otherwise, is something they can help you learn to deal with.
There is also much less of a stigma today to speaking with therapists, and you might be surprise about the people who regularly see a specialist. So, you shouldn’t hesitate for social reasons about visiting one.
If you suspect your overwhelming thoughts may be a kind of sexual addiction, seek help from a licensed sex therapist and treat those symptoms as well. Don't let an obsession turn into destructive or dangerous behavior.

Keep a record of how much time you spend on the computer.,
Set goals to reduce your computer usage.,
Set boundaries, and keep them.,
Fight the impulse.,
Change your routine.,
Get plenty of exercise.,
Set up your computer to be used only for essential purposes.,
Use apps to control your screen time.,
Take the computer away.,
Get support from family and friends.,
Ask a friend or family member to reduce his or her screen time at the same time you do.,
Recognize the harm that overusing the computer can cause.,
Seek professional support if you think you have a computer addiction.It is one thing to feel like you are using the computer too much, and quite another when it becomes a full-blown addiction.",How to Stop Using the Computer Too Much," If you discover that you are spending a lot of time on the computer—perhaps more time than you are spending around other people—it can help to keep a log of your screen time.Using a paper notebook rather than an electronic device, record when you get on the computer, and when you stop using it. Tally up the number of hours you’ve spent on the computer each day.


If you see that you are spending too much time on the computer, follow the methods for reducing your screen time.
Look for patterns in your computer usage. For instance, you might see that you spend more time on the computer over the weekend than during the week, or at night rather than during the day. This knowledge can help you target and address the problem in the best way.;
, Once you’ve started to keep a record of your computer usage , you can start to reduce your screen time.For instance, if you notice after the first week of keeping a log of your time that you are spending 5 hours a day on your computer for non-essential purposes, set a goal for the next week of using it 10 percent less (4.5 hours per day). Each week after that, reduce it another ten percent until you reach a computer usage amount that you are comfortable with.


Giving yourself a reward when you meet each week’s goal can be helpful—just don’t let the reward involve a computer or other electronic device.
You can allow yourself a certain level of computer usage, just make sure it is an amount of time you are comfortable with, and that doesn’t interfere with or take away from other aspects of your life.

, People that struggle with using the computer too much often have trouble getting off of the computer, even if they need to do other things.To control your amount of screen time, set boundaries and work hard to keep them. For instance, if you are having trouble going to bed at night because of your computer usage, tell yourself that you will stop checking social media, playing online games, working, etc. one hour before your bedtime.


Have a friend or family member help keep you accountable by checking on you to make sure you get off the computer when you want to.

, If you feel an urge to use your computer when you don’t really need to, stop and remind yourself that you want to reduce your screen time. It can also help if you replace computer usage with another activity whenever you think of it.For instance, if you feel the urge to check your email first thing every morning, tell yourself “No, I’m going to have some coffee and take a short walk first.”

, Computer over-usage often develops out of habit, but changing your routine can put and end to it.For instance, if you notice that you are spending all of your evenings using your computer for non-essential purposes, try introducing new activities into your life so that you don’t give into the impulse:


Spend quality time with friends or family.
Take up a new hobby that doesn’t rely on screen time.
Take a walk.
Read a book.
Do a puzzle.
Play a board game.

, Overusing the computer can be associated with poor health, in part because it reduces the amount of time that you are physically active. Making sure that you get regular exercise is good for your overall health, can boost your mood, and provides non-computer-related activities that can take the place of screen time. Keep a record of the amount of time you are physically active, and compare it to the amount of time you spend using the computer.Try working at least thirty minutes of vigorous physical activity into each day.


You can even be active during the times when you absolutely have to be on the computer. For instance, you can take a five minute break every hour to walk around, or work on your computer at a standing desk or treadmill so that you will move around some.

, Many of us need a computer for work, school, or business-related purposes. However, you can reduce your screen time if you make sure your computer is not equipped to be used as entertainment or as a distraction. For instance:Uninstall computer games so you won’t be tempted to play them.
Try to do shopping in person rather than online.
Take a social media “vacation.”

, Many devices are equipped with parental controls, and third-party usage monitoring apps can be installed.These can be used to limit your screen time by shutting down or logging off the device after a certain cutoff point that you or someone else can set.

, Physically removing the computer can effectively stop you from using it.If you want to reduce your computer usage, put the device away in a location that is not easily accessible to you when you do not need to use it for essential purposes.


You can lock the computer away, put it in a closet, under a bed, or other out of the way place.
You can leave your computer somewhere else when you don’t need to use it. For instance, if you want to stop using your laptop so much at night, you can leave it behind at your workplace at the end of the day.
You can also ask someone to take the computer away from you and put it somewhere you don’t know about until it is needed again.

, Tell friends, family, coworkers, and others around you that you are trying to reduce your computer usage. You may have a greater chance of succeeding if you don’t feel alone in dealing with the problem. Those in your support group might also be able to offer advice or tips that they have used to reduce computer usage.

, If both of you are trying at the same time, it can make the transition easier. For instance, you can do non-computer-related activities together, and help each other be accountable for sticking to your screen time reduction goals.

, Too much computer usage can keep you from being as productive as you might otherwise be, or hold you back from engaging in other activities. However, the problem can also take a toll on your health. Recognizing some of these dangers can help motivate you to reduce your screen time and computer usage. Overusing the computer can: Make it difficult to sleep at night.
Make it harder for you to concentrate.
Contribute to obesity and premature mortality, largely by increasing the amount of time you sit.
Cause pain in the hands, wrists, back, and other areas.
Cause eyestrain and headaches.

, In the latter case, it can be best to seek professional help from a counseling center, support group, or other source.Signs that you may be addicted include:


Friendships, relationships, family, or finances suffering because of your computer usage.
Missing sleep, school, work, appointments, etc. because of your computer usage.
Lying to others about how much time you are using the computer.
Feeling anxious when you are away from your computer.
Difficulty keeping track of how much time you spend on the computer.
Using the computer very frequently to soothe yourself or distract you from things you are worried about.

Reflect on any decreased physical or mental health as a result of tobacco and alcohol. Have you gained weight or decreased fitness as a result of using? Do you become angry without alcohol, or anxious without tobacco?
Many people choose to quit addictions because they feel sick and tired of feeling sick and tired, and engaging the addiction is more draining than the positive effects of the substance.Consider how tobacco and alcohol interfere with your relationships and social life.
Think of financial costs alcohol and tobacco cost you.;
, Use a notebook to record the times throughout the day you smoke or drink alcohol.Record what feelings or situations preceded using alcohol and tobacco. Avoid situations that may trigger you in the future.


A trigger could be getting into an argument with your family or something not going well at work.
Because alcohol and nicotine are highly correlated substances, one can trigger the other. For example, if you begin drinking, you may want to have a cigarette., Be clear on whether you want to stop altogether or slowly taper your use. While some may want to quit for social or health reasons, others may want to quit due to medical reasons or because they have an addiction. Reflect on your reasons and then choose your goals. If you are an alcoholic, it is best to cut alcohol out altogether and not taper it down.People who smoke have a much harder time quitting alcohol and also tend to relapse more than people who do not smoke.Set goals that include concurrently quitting both nicotine and alcohol together.
Write down a date for each goal to solidify the commitment.

, Throw away all the cigarettes and pour alcoholic drinks down the sink.. Ask the other members of your household to support you in keeping your home free of alcohol and tobacco products, so that you can avoid temptation on a daily basis.

, Don't hold onto your favorite lighter, your flask, or your shot glasses. A big lifestyle change like this is best maintained if you avoid seeing constant reminders of your old habits., Being near places where smoking and drinking are encouraged can be dangerous when you are trying to quit.Avoid bars and other places where alcohol and tobacco are likely to be used.


Sit in the nonsmoking sections of restaurants and choose non-smoking hotel rooms

, Surrounding yourself with people that engage in behaviors you are trying to avoid can be tempting. Explain to them that you are removing the substances from your life and will no longer engage in activities that revolve around drinking or smoking. Create distance from people who will not support you in your desire to be free from alcohol and tobacco., High risk situations can include feeling lonely, tired, angry, and hungry.These situations can leave you feeling vulnerable and more prone to use alcohol or tobacco. Be aware of when you feel you may be approaching any of these situations and learn to prevent them from starting.


Make sure you get enough sleep, eat throughout the day, and don't isolate yourself socially to avoid these high risk situations. If you feel anger coming on, remind yourself to relax and let it pass without depending on alcohol and cigarettes.

, Remember that using alcohol and tobacco provides positive reinforcement because they help you cope with stress and tension.Try to pinpoint what positive aspects you experience as a result of using alcohol and tobacco, and brainstorm different outlets to obtain the same release. Coping can include relaxation and deep breathing, talking to a friend, or taking a walk.

Activities such as taking a walk, reading, and meditation can be effective ways to relax., Everyone needs some vices in life - just make them healthier ones overall. Indulge in a little ice-cream every now and then, or buy some fizzy drinks with lots of carbonation. While staying healthy is important, give yourself a little leeway so that you don't feel denied all the indulgences that you used to enjoy.

, The better you cope with cravings the lesser your chance of relapsing. People who quit smoking and drinking at the same time tend to experience less severe withdrawal and face lower relapse risk., When ceasing alcohol or tobacco, the body may experience withdrawal without continued use. Withdrawal symptoms from tobacco and alcohol can include: anxiety, depression, fatigue, headache, nausea, shaking, stomach cramps, and elevated heart rate., While tobacco withdrawal can be unpleasant on both body and emotions, alcohol withdrawal can be dangerous.

, If you have other friends who are looking to quit drinking and smoking too, make a pact for healthier choices. Check in with each other daily and hold each other accountable for your choices.

, Reach out to smoke-free groups, such as smoke-free Alcoholics Anonymous and other support groups, like Nicotine Anonymous.Talking about your efforts in a supportive environment with people who share similar experiences can make all the difference in your attempts to quit.

Establish a sleeping schedule.,
Encourage a healthy diet.,
Offer lots of drinking water.,
Keep junk foods to a minimum.",How to Keep Your Child Healthy1," It is important for your child to get around 10 hours of sleep every night, depending on age. Going to sleep at the same time each evening will help this happen. Stick carefully to this routine and only push back the bed time if it is absolutely necessary. When possible, allow you child to sleep in if they went to bed late.Sleep is important to health in many ways. It allows your body to recover quickly from illness or fight off potential infections. It also boosts your metabolism. Good sleep can calm your emotions and result in a healthier mindset as well.It is recommended that preschoolers get between 10 to 13 hours, elementary and middle-schoolers between 10 to 13 hours, and teenagers between 8 to 10 hours. This is dependent on personal preference as well. Some children simply prefer to sleep more or slightly less than average.;
, Purchase a variety of fruits and vegetables, whole-grain products, and lean meats for your household. Go for fresh, organic produce whenever you can. Carefully read labels to determine portion sizes and make meals that conform to those guidelines. Offer healthy snacks, such as hummus and carrot sticks, throughout the day.Invite your child to help you with meal prep. Let them choose a healthy recipe for dinner. Take them with you to the grocery store and turn reading labels into a game. Make food more interesting for finicky eaters by crafting healthy personal pizzas (with their own selected toppings) or by positioning fruit into a smiley face on their plate.If your child refuses to eat their veggies, keep offering them. Try out other vegetable options and preparations as well. A child who dislikes straight steamed broccoli may love it when it is topped with a bit of shredded cheddar cheese.

, A child should drink the number of 8 oz. water glasses that correspond to their age (up to a limit of 64 oz. total at 8 years of age). So, a 4 year old child should drink 4 glasses containing 8 oz. of water per day. This total does not include milk, juice, or other liquids, just water.Your child should only start drinking water after they reach 6 months of age. Prior to this, they should drink formula and/or breast milk.
To add some variety, a child can also drink milk after their first birthday. A 2 year old should drink up to two 8 oz. glasses of milk per day. You can also offer juice, in moderation.A child’s brain is composed of 80% water, so staying hydrated is particularly important for optimal cognitive development. Teach your child to look at their urine to make sure it is more clear than yellow. If they spot yellow, then they should grab a glass of water., Avoid purchasing sugary, fatty, or heavily processed foods. If you don’t buy them, then your child will turn to a healthy alternative that is available in your fridge or pantry. Watch out for ‘sneaky’ foods that appear healthy but are actually the opposite. This can include items labeled “low-fat” or even low-juice fruit drinks.Other ‘sneaky’ junk foods can include various crackers labeled as kid friendly that actually contain high amounts of sugars or syrups. Watch out for fruit gummies as well. They often contain high amounts of sugar as well. It is better to simply offer your child a piece of fruit.

See if your child is itchy.,
Watch for a runny or stuffy nose.,
Check for red, itchy, or puffy eyes.,
Look and listen for sneezing, sniffling, or snorting.,
Look for scaly, itchy, or irritated skin.,
Be alert for wheezing or difficulty breathing.",How to Identify a Seasonal Allergy Reaction in Young Children1," The biggest difference between allergies and a cold is that allergies cause itchiness – in the eyes, the nose, the mouth, or the throat.Older toddlers may be able to tell you they feel “itchy,” “tickly,” or “tingly.” For younger children, watch for signs of itchiness like rubbing their eyes, rubbing or wiggling their nose, or trying to move their tongue around a lot.;
, A watery, runny, or congested nose is a very common symptom of seasonal allergies. You may be able to see mucus draining from the child’s nose. Sometimes, however, their nose is congested and the mucus drains down the back of their throat.The child might try to clear their throat often, cough, or have frequent sore throats from the drainage.


Regularly breathing through their mouth is a good indication the child’s nose is clogged or runny.Frequent nose rubbing in young kids, or the “allergic salute,” can cause a small horizontal crease at the lower third of the child’s nose.The child may have some stomach upset from swallowing mucus.If they become a fussy eater it may be due to stomach discomfort, congestion, or a sore throat caused by drainage.

, Allergies cause inflammation, which often causes puffy, red, itchy, or watery eyes.You can probably observe this directly just by looking at the child.


Sometimes allergies cause dark, puffy lower eyelids on a child.In fact, some doctors call these “allergic shiners” because it looks a lot like a black eye., Children with seasonal allergies usually sneeze quite often.This is the body’s way of trying to get rid of the itchiness in their throat or nose. Pay attention to whether your child is often sneezing or making sniffly noises, or even sounds like a pig snorting – they may be trying hard to clear their blocked nose.

, When a child has allergies, they may also have other health problems caused by similar reactions in the body. Many people with allergies also get a skin condition, called “atopic dermatitis,” that causes dry, itchy skin and tends to come and go.This also sometimes appears as eczema or hives.If you think your child has seasonal allergies, check them for patches of red, itchy, or dry skin or ask your doctor about it.


Ask your doctor something like, “I noticed my child is sneezing and has watery eyes, and also has a rash on their arm. Do you think they have allergies?”

, For a child to experience a hard time breathing or wheezing, their allergies must be pretty severe.However, it is possible. Children with asthma are also much more likely to be allergic to pollen, so be on the lookout for symptoms of asthma."

Avoid exposing your child to smoke.,
Avoid exposing your child to sick persons.,
Promote germ avoidance.,
Develop a plan for sick days.,
Schedule well child visits.,
Minimize in-home hazards.",How to Keep Your Child Healthy2," Smoke can linger after you put out a cigarette, so it is important to keep your children away from areas where you are smoking or where you have been smoking. If you are a smoker, enroll in a program to quit and ask smoker relatives to do so as well. Secondhand smoke is harmful to children as they develop.Children exposed to secondhand smoke are more likely to contract a variety of breathing problems and illnesses including (but not limited to) bronchitis and pneumonia. Smoke can also make existing medical problems worse, such as asthma. Babies are also at an increased risk for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)., When it is possible, keep your child away from people who are currently sick. Your child encounters plenty of germs during the day but direct exposure to an infection is just not worth it.


Stay in touch with your relatives, your child’s friends, and your child’s school to watch out for exposure to various infections. For example, if your child is invited to a sleepover but one of the other children present is sick with strep, it is probably best to decline the invitation. Keep in mind that viral infections are impossible to avoid completely, so don't go overboard if your relatives or friends have a mild cold.

, Teach your child to frequently wash their hands. They should do so after using the restroom and before they eat or touch their mouth or face. Give them a small bottle of hand sanitizer to carry around and use if a sink is not available. Instruct them to not share water bottles or drinks with others and to keep their hands out of their mouths (much easier said than done with toddlers).Show your child how to sing the “Happy Birthday” song twice when washing their hands with warm, soapy water. This is the amount of time it takes to remove most germs.
Show your child how to sneeze into their elbow and how to cover their cough with a hand as well. This way they can help prevent the spread of their germs as well.

, If your child is at home with you, then keep them there until they feel better. If your child goes to school or daycare, find out that location's policy on sickness. Some schools require that a child is fever-free for 24 hours before they return. Make no mistake, your child will get sick at some point. Knowing how you will provide for their care will result in less stress for you and your child.Part of planning ahead is also knowing the proper doses of medication for your child. Stock up on common anti-fever medications such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen. It is best to avoid a run to the pharmacy for basic medications whenever possible.

, You child should have a well child check-up every two to three months up until 2 years of age. After 2 years of age, your child will begin to visit their doctor each year for a basic check-up. Find a pediatrician who you trust and make sure to stick to this schedule. Your child’s doctor will take a variety of preventative measures each visit, including tracking your child’s growth and development.Use well child visits as an opportunity to ask any questions that you have regarding your child’s physical, mental, or emotional development. It may help to write down questions before you arrive. For example, you might ask, “Should my toddler be using a spoon and fork yet?”
Your child will also generally receive vaccinations at well check visits. These vaccinations offer protect against an assortment of more serious illnesses such as polio.A yearly flu shot can also help prevent a lot of misery from the flu.
Don’t forget the importance of taking your child to the dentist as well. At least once every year, your child’s teeth need to be cleaned and checked out., Place all toxic chemicals and cleaners in an inaccessible area. Hide all cords and wires. Secure furniture that could topple over. Remove any sharp or dangerous objects. Even after your child is beyond the baby stage, keep an eye out for potentially dangerous items in your home.


You may want to ask that your relatives or family friends safety proof their homes as well, especially when your child visits. Medications, for example, need to be stored in a location that is inaccessible for a child.

Sign them up for sports.,
Get your kids outside.,
Limit technology time.,
Teach them that food is fuel.,
Make plans for the weekend.",How to Keep Your Child Healthy3," Start experimenting with sports at an early age by enrolling your child through your local rec center or school. Or, you could sign your child up for lessons at a local sports facility. Swimming, dancing, and soccer are just a few examples of worthwhile sporting options. Being involved in sports will help your child to get at least 60 minutes of physical activity per day, the minimum suggested amount.Be prepared to go through a number of sports before you find the ones that your child will enjoy. This is a normal part of the process. Avoid pressuring your child to pursue a sport that they strongly dislike. Instead, look for alternative options.
Sports are also great for mental health. The pressure to focus employed by sports like martial arts is great for children struggling with control issues, like ADD., Head outside with your child and a jump rope or a bike for a few hours. Go on a nice long walk or hike with your kid. Play an extended game of tag followed by a park picnic. Soaking in the sunshine gets your child their daily dose of Vitamin D. This vitamin can then boost immunity and help prevent a variety of infections. Remember to apply sunscreen to your child before heading outdoors!Fresh air is also just healthy. It is good to take a break from the air inside your home as it could actually possess a variety of unhealthy pollutants.Always make sure to apply sunscreen before heading outside.

, Try to limit TV time to a maximum of two hours per day. You should also try to regulate the use of the computer, video games, and even their cell phone (if they have one) as well. Placing time and use limits on these devices will encourage your child to get out of doors and explore the world around them.Do not put a TV in your child’s bedroom. The use of technology can have a negative impact on sleep patterns. Instead, read a book to your child before bedtime or follow another relaxing routine., Spend time with your child researching healthy food options online. Look to see how particular foods translate into calories in and out of your body. Give your child the challenge of identifying the best possible food to eat before their sporting event. All children want to be strong and having them understand the impact of food is one way to get there.For example, before your child’s soccer game, ask them if them if a fast-food burger or a homemade sandwich would help them perform the best. Discuss the pros and cons of both options.

, Go on a hiking or camping trip. Try out kayaking lessons at the local lake. Contact your kid’s friends' parents and make a playdate for the local park. If you create definite plans, you are far more likely to get out of the house and explore the world.


Don’t forget to ask your child in advance what they would like to do over the weekend or breaks. They might have some great ideas or know about events that you are unaware of.

Keep communication lines open.,
Talk to them about peer pressure.,
Tell them, “I love you.” Let your child know that they are important to you.,
Stay in contact with their teachers.,
Pay attention to possible warning signs.",How to Keep Your Child Healthy4," Make an effort to be present so that your child will have the chance to approach you, if needed. Ask your child questions about their life and do so on a regular basis. Resist the urge to try to fix all of their problems and instead just be a good listener and a resource for help, if needed.If you discover that your child is upset, you might say, “When you are ready to talk, I’m here and will help you figure everything out if I can.”

, Recognize and acknowledge the mental pressures that your child will face. They will likely be offered drugs, alcohol, or be pressured to engage in sexual activity at some point. It is important to open a dialogue with your child about these issues. Encourage them to ask questions without receiving negative consequences. A single question could prevent them from making a harmful choice.It is best to initiate these conversations prior to your child reaching their teen years. Most parents open up this subject before their child is ten years old, if not earlier.
You could role play various scenarios with your child to get them used to saying “no” and sticking with it. You might say, “What is a good way to respond if someone offers you a beer at a party?”
Don’t rely on school sex ed to fully inform your child. Take responsibility for their well-being and ask them what they know, what they’d like to know, and what concerns they have. Tell them your concerns as well.

, This also reassures them that they are safe and protected. This will also provide the groundwork for them to have healthy and happy adult relationships later on. They will be able to more fully express their feelings to future partners.Never use words of affection as a way to control or manipulate your child. Only say them when you truly mean them in the way that they are intended. For example, you can unintentionally manipulate your child if you say, ""I'll love you even more if you clean your room.""

, Your child’s teachers spend a great deal of time with them and can give you a heads up regarding their mental state. At parent meetings, make sure to inquire not only about grades but about how your child is doing interacting with others and coping with any life changes that are occurring., If your child seems consistently tired, agitated, angry, irritable, or negative, you may want to seek professional help, perhaps with counseling. Other signs of possible depression or other mental concerns include slipping grades, lack of communication, poor hygiene or eating habits, and overall antisocial behavior.Talk to your child's doctor if you have concerns about their physical or emotional health.

Differentiate allergies from a cold.,
Pay attention to the timing of symptoms.,
Consider family history.",How to Identify a Seasonal Allergy Reaction in Young Children2," The biggest difference between allergies and a cold is itchiness – colds generally do not cause itching. Red, itchy eyes are usually symptoms of allergies, not colds. Runny noses will happen in both cases, but drainage from allergies is usually watery and clear, while drainage from a cold can be thicker and colored yellow (or sometimes even green).Children get colds all the time, but if the sneezing and other symptoms last for over 10 days or worsen after being outside, it’s more likely to be allergies., Try to notice when your child experiences their symptoms. Is it worse in the spring and summer? Do they have worse symptoms after being outside? Try to get specific, and narrow down the possible cause of the allergy. The most common causes of seasonal allergies are pollen, dust, and fungus or mold.Dust might accumulate in your house more in the winter when windows are closed and the air is still.
Pollen is present in most seasons from different trees and bushes, but the child will have worse symptoms after running through grasses or weeds, or spending time in a garden.
Mold and fungi grow best in the spring and late summer, but kids with allergies might have reactions from jumping in piles of dead leaves in the fall.

, If a child has seasonal allergies, it’s likely that one or both of their parents has seasonal allergies. Allergies are often inherited, so that can be a clue to recognizing allergies in young children. However, children and parents aren’t always allergic to the same thing – parents pass down the “I’m allergic” trait, but not the “to what” trait."

Find fun activities.,
Avoid turning to porn for boredom or anxiety.,
Distract yourself.,
Build your coping skills.,
Meditate.",How to Substitute Pornography1," Instead of temporary pleasure that you may feel guilty about later, invest in your happiness. If you don't have any work to do, then start doing what gives you happiness (porn gives pleasure, not happiness). Find activities that take up a large chunk of time that will allow you to get out of the house or at least be occupied for a substantial amount of time.


Invest in some hobbies you find enjoyable, especially social hobbies that allow you to make friends and have fun.Look into sports teams or leagues, running clubs, or sewing groups. Do what piques your interest!
Start cooking your meals, go to the gym after work or school, or spend more time with friends. If it’s too tempting to be in the house, get yourself out of the house during any vulnerable times. Go grocery shopping, visit a friend, or do some volunteering.;
, Because of its relative ease of access and anonymity, porn can easily become a way to distract from unpleasant feelings, avoid anxiety or avoid boredom.If you find yourself about to watch porn, take a deep breath. Ask yourself, “Is this a way I’m trying to escape?” If yes, determine to try something else instead.


You may find yourself turning to pornography after an argument, to self-soothe when feeling moody, or as an excuse to to avoid doing something unpleasant. You may also use pornography as a go-to for boredom when you want a time-filler.

, Do what you can to push thoughts of compulsive pornography consumption from your mind by refocusing your attention.Distract yourself by reading a book, building model airplanes, talking on the phone, or watching funny videos online. Do what you can to occupy your mind with something other than pornography until the urge passes.


If you don’t know what to do to distract yourself, do something simple and repetitive, like folding laundry or washing the dishes.

, Some people use pornography to cope with feelings as a way to escape. Instead of using pornography, find healthy coping skills.When feeling down, take a walk, write in a journal, or confide in a friend. Instead of running away from unpleasant emotions, take a moment and explore the negative emotions and ask if there is anything for you to pay attention to in particular.


Practice deep breathing. Sit comfortably and practice elongating each inhale and exhale until you feel completely relaxed.
Write in a journal or use art (drawing, sculpting) as a healthy way to cope. Creating or listening to music can also be helpful. You want to connect to your emotions and engage your mind.
Coping skills help you handle daily stress and build-up of stress. When exploring coping skills, do things that add to your life, not take away. For more information, check out How to Cope With Emotional Pain.

, One way to get control of your mind is to use meditation. While your body may be turned on, it’s your mind that makes the decision to consume pornography. Be the master of your mind by practicing meditation. Meditation can help you avoid impulsivity and find more balance between your mind and body.When you get an urge, begin to breath deeply. Close your eyes and begin to relax your body and your mind. Allow your thoughts to ‘think’ for a bit, then gently push them out of your consciousness and focus on your breath. Any thoughts that come up can be acknowledged, then sent off. Focus primarily on observing your breath. Reach a place of deep relaxation.
Many types of meditations exist. You can focus on clearing your mind, or you can place your focus on one word or phrase, such as “I love myself.”
Meditation is most effective when practiced regularly, on a daily basis.For more information on how to meditate, check out How to Meditate for Beginners

Create a pornography free environment.,
Use your imagination.,
Masturbate.,
Resolve feelings related to intimacy.,
Strengthen your romantic relationship.,
Believe in yourself.",How to Substitute Pornography2," Set yourself up for success by removing any temptations to watch pornography. Delete any files you have on your computer, recycle magazines, and block websites online. If having your computer in your room is tempting, only use the computer in public places or for limited amounts of time each day. You can even adjust your browser settings to block pornographic websites. Reduce any risks that may stand out to tempt you.


Anticipate any problems and pay close attention to your surroundings to avoid compulsion.Adjust your search engine settings. Sometimes an internet search may lead to unintentionally stumbling across pornographic images or websites.

, Pornography is scripted and often predictable. When you feel turned on, allow your mind to take over instead of pornography. You get to be the creator of your own fantasy using your imagination. Unlike porn, you can create whatever thoughts and images you desire in whatever way you fantasize.


Let your imagination run wild. It can be freeing to be the master of your own sexuality and not rely on outside sources.

, Masturbation is normal and nearly all humans engage in masturbation during their lives. Focusing on your own body during masturbation (and not on porn) can help you discover your likes and dislikes and help you learn your body. Masturbation can also help you know what will make you feel good with a partner.Instead of pointing your attention to pornography, turn your attention to your own body. Pay close attention to what brings you pleasure and what you enjoy, not just what your body is reacting to on a screen.
Be mindful while you masturbate. Get out of your mind and focus on the sensations within your body. Don’t allow your mind to be distracted, but stay present with your body’s sensations., You may avoid intimacy with another person and replace it with pornography. Consider seeing a therapist to discuss feelings of intimacy and how to resolve them.The fear of being intimate with someone may be so great that you avoid it and use pornography instead. Whatever the case, discover any blocks you have, and consider discussing them with a therapist.


If you experienced trauma, especially sexual trauma, it may be beneficial to see a therapist and help you overcome feelings related to experiencing the trauma.

, If your sexual relationship with your partner is unfulfilling, it may be due in part to pornography. After all, consuming pornography is linked to lower intimacy in couples.Instead of placing your attention on pornography, give your partner attention.


Don’t look to pornography as a “how-to” guide. Ask your partner about sexual preferences and learn to be adventurous in person.
Spend quality time with your partner and do things that you both enjoy together. You can make dinner together, read a book together, or take daily walks together. Do activities that engage you in conversation and where you can enjoy each other’s company.

, Know that you can change your habits and feel good about it. There’s no need to live in shame or guilt; be ready for the change and follow through on what you want different in your life.

Only you can know how much is too much, because there's no objective number of hours or times in a week that signals ""Addiction."" Learning to recognize the warnings signs and using your own judgment is important.;
, It may be nearly impossible for the average person to stop watching porn right in the middle of a steamy scene, but if you wake up in the morning determined not to watch porn and absolutely can't go a day, or even a few hours, without watching porn, then you may be addicted. Wanting to stop and not being able to stop is a problem.

, If you find yourself thinking about porn whenever you're in class, during work, or even when you're hanging out with friends, and planning when to watch it, the situation is serious. It's okay to occasionally think of porn, but if you feel like you're always thinking about it when you're not near a computer, then you have a problem.


If you look at porn every single time you're on your personal computer, or if you have an urge to look at porn when you're on a public computer at a library, or on a friend's computer, then you have associated computers with porn. This means you'll need to learn to distinguish the two as you learn to heal.

, Are your personal relationships suffering as a result of your relationship with porn? If you have trouble in the bedroom because you can only get aroused when you're watching porn, or if you'd rather be watching porn than hanging out with your latest crush, then you have a situation on your hands.


Remember that your porn addiction can be a sign of larger problems in your life, such as sex addiction or depression.

, Instead of just trying to quit watching porn because you think it's embarrassing or socially unacceptable, you should dig deeper to find the reasons that watching porn has had an adverse effect on your life, and think about how stopping your activity can help improve your situation. Here are some great reasons to stop watching porn:


Because you want to return to having healthy, loving relationships with your friends, significant others, and family.
Because you want to be able to live in the moment instead of in front of your computer screen.
Because you don't want to be a slave to your addictions.
Because you're losing sleep, forgetting to eat, and feeling sick because of your problem.
Because you feel that you've lost your self-respect, your dignity, and your control over your own life.

, Though many people spend most of their days in front of a computer, there are ways to make it harder for yourself to access porn. Once you're only watching it two or three times a day, put up a porn blocker on your computer, like K9 web protection, which blocks porn. That way, you'll have to go through a longer process to turn it off. This may make you less motivated to watch porn.


Avoid surfing the Internet as much as possible and use the computer in the presence of others. Avoid closed spaces and time alone on the computer.
If you can, turn off your wireless Internet unless you really need it. Create a somewhat elaborate ritual to make it difficult for you to turn your Internet back on, like a long and complicated wireless password, or make yourself do the dishes every time you want to turn on your Internet.
Porn addictions develop partly because porn is so easy to access---if you make it harder for yourself to watch it, you may not want to do it as often.

, If watching porn is taking up a large portion of your day, then it's likely that it'll be nearly impossible to stop watching it completely. Instead of quitting cold turkey, create a plan to slowly curb your addiction. Here's how:


First, work on limiting the amount of time you spend watching porn by masturbating quickly. Turn it on, turn yourself on, and turn it off.
Next, limit the amount of times you watch porn a day. If you watch it five times a day, try to get to no more than once a day by the end of the week. But be careful not to turn this into another kind of obsession.
Reward yourself for good behavior. If you go a day without watching porn, eat your favorite dessert or give yourself a small gift, like the pair of shoes you've had your eye on.

, Your porn addiction may have begun because you were lonely, bored, and couldn't think of anything better to do. Now it's time to take your life into your own hands by creating a meaningful routine that will minimize the amount of time you have to watch porn. Here's how:


Exercise. Pick up a new love for jogging, hiking, or team sports. Doing something physical will not only keep you away from the computer, but you'll feel better about yourself in the process.
Develop hobbies that keep you away from the computer. Paint outdoors, take up photography, or spend time reading in a park. Do whatever you can to make your life away from the computer meaningful., Spending time with close friends or a significant other will give you more confidence, and will keep you away from that computer screen. Getting to know and love someone on an intimate level may make porn seem less alluring.


Create a schedule for yourself. Keep yourself occupied by trying to fill as many hours of your day as possible. Make the schedule as soon as you wake up, so you know that there will be no time in your day for porn.

, When you've started cutting back, be very careful to avoid backsliding into your addiction again. If you've got it down to once a day, don't over-celebrate. Decide what your ultimate goal is. Do you want to eliminate watching porn entirely?


Once you've started changing your relationship to it, set the ideal ground rules for your new life. Write them down. Consider sharing them with a close and understanding friend to help keep yourself accountable., You're most likely watching porn as a means to masturbate, and may be feeling ashamed about pleasuring yourself. However, masturbating is perfectly natural, while watching porn is an addiction that can be cured.


Don't be ashamed of masturbating. If you're an adolescent and are exploring the world of masturbation for the first time, you will be exceptionally curious about pleasuring yourself--and that's okay. Masturbating once or twice a day is a healthy way to relieve tension and to be in touch with your body.

, Even if your friend isn't able to help you find a new game plan, just having someone to talk to can make you feel less alone.

, If you've tried to stop watching porn on your own and have not been able to do it, you may need to seek outside help. Though you may be embarrassed to discuss the situation with another person, in the long run, you won't regret reaching out. Here are some places to turn to:


Find help on the Internet. Research the topic and see what other people who suffer from similar problems recommend. But if spending time on the Internet is triggering your porn watching, then minimize your online time, or do it with a friend.
Join a 12-step program. Find support through programs in your area that can help you fight your problem. You'll gain invaluable knowledge and will feel comforted by the fact that there are others with your problem.
Know that many recovery programs are religious in nature. It can be a powerful way to change the trajectory of your life, but do your research so you know what you're getting into.

This also helps with the practical task of installing anti-porn software, without you yourself knowing the password.;
, As long as this material is around, falling back into the habit will be easy. Delete pornographic files on your computer and mobile devices. Throw away pornographic magazines, discs, and all other pornographic material.

, There are many programs available, but in most cases you will need a friend to create the password for you in secret, so you are not able to bypass the block. Here are a few good options:Qustodio has an extensive array of options, and works on just about any computer and mobile device, except for Linux. Free and premium versions are available.
On a Windows computer, you can use Microsoft Family Safety for free.

Norton Family Online is a free option for Windows, Android, and iOS. Try additional features with a 30-day free trial of the premium version.

Covenant Eyes, a Christian company, offers a service for $10/month for computers and mobile devices, and can prevent even the account owner from bypassing the protection.

, If you're likely to spend your time trying to circumvent your site-blocking software, stop the attempt in advance by turning off the WiFi or unplugging your Ethernet cable from your computer or mobile device whenever you aren't using the internet for other purposes.


If no one else is using the network, unplug or turn off your router or modem as well. The more steps it takes to get back online, the less likely you are to give in during a moment of weakness.

, If you spend your free time bored and alone, the temptation to seek out porn will be more difficult to resist. Find something else to occupy yourself.



Start a daily exercise routine. Because exercise releases endorphins and other ""feel good"" chemicals, many people use it to compensate when quitting an addiction.Take a vacation or a weekend trip to begin your effort. Habits are often easier to change when accompanied by a change in environment or circumstances.Ask a friend to introduce you to his hobby. Social activities automatically introduce you to a person or group encouraging you to stick with the change, even if she doesn't know your reasons for picking up the hobby.

, Pornography and sex are charged subjects, and there is no consensus among psychologists or medical experts on the effects of porn or whether a porn habit should be described as an addiction. That said, the following warning signs should tip you off that your pornography habit is something to take seriously:You find it difficult to cut back on your pornography viewing.
You lie about the amount of pornography you watch.
Your relationships, job, or studies have taken a backseat to pornography.
You prefer watching pornography to sex.

, Keep a notebook to write in any time you crave pornography or watch it. Write down a description of the scene directly before the craving started, including your mood, what you were doing, and how you were feeling that day. Stress, lack of sleep, friends who engage in or talk about porn, or easy access to pornography are all possible triggers.

, When possible, avoid triggers altogether. If seeing semi-erotic TV ads is a trigger, avoid watching programs that may have that kind of content. If it's your commute past the local college campus, drive another way. If you cannot reasonably avoid a trigger, plan in advance how you will thwart the triggers effect on you.


If the trigger is unavoidable, make a mental plan in advance for what you will do in that situation. Picture yourself ignoring the trigger, thinking of what to make for dinner instead, or leaving the computer and taking a walk outside.
Carry around distracting items such as an exciting book or a puzzle collection., If you are sexually or romantically frustrated, try seeking a relationship or a more casual sexual relationship. If you are trying to stop watching porn because of its unrealistic depictions of sex and bodies, or how it teaches you to treat sexual partners, consider watching non-mainstream porn that tries to address these issues, such as the videos awarded a Feminist Porn Award.

, If attempting to quit pornography on your own is too difficult or causing too much stress in your life, seek advice from a professional therapist or a 12-step program.Therapy is especially important if you have experienced sexual or physical abuse in the past, or suffered from depression or anxiety.


If you have an unsatisfying sexual relationship with a partner, consider attending sexual satisfaction counseling together. One study shows that even ordinary relationship counseling can improve a sexual relationship."

When you have multiple windows open, your attention gets scattered, and you get pulled into the immersive experience you’re having with your screen. Keep your screen simple and clean as a way to keep yourself focused and aware of what you’re doing and how you’re spending your time.


Add only those websites to your aggregator that you absolutely need to keep tabs on. Don’t fill your mind with unnecessary information.
Only have one program open unless you actually need to use multiple programs.
Only have one tab open on your web browser at a time.

, You may have accounts with websites that you never use, but which email you endlessly trying to remind you to use their service. You don’t need that temptation, so just delete all the accounts you don’t use and unsubscribe from their email listservs. You should also take a look at the accounts that you use too much. Are you spending valuable work time on Facebook or Instagram? Even if you love them and use them often, it may be in your best interest to delete those accounts, or at least deactivate them for a time until you get your internet usage under control.


You may need some of these sites for work — for example, Myspace if you’re a musician — so don’t delete an account that you actually need. You might get a co-worker or friend to maintain that account until you can handle the responsibility.

, Change the app settings on your phone to prevent immediate notifications. Set a schedule in which you allow yourself to manually check email and social media once every two hours or so.

, Relapse rates are high for addicts with chemical addictions like nicotine or alcohol, as well those with behavioral or procedural addictions like gambling, shopping, or internet addictions.Instead of trying to quit cold turkey, make a plan to scale back your internet usage in a manageable way, so you don’t feel overwhelmed by the sudden loss of an important part of your life.


Set manageable goals. If scaling back to one hour a day is your ultimate goal, maybe start with three hours a day.
When you feel comfortable with one step down, reduce your daily allotment by half an hour. Keep scaling back your internet usage until you reach your goal.

, After you’ve made your plan, you need to stick to it, and you can’t do that unless you’re keeping careful track of how much time you’re spending on the internet. If you’re allowing yourself three hours a day at first, you might break that up into three sessions that are one hour each. If that’s the case, make sure to set a timer to let yourself know when your hour is up each time you sit down at your computer.

Most phones have a timer app on them.

, You addiction may be so heavy that you don’t trust yourself to stick to the schedule you’ve set for yourself. If that’s the case, there are programs you can install that will limit your internet time for you. The program called Freedom will block you from the entire internet for up to eight hours at a time, whereas Anti-Social will block only social media sites like Facebook.If you don’t trust yourself not to just turn those programs off, purchase one that requires a password to disable its settings, and have a friend set up the password. Choose a friend you trust not to give you the password!

, You need to find a positive outlet for all the pent-up mental energy you’ll have once you stop using the internet so much. Throwing yourself into your studies or your work with renewed energy is a great way to keep your mind occupied while improving your results and your relationships at work! You’ll be amazed by how much your productivity will improve when you redirect your attention to tasks that matter more in the long run.

, Talk to them about the problems you’ve been having with your internet usage, and ask them to spend more time with you. Instead of chatting with them online, invite them over to your house for dinner, or go meet up with them for dinner and drinks. Your friends and family will serve as your support system, filling in those hours where you’d normally be mindlessly clicking through the internet. Not only will you be distracted from the computer, you’ll also be improving your relationships with the people most important to you.

, There’s a whole world of activities you can enjoy outside of the internet! Make yourself a promise that you will use your computer only for work, and find recreation elsewhere.Get out of the house, away from your temptations.


Take up walking or jogging.
Join a recreational sports league — soccer, basketball, football, whatever you enjoy the most!
Join a book club.
Start a band with some friends who share your taste in music.
Take up knitting or crocheting.
Start gardening
Prepare home-cooked meals that taste delicious, save money, and eat up your spare hours, when you’d normally be surfing the internet!

Use an app to track spending and spot bad habits.,
Look for small transactions that add up.,
Identify unnecessary spending daily.",How to Spot Unhealthy Spending Habits1," There are all sorts of apps designed to help you keep track of your spending. These can be useful to help spot spending habits that you might want to adjust.The Level app, for instance, links to your bank accounts and tracks your electronic spending. It’s designed to help you learn how to save, and helps point out spending habits that are keeping you from doing so.
Mint is another money management app app that helps you budget. Again, you can sync the app with your bank accounts, and Mint will monitor and categorize your spending for you.;
, When you’re looking at your bank account or otherwise reviewing your spending, look for recurring expenses that you may not think about. The classic example is a morning cup of coffee.While a couple dollars might not seem like much each time to make the purchase, you may be spending a substantial amount of money on something each week without realizing it.

, Use an app or carry a small paper pad with you at all times and keep a list of all of the purchases you make. Write out your expenses each night on paper or review the notepad and circle any spending that wasn't a necessary expense.Ideally, try to get in the habit of writing down purchases before you actually make them. This can help force you to evaluate each purchase before you make it.

"
"
Check your financial transactions weekly.,
Categorize your purchases to spot excessive spending.,
Reflect on each purchase you made.,
Review your monthly subscriptions regularly.",How to Spot Unhealthy Spending Habits2," You won’t be able to spot bad spending habits if you don’t look at what you’re spending money on. Get in the habit of checking your account summaries online as often as possible and reading the description of each purchase.If you have a debit card that is associated with an online bank account, consider using it for every purchase you make. This way, the online account will automatically keep a record of every purchase you make.
Look for recurring purchases you might be able to eliminate, like fast food purchases on your way home from work.
Checking weekly is usually ideal, as purchases will still be fresh in your mind.

, Start keeping track of how much you spend on different categories of items. For instance, every time you check your bank accounts or credit statements, add different types of purchases together. This will help you identify types of spending you may be doing too much.For instance, open up a spreadsheet and list all of your food purchases in one column, clothing purchases in another, and any other category that makes sense.
Manually keeping track will make you more aware of how often you make certain types of purchases and motivate you to address the habit.

, As you review your expenses, make a point of assessing each item you purchased. This may be especially effective after grouping purchases together. For instance, ask yourself things like, “Can I afford to spend $40 a week on pizza considering my income?”

Reflecting in this way can help identify specific unhealthy spending habits.
After a while, try to get in the habit of asking yourself, “Do I actually need this?” before every purchase you make.

, Many people pay monthly subscriptions for services they don’t use enough to justify paying for. If you're doing so, this is a sign you have an unhealthy relationship with spending.When you are reviewing your financial accounts and come across subscription fees, reevaluate whether you’re actually getting your money’s worth and cancel any subscriptions you don’t need or can’t afford.

Address a potential spending addiction.,
Spot fees on your credit card statements.,
Note banking fees.",How to Spot Unhealthy Spending Habits3," Otherwise known as “emotional spending,” it's possible to become addicted to spending. If you find yourself buying new outfits or eating out impulsively, consider seeing a psychologist to help identify ways to address this issue.Indicators that you may have a spending addiction include any unnecessary purchases beyond your financial means.
For instance, if you're buying new shoes on credit because you don't have the cash, especially when you already have plenty of shoes, this is a sign you need to get your spending habits under control.

, In addition to your purchases, you may be spending a considerable amount of money on fees and interest if you use a credit card. Paying your bill late, for instance, is not only expensive - it's also a sign you're spending beyond your means.Keep in mind that paying off your credit card every month is extremely important for your long-term financial standing.

, Another unhealthy spending habit is overdrawing your accounts. If you consistently do so, this is a certain indication that you are spending too much. Fortunately, you can avoid the fees associated with overdrawing accounts at most financial institutions by setting up “low balance” alerts at a specified amount.For instance, set up your online account to send you a text when your balance falls below $50. Contact your financial institution directly to find out what options you have.

Put your phone away an hour before you go to sleep.,
Carry your phone in your bag or pocket.,
Have set times where you are away from your phone.,
Pretend like your cell phone is a home phone.",How to Stop a Texting Addiction (Teens)1," Staring at a screen right before you try to go to sleep is going to make it more difficult to fall asleep. An hour before you go to sleep, text anyone you are talking to that you are going to sleep. Then take your phone out of your room and put it somewhere where it is safe, but far away from you. Don’t try to sleep with it right next to your head because you will spend more time focused on who might be texting you than sleeping.If you normally use your phone as an alarm clock to wake you in the morning, it's time to invest in an alarm clock instead.;
, When you take your phone with you places, don’t carry it in your hand. Put your phone somewhere where you can’t see it. This is especially important when you drive. Texting and driving is very dangerous to you and everyone you share the road with. Make sure your phone is hidden away when you drive so you are not tempted to look at it and text., Think of the best times of the day for you to not be on your phone texting (at work, at school, when you do your homework, etc.) and make it a “no phone time.” Turn your phone completely off and put it away somewhere where you can’t get to it for a few hours. Forcing yourself to do this daily will allow you to be more productive and help train your brain to not get anxious when you are not on your phone.


Designate certain periods of the day where it is okay to be on your phone and try to stick to only those times to text.You might want to hand your phone to a parent during these times and ask them to give the phone back at the end of ""no phone time.""

, Probably one of the major reasons you are addicted to texting is because you can take your phone with you anywhere. Try pretending like your cell phone is a landline phone. Place it in one spot in your house and always leave it there and only use it there, instead of taking it with you everywhere you go.You can do this for a little while to train your brain not to check your phone constantly and then eventually start bringing it places with you again.

Find a good texting balance.,
Explain to your friends that you are trying to quit texting.,
Make phone calls.,
Have face-to-face interactions.,
Take a break from socializing.",How to Stop a Texting Addiction (Teens)2," You don’t need to lose friends or damage relationships because you are trying to text less. You can still respond to texts and have social interactions with your friends, just try to limit yourself. Use your phone as a resource to make plans and keep in touch, but not as an activity that consumes your life.

, Tell your friends, family, and boyfriend or girlfriend to only text you if it is important. Ask them to only text you if something important comes up or they want to make plans to see you. Tell your friends not to text you just to talk too much while you are trying to fix your texting addiction. Explain to your friends you are going to be slower at replying because you are trying to use your phone less.


Say something like: “I am trying to text less and need your help. Please only text me if it is important or you are trying to make plans with me, not just to talk. This will really help me get over my texting problem! I will also reply slower than usual"".

, Just because you are trying to text less does not mean you have to miss out on socializing with your friends. Instead of texting your friends to make plans or to catch up, call them. This will allow you to still be in the loop, but not feed into your texting addiction. A quick phone call can contain as much information as 30 minutes of texting and can help you to not addictively stare at your screen all day.

, Force yourself to set your phone aside and focus on the world and people around you. Instead of texting through dinner, put your phone down and ask your parents about their day. Talk to your friends and family in person more often. Instead of texting your friends all day, text them once asking if they want to hang out. Then you can talk to them all day in person instead of over the phone.


Don’t hide behind your phone in uncomfortable social situations. Instead of using your phone as a safety net, try putting it away and talk to the people who are around you., Even if you are a social butterfly, sometimes you should put your phone away and take a break from people. Read a book, study, lay in the grass outside, or watch a show instead of texting. Think of your break from texting as an opportunity to not have to worry about what your friends and family are doing all the time and to just focus on yourself.

Ask your parents to monitor your texting.,
Change your phone plan.,
Delete texting apps off of your phone.,
Turn off the internet.,
Disable notifications.",How to Stop a Texting Addiction (Teens)3," Recruit your parents to help you with your texting addiction. Explain to them that you are trying to text less and that you want them to monitor your usage. It might seem embarrassing or childish to ask your parents for help, but if they help you set ground rules and stick to them it will help you text less. You can also ask them to get mad or even punish you if they see you texting too much or if the number of texts you send each month does not go down.You could even make a deal where you have to pay them a certain amount for each text, and the money goes into a college account.

, You, or your parents, can change your phone plan so you text less. If you have an unlimited phone plan, you’re more likely to text too much. Change your phone plan to allow fewer texts and fewer data per month. This is a good way to force yourself to text less.

, Apps such as Kik, WhatsApp, and Facebook Messengers will only feed into your addiction since they can be used for free with Wi-Fi. Delete all of the messaging apps that you can off of your phone. You won’t be tempted to use them if they are not on your phone.

, Texting with an iPhone uses an app called iMessage. This uses the internet to text. Many other texting apps also use the internet to text. Turn your Wi-Fi off for at least some of the day so you are not tempted to text. Go into your phone settings and turn off your cellular data too. This way you will have no way of receiving and sending text messages through the internet.

, Although you will probably still feel the need to check your phone obsessively, turn off all texting notifications on your phone. On many phones you can make it so your phone does not make any noise, so nothing pops up on your screen, and even so there is no way of knowing at all that you got a new message unless you go into the texting app."

Get some alternative medical support, in how you can rid yourself of the diaper addiction.,
Seek out support groups that deal with your addiction.,
Don't allot yourself any money to buy new packages of diapers.

,
Dispose of any of the previously-used, old diapers that you may have worn or are happening to wear as you read this article, and convert over to underwear or cloth diapers.,
Fire any caregivers you may have hired during your disposable-diaper wearing time.,
Find caring people that can understand your story and help you grieve over your medical problem.,
Find alternative hobbies that can easily take the place of the times when your diaper would have been changed.,
Plan on using the bathroom more routinely, even when your bladder doesn't feel full at all, or even when it is completely empty and you know it.,
Get up several times at night to have ""trickle sessions"" in the bathroom where you can fully empty your bladder.,
Re-package and donate any of the remaining disposable diapers that haven't been worn or taken out of the package yet.",How to Stop an Adult Disposable Diaper Addiction," Be open to other ideas. Diapers aren't the complete answer to every problem faced, but will commonly be used to cover up the real underlying problem.;
, Talk with the group and tell them (either privately or during the meeting) about your problem.

,,


Not only will the wearer refuse to keep wearing a cloth diaper after their first use, but it will also require more than themselves to do, and after firing the caregiver, a cloth diaper change would be harder for the wearer to change themselves. If they don't get a diaper rash within the first two weeks while wearing the disposable diapers, the cloth will cause them great discomfort and cause them to give up their addiction to their diapers.

, You might get a bit emotional during this time, but you'll understand later that doing is will be for your own good.

, It's not easy to see something you've grown attached to, being lost or given away to some other place other than your residence especially when done for good measure. (Whether that measure was medical, emotional, or physical, this ""breakup"" is ""hard to do"".).

, Read a magazine or book, use the Internet during these times, or put together a model of some sort. Find something that can take your mind off your problem (of not wearing the diaper anymore).

, Urinating more often may lessen the amount of ""trickle-points"" and may make you not need to unconsciously urinate where and when no one else is around.

, Wear a bedwetting alarm that will beep and make a loud noise when it feels urine starting to trickle out, especially after the first few nights of not wearing the diaper.

, Although not many nursing homes may need or want your remaining diapers, you may contact them and tell them that they are unused and can be used on their residents, and that you would be willing to give the unused ones to them.

Scroll through your images and count your selfies.,
Notice if you take several selfies a day with your cellphone.,
Check if you obsess over your selfies.,
Ask your friends if they think you have a problem.",How to Recognize a Selfie Problem1," Go through your cellphone images and add up how many selfies you have saved in your phone. If you have more than five to ten within a two week period, you may have a selfie problem.


You may also notice that you only have photos of yourself or very few photos of other people besides yourself. This could be a sign that you are only using your cellphone to take pictures of yourself, rather than document others around you or events that happen in your life.;
, Try to keep track of how many selfies you take a day. Notice if you take one selfie a day, such as right before you leave for work or for school, or if you take multiple selfies a day, such as once in the morning, once in the afternoon, and a few times a night. This may be an indication that you are taking a lot of selfies every day., You should consider how you view your selfies, especially if you take a lot of them. Maybe you enjoy how you look and want to share your appearance with others. But if you find yourself critiquing how you look in your selfies, you may not be comfortable with your appearance and this could be unhealthy.Ask yourself several questions, such as: Do I appreciate how I look my selfies? Do I manipulate my selfies with filters or settings on my phone to make myself look a certain way? What do the selfies mean to me? What purpose do they serve?

, You may need some perspective on your selfie habits to determine if you have a problem. Ask your friends if they feel like you take a lot of selfies on your phone and if they think you may have an addiction to selfies. You may also ask your friends if they feel you only use your cellphone for selfies and not for other things, as this could be a sign of a selfie addiction.


Try to ask friends that will be honest and upfront with you. Be willing to accept their feedback and listen to what they have to say. Getting an honest, outside perspective can help you determine if you are a little too into selfies.

Notice if you post a lot of selfies every day.,
Pay attention to how often you check your selfie posts.,
Determine if your selfie habit is distracting you from your commitments.",How to Recognize a Selfie Problem2," You should look at your social media habits and consider if you post a lot of selfies on social media every day. Though taking selfies on your phone may be enough for you, you may feel compelled to share it on social media with others. Too many selfie posts can be a sign that you are addicted to taking them and sharing them for others to see.


You may scroll through your social media pages to see if many of your posts or the majority of your posts are selfies. This could be a sign that you are a little too into posting selfies and sharing them with others.

, You should also be mindful of how often you click open your social media and check your selfie posts. Are you constantly looking at Facebook or Instagram to see if your selfie post got enough likes? Are you upset when your selfies do not get as many likes or comments as you hoped? These could be signs that you have an unhealthy relationship with selfies and social media.You may start a tally of how often you check your selfie posts during one day. If you check your selfie posts more than one to two times a day or feel you are checking them compulsively, you may have a selfie problem.

, You should also consider how your selfie habit affects you commitments and daily routine. Notice if you are coming up short on your commitments because you are too busy trying to get the perfect selfie. You should also recognize if your selfie habit is distracting you from getting things done in your daily routine or taking up time in your day that should be spent on other commitments or tasks.For example, perhaps you notice that you spend 30 minutes trying to get the perfect selfie in the morning before school to post on social media. You may realize that by the time you get the perfect selfie, you have missed your bus or end up late for your first class. This could be a sign that your selfie habit is taking up too much of your time.

Limit the number of selfies you take a day.,
Take pictures of other things besides yourself.,
Use social media in a different way.",How to Recognize a Selfie Problem3," You can address your selfie problem by trying to limit the number of selfies you take per day. Aim to reduce your selfies to one or two a day, especially if you find yourself taking quite a few on a regular basis. This can help you address your selfie issue and still enjoy them, but in a more controlled, reduced way.Perhaps you avoid taking selfies at all for several days in a row to see if you can limit the number of pictures of yourself you take. Or maybe you allow yourself to take one selfie in the morning and no more.

, Try shifting your attention from pictures of yourself to pictures of other things around you, such as your friends, your family, or individuals on the street. You may end up enjoying taking pictures of others so much that you are able to let go of the compulsion to take pictures of yourself.


You may also find that you enjoy taking pictures of landscapes or interesting objects around you. Turn your camera on the environment around you and channel your creativity into taking interesting images of things around you, rather than just yourself.

, You can also deal with a selfie addiction by using social media in other ways beyond just a space to post selfies. Try posting inspirational quotes or personal thoughts on social media instead of a selfie. Or, post articles or essays that you find interesting on your social media to share with others. Sharing and posting information beyond a selfie can help you let go of your need to take selfies on a regular basis.


You may also try expressing yourself by posting your favorite music or images of your favorite artist. This could be a more interesting way to express yourself on social media, rather than post multiple selfies.

Talk to your child about their TV habits.,
Set a schedule.,
Encourage your child to do something more productive, rather than TV.,
Create barriers as needed.,
Encourage your child to read.,
Let your child write their own story.,
Encourage your kids to draw.,
Go on a ""field trip."",
Distract your child.,
Do not let your child watch TV while eating dinner, doing homework, doing chores, etc.,
Hide the remote, or take the batteries out of it.",How to Stop a TV Addiction (for Kids)," The success of this depends on their age: if they're very young, you may just need to set some limits and rules, rather than engaging them in the process. If they're old enough to want to partake in the planning, ask them what they think a regular amount of TV viewing is, and explain your concerns to them. Try to reach a compromise on how much screen time is a good idea - but if you need to, set the limits yourself. You are the parent, after all.;
, Consider mapping out a schedule on a white board or calendar. You might limit their viewing to certain days of the week, or limiting the time they watch, such as ten or twenty minutes.

, It's a good idea for them to do chores or homework, but they can also enjoy playing board games, doing activities outside, and socializing with friends. Try to make the alternatives really fun at first, to help your child transition into watching less TV.


Do not let them watch TV while they are doing or working on homework, chores, etc. If you do that, your child will get distracted, sit down on the couch, and watch.

, Instead of turning the TV off, consider unplugging it instead, because kids can turn on the TV, but some know how to plug back in the TV. Put something to block the way if your child knows how to do this so they can't do it. Consider using a cloth or board to block the actual view of the TV itself, if seeing it there and turned off is disturbing to them., Reading books is one important part of learning. Go to the library with your child and read books over there. Read as many books as possible to stay away from TV as much as possible. Once you're done at the library, take a few books home to read. Pick books your child likes and that are for children, and make sure they are exciting and fun too. Children usually like exciting books.

, After reading a book your child likes, help them get ideas from it so they could write their own story. Writing is almost similar to reading, but means that your child is creative author.

, Kids sometimes love to draw. Give them crayons, paper, and a pencil.

, Get away from the living room and out of the house. Take them out somewhere to have a lot of fun, such as a park or carnival. Let play all the games, eat a meal, ride on the rides, etc. Wherever you go, make this enjoyable for your child.

, If you have something really fun to do with your child, and he/she usually likes it, tell your child about it. They may get surprised, turn off the TV, and start doing the fun thing. Make sure it's a thing your child usually likes. Children usually like to play with fun things and have a good time.

, This is even worse when they watch while doing homework because TV usually keeps your child from doing homework. Whatever reason, do not let your child watch TV. Also no iPods, iPhones, or iPads or any other unnecessary distractions during homework.

, If you can't find the remote or it doesn't have batteries, you won't be able to turn on the TV. And that keeps you from watching it.


Keep batteries away from children, as they may have some kind of rust, and if children touch it, they may get poisoned.

Understand the simple staging process.,
Begin with the limited disease characterization.,

Look for signs of Stage III lung cancer.,
Categorize Stage IV lung cancer.,
Understand what TNM stands for.,
Define the tumor.,
Categorize the node.,
Define the metastases.,
Understand that lung cancer can be classified into types.,
Define non-small cell lung cancer.,
Know what small cell lung cancer is defined as.,
Be aware of what can cause lung cancer.",How to Stage Lung Cancer," Stages of cancer are used to define the size of cancer cells or tumors and indicate whether the condition has already metastasized to other parts of the body.


Stages are used to provide information necessary for determining the proper management for the particular stage of cancer.
Some health care practitioners utilize a very simple form of staging lung cancer (most specifically for small cell lung cancer) which separates the cancer into two stages.;
, This stage is characterized by the development of cancer cells just within one side of the lungs, in the lymph nodes near the lungs or in the fluids surrounding the lungs (pleural effusion).

, In this stage of lung cancer, the disease has already spread into the lymph nodes outside the lungs or into other organs of the body.

, Cancer cells are relatively small and are localized. No cancer cells are evident in any lymph nodes. This stage can be further broken down into:


Stage IA. The size of tumor is up to 3 centimeter (1.2 in) only.
Stage IB. Tumor size is between 3 to 5 centimeter (1.2 to 2.0 in). Cancer cells can be present in the main airway of the lung (bronchus) or in the membrane protecting the lung (pleura). The lung can also be partially collapsed.

, In this stage, the tumor size can be within 5 to 7 centimeter (2.0 to 2.8 in) but cancer cells are not apparent in any lymph nodes.


Alternatively, the tumor size may be 5 centimeter (2.0 in) or less but cancer cells are already seen in the lymph nodes near the affected lung.
In whichever case, cancer cells may have spread into adjacent structures of the lungs like the bronchus or pleura. The lung may be partially collapsed as well.

, This stage can be characterized by the following manifestations:


Tumor size is between 5 centimeter (2.0 in) and 7 centimeter (2.8 in), however cancer cells are already affecting the lymph nodes near the affected lung. Alternatively, the tumor size may be larger than 7 centimeter (2.8 in) but cancer cells are not evident in any lymph nodes.
In other cases, this stage may mean that tumor size is larger than 7 centimeter (2.8 in) but has already spread to other areas of the body such as the chest wall, diaphragm, mediastinal pleura and parietal pericardium or the phrenic nerve.
Cancer cells are larger than 7 centimeter (2.8 in) and are already affecting the main airway near the area where it divides to go into each lung.
Cancer cells are taking part in the collapse of the lungs.
Tumor can be in any size but there is more than one tumor in the same lobe of the lung.

, This stage is characterized by the total collapse of the affected lung or an accumulation of mucus that causes inflammation. This stage is subdivided into:


Stage IIIA. It can indicate variety of cases such as:

Tumor is bigger than 7 centimeter (2.8 in) and has already spread into the lymph nodes near the lungs.
Cancer cells already spread into the chest wall, diaphragm, or in the mediastinal pleura and parietal pericardium that covers the heart. Or in some instances, the cancer cells have spread into the lymph nodes near the main airway or in the middle of the chest on the same side of the damaged lung.
Cancer cell can be any size but have spread into other major structures involving the chest, esophagus, heart, larynx, main blood vessel, spinal bone and trachea. They may also be evident in the lymph nodes near the affected lung. Or in some cases, cancer cells are already affecting more than one lobe of the same lung and may have spread into the lymph nodes near the damaged lung.


Stage IIIB. This stage can denote:

Cancer cells have spread into the lymph nodes on the opposite side of the affected lung. Or cancer cells are found in the lymph nodes at the center of the chest and have spread into other areas such as the chest wall, diaphragm, mediastinal pleura and parietal pericardium or in other major structures in the chest like the esophagus, heart, main blood vessel and trachea



, This stage signifies that:


Cancer cells are already affecting both lungs.
Cancer cells have metastasized to other parts of the body like the liver or bones.
Cancer cells are causing fluid accumulation in the heart (pericardial effusion) and lungs (malignant pleural effusion).

, TNM stands for Tumor, Node and Metastases.

, Defining the tumor involves describing the size of the tumor, as follows:



T1: T1a. Tumor size is smaller than 2 centimeter (0.8 in) across and is contained within the lungs. T1b. Tumor size is between 2 centimeter (0.8 in) and 3 centimeter (1.2 in) across but it is still contained within the lungs.

T2: Tumor size is between 3 centimeter (1.2 in) and 7 centimeter (2.8 in) across or it can grow into the main bronchus more than 2 centimeter (0.8 in) below the area where it divides to enter each lung. Or in others, the tumor has developed into the inner lining of the chest cavity or it can take part into the collapse of the lungs. T2a: T2 tumors that are 5 centimeter (2.0 in) or smaller in size. T2b: T2 tumors that are larger than 5 centimeter (2.0 in) in size.

T3: Tumor size is larger than 7 centimeter (2.8 in) or has developed into other body structures such as the central lining of the chest cavity, chest wall, diaphragm, and pericardium. The tumor may contribute to the total collapse of the lungs. Or more than one tumor is present in the same lobe of the lung.

T4: The tumor may be apparent in other structures such as the esophagus, heart, major blood vessels, mediastinum, nerve that controls the voice box, spinal bone and trachea. Or more than one tumor is affecting one lobe of the same lung.

, Categorizing the node determines whether the cancer cells have spread into the lymph nodes near the lungs.



N0: Cancer cells are not found in any lymph nodes.

N1: Cancer cells are visible in the lymph nodes close to the affected lung.

N2: Cancer cells are present in the lymph nodes in the middle of the chest but on the same side as the damaged lung. Cancer cells may also affect the lymph nodes below the area wherein the windpipe branches off to each lung.

N3: Cancer cells affect the lymph nodes on the opposite side of the affected lung or develop in the lymph nodes in the collar bone and the top of the lung.

, This indicates whether the cancer cells have already spread into other parts of the body.



MO: No evident signs that cancer cells have spread into the opposite lobe of the affected lung or to any other parts of the body.

M1: M1a: Cancer cells are present in both lungs. The fluids around the lungs and heart also contain cancer cells. M1b: Cancer cells have already spread to other parts of the body like the bones and liver.

, Lung cancer can be classified into a number of different types based on the appearance of cancer cells under a microscope

, Eighty percent (80%) of lung cancers fall under this category. It can be further subdivided into:



Adenocarcinoma: A type of lung cancer that is commonly experienced by women and non-smokers. It forms in the mucus-producing glands of the lungs.

Bronchioloalveolar carcinoma: A very unusual type of lung cancer that develops near the air sacs of the lungs.

Large-cell undifferentiated carcinoma: A type of lung cancer that grows quickly near the outer edges or surface of the lungs.

Squamous cell carcinoma or epidermoid carcinoma: The most common type of lung cancer that usually affects the male population. It develops in the lining of bronchial tubes.

, Small cell lung cancer accounts for the remaining 20% of lung cancer incidents. It is comprised of small cells that reproduce abruptly and develop into large tumors that can spread throughout the body. Most cases are caused by smoking.

, Normally, all cells in the body undergo a systematic process of growth, division and death (apoptosis). Any breakdown of this orderly process usually indicates the formation of cancer cells. These cancer cells develop when a programmed death of cells do not push through but instead continues to grow and divide. This phenomenon leads to the build up of abnormal cells that mature uncontrollably. Lung cancer is typically associated with:



Carcinogens: Inhalation of carcinogenic substances usually leads to the development of lung cancers. Carcinogens are substances that are capable of damaging DNA thus promoting cancer. Examples include: arsenic, asbestos, compounds in car exhaust fumes, radiation (gamma and x-rays), sun, tobacco. Exposure to these carcinogens triggers the formation of free radicals that can damage body cells and affect their normal function and process of division.

Genes: Some cases of lung cancer are attributed to familial genetic predisposition to the disease. Certain individuals can inherit the disease if it runs within their family, while others can be born with specific genetic mutations for lung cancer that can progress later in life. Genetic predisposition can directly cause lung cancer or it can increase an individual’s risk for lung cancer.

Pray - Reconnect with life and that quiet but persistent voice inside you that is telling you to be more.,
Forgive Yourself - You may have asked for God’s help in the past and then turned it away because you did not feel worthy of it.,
Don't blame - Someone caught up in an addiction may not want to realize or own their choices and behavior.,
Practice trust - If you ask God for help, God does not forget about it, we do.,
Listen to your emotions - Emotions are the nerves to the soul.,
Don’t just focus on past problems - What you focus on, you will achieve and become.,
Focus on God, don't fight against Satan - Similar to the above step, be careful not to base your life only on the fear of some insidious disease.,
Don't confuse God's judgement with your own - Once you ask God to forgive you for the pain and hurt you caused by drinking and drugging, God does.,
Hold yourself accountable.- Don’t confuse your actions or the actions of others with faith or God’s desire or will to love or help you.",How to Regain a Sense of Faith and God in Addiction Recovery," Praying can help you by allowing you to remember the abilities and strengths you possess. If you are unsure how to pray or what to pray for, talk as if you are talking to a friend. Verbally processing issues can help in resolving them.;
, What you are doing is not trusting that God really forgave you because you have not forgiven yourself yet. This often happens when we are ""talking the talk"" but not ""walking the walk"". We cannot lie to ourselves and we know when we are actively engaged in change. You start to forgive yourself when you actually stop drinking or using drugs and start leading a healthy life.

, They may want to blame it on something or someone else. Faith and God take the excuses away. Faith and God do not avoid responsibility. They challenge us to a higher ideal, a higher belief, a higher dream. They are our potential for something more. Addiction is a selfish pull away from faith and God and does not acknowledge ownership of choices. A belief in faith or God is an acknowledgement of fault and a trust in the capabilities for something more.

, Practice trusting that faith and God will prevail. Trust may be difficult when you first stop your addiction as you are use to shutting others out and only trusting yourself in order to protect yourself from hurt. To regain trust, begin by allowing yourself to trust one person. Do this completely (whether it is your Mom, Grandparent, etc). What this will teach you is that everyone you give trust to won’t hurt you.

, Emotions may be scary and unfamiliar at first as you have covered them with drugs or alcohol for so long. Your emotions are essential in changing your life. They will tell you when your life is off course. Listen to them. If you are having negative emotions, look at them as a signal that change is needed.

, Do not allow past problems to define who you are. You are either moving toward a solution or still stuck on the problem. To focus on faith and God reflects what you want your life to represent and be about. Everyone makes mistakes, but you don’t have to focus on those mistakes for the rest of your life.

, To continuously focus on avoiding the drug or alcohol monster makes this monster even stronger. If you constantly focus on the past pain and troubles of your drinking or drug use, this is what your life will be about, the pain and troubles of the past. We are what we focus on.

, Once forgiven, God does not remember your past mistakes or sins. They are gone, forgotten. You have a clean slate. Holding on to past pain may give you the excuse to continue to drink or drug again. Watch how you judge yourself as you need room for growth which comes from faith and God and the belief in something more.

, You may feel that if you relapse you have failed or are unworthy of God’s help. Or you may only feel valued if you “follow the program”, remain sober or attend meetings. We are all different. We are all human and will make mistakes. Sometimes it is better to follow that voice that resonates deep within you than blindly follow someone else’s rules for “recovery”.

Keep your weight under control.",How to Survive Cancer," Some types of cancer (prostate, breast, lymphoma for examples) are best diagnosed with a minor biopsy procedure (taking a tissue sample with a long needle) to see if cancer cells are present.A biopsy is considered a diagnostic surgery — to see if the cancer cells can be detected.


Biopsies can not only detect if cancer cells are present in some area of the body, but they can also give your doctor an idea of cancer type and general degree of aggressiveness.
A biopsy procedure is fairly low risk for anything serious such as an infection, but bruising, tenderness (for a few days or more) and minor bleeding are common side effects.;
, Some types of cancer, such as squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, can be entirely removed and cured with surgery — so it's referred to as curative surgery.However, it's important to realize that most types of cancer cannot be entirely removed via surgery because cancer cells often spread throughout the body, which is called metastasis.


The best time to remove a cancerous tumor is in it's early stages before it spreads to other sites via the blood.
Preventive (prophylactic) surgery is done to remove tissue (such as the breast) that’s likely to become cancerous, despite not showing any signs of cancer.

, Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill or damage cancer cells in specific areas of the body by altering the genes (DNA) in the cells.It's one of the most common treatments for cancer (by itself or in combination with other therapies). Radiation can be very effective for lymphomas, lung cancer and various skin cancers, among others.


Radiation therapy doesn’t always kill cancer cells right away. Instead, it might take many days or weeks of treatment for the cancer cells to start dying.
Cancer cells may continue dying for months after the radiation treatments end.
Radiation can also burn healthy tissue and there's even a small risk of triggering cancer cells due to its ability to alter DNA, so talk to your doctor about the pros and cons of the therapy.

, Chemotherapy involves using medicines or drugs to kill cancer cells.Although surgery and radiation therapy kills or damages cancer cells in relatively specific areas, chemotherapy works throughout the entire body because the chemicals travel within the bloodstream. Chemotherapy can kill cancer cells that have metastasized far away from the primary (original) tumor.


Chemotherapy often shrinks tumors and/or stops cancer cells from dividing, but doesn't entirely get rid of cancer — it's controlled and managed as a chronic disease instead.
Chemotherapy is often recommended for lung, ovarian, pancreatic and blood cancers.
The problem with chemo is that it can also kill healthy cells in the body, which can lead to negative side effects.

, As scientists have learned more about the triggers for growth and spread of the various types of cancer cells, they've developed drugs that target the differences.As such, this drug-based treatment is typically called targeted cancer therapy. In essence, it's a more specific type of chemotherapy that generally leads to fewer and more mild side effects.


Targeted drugs can be used as the main therapy for some cancers, but typically they’re given along with standard chemotherapy, surgery and/or radiation therapy.
Much like standard chemotherapy, targeted therapy is given intravenously (directly into the veins) or as pills. However, targeted therapy tends to be much more expensive than regular chemo.

, A relatively newer type of cancer treatment that can increase your chances of survival is called immunotherapy, which uses certain parts of your immune system to combat cancer cells.This can be done by either boosting your own immunity to attack the cancerous cells or by giving your body immune system components, such as special proteins.


Some types of immunotherapy are also called biologic therapy, bio-therapy or cancer vaccines.
Monoclonal antibodies are immune system proteins that attack specific parts of cancer cells.
Immunotherapy works better for certain types of cancer at certain stages, so ask your doctor if it's a good option for your situation.

, Stem cell transplants can also be used to treat cancer and increase your survival rate. Stem cells are essentially immature (undifferentiated) blood cells found in your bone marrow and blood. However, these adaptable cells can mature into all types of different blood cells and help to treat or even cure various types of cancer. Stem cell transplants are also used to replace bone marrow and blood that's been destroyed by cancer, chemo and/or radiation therapy.


Stem cell transplants are most effective for cancers affecting your blood or immune system, such as leukemia, lymphoma and multiple myeloma.Stem cells can be donated from a donor (from their bone marrow) or gotten from fetal tissues.
The cost of a stem cell transplant is more than any other type of cancer treatment.

, In addition to getting treatment from a cancer specialist, another important factor in increasing your risk of survival is eating nutritious food. Your body, particularly your immune system, needs lots of vitamins, minerals, amino acids and healthy fats to fight cancer and other diseases.

Furthermore, fighting cancer (and other chronic diseases) requires lots of energy, so getting enough calories per day is also important.

A healthy cancer-fighting diet should include lots of fresh fruits and veggies (particularly ones rich in antioxidants, such as dark berries, grapes, broccoli and peppers), lean meat and fish, as well as fibrous whole grains.
Cancer tends to thrive on sugar, especially refined sugar, so avoid soda pop, milk chocolate, ice cream, candy, cakes, donuts and most desserts if your have cancer.

, Another way to boost your immune system and maintain a healthy weight is by getting regular (daily) cardiovascular exercise.However, exercising (and eating) might be difficult during some types of treatment, such as chemo. Great types of cardiovascular exercise for cancer patients include brisk walks, hiking, cycling, swimming and jumping on a trampoline.


Exercise also improves blood flow, strengthens bones and muscles, improves lung function, stimulates appetite, improves sleep and elevates mood — which are all factors important for surviving cancer.
Depending on the type and stage of cancer you have, some exercises may be inappropriate, so always okay any activity with your oncologist.

, One thing many long-term cancer survivors have in common is that they have friends and family they can depend on for emotional, spiritual and/or physical support.In contrast, being alone without anyone to confide in and get emotional support from significantly increases the risk of dying from all forms of cancer (and many other diseases).


Don't be ashamed or embarrassed by a cancer diagnosis and not tell friends and family. Instead, tell them immediately and allow them to digest the information and help in their own ways.
If you don't have or can't count on your friends or family, their are many cancer support groups to join, either in person or online. Ask your local hospital and church for information.

, Although many miracles are attributed to the power of positive thought, there's currently no scientific proof that a positive attitude (alone) gives you an advantage in cancer treatment or improves your chances of survival.However, a positive attitude can improve the quality of your life during cancer therapy and beyond, which makes surviving the disease more worthwhile.


A positive attitude is more likely to keep you physically active, maintain ties to friends and family and continue on with social activities, which are all tied to cancer survival.
A positive attitude also enables you to look at cancer as a hurdle or challenge to overcome, and not a death sentence to fear and dread.

, Perhaps the most important aspect of surviving cancer for the long term is getting regular check ups after the above-mentioned treatments have either ""cured"" your cancer or put it into remission. The main point of continuous follow-up care is to check if your cancer has returned or spread to other parts of your body.Frequent check ups (1-2x per year) can also help to find other types of cancer and detect any side effects from your cancer treatment.
Follow-up care typically involves seeing your family doctor or oncologist (cancer specialist) to review your medical history and get a physical examination, blood tests and/or imaging studies (x-rays, MRI, CT scan).

, Although the research is mixed in regards to if chronic stress can actually induce cancer or cause it to return directly, there's no question that long-term stress weakens the immune system and hampers its ability to fight cancer cells from developing.As such, combat stress in your life with stress-relieving practices such as yoga, tai chi, meditation, deep breathing techniques and positive visualization. Join a class at your local gym, church or community association and learn how to do these activities properly.


Deal with stressful situations head on, both at work and at home, and don't let them become chronic and negatively impact your health.
Chronic stress also increases the probability of certain behaviors developing that are linked to increasing the risk of cancer, such as smoking, drinking too much alcohol and overeating.

, Compared with people of normal weight, those who are overweight or obese are at greater risk for many diseases, including certain cancers — particularly cancer of the esophagus, pancreas, colon, rectum, breast, endometrium, kidney, thyroid and gallbladder.As such, keeping your weight down is one of the more important acts that increase your chances of surviving these cancers long term.


Long-term weight loss depends on two main factors: reducing your daily caloric intake from food along with regular daily exercise — even just 30 minutes of walking each day.
For most women, eating less than 2,000 calories per day leads to some weight loss every week even with light exercise. Most men will lose weight if they consume less than 2,200 calories per day.
To lose or maintain a healthy weight, eat lean meats and fish, whole grains, fresh veggies and fruit and drink lots of water. Avoid fast food, processed food, baked goods, candy, chocolate and soda pop.

"
Remember that early symptoms can be mild and vague.,
Be suspicious of a new cough that doesn't go away.,
Look out for unexplained weight loss and fatigue.,
Watch out for unexplained bone pain.,
Talk to your doctor about getting screened if you're at risk for lung cancer.,
Don't rely only on chest x-rays.,
Get a CT (computed tomography) scan for best results.,
Augment CT scans with a sputum test.,
Quit Smoking.,
Avoid secondhand smoke.,
Reduce your exposure to radon gas.,
Stay away from asbestos.",How to Screen for Lung Cancer," One of the reasons that lung cancer is so deadly is that the disease doesn't often cause noticeable symptoms during the early stages.Furthermore, the mild symptoms of early stage lung cancer are often mistaken for a cold, bout of the flu, bronchitis or asthma.


Common early signs of lung cancer (and most upper respiratory infections) include a mild, persistent cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, and weight loss.
Signs and symptoms of lung cancer usually become noticeable once the disease is advanced, which is why it's such as deadly disease.
The common cold, flu and bronchitis are viral infections that typically fade away two to three weeks, so if your symptoms persist, schedule an appointment with your doctor.;
, One of the telltale symptoms of lung cancer is the development of a persistent cough that's either completely new or noticeably different than the typical dry, hacking smoker's cough.In contrast to the dry and unproductive cough common with smokers, coughing up foul-smelling phlegm and even blood on occasion is not unusual with the mid-stages of lung cancer.


Due to the constant coughing and slow destruction of tissue in the lungs from lung cancer, chest pain invariably develops also.
Along with the coughing, wheezing and hoarseness are common with lung cancer too — but it's often misinterpreted as being either emphysema or asthma.
If you have a cold or flu and are full of phlegm you may need a chest x-ray. If you have a severe cold with purulent sputum, then the doctor will do a chest examination, such as an x-ray.

, Another telltale sign of later-stage lung cancer (and many other cancer types) is unexplained / unintended weight loss, which is known medically as cachexia.Cachexia is best described as wasting away and it occurs because the growth and spread of the cancer burns a lot of energy, so your muscles and fat stores waste away.


Unlike weight loss from dieting and exercising, cachexia leads to loss of muscle mass and a gaunt-like appearance — sunken eye sockets and cheeks, for examples.
Along with weight loss, chronic fatigue develops rather quickly with lung cancer because the lungs lose their ability to absorb oxygen and transfer it to the blood efficiently.

, A late-stage and very serious symptom of lung cancer is deep, achy bone pain, which usually indicates the cancer cells have spread (metastasized) to the skeletal system.The spine, ribs and skull are common sites of metastasis for lung cancer, which is often described as a constant, deep boring pain that can get worse at night while in bed.


If lung cancer spreads to the skull / brain, headaches, dizziness and nausea quickly follow.
Once lung cancer has spread to the bones and/or other organs, the chances of survival tend to plummet, even with intensive medical treatment.

, If you're a heavy smoker (or have a recent history of smoking), work with toxic / noxious material and are older than 55 years old, ask your doctor about yearly (annual) screenings for lung cancer.Getting screened typically means testing for the disease when there are no symptoms or history of lung cancer.


Heavy smoking means smoking at least a pack of cigarettes a day for more than a few years consecutively.
The goal of screening is to catch lung cancer early when it's most treatable and poses the least threat to life.
Lung cancer screening tests can suggest cancer when no cancer cells or tumor is present, which is called a false-positive result. False-positives lead to additional diagnostic tests and surgeries that are not needed and carry additional risks.

, Many decades ago, chest x-rays were considered the most hi-tech and best way to diagnose lung cancer, but in modern times it's recognized as being unreliable for screening purposes.Chest x-rays are pretty good at detecting larger tumors and masses in the lungs, but that's when the condition is already quite advanced, which defeats the purpose of screening. As such, x-rays should only be used to help confirm a diagnosis of lung cancer, not screen for it on a yearly basis.


Chest x-rays involve relatively high doses of radiation, which can increase the risk of lung cancer (and other cancers) developing over the course of many years.
X-rays visualize bone much better than soft tissue, so chest x-rays are more valuable for seeing if lung cancer has spread to the surrounding bones.

, According to medical authorities, the only recommended effective screening test for lung cancer is low-dose CT scans or LDCT.With an LDCT, a special x-ray machine controlled by a computer scans the chest area and uses relatively low doses of radiation to take detailed pictures of the lungs — both of the soft tissues and surrounding bones.


Annual screening with LDCT reduces the number of people who die from lung cancer, but only in very high-risk smokers and ex-smokers.LDCT screening is associated with a high number of false-positive results, which leads to unnecessary further testing and procedures.
LDCT takes place on a table that slides in and out of a large scanning machine. The detailed pictures are actually many ""slices"" of the chest area.

, Another type of test that can be used along with LDCT scanning (but not relied upon solely) is sputum cytology, which involves looking at a sample of your lung mucus (called sputum or phlegm) under a microscope for cancer cells.Collecting sputum is not difficult with chronic smokers and people with lung cancer, so no invasive procedures are needed.


Sputum cytology is used to check for signs of lung cancer, but it doesn't decrease the risk of dying from lung cancer when used solely as a screening tool.
Unlike chest x-rays and CT scans (even lose dose), sputum cytology doesn't expose the patient to any radiation. Furthermore, false positives are much more uncommon.
If the sputum does not uncover the etiology, then you may need bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar washings. This is when they put a tube in your trachea to get a specimen from the inner lung tissue for diagnosis.

, Your risk of lung cancer significantly increases with the number of cigarettes and cigars you smoke daily, as well as the number of years you smoke for.Quitting at any age can dramatically lower your risk of developing lung cancer — it's never a bad time to quit. Tobacco smoke contains cancer-causing compounds (carcinogens) that mutate lung cells into cancerous cells.


Quitting ""cold turkey"" is difficult for most people, so consider using nicotine patches or gum to wean yourself off the addiction.
Hypnotherapy can be very effective for quitting smoking, but it doesn't seem to work for everyone. Make sure to use a reputable hypnotherapist.
Try using the START acronym to help you on your way. START stands for “Set” a start date to quit smoking, “Tell” your friends and family for support, “Anticipate” difficulties and plan ahead, “Remove” all tobacco products from your car, house, and place of work, and “Talk” to your doctor about available treatment methods and support.

, Even if you're not a chronic smoker, your risk of lung cancer increases measurably if you're exposed to secondhand smoke on a regular basis.It's not as intense as smoking, but some of the carcinogens float in the air and can cause lung damage once you breathe them in.


Most restaurants in developed countries are non-smoking now, but avoid bars / nightclubs where smoking is still permitted.
Ask your friends and family member who are smokers to smoke well away from you and other non-smokers (especially children) — preferably outdoors in a well ventilated room or area.

, Radon gas is produced by the natural breakdown of uranium in soil, rock and water in the environment, which invariably becomes part of the air you breathe.However, unsafe levels of radon can accumulate in buildings and homes if they are near or built on uranium-rich soil — it can damage lung tissue. Radon gas cannot be seen or smelled by people, so it must be tested for by special (albeit affordable) equipment.


Buy a radon testing kit from a home improvement store and test your home and workplace — it can take a few weeks.
If unsafe levels of radon are discovered, remedies are available, such as insulating and ventilating the space that's affected.

, Exposure to asbestos is a known cause of cancer because it's a strong lung irritant that triggers a constant inflammatory reaction, and also leads to cellular mutation.Asbestos used to be used in insulation products and brake pads many years ago, although it's still used in some industrial applications. Be cautious if you live or work in an older building — made in the 1970s or earlier.


Asbestos lodged in lung tissue causes lung cancer, although when it gets lodged in the pleural lining it leads to a condition called mesothelioma.In addition to asbestos, workplace exposure to arsenic, chromium and nickel also increase your risk of lung cancer, especially if you're a smoker.

Examine your body.,
Track your changes on a mole map.,
Look for problem moles.,
Repeat the exam once a month.",How to Spot Early Signs of Skin Cancer1," The best way to find skin cancer early is to keep a check on any skin abnormalities through a monthly full body skin exam. Stand in front of a full length mirror. Examine the whole front of your body, checking each part of your body. Turn around and look over your shoulder, examining the back area of your body, paying special attention to the back of your legs. Next, raise your arms and examine your underarms, inner arm area, elbow, forearms, upper underarms, and palms.


Make sure you also look at the tops and bottoms of your feet.
Using a hand mirror, check your buttocks, genitals, neck, and scalp.
If there are areas you can’t reach, ask a loved one to help.;
, As you examine your body, track your moles on a mole map. This map needs to be a representation of your body, with a front and a back, so you can keep track of where all your moles are. Each month, pinpoint where your moles are and write down the general appearance of them.


The American Academy of Dermatology has a premade map that you can download every month as you do your examination., While making your examination, you need to watch for problem moles. You should notice is your moles change shape, size, or color, start to ooze or bleed, and feel itchy, swollen, or tender. To keep track of problem moles, you need to follow the ABCDE rule. The rules to notice melanomas are:


A: Asymmetry, when moles have different halves and one side looks different than the other
B: Borders, which tend to be ragged, irregular, or scalloped
C: Color, which can be different shades of brown, tan, red, or black, with rare ones turning white
D: Diameter, which tend to be larger than 6 mm
E: Evolving, which means they change size, shape, and color over time, In order to note the progress of your moles, you need to make sure you perform this examine once a month. This will ensure that you know how your moles are doing and you will be able to catch any changes as early as possible.


Create a new map every month so you can notice any changes."
"
Use sunscreen.,
Avoid peak sun exposure times.,
Wear protective clothing.,
Talk to your dermatologist.",How to Spot Early Signs of Skin Cancer2," You can help prevent skin cancer by wearing SPF. You should apply SPF 30 or more to any area of your body that will be exposed to the sun. Use about one ounce of sunscreen to cover your skin every time you apply it.


You can wear moisturizer with sunscreen on your face to help prevent clogging your pores., In order to help prevent skin cancer, you should avoid going outside during the times when the sun is at its peak. This is typically between the hours of 10 am and 2 pm. This is because the sun’s rays are most direct during this time of day.


If you have to be outside, try to stay in the shade as much as possible., When you are going to spend a long time in the sun, you should wear protective coverings over your body. This means you should wear long pants, long sleeve shirts, hats, and sunglasses.


This will limit unwanted UV radiation exposure to your skin., If you are not sure if your mole or skin area is skin cancer, make an appointment with your dermatologist. If you are at high risk, you should have regular exams with your dermatologist to keep track of it. If you have had severe sunburn recently, you may also need to get checked out.


If your dermatologist is worried about a mole, you may need a shave biopsy to check the tissue."

Recognize melanoma skin cancer.,
Notice non-melanoma skin cancer.,
Decide if you are at risk.,
Notice the causes of cancer.",How to Spot Early Signs of Skin Cancer3," Skin cancer can be divided into non-melanoma and melanoma skin cancers. Melanoma skin cancer is the dangerous kind. Your skin grows normally to naturally replace cells that die off. With cancerous cells, however, there is an uncontrolled growth of cells to form a solid tumor. These can be benign, which are not cancerous, or malignant, which are cancerous and can spread the cancer.Different types of melanoma skin cancer include:

Atypical moles, also known as dysplastic nevi, which are larger than normal moles (greater than ⅓ inch or greater than 8 mm), have irregular or non-smooth edges, and are often darker than normal brown moles
Actinic (solar) keratosis, which is a rough and scaly patch of skin that has often been exposed to the sun, most commonly found on the face, ears, lips, scalp, neck, back of your hands, and forearms, and that get bigger over time, Non-melanoma skin cancers are the most common forms of skin cancer. Almost all of these forms of skin cancer can be cured, with better chances of a cure arising if you spot them early. The different forms of non-melanoma skin cancer are:


Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC), which is commonly found on the head, face, arms, neck, and hands, looks like raised, small, pearly bumps, grows slowly and rarely spreads
Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC), which is found on the neck, face, arms, head, and hands, is scaly and rough, reddish in color, and rarely spreads to other parts of the body
Merkel Cell Carcinoma (MCC), which is a less common and very fast growing skin cancer, shows up as firm, shiny lumps on the skin with a reddish, pinkish, or bluish color, and do not hurt but may be tender to the touch
Cutaneous T cell Lymphoma, which starts in the blood, appears as scaly or bumpy patches on the skin, and is very slow growing
Kaposi’s Sarcoma, which is usually associated with HIV/AIDs, is purplish in color, and appears as a flat patch of skin or inside the mouth, nose, or throat, There are certain situations that make you more at risk for skin cancer. These will make you more susceptible to skin cancer, which means you need to be more careful with your skin and try as many of the preventative methods as possible. These risks include:


10 or more atypical moles, causing a higher risk of melanomaExcessive sun exposure
Blond or red hair
Blue or green eyes
Fair complexion
Family or personal history of melanoma
Excessive ordinary moles (more than 50) or having many freckles
Immunosuppressive disorders
Early childhood sunburns
Inability to tan
History of tanning bed useAdvanced age, There are a few causes of skin cancer, and some situations where the cause is unknown. The most common cause is excessive sun exposure, which is ultraviolet or UV radiation.

In other cases of skin cancer, the exact cause is unknown but is typically caused by a combination of factors that may include diet, genetic factors, lifestyle choices, viral infections, and environmental carcinogens.

The root of cancer is a genetic defect or mutation in the DNA that causes the cancer cell to lose control over its growth."

Listen.,
Give him space.,
Be encouraging.,
Communicate effectively.,
Acknowledge his feelings.",How to Support a Spouse With Prostate Cancer1," A prostate cancer diagnosis can feel overwhelming. Although it is treatable, prostate cancer can cause major lifestyle changes and significantly impact your spouse's emotional and physical well-being. He will likely feel overwhelmed at first, so be there to listen to him express his feelings.Be an active listener. Let your spouse know you are listening by nodding your head and giving verbal signs that you hear him.
Some men need to yell and cry after receiving the diagnosis. Know that this is not personal. You can listen to his anger and demonstrate that you are there to support him while he processes his feelings.;
, Your spouse's diagnosis will have a big impact on your life, too. But try to remember that while you are both dealing with change, he is the one with the illness. He may need some time by himself to process his emotions. That is normal and healthy.Let him know you will be there when he's ready to talk. Try saying, ""I respect your need for some alone time. Just let me know if you change your mind and want some company.""
Remember that his emotions are not aimed at you. Try not to feel hurt if he asks for some space.

, There are many ways that you can bolster your spouse's spirits. You can offer him encouragement by simply reminding him that you are in this together. Say something like, ""I'm here for you no matter what.""Encourage your spouse to participate in meaningful activities. If he is a spiritual man, you can encourage him to keep going to church.
Prompt him to continue to spend time with loved ones. Many people tend to initially withdraw after a cancer diagnosis. Remind your husband that he loves being around his grandchildren, for example.

, When dealing with prostate cancer, it is important to keep the lines of communication open. Let your partner know that you are ready and willing to listen. You can demonstrate your support by asking questions.Ask how he feels about his treatment options. Listen carefully to any of his concerns.
Express your opinions. Try saying, ""I feel like the doctor's first suggestion might work best for our family. What do you think?""
Be open and honest and ask him to do the same.

, For many men, it is comforting to talk about how they feel. Remind your spouse that you are happy to listen to him. If he expresses fear, acknowledge that that is a normal reaction.Avoid being judgmental. Everyone reacts differently when dealing with cancer. Remember that all emotions are valid.

Learn about treatment.,
Implement lifestyle changes.,
Address intimacy.,
Take more responsibility.,
Be his voice.",How to Support a Spouse With Prostate Cancer2," Emotional support is very important, but there are also many practical things you can do to help your partner. Take the time to go with him to doctor's appointments. The more you understand his treatment, the better equipped you will be to help him deal with it.Be prepared to ask questions. Do some research ahead of time and write down anything that seems unclear. The doctor will be happy to answer your concerns.
Help your spouse gather information. You can find information and support groups online, and you can ask your doctor for pamphlets, too.

, Be aware that you might need to make some changes to your daily routine. You spouse might have a lot of medical appointments, so be open to adjusting your schedule to accommodate these new priorities. Let him know that you are willing to help him adapt to changes. One side effect of prostate cancer is often incontinence. If this is an issue for your spouse, be supportive and helpful. For example, when you go to the movies, choose seats near the back and towards that aisle so that he can quickly get to the restroom.

, Prostate cancer can cause complications that make sex difficult for men. This can cause problems in relationships. Address the issue openly and honestly with your spouse. Allow him to talk openly about his needs. You should express yours, too.Initiate intimacy. You might need to make changes to your sex life, but that doesn't mean it has to become dormant. If you initiate intimacy, that lets your partner know you still desire him.
Be physical. Make sure that you kiss and hug him as you normally would.

, Cancer treatment can be physically and mentally exhausting. Offer to start taking more responsibility around the house. Try to cook more meals, or run the errands that your spouse would normally do.Explain that you are not trying to take his place, but that you are just trying to help. For example, say, ""I know you enjoy taking Emily to dance lessons, but if you're tired, I'm more than happy to drive carpool this week for you.""

, Some people find it very difficult to talk about their cancer. Ask your spouse if he would like your help breaking the news to family and friends. The two of you can come up with a plan that will take some of the pressure off of him.Once people know about his cancer, they will want to express their support. If your spouse seems overwhelmed, you can answer the phone or e-mails for him.
Try saying, ""Stan will be glad to know that you dropped by, but he's feeling pretty tired today. I'll have him give you a call when he's up to it. Thanks for your support.""

Process your feelings.,
Practice self-care.,
Ask for help.",How to Support a Spouse With Prostate Cancer3," Everyone responds differently when a spouse is diagnosed with prostate cancer. It will have a big impact on your life. It is important that you acknowledge your emotions and take time to deal with them.Remember that it is normal to feel fear, frustration, and grief, among other emotions.
Allow yourself time to go through a range of emotions. Like him, you will have good days and bad days.

, In order to effectively care for your spouse, you need to remember to take care of yourself. Your needs are important, too. Make sure that you are remembering to eat right. You should also remember to take breaks from care-giving.Try to find a balance in your life. Caring for your spouse will take a lot of your time, but it's important to schedule time for yourself, too.
Don't stop doing activities that you enjoy. You might have to miss a meeting of your book club now and then, but don't give it up for good.

, Dealing with cancer is extremely stressful, so you may need to ask for help from friends and family to manage. Reaching out to friends and family for help can help you to feel less stressed and make it easier to go through your daily activities.


If you are having trouble handling the day-to-day tasks, ask friends and family for help. For example, if your daughter has a soccer game when you need to be at a medical appointment, ask someone else to take her.You may also want to find a support group to meet people who are dealing with similar circumstances. There are groups online and ones that meet in person. Ask your doctor to recommend a group of other spouses dealing with prostate cancer.

Determine whether or not you are at high risk.If you have had two or more first degree relatives with pancreatic cancer, you are deemed high risk.,
Book an appointment with a genetic counselor, doctor, or other health care professional who is thoroughly trained in analysis of genetic tests.,
Consider a CT (based on X-ray radiation, has safety concerns) versus MRI scan (magnetic resonance imaging, problematic for recently installed stents, any other metal devices, plates, screws, pins, etc.,
Opt for a procedural screening test.,
Know that there are currently no set guidelines around screening.Although there is consensus that screening should be made available to high risk individuals, the frequency and type of screening test is determined on a case-by-case basis.",How to Screen for Pancreatic Cancer1," Alternatively, if you have had one first degree relative with pancreatic cancer diagnosed under the age of 50, you are also categorized as high risk. Being ""high risk"" makes you eligible for screening tests for pancreatic cancer that are not currently made available to the general population.


You may also be categorized as high risk, if you test positive for a genetic syndrome that has been linked to a heightened risk of pancreatic cancer.;
, This person would can help you individually and your family understand their test options and results. Your doctor would need access to a lab that does genetic testing, if you suspect this may apply to you.

Approximately 10% of pancreatic cancers are linked to genetic causes, and individuals who fall into the high risk category due to these causes are eligible for screening.,).The CT or MRI method of screening is available for high risk individuals. The challenge with a CT or MRI scan is that it can be very hard to detect early and/or very small lesions on the pancreas or spreading to the duodenum, gall bladder, liver and such with imaging techniques alone. However, it is better than nothing, and they are the best imaging options currently available. It is also a quick and non-invasive test.

, Instead of a CT or MRI scan, you can choose an ERCP (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography) or an EUS (endoscopic ultrasound).Both of these rely on tubing being inserted into your digestive tract through your mouth while you are sleeping under anesthesia to closely examine the pancreas and surrounding areas first without contrast and minutes later with it (iodine ""dye""). They are internal tests that involve some risks of bleeding or infection -- and are more complex to perform -- but can provide your doctor with a chance to see first-hand how your pancreas looks, and whether there are any suspicious or concerning lesions or tumors present there or nearby (that may indicate potential cancer).

, In the future, there will likely be medical guidelines and recommendations/protocol; however, since screening is relatively new, it will currently be a decision made between you and your physician/care team.

Understand that obesity, plus smoking and alcohol use are associated with an increased risk of developing several types of cancer including pancreatic.There are currently no screening tests available for the general population.By the time of diagnosis based on illness, the cancer has usually metastasized (spread) to other areas of the body, meaning that the patient has on average a prognosis of 6 months to 2 years to live following the time of diagnosis.,
Try as you may to be alert, but most pancreatic tumors form in ""exocrine"" cells that do not secrete hormones also do not cause any signs or symptoms until after the cancer spreads.,
Recognize the symptoms of pancreatic cancer.Since the general population is not currently offered screening for pancreatic cancer, if you begin to notice suspicious symptoms it is important to book an appointment with your doctor as soon as possible.,
Know that a blood test may become available in the future.The ideal type of screening test would be a blood test, because it is cheap, easy, and can be readily administered to a large number of people.,
Keep up with the medical research.There is a lot of exciting research going on at the moment in the areas of genetics, proteomics (the evaluation of specific proteins that may be correlated with pancreatic cancer), and other biomarkers (substances that can be measured in the body that may correlate to the early detection of pancreatic cancer).",How to Screen for Pancreatic Cancer2," In the USA ""five-year survival rates"" (perhaps in remission, or not) for some cancers, such as breast, prostate, and thyroid cancers, now exceed 90 percent.The inability to detect pancreatic cancer earlier with simple screening tests is a huge problem; as such, it has become an important focus of medical research today.


The reason that there are no useful cancer ""blood-screening test"" available for the general population (those who are not at high risk) are because the current blood tests being considered by medical professionals are not reliable or accurate, and they provide no significant improvement at detecting pancreatic cancer early.
The other screening options (those that directly visualize the pancreas and are offered to high risk people) are more accurate but are too costly to the patients and medical system for general use.

, This makes it to unlikely for the patient to ask for a diagnose as it does not cause one to feel sick, and also much harder to diagnose such pancreatic cancers in a timely manner. Also for most patients with this (sneaky) exocrine pancreatic cancer, current treatments do not cure the cancer.A hopeful cure for a rare, malignant pancreatic tumor type, arising from islet cells, ""neuroendocrine (PNET),"" has a much better prognosis than pancreatic exocrine cancers with approved medications for them., He or she can then order investigative tests to determine whether or not it is cancer. Common symptoms of pancreatic cancer include:


Yellow discoloration of your skin and of the whites of your eyes (called ""jaundice"") caused by high liver enzymes such as bilirubin (red-bile)
Pain in your upper abdomen that may radiate to your back and back of the rib cage
Unexplained weight loss, because of sugar metabolism problems caused by the diseased pancreas
Decreased appetite, as food taste differently if you have yellow jaundice.

, The purpose of the blood test would be to test for some sort of marker(s) that are shown to be correlated with a heightened risk of pancreatic cancer.


Those who are deemed to be at heightened risk from the screening blood test would then receive more detailed testing from their physician, to determine whether or not there is in fact any cancer present.

, Hopefully in the near future enough information will be gathered for the medical community to come up with effective tests that can be made available to the general population to screen for pancreatic cancer.

Become aware of how colon cancer is diagnosed.,
Know that Stage I Colon Cancer is usually asymptomatic.,
Recognize the symptoms for Stage II and III Colon Cancer.,
Recognize the symptoms of Stage IV Colon Cancer.,
Understand why staging is so important.,
Be aware that diagnostic tests are crucial to the accurate staging of colon cancer.As previously mentioned, staging your colon cancer is crucial as it dictates the course of treatment offered by your physician.It is very difficult (if not impossible) to accurately stage colon cancer based on clinical exam alone (by your doctor's physical exam).,
Know the difference between different types of staging for colon cancer.,
Go for a CT scan.,
Consider other forms of imaging if your doctor recommends this.,
Have your cancer assessed after treatment for any signs of recurrence.",How to Stage Colon Cancer," For some people, they show no symptoms at all and the diagnosis is discovered from a screening test (such as the stool test); this is followed up by a colonoscopy (where the doctor inserts a tube through your rectum to look at your colon, at which point he or she will be able to see any cancer that may be present). For other people, colon cancer is diagnosed after presenting to the doctor with suspicious symptoms (which will be described in detail later in the article), at which point a colonoscopy is done which may or may not reveal the presence of cancer (note that colonoscopy is the test that is used to officially ""diagnose"" cancer as the doctor can see it before his or her own eyes). , This means that you will likely not be aware that you have it, unless it is detected by a routine screening test such as a stool test to check for blood. These are recommended every one to three years depending on the test. For example, Cologuard is only required once every three years.Another option is a colonoscopy. This test is most often recommended for those who have a personal or family history of ""polyps,"" which are growth on the intestinal wall that may be the ""precursor"" for colon cancer., Symptoms appear during these stages, when the tumor mass begins to grow and causes obstructions or invades adjacent organs. Symptoms of colon cancer include: Blood in your stool. This may be visible, or it may be in too small of a quantity to see with the naked eye, which is what the stool screening tests are detecting.
Abdominal pain. This may be due to partial obstruction of your bowels by the cancer, among other potential causes of pain.
Changes in bowel habits, such as decreased frequency of stools, or constipation due to the cancer mass obstructing the colon.
Feeling unusually fatigued, or light-headed when you stand. If your doctor checks your blood counts, people with colon cancer often have low red blood cells and low hemoglobin due to blood loss from the cancer.

, Stage IV is when the cancer has spread to other parts of the body, beyond the colon.


The most common sites that colon cancer spreads to include: the lungs (resulting in difficulty breathing), the bones (resulting in bone pains and aches), and the brain (resulting in confusion, dizziness, and/or seizures).
Additionally during stage IV colon cancer, patients often lose a significant amount of weight (many of them up to 10 pounds per month). This is due to lack of appetite, uncomfortable bowel/abdomen after eating, and the increased metabolism from the cancer cells.
Cancer cells have a faster metabolism rate than normal cells. Therefore, as the cancer cells spread, they “eat” more nutrients and leave the patient less nutrients for maintaining body function and weight.

, Not only does it provide you and your doctor with helpful information about how severe or worrisome your colon cancer is, but it is also necessary in order to determine the best course of treatment. Early stage cancers (usually Stage I or II) that have not spread to lymph nodes or other parts of the body can usually be removed surgically; this is called a ""resection."" However, if the cancer has spread to nodes (often Stage III) or to another part of the body (Stage IV), the treatment is usually chemotherapy and/or radiation. Patients are ""re-staged"" after they receive chemotherapy and/or radiation, and if their tumor has responded well to these treatments (i.e. if the tumor has shrunk and is now present only in the colon and not in the lymph nodes or elsewhere in the body), the patient may then receive surgery to cut the remainder of the cancer out. , Therefore, making use of today's medical imaging advances (such as CT scan) will make the world of difference in helping your doctor to get the clearest picture of what is going on, and what ""stage"" of colon cancer you have, so as to optimize treatment and help you in the best way possible., These include ""clinical staging,"" ""pathological staging,"" and ""post-treatment staging,"" each of which are important in their own way.""Clinical staging"" is established through your doctor's physical exam, and the help of imaging studies such as a CT scan. It is basically the ""pre-treatment"" look at the situation, as doctors gather as much information as possible to determine what ""stage"" your cancer is at.
""Pathological staging"" requires examination under a microscope of a sample of the cancer itself. If you receive surgery, a sample of your cancer is usually taken at this time and examined under the microscope to give a precise assessment of exactly what ""stage"" it is at based on ""pathology"" (how it looks under the microscope).
Finally, ""post-treatment staging"" is after a patient receives chemotherapy and/or radiation (which is only for patients with more severe disease). After these treatments are completed, the tumor will be ""re-staged"" to assess whether it has shrunk, and whether the ""stage"" has decreased enough to proceed with surgery and to cut the remainder of the cancer out.
Note that you may hear your doctor talking about ""TNM staging"" as well. What this stands for is tumor size (the ""T""), lymph node involvement (the ""N""), and presence or absence of metastases, which means the involvement of other organs beyond the colon (the ""M""). The reason your doctor may use these terms is that these are the criteria which, together, help a doctor to stage your colon cancer from I to IV., After your doctor has completed a physical exam and assessment of your symptoms, this is the next step in ""clinical staging."" It allows your doctor to see in much more detail the extent of your cancer, whether any lymph nodes or surrounding structures are involved, and whether or not the cancer may have spread to any other areas of your body (called ""metastasis"").A CT scan is also helpful for surgical planning, as it provides images that show the location and size of the cancer mass.

, This may include a liver MRI if your doctor is worried that the cancer may have spread to your liver.


The most common site of metastasis for colon cancer is to the liver, and MRI is a much more precise way of looking at the liver (as the liver is harder to visualize on CT scan alone).If the cancer has spread to parts of your body other than your liver, your doctor would recommend tests specific to those areas to better assess the extent of the cancer. (The type of test would depend on the area of the body involved.)
Finally, if a CT provides results that are at all ""unclear,"" or difficult for your doctors to interpret, you may be sent for something called a PET/CT. This is where glucose (sugar) molecules are ""tagged"" and sent into your body and, since cancer takes up sugar at a faster rate than regular cells, the cancerous areas ""light up"" on the PET/CT scan when they take up the sugar. This test is much more expensive, however, so is rarely used except in those cases that are challenging for doctors to diagnose based on CT scan alone., This is important because, even if your cancer is removed surgically, there is a chance it could come back down the road, and it is always better to catch this sooner rather than later.


Perform laboratory tests to check for cancer recurrence. Laboratory tests are not used for staging or diagnosis; however they should be performed in pre-treatment evaluation and post-treatment surveillance for recurrence of cancer.
During a lab test, the analyst will look for tumor markers. The main ""tumor marker"" that has been associated with colon cancer is something called CEA. Although markers like CEA are not useful for staging or diagnosis, they are useful for surveillance of cancer recurrence.
The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) recommends yearly CEA levels be performed for up to 5 years.

Take some time to research your condition.,
Don't hesitate to ask your doctor about the diagnosis.,
Be aware that this sort of cancer is often caused by exposure to toxins.,
Be prepared for the symptoms that occur because of pleural tumors.,
Be ready for possible physical changes.",How to Respond to a Pleural Lung Cancer Diagnosis1," Learning about pleural lung cancer may help you to feel a bit more prepared to face the cancer-head on. The pleura is a space in between your lungs and chest wall. It contains pleural fluid that is responsible for lubricating your lungs and chest wall while you breath. When a cancerous tumor develops in the pleura, it is considered pleural lung cancer.Ways to learn about pleural lung cancer include:


Discussing the condition with your doctor.
Running an online search through different cancer websites.
Talking to friends or family members who have experienced or are experiencing this condition, or who have a loved one that is.
Reading books or articles about about pleural lung cancer.;
, While spending time at the doctor's office may be the last thing you want to do, it is important to learn what you can about your condition. Your doctor will be more than happy to answer anyway questions you have about this type of cancer, as well as your specific diagnosis.

, One possible cause of pleural tumors is exposure to asbestos and smoking. Asbestos is a potentially hazardous mineral. Cigarette smoke can also lead to the growth of a tumor in the pleura.

, You may find that you begin to experience these symptoms as your pleural tumor continues to grow. These symptoms can include:


Shortness of breath when you do physical activities. Shortness of breath can occur because fluid may begin to accumulate in your lungs as the tumor grows.
Prolonged or chronic cough. A persistent cough can indicate an infection in your lungs or that the tumor is growing. Infections and tumors can lead to the growth of scar tissue in your lungs that can irritate your lungs, causing you to cough.
Weight loss for no apparent reason. Lung cancer can cause you to lose weight, though the reason for this is unknown. Weight loss generally occurs in people with solid tumors.
Pain in your chest. Chest pain can occur because the tumor can cause tissues and muscles to tear, causing scarring and pain in your lungs.

, Having any kind of cancer can change your physical being. While everyone reacts to conditions in different ways, common changes that occur in people diagnosed with lung cancer include:


Weight loss.
Stress-induced physical changes like fatigue, pale skin, and loss of appetite.

Discuss the available options of treatment with your doctor based on your specific condition.,
Talk to your doctor about surgery.,
Consider radiation therapy.,
Consider chemotherapy.,
Know that some of these treatments can be combined.",How to Respond to a Pleural Lung Cancer Diagnosis2," Lung cancer can be treated in a variety of ways. However, the treatment that your doctor chooses for you will depend on:


Your overall health.
The size of the cancer tumor.
The exact location of the tumor.
The stage of the tumor.

, This is done by a thoracic surgeon. The goal of the surgery is to remove the whole tumor and the surrounding lymph nodes. This is done to ensure that no cancer cells are left on adjacent tissues.The time taken for recovery will depend on the surgical procedure that has been done and the amount of tissue that has been removed. The recovery will also depend on your condition before the surgical procedure.

, Radiation therapy is a treatment option where x-rays that have high energy are used to destroy the cancerous cells. This procedure is done by a radiation oncologist. The most common type of this treatment is external beam therapy where a machine is placed on the external part of your body. Radiation can also be given using implants that are inserted inside your body, which is called internal therapy.The side effects that may occur after radiation therapy include decreased appetite, fatigue, sore throat and dysphagia (difficulty in swallowing). Your skin might also feel irritated where the therapy was applied.

, Chemotherapy involves taking drugs that may stop the cancerous cells from multiplying and dividing. Most of these drugs are given intravenously and work systematically through your body in an attempt to kill all the cancerous cells.You may receive several drugs at once. Side effects may include nausea, vomiting, fatigue, decreased appetite, hair loss, diarrhea and increased risk of infection.
You may be given other drugs that will help to reduce the side effects that may occur during chemotherapy treatment.

, Some of these modes of treatment may be combined to increase your chances of defeating the cancer.


For example, you may have a surgical procedure done to remove the cancer, followed by radiotherapy to kill off any remaining cancerous cells.

The following steps will outline how you can live in a healthy lifestyle.

, If you have been diagnosed with lung cancer, it is important that you stop smoking. You should also avoid being around cigarette smoke, even if you are not the one smoking, as cigarette smoke can make your tumor, and your overall health, worse. It can also exacerbate your shortness of breath. Ways to quit smoking include:


Going to support groups.
Using a nicotine patch.
Talking to your doctor about other medications you can take to help break the habit.

, Try to exercise often, but always stop if you are having difficulty breathing. Exercising can help to strengthen your lungs. Try simple exercises like walking every morning.


You could try walking 10 to 20 minutes every morning to try to strengthen your lungs.

, Creating a healthy diet for yourself may help to combat other medical conditions that could develop because of your lung cancer. In particular, foods rich in fiber can help to keep your blood pressure normal and manage other body functions.Fiber-rich foods include:


Green leafy vegetables like spinach, cabbage, turnip greens, and lettuce.
Fruits like apricots, apples, bananas, blueberries, plums, pineapples, and melons.

, This will help you know if your status is improving or not. It is important to keep track of your health. Your doctor may have specific advice for your condition that will help to keep you as healthy as possible.

Talk to family and friends about your condition.,
Join a support group.,
Do not lose hope.",How to Respond to a Pleural Lung Cancer Diagnosis4," While it may be very hard to do, it is important that you tell your family members and close friends about your diagnosis. Having a support network of people that you love can provide you with the moral support and strength you will need to fight your illness.Sharing your thoughts, fears, and feelings is an important part of accepting your condition and facing it head-on.

, There are many support groups for cancer patients. These groups can help you to deal with your diagnosis and help you find ways to handle the situation. You may also find that it is helpful to talk with other people who are going through the same things as you.


You can find support groups online. Your doctor may also be able to recommend support groups in your area that you can consider going to.

, Keeping a positive attitude is an important part of dealing with your diagnosis. While it is completely natural to feel sad, angry, or lost when faced with this news, keeping your hope alive and spending time with loved ones is an important part of gaining the strength to fight your illness.

Deal with your emotions.,
Find someone you can talk to.,
Take some time to comfort yourself.,
Ask your doctor questions.,
Do your own research.,
Talk to your health insurance provider.,
Research charitable assistance.,
Manage your symptoms.,
Eat healthy foods.,
Build a support network.",How to Respond when You Are Diagnosed With Cancer," A cancer diagnosis is a jarring experience that can elicit a wide range of emotions such as fear, anger and depression.It is best to get into the right state of mind before making treatment plans or telling friends and family.


You may be tempted to ignore and sublimate your feelings, either to soften the news for your friends and family or out fear of the future. It’s best to allow yourself to experience your emotions, even if they are unpleasant.
Don’t make any major decisions while you're feeling emotional stress. This can lead you to make decisions you could regret later on.;
, Friends and family can be crucial in times of stress. Being with someone you feel comfortable with can lessen the burden of extreme emotions.


If you know specific people in your life may react in a way that places more stress on you, avoid them until you’re ready to deal with it.
You shouldn’t feel like you have to put on a brave face for anyone. Don’t worry about anyone else’s emotions until you feel comfortable with your own.
Many people that get diagnosed with cancer seek professional counseling., You will need to do a lot of planning and thinking in the coming days. But you should absolutely take some time to relax and get into a positive state of mind.


Take a short vacation somewhere that relaxes you.
Enjoy your favorite hobby until your mind is at ease.
A positive state of mind is scientifically proven to improve your body’s natural defenses against diseases like cancer., Your doctor is your first and best resource for information because they have first-hand familiarity with your lab tests. Beyond determining the basic name, size, location and rate of growth information about the tumor, you should try to think of as many questions as possible to get a thorough understanding of your condition.


Ask about lifestyle issues like hair loss, your diet and the amount of physical activity you can engage in.
There are no stupid questions when dealing with a matter this serious so don’t be afraid to ask anything that comes to mind.
Ask your doctor for a copy of your pathology report and then seek a second opinion. Even the best doctors can vary in their opinion about the nature of an illness and how to go about treating it. This is particularly important with a cancer diagnosis both because the stakes are high and because different oncologists often see the same cancer in different ways., There are often several treatment options available for a cancer diagnosis including radiation, chemotherapy and surgery. Even within these categories, there are many specific decisions that need to be made to develop a course of treatment that is right for you.


The expenses, side-effects and chances of success can vary greatly so be sure to research your options thoroughly.
If your cancer is particularly serious or rare, you may want to enter experimental drug trials to try the latest options in medical innovation.Do your own research on up-to-date, reputable websites. The best information the medical world has to offer can often change so you’ll want to make note of how recently the research or advice was produced.
Talk to someone with your type of cancer. Use the internet or a doctor’s referral to find others who have had your type of cancer. There is a lot about this experience you can only learn by going through., The costs associated with cancer can be very expensive.Once you’re in a stable emotional state and have informed the people closest to you, one of your first calls should be to your health insurance provider.


This is urgent because it can often take some time to get approvals for procedures and you don’t want this to delay your treatment., Cancer treatment can be incredibly expensive. Fortunately, charitable organizations can sometimes help.


Many hospitals and doctor’s offices offer long-term payment options or cost reductions for people with income challenges. There are many non-profit organizations, funded by government grants and/or charitable donations, that provide grants to help deal with medical or personal costs associated with cancer.Many cancer patients have also experienced success in using sites like GoFundMe.com to solicit donations from the internet., Some forms of cancer will cause pain, loss of appetite and fatigue among many other physical symptoms. Have a plan for how you will deal with these symptoms ahead of time.


Talk to your doctor about perspective pain killers. In some states, your cancer may make you eligible for a medical marijuana license.Plan time to rest each day so you aren’t overcome by exhaustion. Use light physical activities like walking to build stamina and prevent atrophy., Most medical treatments for cancer rely on your body’s natural defenses to fight the spread of the disease and the side effects.Whole grains, lean protein, fruits and vegetables are great sources of natural energy to fight fatigue.Staying hydrated is essential to keeping. Your condition will likely cause your skin, eyes and mouth to feel dry.Prepare for difficult eating by stocking up on foods that are easy to digest like soup or fruit smoothies., Few people can go through this experience alone. You may need to lean on others for a variety of tasks and to cope with stress.


Bring a friend to your doctors’ appointments. Having someone with you can help ensure you ask all the necessary questions and have emotional support to deal with any potential bad news.Think of several people you can call to talk about your emotions at any time. The stress and anxiety of your situation may feel manageable one minute and overwhelming the next so it’s nice to be able to make a quick call.
If necessary, ask someone to take over daily responsibilities like running errands or cleaning around the house.
Don’t let your pride get in the way of asking for help. If someone offers help you need, accept it.

Get hormone treatments.,
Consider getting genetic testing.,
Consider your risk for cervical cancer.,
Determine your risk for ovarian cancer.,
Recognize your risk for uterine cancer.,
Consider your risk for vaginal and vulvar cancers.",How to Reduce Your Gynecologic Cancer Risk," The Pap test or pap smear tests for cervical cancer and the human papillomavirus (HPV) test checks for changes in cells that could cause cancer. During a Pap test, the doctor will place a special tool (speculum) inside your vagina to swab for cells. This is sent to a lab for examination. If you're menstruating, have had sex (or used contraceptive jellies or foams), or douched, wait at least two days before getting the Pap smear. Follow the Centers for Disease Control's recommended Pap schedule:Women over 21 should get a Pap test and HPV screening once every three years if the results are normal.
Women over 30 should get a Pap and HPV test once every five years if the results are normal.
Women under age 65 should continue getting Pap tests until age 65 or until getting a total-hysterectomy for non-cancerous conditions.;
, HPV is a group of viruses that are directly connected to cervical, vaginal and vulvar cancer. To make the vaccine more effective, it is usually given as a series of three shots to girls starting at the age of 9 and boys starting at the ages of 11 or 12. If you haven't already gotten it at an early age, the HPV vaccine is recommended for:Girls and women between the ages of 13 and 26
Boys and men between the ages of 13 to 21
Men who have sex with men through age 26
Men with compromised immune systems through age 26

, If you're overweight or obese and don't get much physical activity, you could be at a higher risk for uterine cancer. Try to lose weight by eating a healthy diet and becoming physically active. Talk with your doctor or a registered dietitian to create a personalized diet. Avoid processed foods, eat more vegetables and fruits, and choose lean protein sources.Your doctor or dietitian may recommend reducing your intake of animal fat, which appears to increase the risk of gynecological cancers.

, Smoking is associated with cervical, vaginal and vulvar cancers. If you're struggling to quit or even cut back, talk with your doctor, who can recommend support groups or cessation aids.You can use nicotine replacement therapies (like patches or gums) or smoking cessation medications, which may help smokers quit.

, If you're taking an estrogen therapy alone, you may actually increase your risk for uterine cancer (if you have a uterus). But, if you take estrogen plus progesterone together as a hormone replacement therapy, you can reduce that cancer risk, though this may increase your risk for breast cancer. You can also reduce your uterine or breast cancer risk by taking oral contraceptives that contain these hormones.Progesterone treatment can be used to treat uterine cancer in some situations.

, Talk with your female family members about their medical histories, especially close relatives like your mother, sisters, aunts and grandmothers. Some cancers are linked to gene mutations. If a close family member has a cancer caused by a gene mutation (like ovarian or breast cancers), you might benefit from genetic testing and counseling.When you talk with your family about their medical histories, find out how old they were when cancers were diagnosed. Remember to get information from both sides of your family., Cervical cancer is more common in women over 30 and is commonly caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). Your risk factors are higher if you smoke, are infected with HIV/AIDS, or have a suppressed immune system. Using oral contraceptives for five years or more, giving birth to three or more children, or having several sexual partners can all increase your risk as well.Early cervical cancer often has no symptoms, but advanced cervical cancer can cause vaginal bleeding or an abnormal discharge.

, Talk with your family to find out if close female relatives have a history of ovarian cancer since this may increase your risk. You may be at a higher risk if you're middle-aged or older, have a genetic mutation like BRCA1 or BRCA2 (or are of an Ashkenazi Jewish background which is associated to these mutations), or have a history of breast, colon, rectal, cervical or skin cancer. Endometriosis and a history of taking estrogen (without progesterone) may also be risk factors. Watch for symptoms of ovarian cancer that include:Abnormal bleeding or discharge
Pain in the lower part of your abdomen
Back pain
Bloating
Feeling full after eating only a small amount of food
Changes in how often you urinate

, Find out if you have a close family member who has had uterine, colon or ovarian cancer since this can increase your risk. Your risk for uterine cancer is also higher if you're over 50 years old, are obese, use estrogen replacement therapy alone (without progesterone), or have had irregular periods or difficulty getting pregnant. Women who have used a drug called tamoxifen to treat some forms of breast cancer also have an increased risk for uterine cancer.Symptoms of uterine cancer are abnormal bleeding or abnormal discharge, especially in post-menopausal women. Women with advanced uterine cancer may experience pain or a sense of pressure in the lower abdomen, but this is rare.

, Cancers of the vagina (the birth canal) and the vulva (the outer part of the genitals) are very rare. Your risk factors for these cancers are higher if you're infected with HPV, have a history of cervical abnormalities or cervical cancer, you smoke, or you have chronic itching or burning around the vulva. Get medical attention if you notice symptoms of these cancers which include:Abnormal bleeding or discharge
Blood in your stool or urine
Urinating more frequently
Pain the the lower abdomen (especially during sex)
Itching or burning sensation around your vulva
A rash or physical changes (like warts) around your vulva

Get a colonoscopy.,
Get a Fecal Occult Blood Test (FOBT).,
Try genetic testing.,
Discuss other screening options with your doctor or a health care professional.",How to Reduce the Risk of Colon Cancer1," Colonoscopy screenings typically begin when you turn 50 if you have no other colon cancer risk factors, such as relatives who have had colon cancer. If you have a family history of colorectal cancer or inflammatory bowel disease, your physician may advise you to have a colonoscopy before your 50th birthday.Prepare for your colonoscopy screening. The colonoscopy allows doctors to remove any polyps that may be forming in your colon. Polyps take 10 to 15 years to grow, and may turn into colorectal cancer.
You may be required to fast and go through a colon cleansing.
Getting a colonoscopy performed will take less than one day.;
, FOBTs are tests that look for hidden blood in stool which can be signs of polyp growth or cancer. FOBTs are much less invasive than colonoscopy and can be done once a year.You may often have the option of sampling your stool at home and mailing it, in a container provided to you by your doctor, to a lab to be medically tested.

, Genetics play an important role when it comes to your risk of colon cancer — 5 to 10 percent of colorectal cancers are caused by genetic mutations that can be inherited. If you have a first-degree relative who has had colorectal cancer (and especially if they developed it at a young age), ask your doctor about whether or not you should get tested for these mutations.A number of genetic tests are available to determine whether you have a genetic mutation that predisposes you to colorectal cancer, including tests for MLH1, MSH2, APC, MSH6, PMS2, and MUTYH mutations.
A genetic counselor can help you understand your individual cancer risk and which type of genetic tests, if any, may be useful for you or for other members of your family.

, There are many different options for colon cancer screenings, many of which depend on your overall health, age, and family history. Consulting your doctor about which screening test is right for you will help you get the most accurate results possible.Screening options vary from less invasive regular visits to less frequent and more invasive. If you are regularly screened with a FOBT you may also need a colonoscopy in order to confirm results.
Return for a colonoscopy screening every 1 to 10 years, depending on what your doctor recommends. If you have precancerous polyps removed, your doctor may want you to return in 1 to 3 years. However, if you have no polyps, you may not have to return for 10 years.

Eat five or more servings of different vegetables and fruits every day.,
Eat plenty of fiber.,
Decrease the amount of red and processed meats in your diet.,
Avoid drinking alcohol excessively.,
Don’t smoke.,
Talk to your doctor about taking aspirin.,
Take vitamins and supplements.",How to Reduce the Risk of Colon Cancer2," Consuming more fruits and vegetables everyday helps reduce the risk of colon cancer while providing other beneficial effects to your health. Fruits and vegetables, like strawberries and spinach, are rich with nutrients, fiber, and cancer fighting antioxidants.If you have a sweet-tooth, try and replace processed sugars with natural sugars found in fruits.
Replace processed carbohydrates with vegetables, like carrots or parsnips.

, Fiber is essential to counter-acting carcinogens and helps fuel the resident bacteria already present in our guts. Taking care of your colon by eating fibrous foods like whole grains, lentils, apples, and broccoli will reduce your risk of colon cancer.Try whole wheat or seeded breads instead of breads made with processed and bleached wheat.
If you think you are not eating enough fiber, try a supplement like Metamucil.

, Red and processed meats contain a combination of potentially harmful elements, from the particular type of iron present in red meat to its carcinogenic effect when being cooked at high temperatures. Avoiding red and processed meat will greatly reduce your risk of colon cancer.Think of red meat as a garnish to a vegetable heavy dish if you find you cannot live without red meat.
Many processed meats, like hot dogs, bacon, salami, and some lunch meats, contain sodium nitrite, which turns into a carcinogen during digestion., Alcohol can be heart-healthy in low doses, but it can also increase the risk of cancer when consumed consistently. To drink in moderation and lower your risk of cancer, limit your alcohol consumption to no more than two drinks a day for adult males, and no more than one a day for adult females.A single drink amounts to 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or 1.5 ounces of distilled spirits (liquor)., Smoking not only increases the risk of serious diseases like heart disease, emphysema, and stroke, but is also a major cause of at least 14 different cancers, including colon cancer.Consult your healthcare professional about smoking cessation products.
Many over the counter smoking cessation products are available at pharmacies and grocery stores.

, If you are 50 to 69 years of age, ask your doctor about taking a low daily dose of aspirin. Doing this for 10 years may reduce your risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and colorectal cancer, according to recommendations from the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF).This may not be appropriate for everyone, especially if you take other medication or have other medical conditions, so make sure you talk to your doctor first.

, Both calcium and Vitamin D can help reduce the risk of cancer. If you are having difficulty eating enough calcium and vitamin-rich foods, look for supplements in a powder, pill, or capsule form.If you live in an area that does not get frequent sunlight, you may benefit from Vitamin D supplements.
Whole milk is a great source of both calcium and Vitamin D.

Exercise daily.,
Maintain a healthy weight.,
Join a health club or spa.",How to Reduce the Risk of Colon Cancer3," Frequent and moderate daily exercise will help you avoid a sedentary lifestyle known for producing digestive system cancers. Exercise has enormous benefits to both those of a healthy weight and those who are obese.Try walking everyday for 30 minutes. Walking is a moderate exercise that may reduce your risk of colon cancer.
Sign up for a dance or yoga class. Dance and yoga classes may be a fun way to get moderate exercise.

, Although exercise can reduce the risk of cancer in both those who are at a healthy weight and obese, maintaining a healthy weight will help reduce the long-term possibilities and risks of cancer.Maintaining a healthy weight is achieved through a combination of a healthy diet and regular exercise.
Consult your doctor before beginning new health routines.

, Joining a health club or spa will provide you with resources to maintain a healthy weight and continue regular and moderate exercise. Many spas and health clubs offer other benefits that stimulate health and can often offer nutrition resources should you have questions or concerns about your lifestyle.


Working out three or more times a week will help you maintain a healthy weight, which may lower your chance of getting cancer.

Know your current resting heart rate.,
Take your pulse.,
Evaluate your resting heart rate.,
Know when to see your doctor.",How to Lower Resting Heart Rate1," Before you start taking action to try to lower your resting heart rate, it's important to know what your starting point is. To do this you just need to take your pulse and count the beats. You can do this at the carotid artery (in the neck) or at the wrist.


Be sure that you are resting and relaxed before you start.
The best time to do it is before you get out of bed in the morning.;
, To take your pulse at the carotid artery, place your index and middle finger tips lightly on one side of your neck, to the side of your windpipe. Press gently until you find the pulse. To get the most accurate reading, count the number of beats in 60 seconds.Alternatively count the beats in 10 seconds and multiply by six, or 15 seconds and multiply by four.
To measure your pulse at the wrist, place one hand palm up.
With the other hand, place the tips of your index, middle and ring fingers below the base of your thumb until you feel the pulse.
Alternatively, if you have a stethoscope, you can evaluate your resting heart rate with it. Lift up or remove your shirt to expose the bare skin, place the earpieces in your ears, hold the stethoscope against your chest and listen in. Count the number of beats per minute as you listen.

, Once you have discovered your resting heart rate you need to find out where it is along the scale of healthy and unhealthy. A normal resting heart rate should be between 60 and 100 beats per minute (bpm).A rate of more than 90 is, however, considered high.If your heart rate is lower than 60 bpm and you also have the following symptoms —dizziness, shortness of breath and tunnel vision — then you should be evaluated by a doctor.
The resting heart rate of well trained endurance athletes can be between 40 and 60 bpm.They will not, however, experience the adverse symptoms, such as dizziness.
Test your rate over a few days to get an average.

, A high resting heart rate isn't an immediate danger, but can lead to longer term health problems. In these cases you should gradually lower your resting heart rate through exercise.But if you have a very low pulse, or frequent bouts of unexplained fast heart rates, particularly if these are coupled with dizziness, speak to a doctor.Generally if a high heart rate is combined with other symptoms you should visit a doctor.
Account for common causes such as caffeine intake, before you go to the doctors.Speak to your doctor if you are on any medications that might be affecting your heart rate, such as beta blockers.

Say something.,
Offer emotional support.,
Offer practical support.,
Be encouraging.,
Use humour when appropriate.,
Remember that each cancer journey is different.,
Don’t say you understand what your friend is going through.,
Don’t offer advice and don’t judge.,
Don’t be blindly optimistic.",How to Write to Someone Who Has Been Diagnosed With Cancer," When someone you know is diagnosed with cancer, you might feel completely numb or unable to process the situation. It is perfectly normal to be sad and upset about the situation, and not know what to do, but it’s important that you don’t drift away from your friend. Even if you don’t know what to say or how to react, make an effort to reach out and show your friend that you are there.


Just sending a short note or email at first saying you have heard the news and are thinking of them can help your friend feel a bit less alone.You could say, “I’m sorry this has happened. I’m thinking of you.”If you don’t know what to say, it’s okay to admit this. Say “I’m not sure what to say, but I want you to know that I care and I’m here for you.”;
, Everybody is different, but someone who has just been diagnosed with cancer will probably be feeling very lonely. It’s very important that you clearly show that you are there to support and help in any way you can. You can express your support by saying “Please let me know how I can help.”


Just being a good listener can make a difference to somebody. Say something like, “If you want to talk, I’m there for you.”While you should offer to listen, you shouldn’t press her to talk or pass on more information to you about the diagnosis.

, In your letter will you want to show that you are there to help in any way you can. This support can be practical as well as emotional. In some cases practical help can be a big help to a friend suffering from cancer. Offering to do everyday tasks such as helping to look after children and pets, or washing and cooking, can really help somebody who is tired or feeling weak.


Keep in mind that your friend may not want to feel that she is putting you out by asking for something.
Try to help in a way that looks casual, even if it isn’t.
For example, if you are offering to pick the kids up from school, you could say “I’m always in the area when they finish school, and could pick them up on the way home.”
Don’t just say, “would you like me to pick up your kids from school?”, It’s important to express encouragement and not be pessimistic or too downbeat. It can be difficult to find the right balance, as it’s equally important not to display false optimism or downplay the seriousness of the situation. Acknowledge the situation, but always express your support and encouragement.


You could say, “I know this is an incredibly difficult journey you are on, but I am here to support you and help you in any way I can to help you get through it.”, Depending on your friend and your relationship, humour might be a good way to show encouragement and support while also helping your friend smile. This can be difficult to achieve in a letter when you are not able to judge the reaction and body language of the other person.


For example, joking about something like hair loss can be a good way to relieve stress.Use your judgement, and if in doubt avoid making any jokes in the letter.

, You might know someone who has been through cancer, but you shouldn’t try to relate that experience to your friend’s diagnosis. Try to avoid sharing stories about people you know who have suffered from cancer, and remember that each case is different.


Instead you can let your friend know that you are familiar with cancer up to a point, and let your friend decide whether or not to ask you to elaborate.Saying something like, “my neighbour had cancer and he came through just fine” is not that likely to reassure your friend.
You may give the impression that you are detracting attention from her, when you are trying to show support and solidarity., You might think you are expressing support and solidarity, but unless you yourself have been through cancer, you do not know how your friend will be feeling, so don’t say you do.If you say something like “I know just what you’re going through,” or “I really know how you feel” it might seem like you are not taking it seriously enough.If you try to equate your friends diagnosis to a difficult period is yours or somebody else’s life, it can come across badly and be insensitive.
If you know somebody who has been through cancer, you can mention this and offer to introduce them, but don’t push it.
You can just say, “I have friend who went through cancer a few years ago, if you like, I can put you in touch.”, You might think it is helpful to offer advice on how to deal with cancer, or how somebody you know was helped by some alternative treatment. Your friend, however, will not want to read a long story about something that doesn’t really have anything to do with her. Offering advice about something you have no clear experience of us, no matter how well meaning, can appear insensitive. Leave the advice to the doctors.This is also not the time to ask questions about your friend’s lifestyle or habits.
Maybe your friend is a long-time smoker, who you spoke to about lung cancer countless times. That doesn’t matter now. Just focus on supporting her and being sensitive., While it is important to be positive, you shouldn’t say something like “I’m sure you’ll be fine,” or “you’ll get through it no problem.” You may just be trying to show support, but what you say might be interpreted as belittling the seriousness of situation. You may not know all the facts about the diagnosis and the prognosis.Don’t push your friend to reveal more about the prognosis than she has already.
Rather take the time to educate yourself as much as possible independently.
You can talk to friends or family to find out more information, but respect your friend’s privacy at all times."

Introduce regular exercise.,
Determine your maximum heart rate.,
Determine your target heart rate zone.,
Monitor your heart rate during exercise.",How to Lower Resting Heart Rate2," The best way to gradually and safely lower your resting heart rate is to introduce regular aerobic exercise into your routine. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends healthy adults get 150 minutes moderate intensity aerobic activity (brisk walking) per week and muscle strengthening activity 2 days or more per week. Muscle strengthening activities should work all major muscle groups (legs, hips, back, abdomen, chest, shoulders, and arms).For a healthier heart, aim for 40 minutes of moderate to vigorous exercise three or four times a week.
Include stretching and flexibility exercises such as yoga.
Try to combine this with muscle strengthening exercises twice a week., To really target your resting heart rate, you can tailor your exercise routine so that you aim for a target heart rate when you are exercising. This way you can track the intensity of the exercise and how hard your heart is working, gradually increasing it as you become fitter. To do this you need to determine your maximum heart rate. All of the safe methods for this are approximations, but they can give you a general picture.


One basic method is just subtract your age from 220.So if you are 30, your maximum heart rate will be approximately 190 beats per minute.
This method is considered more accurate for those under 40.
A slightly more complicated recent method is to multiply your age by 0.7, and then subtract that figure from 208.
With this technique a 40-year-old has a maximum heart rate of 180 (208 - 0.7 x 40)., Once you know an approximate value for your maximum heart rate you can determine the target heart rate zones for your exercise. By exercising within your target heart rate zone you can keep better track of how hard your heart is working and organise your exercise regime more precisely.


As a general rule heart rate during moderate activities is about 50-69% of your maximum heart rate. When you are first starting to work out, you should aim to keep your heart rate in this, the lower range of your target zone.Hard and vigorous activity will be between 70 and 85% of your maximum.You should gradually work up to working out at this level — it should take about six months to safely and comfortably reach this point if you are just beginning to exercises., To keep track of your heart rate during exercise just take your pulse at your wrist or neck. Count for fifteen seconds and multiply the number by four. When you are exercising you want to keep your heart rate between 50% and 85% of your maximum. If you are dropping down, try to up the intensity.If you are relatively new to exercise, increase gradually. You will still reap the benefits and will be less likely to sustain injury or to become discouraged.Be sure to stop exercising for a moment while you take your pulse.

Combine your exercise with a healthy diet.,
Avoid tobacco.,
Cut down on caffeine.,
Avoid alcohol.,
Reduce stress.",How to Lower Resting Heart Rate3," Being overweight makes your heart work harder to pump blood around your body. If you are overweight linking your exercise regime with a healthy diet will help to lose weight and relieve some of the stress on your heart, which in turn will lower your resting heart rate., As well as all the other damage tobacco does to your body, smokers are known to have higher resting heart rates than non-smokers. Cutting down or preferably quitting smoking will help to lower your heart rate and improve the healthiness of your heart.Nicotine constricts blood vessels and causes damage to heart muscles and vasculature. Quitting smoking can greatly improve blood pressure, circulation and overall health as well as decrease risk for cancer and breathing problems.

, Caffeine and caffeine products such as coffee and tea are well-known to increase heart rate.If you think you have a slightly high resting heart rate, lowering your caffeine intake can help to reduce it.More than two cups of coffee a day can contribute to side effects including an increased heart rate.Decaffeinated drinks can help you lower your caffeine intake.

, Alcohol intake has been connected to increased heart rates and higher average heart rates. Cutting down on the amount of alcohol you consume can help you to lower your resting heart rate., Reducing the amount of stress you experience isn't necessarily easy, but it can help you to lower your resting heart rate over time. Stress in extreme amounts can have a negative impact on your health. Practice some activities that help you to relax such, as meditation or tai chi.Try to dedicate a little time each day for a period of relaxation and deep breathing.


Everyone is different so find what relaxes you.
Maybe it will be listening to calming music, or taking a long bath.

Stay safe when exercising.,
Develop your exercise regimen with your medical team.,
Engage in aerobic walking.Aerobic walking is the act of walking about with a speed, purpose, and vigor in order to improve your health and overall vitality.,
Ride your bike.,
Go swimming.,
Do some resistance training.Resistance training – also known as strength training or weight training – requires the use of weights or resistance equipment to help you build muscle mass.",How to Relieve Cancer Fatigue with Integrative Therapy1," Always exercise at a level that is appropriate for your fitness and energy levels. For instance, if you are riding your bike and feel fatigued, do not continue. End your bike ride and relax until you feel that you have the strength to continue, or combat your cancer fatigue with exercise another day.Drink water to stay hydrated while exercising. Avoid drinking sugary drinks like soda and sweet juices, alcohol, and caffeinated beverages.
Know when to stop exercising. If you begin feeling dizzy, lightheaded, nauseous, pain that does not recede (especially in your chest or heart), or your heart is racing, end your exercise routine for the day.;
, Your medical team will be able to advise you about what sort of exercise is best for you given your specific condition and medical history. They will also be able to answer any questions you might have about the impact of certain exercises on your cancer fatigue., To get started, strap on a pair of comfortable walking shoes.


Start small. For instance, you might walk briskly for five minutes around your block. After a few weeks when you begin to feel less fatigued, you might increase your walks to ten minutes daily. A few weeks beyond that, you might increase your walks to fifteen minutes daily. You can build endurance by taking multiple short walks per day instead of one long one. For example, instead of taking one 30 minute walk, take three 10 minute walks throughout the day.
Aerobic walking can relieve cancer fatigue., Bicycling is a low-impact exercise, meaning it does not put too much strain on your muscles, bones, and joints. It’s also a great way to exercise your whole body.You could bike in the bike lane around your city, or ride your bike on the paths at your local park.
If you have poor coordination or balance, you might be better off using a stationary (non-moving) bike at your local gym. Call your local gym to find out if they have stationary bikes available., Swimming is a fun and relaxing exercise that could reduce your cancer fatigue. There are many places to swim. If you live near the sea, you could swim in the sea. If you live near a large lake, you could swim in the lake. If your community offers a community swimming area – for instance, a high school pool – go swimming there.Don’t swim out too far. Stay in view of the shore.
Only swim where there are lifeguards on duty.
Never swim outside during storms and hurricanes.

, Common forms of resistance training include pushups, sit-ups, and weightlifting. There are many types of weightlifting, including free weights, barbells, bench presses, and dumbbells.One advantage of resistance training is that you can do many of the exercises at home. For example, you can lift milk cartons or large food cans instead of free weights.Start out easy. Lift a small amount of about five pounds. If you feel that you have the strength to lift more, or you are not mildly worn out after 10-12 repetitions of the particular resistance training exercise you’re engaged in, add weight in small increments of about five pounds.
Never lift more than you can handle. Be honest with yourself and don’t push your cancer-fatigued body beyond what it can handle.
If you need help developing your resistance training form, consult an athletic trainer.

Work with your doctor to come up with a diet plan that will help keep your fatigue in check and get you the nutrition that you need. Your doctor may also be able to refer you to a dietitian who specializes in working with cancer patients., Dehydration can contribute to fatigue. In general, doctors recommend that you get at least eight to twelve cups (about 2-3 liters) of fluid daily.If you are maintaining your weight, try to get most of your fluid in the form of water.
If you are trying to gain weight, drink high-calorie fluids like fruit juice, milk, or sports drinks.

Stock up on healthy, pre-packaged foods, like fruit cups, cheese sticks, yogurt cups, and canned soup. These foods make good snacks or small meals that require little time and energy to prepare.

, A variety of dietary supplements may be helpful in managing cancer related fatigue and other cancer symptoms. However, some dietary supplements may interact with your medications or cause other adverse effects, so they should be used with caution.Always talk to your doctor before starting any supplement. Try to choose supplements that have been evaluated by a third party verifier, like USP.
L-carnitine and ginseng are two supplements that have been shown to be particularly helpful in fighting cancer fatigue. Talk to your doctor or a cancer dietitian about whether these supplements would be appropriate for you, and what dosage they would recommend.

If a tumor is detected via a clinical diagnosis, ultrasound, and blood tests, then the doctor will remove the tumor in a process called a radical inguinal orchiectomy.In addition to the tumor, the testicle and spermatic cord will also be removed. If you remove the entire testicle, you have the option of getting a testicular implant.The tumor and other tissue is then sent to a lab to be examined for cancerous cells.;
, If the analysis of the tumor shows that there are cancerous cells, then your doctor will order imaging tests, such as an ultrasound (to check for fluid or for a solid mass), x-rays, MRIs, CT, PET, or bone scans. The doctor will need images of your body to determine certain important things about your cancer.Imaging tests will be used to determine if and where the cancer has spread. These tests can help the doctor detect if the cancer has spread to other areas, like the lymph nodes or other organs. A CT scan is recommended if there is suspected metastatic spread to the pelvis and thorax.
Imaging tests are also used to see if the treatment is working and if the cancer is returning after treatment.

, Testicular cancer is divided in stages. The stage of the cancer refers to the severity of the cancer. The stage is determined from the examination of the tumor, where the cancer cells are studies in a lab. Your treatment depends on the stage of cancer, so you will always get your cancer staged when you get diagnosed.Stage 0 testicular cancer occurs when abnormal cells are found in the testicles. The cells may evolve into cancer, but at this stage they are just abnormal. This may be something like a testicular scar.
Stage I cancer is discovered after the testicle(s) is removed. Stage I cancer occurs when the cancer is either in the testicle or the membranes around the testicle. Stage I may also be in the spermatic cord or scrotum. Surgery and close monitoring may be all the treatment that is needed for stage I. Sometimes, chemotherapy or radiation is also used.
Stage II cancer is when the cancer is in the testicle, scrotum, and spermatic cord, along with the lymph nodes in the abdomen. Stage II often is treated with radiation therapy. Sometimes, mild chemotherapy is also used.
Stage III cancer has the same markers as stage II but has also spread to lymph nodes beyond the abdomen, to the lungs, or other parts of the body. Surgery is often needed to remove tumors in other parts of the body, along with chemotherapy.Chemotherapy may involve cisplatin based combination therapy with three cycles of bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin. However, men with compromised pulmonary function have to be careful if they are on bleomycin because this chemotherapy can cause lung injury.

, You will work with a treatment team when you undergo treatment for testicular cancer. Your team will vary depending on what the stage of your cancer is and your options for treating that stage.You will probably have a urologist, physician assistant, nurses, and nurse practitioners.
If you have radiation therapy, you will have a radiation oncologist. If you undergo chemotherapy, you will have a medical oncologist.
You may also have social workers or other mental health professionals, physical therapists, or other professionals.

, When deciding where to undergo treatment, make sure you choose a place that actively treats testicular cancer. Some hospitals or treatment centers may specialize in other types of cancer, such as breast cancer, lung cancer, or colon cancer. However, any National Institutes of Health (NIH) recognized cancer treatment center will provide excellent treatment, so making this distinction is important. These treatment centers are known as NCIs, or National Cancer Institutes.There are 69 NIH NCI-Designated Cancer Centers across the country. These are the best places to go for cancer treatment. These institutions usually do clinical and basic science research, and they have an academic approach highly focused on the treatment of all types of cancer.

, One common treatment for cancer that is not found in any place in the body except the testicle is careful observation. After surgery removes the testicle, you may need no other treatment. For the next decade, you will have regular check ups to monitor your body to make sure the cancer has not returned.You will get exams and blood tests every three to six months for a year after your surgery, then every six to nine months. You will also have CT scans and x-rays to check for cancers in other parts of your body.
Radiation and chemotherapy will be used if cancer cells are found in other parts of your body.

, Radiation therapy is a common cancer treatment for stage II cancer. During radiation therapy, high-powered x-rays and other radiation are used to stop the growth and kill cancer cells. Radiation therapy is most commonly used to destroy cancer cells in the lymph nodes.Radiation is done externally by placing the machine over the affected area. Radiation therapy is painless.
Radiation is sometimes used with early stage II cancers to kill any cancer cells that may be developing in the lymph nodes.
Radiation is used in stage III when the cancer has spread metastatically to other parts of the body.

, Chemotherapy is a drug treatment for testicular cancer that is generally injected directly into the vein with a needle. The injected drug travels through the body to get to the cancer cells. This treatment finds and kills cancer cells not attached to the tumor that are floating through your body.Chemotherapy is generally used with stage I, II, or III cancer when the cancer has moved beyond the testicle. If the cancer is only in the testicle, chemotherapy will not be used. Chemotherapy is also used when the cancer is recurrent.
Chemotherapy, usually a cisplatin based therapy, is administered in cycles of treatment and rest. The treatment may take weeks or months to complete.

, If you have some types of stage I or II cancer, you will need to have the lymph nodes in your abdomen removed. This is done in a process called a retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND). The surgery is done via an incision in the abdominal region, and the lymph nodes are removed from the back of the abdomen.Removing the lymph nodes may cause damage to nearby nerves, which can lead to problems with ejaculation., If you have certain types of advanced stage testicular cancer, the cancer may have moved to other parts of the body. You may need to get surgery on other parts of your body if chemotherapy or radiation has not killed the cancer cells.For example, you may have to get tumors removed in your lungs, brain, liver, or other organs.

, If you do not have life-threatening cancer, you may consider getting a second opinion. A second opinion can help you feel confident that your cancer diagnosis is correct. A second opinion can also help give you an idea of common treatment options.Don’t feel like you can’t get a second opinion just because a doctor told you that you had cancer. Your health and treatment is in your hands, and you have a say. If you don’t feel comfortable with a treatment option or diagnosis, get a second opinion.

, If you have testicular cancer but still want to be able to have children, you may consider sperm banking. Testicular cancer does not mean you will be infertile; however, changes due to the cancer, chemotherapy, or surgery may cause low sperm counts, ejaculation problems, or infertility.Sperm banking is where you freeze samples of your sperm so your partner can be impregnated via artificial insemination later.
Advanced stages of testicular cancer are always offered sperm banking.

, You may need testosterone replacement therapy if you have had one or both testicles removed. You may be given testosterone as an injection, patch, or gel. Testosterone replacement therapy can help increase your libido and help you with erectile problems.Low levels of testosterone may cause fatigue, lower sex drive, reduced growth of body hair, erectile dysfunction, and weight gain.
Side effects of TRT are mild. You may experience acne or oily skin, swollen breasts, and increased need to urinate. TRT may increase the risk of prostate cancer, so discuss this with your doctor.

, If the cancer spreads to or damages your lymph nodes, you may experience retrograde ejaculation. This is a condition where the damaged lymph nodes make the semen you ejaculate travel back into your body, into the bladder. You can orgasm, but you cannot impregnate a partner.To treat retrograde ejaculation, you can take medicine to strengthen the bladder to help keep the semen from flowing into it.
You can also impregnate your partner with by artificial insemination or in-vitro fertilization.

, You may decide to do a research clinical trial as part of your cancer treatment. Many cancer treatments offer the newest advanced cancer treatments, and often they are a way to get the newest treatments that aren’t available to the general public yet.Clinical trials help doctors and researchers learn new and better ways to treat cancer.
Ask your doctor if the treatment center or hospital does clinical trials. You can also look online for clinical trials run by cancer organizations and cancer research hospitals.
Clinical trials may not be right for everyone. Talk to your doctor.

Opt for standard chemotherapy.Standard chemotherapy agents include Melphalan (Algerian), Cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan), Doxorubicin (Adriamycine), and Liposomal Doxorubicin (Doxil).,
Ask your doctor for a steroid prescription.Steroids commonly used in the treatment of multiple myeloma include Dexamethasone and Prednisone.,
Try the newer drugs specifically for multiple myeloma.A number of new drugs have emerged as new possibilities for the treatment of multiple myeloma and have recently been approved for treatment.,
Receive immunotherapy.The names of these medications are elotuzumab (Empliciti) and daratumumab (Darzalex).,
Consult your doctor to determine the ideal treatment plan for you.",How to Treat Multiple Myeloma1," Chemotherapy is often quite successful at controlling multiple myeloma; however, used on its own, it is rarely fully curative (although there are some case reports where it has lead to full remission of the cancer).;
, Dexamethasone is most commonly used, and it can be prescribed either as a tablet or as an injection.


Dexamethasone works both by diminishing inflammation and potential pain caused by the cancer, as well as by inducing death of the cancer cells themselves, so the benefits of the drug are several-fold., These include thalidomide (Thalomid), lenalidomide (REVLIMID), bortezomib (Velcade), carfilzomib (Kyprolis), ixazomib (Ninlaro), and pomalidomide (Pomalyst). These are most often considered for new diagnoses of multiple myeloma, and/or for cases that have been unsuccessful at being cured via other methods. Speak to your doctor for further information about considering these new drugs.

, They are specifically designed to target the cancer cells via immunological mechanisms (using antibodies that attach specifically to cancerous cells), with the goal of removing these cancerous cells from the body.


Immunotherapy is often used for people whose multiple myeloma has continued to progress, despite the trial of other medical therapies.

, Ultimately, the treatment of multiple myeloma is a complex issue that is best addressed by medical specialists. There are a variety of options available, and you will most likely be receiving multiple modes of treatment, either at the same time or in sequence, to treat your cancer.

"

Understand that a stem cell transplant is another treatment option.A stem cell transplant holds the potential to be a very effective form of treatment, and it can lead to cure from multiple myeloma for about 4% of people (in others, it improves the disease but not to the point of cure).,
Be aware of the eligibility criteria for a stem cell transplant.Due to the higher risk of this treatment, it is up to your doctor's discretion whether he or she recommends to proceed with it.,
Receive strong chemotherapy prior to the stem cell transplant.You will be given a high dose of chemotherapy treatment prior to the transplant to eliminate as many of the cancer cells as possible from your bone marrow.",How to Treat Multiple Myeloma2," The caveat to stem cell transplants is that, because they are higher risk procedures, there are certain eligibility criteria that must be met in order to receive this treatment.


Stem cell transplants are usually autologous, meaning that they use your own cells in order to ensure an exact match. Sometimes another's cells can be used for the transplant, but this is much less common.

, Factors where doctors would likely not recommend a stem cell transplant include:


Age greater than 77 years old
Significant heart problems or heart disease
Impaired kidney function
Impaired liver function
Overall poor health and day-to-day function, as assessed by your physician.

, This is another reason that good health is key in order to undergo this treatment; people with poor health may not be able to tolerate the intense chemotherapy that is required prior to the stem cell transplant. The goal of the chemotherapy is to remove the diseased cells from your bone marrow prior to transplanting healthy ones; if all of the diseased cells are unable to be removed, it puts you at risk of a relapse down the road.


If you are going to be cured of multiple myeloma, strong chemotherapy followed by a stem cell transplant is your best bet. Although it can be a challenging procedure to go through, it is likely to be the most effective.
Radiation may also be given prior to a stem cell transplant as a further means to get rid of as many cancer cells as possible prior to the transplant."

Discuss aspirin with your doctor.,
Try phlebotomy.,
Ask about prescription medications.,
Discuss treatments that target genetic mutations.,
Treat itchiness medically.,
Discuss radiation treatment.",How to Treat Polycythemia Vera1," Aspirin can be used to reduce the risk of things like blood clots and strokes. Your doctor may want you to take a low dose of aspirin each day depending on your current health.Usually, aspirin is the first course of treatment. Doses are usually around 81 milligrams, but your dose may be lower or higher depending on your health.
Ask your doctor any questions you have regarding when and how to take aspirin if they suggest it would help with your PV. Also, let your doctor know about any existing medications you're taking in case they interact poorly with aspirin.;
, Phlebotomy is a medical treatment in which a needle is used to remove small amounts of blood from your body. Your doctor may suggest phlebotomy to treat your PV.The goal of phlebotomy is to reduce blood cell count and get your blood thickness closer to normal. The treatment lasts several weeks. In most cases, one unit of blood is removed during each session but treatments vary.
Phlebotomy is similar to donating blood in that a needle removes blood from your body. If your doctor suggests phlebotomy, make sure you ask them about any kind of self care you need to practice before or after the procedure.

, In addition to aspirin, prescription medications can be used to treat PV. Talk over prescription medications with your doctor and see if they think medications would help with your PV.Hydroxyurea is one medication frequently prescribed for patients with PV. It reduces the number of red blood cells, helping with blood flow and blood thickness.
Interferon-alpha is a substance that your body makes naturally. Taking interferon-alpha substitutes can help with PV, as they help your immune system fight excess bone marrow cells.

, If none of the standard treatments are not helping control your PV, talk to your doctor about some new treatments that are aimed at the genetic mutations that cause PV (known as the JAK or JAK-STAT pathway). These new treatments include JAK inhibitors, which block the JAK-STAT pathway and prevent it from producing too many blood cells; and HDAC inhibitors, which slow down the overproduction of red blood cells., Itchiness is a common symptom of PV. While it can be treated at home, extreme itchiness can be treated medically.Medications like antihistamines may be prescribed to treat itching, depending on your current health and existing medications.
Ultralight therapy may relieve itchiness.
Medications typically used to treat depression, such as Prozac and serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), may help target itchiness as well.

, Your doctor may suggest radiation treatment as this can help suppress overactive cells. This helps keep things like blood flow and blood thickness at normal levels.If your doctor thinks radiation would work for you, they will go over the process, including before and after care, carefully with you. Ask your doctor any questions you have at this time. The type and frequency of radiation treatment varies depending on the progression of your PV.
Radiation treatment can increase your risk for leukemia. If your doctor thinks you're at an increased risk for leukemia, they may advise against radiation treatment.

Stay hydrated.,
Treat itchy skin.,
Stay away from extreme temperatures.,
Monitor sores closely.",How to Treat Polycythemia Vera2," Proper hydration is important when treating PV. Dehydration can worsen your condition, so make sure to drink water frequently.Keep a water bottle on hand throughout the day and periodically take sips.
Stop at a water fountain whenever you see one to take a drink.
If you dislike drinking plain water, try flavored seltzer water or adding things like fruit to tap water.

, Itchy skin can be a major problem if you have PV. There are many ways to minimize and treat itchiness at home if it's an issue for you.Use lotions and other moisturizers on a regular basis, especially when your skin feels dry and itchy. These can hydrate your skin, lessening itchiness.
Heat can make itchiness worse, so avoid hot showers, hot tubs, and other exposure to hot water. Use warm water instead of hot water when bathing and showering.
Always pat your skin dry after taking a shower or bath. Rubbing your skin can make itchiness worse. After getting out of the shower, use a clean towel to gently pat water off of your skin.
Avoid scratching when you're itchy. This can make itchiness worse and increase your risk for an infection. It can help to trim your nails very short or wear gloves or mittens during the day to reduce the temptation to itch.

, Extreme hot and cold can worsen symptoms of PV. Take measures to protect yourself from extreme temperatures.Always bundle up if you have to go out in cold weather.
Drink extra liquids in hot weather and wear things like visors to protect yourself from the sun. You should also use sunscreen.

, People with PV commonly have non-healing sores, such as bruises or scrapes from normal activities, that are very slow to heal. The slowed blood flow in PV delays healing, so minor sores may take much longer to heal than normal. Look over your body regularly if you have PV to keep an eye out for new sores.Feet are particularly prone to sores, so check your feet frequently. Talk to your doctor about any new sores you find.
Take extra care with your sores until they are healed. Bandage them carefully and try not to bump them.

"
"
Talk to your doctor about physical activity.,
Seek emotional support.,
Quit smoking.",How to Treat Polycythemia Vera3," For many people, physical activity is safe if you have PV. However, if you develop complications like an enlarged spleen, you may have to avoid things like contact sports. Discuss safe physical activity each time you see your doctor.Walking may help with side effects such as fatigue as it can help with blood circulation. Discuss regular walking with your doctor to see if it's a safe option for you., Any type of cancer can be difficult on an emotional level. In addition to treating physical symptoms, treat emotional ones. Seek out support from friends and loved ones to help you cope during this difficult time.Talk to your friends and family members about how you feel. Ask them to let you vent on occasion if you're feeling scared, frustrated, or otherwise down.
See if you can find a cancer support group online or in your area.
You may benefit from professional counseling if you're feeling very depressed or stressed about your diagnosis.

, If you smoke, take measures to quit. Smoking can make symptoms of PV worse, so talk to your doctor about quitting.Make an appointment with your doctor to make an action plan for quitting. Some people quit cold turkey while others quit gradually. Your doctor may also suggest medications to help you quit.Seek support. See if you can find a support group for those quitting smoking at your local hospital. If there are no support groups in your area, you can find support groups online.

Understand the different types of hormone therapy.,
Consider the side effects and efficacy of hormone therapy.",How to Treat Prostate Cancer with Androgen Deprivation Therapy," After your initial diagnosis of prostate cancer in previously untreated prostate cancer patients, you’ll likely schedule a series of appointments with an oncological specialist. Your doctor will evaluate your condition and circumstances and make a recommendation about potential treatments.


A physician will gather detailed medical history and perform a physical exam, if they have not done so already.
Your doctor will explain to you your diagnosis, prognosis, and potential treatments. Based on diagnostics, they will likely talk about your “grade” or level of prostate cancer. Prostate cancer is graded on a scale from 1 through 10, with 5 or above indicating tissue that is extremely abnormal and indicative of cancer. This is called a Gleason Score the higher the Gleason Score the more aggressive the cancer is.
It is very likely that you’ll have to consult your doctor several times before they commit you to a course of hormone therapy.;
, Your specialist will recommend diagnostics that will confirm your initial diagnosis and gather more information about your condition. These diagnostics are critical in helping your physician arrive at an informed idea about future treatment.


A physician will run a prostate-specific antigen blood test. They may do this several times.
Your specialist will conduct a transrectal ultrasound.
If earlier diagnostics indicate prostate cancer, they will likely conduct a prostate biopsy.
There are a variety of other diagnostics that may be used to see if prostate cancer has spread beyond the prostate. These include a bone scan, a CT scan, MRI, or lymph node biopsy.Late prostate cancer frequently metastasizes to the lumbar spine with back pain.

, After you’ve spoken to your doctor and submitted to diagnostics, you and your doctor will be able to decide on a specific type of hormone therapy treatment. It is important to heed the advice of your physician, as they have substantial experience.


If you feel ill-advised, you should get a second opinion.
Depending on your situation, your doctor will suggest a specific course of hormone treatment. However, they may offer you different options. Take time to think about the pros and cons of each option.
Talk to your family about the different options your doctor has suggested. They may be able to offer you support or they may have some insight you overlooked. In addition, the option you pick might impact your family in the future., As a first step, your doctor may prescribe oral medication, such as a GnRH agonist to block the hypothalamus pituitary axis. This medication will reduce the amount or effectiveness of androgens in your body. This is a less aggressive option, but may provide positive results that reduce dangers associated with more invasive procedures like surgery.


Oral medication may be prescribed over a short or long period.
Make sure to take your medicine as recommended by your doctor.
Note that cancer may build resistance to androgen therapy over time., Hormone treatment—oral or injectable—is often prescribed prior to or after surgery or radiation. Using antiandrogens with a GnRH agonist produces a combined androgen blockade.


In some cases, a doctor will prescribe hormone treatment to shrink your cancer in preparation for surgical removal.
Other times, your doctor will prescribe hormone treatment after surgery or radiation to shrink or weaken any cancer that is remaining.
This is one of the most aggressive treatment options., Your doctor might suggest that you have medicine injected into you, or implanted. This medicine will inhibit the ability of your testicles to produce androgens – a process known as chemical castration.


Chemical castration is reversible once the drugs are stopped or removed from the body.
This treatment may be very costly.
A side effect of chemical castration is testicle shrinkage – something that may not be reversible.
Injectable medicine will need to be repeated every month.
The implant may need to be replaced yearly or at the cessation of your hormone therapy treatment., Perhaps the most invasive option of getting hormone therapy is to have a surgeon remove your testicles. This will eliminate androgens produced by the testicles.


This is the least costly option of treatment.
This will result in permanent physiological changes, like weight gain and increased breast tissue, that accompany drastically decreased testosterone production in your body.
This option is effective because the testicles produce 80% to 90% of the body’s testosterone., Your first step in learning about hormone therapy is to know when – and under what circumstances – doctors prescribe its use. Ultimately, not all people and all stages of prostate cancer will merit use of hormone therapy. Hormone therapy is often used:


When prostate cancer is too large to be treated through surgery or radiation.
If prostate cancer persists following surgery or radiation.
In conjunction with other treatments.
As a precursor to another, more invasive, treatment., Before deciding on treatment, you need to understand the vastly different methods of doing so. Ultimately, different approaches of hormone treatment vary in levels of invasiveness or permanence.


Surgical castration, which removes the testicles – the body’s largest source of androgens.
Injectable or implantable drugs that reduce the amount of testosterone created by your testicles.
Pharmaceuticals that reduce the amount of testosterone and other androgens created by your body.
Medications that prevent androgens from operating properly., Like other types of cancer treatment, androgen deprivation therapy has varying side effects and degrees of efficacy.


Efficacy depends on a wide number of factors, including its use in conjunction with other treatments, the severity of the cancer, and the age or general health of the patient.
Side effects may include: hot flashes, lowered sex drive, diminishment of testicles, osteoporosis, bone fractures, tiredness, nausea, and depression.There are also effects on body composition and metabolism, which may include decrease in lean muscle mass, increased fat storage, decreased muscle strength, tenderness or growth of the breast tissue, and decreased insulin sensitivity.
Some studies suggest that ADT can increase morbidity and mortality from cardiac disease.

Be ready for pre-treatment tests.",How to Treat Leukemia," Chemotherapy is a type of chemical that works to kill the cancer cells. One way to take chemotherapy is through an oral pill. While a pill may seem less intimidating, it does have the same chemicals as other types of chemotherapy, and you need to pay close attention to the instructions given to you by your doctor or pharmacist.For instance, many chemotherapy pills must be taken on a very regular schedule that you shouldn't change. You will build up a certain level of the drug in your system, which you maintain with a regular schedule. You may take them in rounds to give your healthy cells a chance to thrive.You also must keep them separately from your other pills if you use a pill organizer.
The pill form is used to treat chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML).The oral medication used to treat CML are known as tyrosine kinase inhibitors.;
, Another type of chemotherapy is injected straight into your veins. This type of chemotherapy is used to treat almost every type of cancer, though your doctor may lean on pills more for more chronic versions.To receive this type of chemotherapy, you must visit a clinic. The chemicals are dripped into your veins through an IV. Each treatment is given over a few hours or days.
You may need a cannula inserted in your hand or arm each time you come in, or you may receive a central line or peripherally inserted central catheter, which can be left in over a longer period of time. Another option for longer-term placement is rubber implanted port., This treatment is another type of chemotherapy which is injected into your spinal cord and brain instead of into your blood.This treatment is usually given if the cancer has moved to your nervous system, as traditional chemotherapy types may not reach these areas.Generally, you'll need to lay down for a while after this injection, which gives the chemotherapy drugs a chance to move into place.
This procedure is relatively rare when compared to other types of chemotherapy., Chemotherapy comes with an unfortunate number of side effects, due to the fact that it can destroy or harm normal cells along with the cancer cells. Mainly, the cells it harms will be in your bone marrow, GI tract, mouth, and hair. Because it destroys these cells, it can cause some major side effects, which you can deal with through traditional and naturopathic medicine.Some of the major side effects include sexual dysfunction, hair loss, mouth sores, nerve damage, nausea, changes in taste, heart damage or weakness, fatigue, and lowered blood cell counts.
You'll need to make certain life changes, like finding food that appeals to you to combat taste changes and learning exercises to help with the tiredness.
You may need to take medications to help you combat nausea and lowered white blood cell counts and supplements to help with cardiotoxicity.
For hair loss, mouth sores, sexual dysfunction, and nerve damage, you'll need to develop routines with the help of your naturopath and mind-body therapist to deal with the emotional and physical ramifications of these side effects.
Oral chemotherapy may also cause hand-foot syndrome, which is where you have pain and swelling in your hands and feet. If you develop this symptom, your doctor may be able to change your dosage to lessen the effect., This type of therapy uses X-rays or other methods to deliver radiation to your body to help kill the cancer cells. This therapy can be targeted to one particular part of your body, or it can be used across your body.Side effects can vary widely. You may be more tired, have stomach problems, or skin irritation. You may also develop more infections.
How severe your side effects are will likely be affected by how long and how often you have this treatment, as well as how much of your body is radiated. , This treatment is often used together with other treatments. Its benefit is it can specifically target the leukemia cells, which in turn can manage the disease.Targeted therapy is often used to help manage chronic leukemia, such as chronic myelogenous leukemia.Like chemotherapy, targeted therapy can cause some side effects. The primary side effects are fatigue and an increased chance of infections.
You may also run a fever, develop a rash, experience headaches, have nausea, or be short of breath., This type of therapy uses your body's own defenses to fight off the leukemia. In theory, your body should recognize cancer cells as being harmful or abnormal and destroy them; however, when you've developed cancer, something has gone wrong. For instance, the cancer finds a way to hide from your immune system or it disables part of the response. Biological therapy tries to make your immune system attack the cancer cells as it should.One type of biological therapy uses a drug or chemical to tell your immune system what to do.
Another option is taking some of your immune cells out of your body to teach them in a lab to attack the cells. Then the immune cells are put back in your body to destroy cancer cells.
A third option is forcing the cancer cells to reveal themselves to your immune system. In other words, if the cancer cells are using certain signals to hide by turning them on or off, the therapy helps change those signals back so that your immune system can recognize the cells.
However, most biological therapy is still in clinical trials, so you may need to get on a clinical trial to receive it. Ask your doctor about clinical trials or check with the major research hospitals to see if they have clinical trials in this area.

, A particularly aggressive form of treatment is stem cell transplant, which is generally given after you've already had chemotherapy and radiation to destroy the affected bone marrow. You'll be given healthy stem cells, sometimes your own and sometimes cells donated from another person. The stem cells can help create new and healthy bone marrow.If your own stem cells are used (autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant), they will be collected and stored before you go through chemotherapy. If another person's stem cells are used (allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant), they must undergo tests to make sure they are a match.
Once you have the transplant, you will need time to recover, usually a matter of months, and you will likely have pain in your bones, as well as nerve damage, which can lead to numbness. Other complications include graft versus host disease (GVHD), cardiac disease, infection, and secondary cancers. You can work with a doctor to help control this pain and reduce your risk of developing other complications.Bone marrow transplants, in which you receive healthy bone marrow from another person, are similar to stem cell transplants; however, stem cell transplants are now more common., Clinical trials are sometimes used when other types of treatments are not successful at curing cancer. Clinical trials have various criteria patients must meet in order to participate, such as having a certain type of leukemia or being relatively healthy. Ask your doctor about clinical trials. You can also check with the major teaching hospitals and the Cancer Treatment Centers of America.

, One of the main symptoms of leukemia is bleeding or bruising easily, as leukemia affects the blood's ability to form a blood clot.You may also have stomach pain, unexplained fevers, and constant fatigue, as well pain in your joints or bones.Other symptoms include swollen lymph nodes or enlarged spleen or liver and weight loss.
You may notice you are sweating more at night. You may also have infections more often and have petechiae on your skin (small, red spots).

, If you have a combination of these symptoms, you should see your doctor; however, many of these symptoms can point to other diseases, too, some much less serious. Don't immediately assume you have leukemia if you have a couple of these symptoms.If the doctor suspects you may have leukemia, they will check for physical symptoms, such as feeling your lymph nodes and sometimes your abdomen.
The doctor will also likely run a complete blood count to check your blood count levels.
If those tests indicate leukemia is likely, the doctor will do other tests, such as biopsies, spinal taps, X-rays, MRIs, CT scans, and/or ultrasounds., Myelogenous leukemia and lymphocytic leukemia are the two main forms, which can be either chronic and acute. Therefore, the four main diagnoses are acute lymphocytic leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, acute myelogenous leukemia, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia.Chronic refers to the fact that leukemia isn't as fast-acting as acute. With acute leukemia, the cancer is attacking developing cells, so it is more aggressive.
""Myelogenous"" and ""lymphocytic"" denote which type of white blood cells are affected.

, Once you're diagnosed with leukemia, you'll likely work with a team of doctors and specialists who will supervise your care, including an oncologist (cancer doctor), a pathologist (specializes in diseased tissue), and a hematologist (blood doctor). You'll also likely have a psychologist, a nutritionist, and a clinical nurse specialist. You may work with a naturopath, who can help you with alternative medicine solutions to side effects like nausea., You'll need tests to determine the strength and type of your leukemia, of course, but you'll also need tests to determine your overall health. Because many treatments for leukemia are aggressive, you have to be healthy to withstand them. If you are not healthy enough, your doctor will consider other treatments.You will likely have a blood test to see if your liver and kidney will hold up to the chemotherapy.
You will also have scans to determine a starting point for your treatment.

About 80% of patients recover from throat cancer if the surgery is a success in the early stages of the disease.Surgery using endoscopy, where tumors on the surface of your throat or your vocal cords are removed through your mouth no incisions, may be used. Your doctor may be able to scrape off or cut out the tumors depending on their size and location.Your doctor may also use laser surgery to remove smaller tumors in your throat. The laser will be inserted into your throat to vaporize tumors in your throat.;
, Your doctor may remove all or part of your voice box to get rid of tumors on your voice box. Your doctor will do their best to preserve your ability to speak and breathe normally using your mouth and throat.If there are larger tumors on your voice box, your doctor may need to remove your entire voice box. During surgery, the doctor may attach your windpipe to a hole in your throat to allow you to breathe. If your entire larynx must be removed, you will likely work with a speech pathologist to help you learn how to speak without your voice box.

, Surgery on your lymph nodes may need to be performed if the cancer has spread deep within your neck. Your doctor may recommend removing some or all of your lymph nodes to ensure the cancer does not spread.Surgically removing the lymph nodes is controversial, but it may be necessary, as throat cancer can recur or spread through your lymph system. Your doctor may recommend removing your lymph nodes to check if cancer is present and to lower the risk of the cancer coming back., Though surgery can successfully remove the cancerous cells from your throat, especially if it is in the early stages of the disease, there are still risks and side effects associated with this option. Your doctor should outline all the risks of the surgery before you undergo the procedure.You are at risk of bleeding and developing an infection during surgery.
You may also experience complications after the surgery, such as difficulty swallowing or speaking. Your doctor should prepare you for these complications and you should seek support after surgery to ensure you can still maintain a positive quality of life.

Speak to your doctor about radiation therapy.,
Combine radiation with other treatments for more advanced cancer.,
Learn the symptoms of radiation therapy.",How to Treat Throat Cancer2," Radiation therapy may be a good option if your cancer is caught early, such as Stage I or Stage II cancer. Many patients have a high survival rate after the use of radiation therapy to remove cancerous cells in their body, especially if the cancer is detected early. Radiation therapy uses high-energy beams from X-rays and protons to kill cancerous cells in your throat.Your doctor may use a large machine outside your body, known as external beam radiation. You can also receive radiation through small radioactive seeds and wires placed inside your body, near your cancer, known as brachytherapy.
Your doctor may suggest 3-D conformal radiation therapy, where several radiation beams are doled out in the exact shape of your tumor or tumors. You may also get radiation in the form of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), where the treatment is customized to the specific shape of your tumor. This allows the radiation to be more precise., If you have a more advanced stage of throat cancer, your doctor may recommend doing radiation therapy in tandem with other treatments, such as surgery or chemotherapy. You may also combine radiation with other treatments if you have very large tumors on your throat.If you have very advanced throat cancer, your doctor may suggest radiation therapy to reduce your symptoms and make you more comfortable as your body experiences the cancer.

, Your doctor should outline the symptoms of radiation therapy before you undergo treatment so you know what to expect. Many patients develop sores in their mouth and throat, which can make eating and drinking difficult. They may then experience weight loss and malnutrition because they cannot eat or drink.You may also experience skin issues, such as blistering or peeling, dry mouth, difficulty swallowing, a loss of taste, hoarseness, or difficulty breathing.
Keep in mind many of these side effects will go away after you stop radiation therapy.

"
"
Talk to your doctor about chemotherapy drugs.,
Note the side effects of chemotherapy.,
Consider combining chemotherapy with radiation therapy.",How to Treat Throat Cancer3," Chemotherapy is used to try to kill off cancer cells by administering certain drugs. Your doctor may suggest the use of chemotherapy if your cancer is in the early to middle stages to try to promptly attack and kill the cancerous cells in your throat.Your doctor may suggest several chemotherapy drugs for throat cancer, including Cisplatin, Carboplatin, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), Docetaxel, Paclitaxel, Bleomycin, Methotrexate, and Ifosfamide.
Your doctor may suggest the use of one drug or two or more drugs together. You will likely be prescribed chemotherapy in cycles of a few weeks at a time, with a rest period between each cycle of treatment so your body can recover.

, Chemotherapy can be effective at attacking your cancer cells. But it can also attack other cells in your body, such as cells in your bone marrow, your mouth, and your intestines. You may also experience common side effects while on chemo, such as nausea, vomiting, a loss of appetite, mouth sores, diarrhea, hair loss, fatigue, and a higher risk of infection and bleeding.Keep in mind some chemotherapy drugs can also cause other side effects like nerve damage, numbness, tingling, and pain in your hands and feet.
Most of the side effects of chemotherapy will go away after the treatment is done, but some can last for a long period of time or be permanent. You should let your doctor know when you experience certain side effects while on chemotherapy, as there are ways to treat or prevent some of these side effects.

, This form of chemo is called chemoradiation, where chemotherapy is given at the same time as radiation treatment. Your doctor may suggest this course of treatment instead of surgery or after you have throat surgery to ensure the cancer does not return.Your doctor may suggest a dose of chemotherapy every three weeks during radiation therapy. The exact dosage will depend on the stage of your throat cancer.
Some chemotherapy drugs can make the cancer cells in your throat more responsive to radiation therapy, which can then help to kill off the cancer cells more effectively. However, combining radiation and chemotherapy can increase the side effects you experience on both treatments."

Evaluate your cat’s quality of life.,
Consider the cost of treatment.,
Discuss the requirements of care with your veterinarian.,
Observe your cat’s clinical signs.,
Schedule an appointment with your veterinarian.,
Talk with your veterinarian.,
Discuss surgical tumor removal with your veterinarian.,
Learn about chemotherapy.,
Ask your veterinarian about radiation therapy.,
Feed your cat a healthy diet.,
Administer medications to relieve treatment side effects.,
Take precautions to prevent drug exposure at home.,
Administer at-home chemotherapy.",How to Treat Feline Cancer," Quality of life should play a major factor in deciding whether to treat your cat’s cancer.If your cat seems to be generally in good spirits and does not have unmanageable pain or severe cancer-related symptoms, she may be able to handle the rigors of cancer treatment. However, if her quality of life is suffering and she seems miserable, treatment may not be the best option for her.


As much as you may want to do everything you can to treat your cat, your cat’s quality of life should take priority.
Realize that putting her through cancer treatment could make her feel even worse.;
, Treating feline cancer can be very expensive, especially if you seek treatment by a veterinary oncologist. For example, diagnosis alone can cost several hundred dollars ($500 to $800). Depending on the type of treatment that the oncologist recommends, your cat’s treatment could cost anywhere from about $800 to $6000.Your veterinarian may be able to treat your cat for less,but may not have access to more specialized treatment options (e.g., radiation therapy). He or she may end up referring you to a veterinary oncologist.
Additional costs may include special food, pain medications, and anti-nausea medications.
You may feel guilty about weighing the cost of treatment against your emotional want to treat your cat’s cancer. However, it may not be financially feasible for you to devote a significant portion of your finances towards your cat’s cancer treatment.

, Treating your cat’s cancer may involve frequent trips to your veterinarian’s office, depending on the type of treatment.Determine if you would be able to manage frequent office visits with your work schedule.


Depending on where you live, a veterinary oncologist may not be nearby. You may need to factor in the distance to reach a treatment center when deciding whether to move forward with treating your cat’s cancer.
Your cat’s cancer treatment may involve at-home administration of oral chemotherapy.Discuss this possibility with your veterinarian, and if you would feel comfortable giving your cat chemotherapy on your own.
Having a full understanding of your cat’s needs during her cancer treatment will help you make a more informed decision about whether to proceed with the treatment.
Another factor is the cat's temperament. Many chemo drugs need to be given via a catheter in the vein. If the cat is highly stressed or aggressive, then sedation may be required so you should weigh up if your cat is can cope with the additional distress and if you can cope financially with the added cost of sedation.

, Cats often try to mask their clinical signs when they are sick.As attentive a pet owner as you may be, you may not immediately notice when your cat is feeling unwell. Unfortunately, masking illness can make cancer detection difficult.The later the cancer is diagnosed by your veterinarian, the costlier and more aggressive the treatment may be.A new lump or bump is an easily visible sign of potential cancer.Clinical signs may vary based on the location of the tumor. For example, a gastrointestinal cancer would cause such symptoms as vomiting and diarrhea. With skin cancer, you may see redness and irritation, along with a lump or bump.Be mindful that your cat’s cancer may not produce any clinical signs initially, and then cause a sudden appearance of clinical signs., Take your cat to your veterinarian as soon as you start to notice clinical signs. You may not suspect cancer, but your veterinarian can run various diagnostic tests to determine why your cat is ill. When it comes to cancer, early detection and diagnosis are key.Diagnostic tests that your veterinarian may run include imaging (e.g., x-rays, ultrasound), blood work, and a biopsy.Be aware that biopsies are not always conclusive.Your veterinarian may also want to test for feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), both of which have been associated with cancer in cats (especially FeLV).The diagnostic tests can help to assess your cat’s overall health and her ability to undergo cancer treatment, as well as determine how advanced the cancer is., If the diagnostic tests reveal that your cat has cancer, talk with your veterinarian about how to move forward. He or she will understand that you will have a lot of questions and concerns about treating your cat’s cancer. For example, ask about the cost of cancer treatment, which could range from several hundred to several thousand dollars.You can also ask what may have caused your cat’s cancer. Keep in mind that feline cancer often has unknown causes.Some causes that are known include FeLV and repeated sun exposure (especially in white-headed cats).Consider getting a second opinion from a veterinary oncologist. Different veterinarians have different approaches to cancer treatment, so it may help to learn the perspectives of several veterinarians regarding your cat’s cancer treatment.A veterinary oncologist may have knowledge of treatment options that your own veterinarian may not be aware of., Surgery is a very common form of cancer treatment, particularly for skin tumors and internal tumors with distinct borders.Among the various cancer treatment options, it is considered most likely to be curative.The size of some internal tumors can cause your cat to feel unwell. For large tumors, surgical therapy can reduce the size of tumor (‘debulking’) and thus relieve some of your cat’s symptoms.Some cancers can spread to surrounding healthy tissue. For this reason, healthy tissue is often removed with the cancerous tissue during surgery.The healthy tissue can then be microscopically analyzed for signs of cancer cell invasion.
Be aware that surgery may not prevent the risk of cancer recurrence in your cat. Your veterinarian can discuss this likelihood as you are considering treatment options., Chemotherapy is another common cancer treatment. For feline cancer, it is not curative. Rather, chemotherapy is used to slow cancer cell growth and relieve clinical signs.It is also used when surgery is not an option, such as when the cancer has spread to other body parts.Your veterinarian will probably consult with a veterinary oncologist to develop a unique chemotherapy regimen for your cat.The chemotherapy regimen may change during the course of your cat’s treatment,depending on such factors as your cat’s tolerance of the medication and the cancer’s response to the medication.
Fortunately, the side effects of chemotherapy are milder in cats than in people. The most common side effects are gastrointestinal upset (e.g., vomiting, diarrhea) and loss of energy, and are frequently mild.Chemotherapy can be administered in different ways (e.g., intravenous, orally) and is administered over several minutes to several hours., Radiation therapy (RT) is another cancer treatment option for your cat. It uses x-rays or electrons to kill cancer cells.RT is often used in combination with chemotherapy and may be used after surgery if the entire tumor could not be surgically removed.Your veterinarian may suggest RT if your cat’s tumor is in a location that would make it dangerous to remove.Specialized imaging modalities, such as computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, may be needed to identify the planned site of RT.Because complete stillness is required during a session of RT, your cat would need to be under general anesthesia.RT is typically administered in small doses over several weeks.A veterinary oncologist would be able to develop a radiation therapy treatment plan for your cat.Side effects of RT vary depending on the dose and type of radiation. Common side effects are redness and discomfort at the treatment site. Your cat may need pain medication to relieve this discomfort., Cancer can produce what is called cancer cachexia: malnutrition and severe weight loss, even with an adequate amount of food being eaten. Cancer cachexia can get even worse if your cat has a loss of appetite because of the cancer and/or cancer treatment.Addressing your cat’s nutritional needs during her cancer treatment is crucial to counteracting the cachexia and keeping her as healthy and strong as possible.


There are many causes of cancer-related weight loss and loss of appetite: altered sense of taste and smell, GI upset, tumor location (e.g., in the stomach or intestines), and changes in metabolism.During cancer treatment, your cat will need to eat foods that are energy dense.Fat should be about 25-40% of your cat’s diet. Cancer cells typically don’t use fat, but fat can be used as an energy source for your cat.Protein should be another main component of your cat’s diet (40-50%), since cancer cachexia leads to loss of muscle mass and, subsequently, protein.Your cat’s diet during cancer treatment should be low in carbohydrates, since cancer cells use glucose for energy.Omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin B12 are good additions to your cat’s diet.Consult with your veterinarian to develop the ideal treatment plan for your cat while she is being treated for cancer.

, Although your cat will likely experience only mild treatment side effects, she may still need additional medication to relieve her discomfort. For example, she may need pain medication, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and opioids.Meloxicam and ketoprofen are NSAIDs approved for use in cats.Your veterinarian will need to write you a prescription for these medications. However, be aware that corticosteroids are a common part of a chemotherapy protocol. NSAIDs are NOT compatible with steroids. To combine the two could cause serious, potentially life threatening side effects such as bleeding from the gut. Always check with your veterinarian before giving any medication to your cat.
GI upset is a common side effect of NSAIDs.Your veterinarian may want to prescribe an opiate, such as morphine, if your cat has moderate to severe pain.Do not use give your cat Tylenol. Tylenol is toxic to cats.Your cat may also need anti-nausea medication to relieve treatment-induced nausea.
Follow your veterinarian’s instructions on administering medication to your cat at home.

, This is applicable if your cat is receiving chemotherapy treatment. The drugs will be in your cat’s system for up to 72 hours after drug administration,so you will need to be extra careful when handling your cat’s waste and bedding after her treatment sessions.


Wear disposable gloves when you clean your cat’s litter box and any accidents.Clean her litter box daily.Always double bag the waste and wash your hands after cleaning up after your cat.Double bag your gloves when you take them off.Keep your other pets away from your cat’s waste.Clean your cat’s bedding separately., If you are administering chemotherapy to your cat at home, it is extremely important to prevent your own exposure to the drugs. For example, you should wear gloves and refrain from eating, drinking, or chewing gum when giving her the drugs. Also, double bag your gloves when you have finished administering the chemotherapy.Do not alter the drug capsules in any way (e.g., cutting in half, dissolving in water).Wash your hands after administering the drugs.Humidity may affect the effectiveness of the medication, so do not store the chemotherapy medication in the bathroom."

Cook your own (or buy) low-salt or unsalted foods.,
Avoid ordinary processed-foods with salt and other additives, prepared, canned and bottled foods such as meats, pickles, olives, soups, chili and such, bacon, ham, sausage, bakery products and mono-sodium glutamate (MSG), and meats with added water (will have higher/added sodium content).,
Avoid using excessive amounts fake salt/salt substitute (usually potassium chloride, KCl).,
Eat a moderate, lean diet and avoid stimulants.,
Use less caffeine.,
Increase fiber.",How to Lower High Blood Pressure Without Using Medication1," Avoid excessive table salt (sodium chloride, NaCl). You definitely need a small amount of salt (both sodium, Na, and chloride, Cl) in your diet. Sodium helps regulate electrical processes in the nerves and muscles but excess can cause you to retain excess fluids (edema), which makes your blood have more fluid volume. When your blood has more volume, your heart has to pump harder to move that excess volume throughout the body. This causes the blood pressure to go up. (Whether food tastes salty is not the point; so watering down soup will not help unless you also pour off 1/2, or all the water.) Remember, it's not just the salt that you put on your food while cooking or at the table, it's also the amount of sodium that's in the prepared foods that you buy. Several processed, packaged foods contain sodium benzoate as a preservative. You should become ""label conscious"" and buy ""low salt/sodium"" or ""unsalted"" foods and cook without salt. However, be aware that excessive use of products that replace sodium with potassium, K, just to make a ""low sodium"" claim can be harmful.;
, Also avoid condiments such as prepared mustard, salsa, chile sauce, soy sauce, ketchup, barbecue sauce and other sauces. Many American diets include up to 5,000 milligrams (5g) of sodium daily which nearly all medical professionals consider extremely unhealthy. Try to get to below 2 g (2,000 mg.) per day.


Medical professionals often prescribe ""low sodium diets"" that consist of between 1100 and 1500 mg. daily. The American Heart Association advises that the human body actually can function with eating as little as 200 mg. of sodium daily.
To get ""good"" flavor, there are multiple brands of salt-free seasonings that are zesty combinations of ground, powdered spices and herbs. Plus, fake-salt products are not just low or ""lite"" salt products -- but are salt substitutes (such as potassium based: potassium-chloride, for example), and use that sparingly, as the flavor is different from sodium salt.

, Like sodium, potassium is an electrolyte required in the diet in small amounts for your nerves and the heart to function.


Caution: Excessive potassium in the blood (hyperkalemia) is a common cause of life-threatening heart rhythm changes (cardiac arrhythmias). It can cause a heart attack called ventricular fibrillation where the lower parts of your heart beat so fast or flutter so that it cannot pump blood. An extremely high amount of potassium in your blood can also make your heart suddenly stop beating at all.Symptoms of dangerously high potassium in the your blood supply (hyperkalemia) can include: Abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia) that can be life threatening or either too slow or too rapid heart rate, feeling very weak, heart failure., Avoid caffeine, much chocolate, sugar, white carbs (although pastas are not as quick to change to sugar as breads, pastries and cakes are), candy, sugary drinks and excessive dietary fats. Try eating a more plant based diet, instead of so much of meats, milk products and eggs.

, Stopping coffee and other caffeinated beverage consumption will lower blood pressure. But, even one or two cups of coffee can raise blood pressure into the unhealthy Stage 1 level. If a person already has Stage 1 Hypertension, the coffee usually complicates the problem further because caffeine is a nervous system stimulant. Thus, agitated nerves cause the heart to beat faster, which raises the blood pressure. If you are a person who drinks a lot of caffeine (more than 4 caffeinated drinks/day), you may need to taper yourself off caffeine to prevent withdrawal symptoms such as headaches.

, Fiber cleanses your system and helps control your blood pressure by having digestive regularity. Most vegetables are high in fiber, especially those with leafy greens. Many fruits, nuts, and legumes (beans and peas) are also rich in fiber, as are whole-grain products.

Eat a diet comprised of healthy whole foods.,
Reduce your sodium intake.,
Consume less alcohol.,
Reduce caffeine intake.,
Avoid consuming red meats.,
Increase your intake of omega-3 fatty acids.",How to Lower Diastolic Blood Pressure1," Fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, seeds, legumes, low-fat dairy products, and foods high in potassium naturally help improve heart health and lower diastolic blood pressure. Start consuming more whole foods, and cut back on foods that are processed and high in sugar and fat.


On a daily basis, try to get 6 to 8 servings of whole grains, 4 to 5 servings of vegetables, 4 to 5 servings of fruits, 2 to 3 servings of dairy, 6 servings or fewer of lean meat/poultry/fish, and 4 to 5 servings of nuts/seeds/legumes. You should also limit your consumption of sweets to 5 servings or fewer per week.Foods rich in potassium can help balance out the effect of sodium, so consider eating more potassium-rich fruits and vegetables in particular, including bananas, oranges, avocados, beans, greens, potatoes, and tomatoes.;
, Excess sodium consumption causes water retention and forces your heart and arteries to work harder to pump blood throughout your body. Consume no more than 1,500 mg of sodium per day, and avoid using table salt, which often contains man-made additives that can worsen your health.Keep in mind that one teaspoon of table salt contains 2,300 mg of sodium on average. The average person consumes about 3,400 mg of sodium daily--more than twice the recommended amount.
Excess sodium can cause your body to retain water, which increases the amount of work your heart and blood vessels must do. As a result, excess sodium increases your diastolic blood pressure just as it increases your systolic blood pressure.
Check food labels and recipes, and stick with foods that contain 140 mg or less of sodium per serving. Limit salt, MSG, baking soda, baking powder, disodium phosphate, and any compound with ""sodium"" or ""Na"" in it. Rely on other herbs, spices, and naturally flavorful ingredients to enhance the taste of food instead of reaching for the salt.

, Studies show that moderate alcohol consumption can improve heart health, but consuming more than one or two alcoholic beverages per day increases blood pressure and has adverse health effects. Lower your alcohol intake, and consult with your healthcare provider for recommendations on alcohol consumption.Note that ""one drink"" equals 12 oz of beer, 5 oz of wine, or 1.5 oz of 80-proof liquor., Caffeine is linked to higher diastolic blood pressure levels, which occurs when caffeine blocks the hormone responsible for keeping arteries widened. Reduce your current caffeine intake, and switch from drinking coffee, energy drinks, and sodas to natural white, green, and black teas when you need an energy boost.Technically, caffeine may or may not have a significant effect on your blood pressure. If you don't drink it often, caffeine can cause a dramatic spike in overall blood pressure, but it generally has a less significant effect if you've been consuming it regularly for an extended period of time. Check your blood pressure within 30 minutes of drinking a caffeinated beverage; if either diastolic or systolic blood pressure increases by 5 to 10 mmHg, that's too much, and you should look at cutting back.
If you decide to reduce your caffeine, take several days to do so and lower your average consumption to about 200 mg daily--roughly two 12 oz (355 ml) cups of coffee.

, Regular consumption of red meats increases diastolic blood pressure and your risk for developing heart disease. Stop eating red meats such as beef and steak, and switch to eating healthier meats such as chicken, turkey, and fish.

, Foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids can improve heart health and are effective at lowering blood pressure and reducing your risk for heart disease. Examples of foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids are walnuts, salmon, tuna, mackerel, sardines, and trout.


Ideally, you should get 2 to 3 servings of healthy fat daily. While omega-3 fatty acids are a good choice, just about any monounsaturated or polyunsaturated fat can help your diastolic blood pressure. This includes many plant-based oils, including olive oil, canola oil, peanut oil, safflower oil, and sesame oil.Avoid foods containing saturated fats and trans fats, since these have a negative effect on your blood pressure. This includes fried and heavily processed foods.

"
Try taking some natural remedies.,
Take B vitamins.,
Eat foods rich in omega-3 and minerals such as potassium: tomatoes/tomato juice, potatoes, beans, onions, oranges, fruits and dried fruits.",How to Lower High Blood Pressure Without Using Medication2," Check with your doctor to see whether a natural remedy may be a safe alternative to medication for you. Many natural remedieshave scientific evidence to show that they can lower high blood pressure.


The top supplements for lowering blood pressure are coenzyme Q10, omega-3, fish oil, garlic, curcumin (from turmeric), ginger, cayenne, olive oil, nuts, black cohosh, hawthorn, magnesium and chromium.
Take 1 teaspoon of apple cider vinegar 3 times a day. Dilute it with about a cup of water. This works quickly and effectively.Use garlic tablets or eat 1 raw clove of garlic a day., Vitamins like B12, 6 and 9 can help lower homocysteine levels in the blood that can lead to heart problems. You can also find these nutrients in the daily foods you eat.

, Consume fish twice a week or more. Fish is high in protein, and many types of fish, including salmon, mackerel, and herring, also have high levels of omega-3 fatty acids, which lower fats called triglycerides and promotes overall heart health.

"
"
Stop smoking.,
Lose weight.,
Avoid drugs and alcohol.",How to Lower High Blood Pressure Without Using Medication3," Stimulants in cigarette smoke, like nicotine, can affect blood pressure. If you stop smoking, you can not only lower your blood pressure, but you can also help your heart to become more healthy and reduce your chances for other health-related diseases including lung cancer.

, Carrying around extra weight causes your heart to work harder all the time and this increases your blood pressure. Imagine having an extra 20 pounds (9 kg) on your body. That would be the same thing as carrying around a 20 pound (9 kg) bag of dog food. Try walking around the block while carrying this bag of dog food. Soon, your heart will begin to beat faster and harder, you'll become out of breath, and you'll feel very tired. Eventually, you'll get to the point where you can't wait to put that bag down.


Imagine how hard it is for your body to carry around that extra weight all the time! Unfortunately, many of us are carrying around a lot more than just an extra 20 pounds (9 kg). By losing this extra weight, your heart won't have to beat as hard and you'll lower your blood pressure.

, Excessive use of drugs and alcohol can damage many organs in the body including the liver and the kidneys. When these organs are damaged, they can cause a build-up of fluids in the body. As mentioned above, extra fluids make the heart beat harder and this increases the blood pressure.


Many drugs are stimulants. These cause the heart to beat faster. The faster the heart beats, the higher the blood pressure goes. By cutting out drugs and alcohol you'll succeed in reducing your blood pressure.
Some over the counter medications such as Ibuprofen for headache cause the body to retain sodium. So, people using such products that retain sodium more than the body naturally would -- have even higher stresses on their systems.

"
"
Slow down to help your body relax from stress.,
Meditate.,
Breathe deeply and slowly but not so slow as to cause discomfort, and listen to music if you like, while relaxing to lower blood pressure.,
Take a soaking hot bath or hot shower for 15 minutes which can actually suppress one's blood pressure for several hours.",How to Lower High Blood Pressure Without Using Medication4," Many people have a temporary rise in blood pressure when under stress. If you have high blood pressure because you are overweight or have a family history of hypertension, then stress raises it that much more. This is because your adrenal gland releases stress hormones which tend to cause your cardiovascular system to overwork.


If you are under chronic stress where you produce that stress hormone every day, then your cardiovascular system will naturally go into a state where it is overworking. This occurs due to the fact that the stress hormone increases your pulse, respiration and heart rate, as in preparation for ""flight or fight"". Your body thinks you are in need of fighting or running and naturally gets your body ready for either one. After prolonged stress, imagine what kind of work the heart is placed under. So try some relaxation techniques:
Try taking a long walk to take the edge off a stressful day long before bedtime. Make time for decompressing each and every day.
Set aside around 30 minutes before bed to finish the day’s must-do tasks (10 minutes). Do the personal hygiene things (10 minutes). Create calm-down time; try deep breathing and/or meditation (10 minutes).

, Simply observing and slowing the respiration rate produces a significant reduction in blood pressure.

, Do this until you fall asleep for instance or in break time for 5, 10 or 15 minutes occasionally throughout the day.

, Taking a hot bath just prior to bedtime can help the body retain lower blood pressure for hours or even the entire night.

"
"
Exercise.",How to Lower High Blood Pressure Without Using Medication5," Walk every day for at least 20 to 30 minutes at a moderate speed of about 3.0 mph (4.8 km/h). Study after study has demonstrated that the mere act of walking has a suppression effect on hypertension. Can't walk outside? Used treadmills can be found at all sorts of online sites for as little as $250. The advantage: walk even as it rains or snows outside. You can even walk in your pajamas without the neighbors seeing you! But do yourself a favor. Walk every day without fail. 30 minutes is all it takes, daily.

"
"
Exercise for at least 30 minutes most days of the week.,
Lose excess weight.,
Stop smoking cigarettes.,
Reduce and manage stress.",How to Lower Diastolic Blood Pressure2," Exercise helps strengthen your heart muscles, improves blood flow, and allows your heart to pump more easily with less effort. Find a physical activity you don’t mind doing and add that activity to your daily routine. Start walking, running, cycling, dancing, or swimming, or work with your healthcare provider on developing an exercise routine that works best for you.Keep in mind that the type of exercise you do will impact how much you'll need. In general, try to perform 75 minutes of vigorous exercise or 150 minutes of moderate exercise each week, but check with your doctor first to determine what your heart can handle.If you have existing heart problems, for instance, vigorous exercise may put too much additional strain on your heart; your doctor may advise moderate exercise until your overall health improves.

, Individuals with thick waistlines and a high body mass index (BMI) of 25 or higher often have high diastolic blood pressure readings since their hearts have to work harder at pumping blood throughout their entire bodies. Focus on losing weight by exercising regularly and eating healthier foods, and consult with your healthcare provider about other effective weight-loss treatments.


If you're notably overweight, losing as few as 10 pounds (4.5 kg) can dramatically improve your blood pressure numbers.
Also note that carrying extra weight around your waistline can have an especially strong impact on your blood pressure. As a general rule, aim to have a waist measurement less than 40 inches (102 cm) as a male or 35 inches (89 cm) as a female., Nicotine in cigarettes narrows your arteries, hardens artery walls, and increases your risk for blood clots, heart disease, and stroke. Stop smoking as soon as possible to lower your diastolic blood pressure, and consult with your healthcare provider about effective smoking cessation methods if you experience difficulty with quitting., When under stress, your body releases chemicals and hormones that temporarily narrow your blood vessels and cause your heart to beat faster. Long-term stress increases your risk for major heart problems such as stroke, heart attack, and heart disease. Identify your stressors, and eliminate them from your life to lower diastolic blood pressure.


While there are many ways to reduce stress, some ideas you can start putting into practice right away include identifying and avoiding your stress triggers, taking 20 minutes daily to enjoy a relaxing activity you enjoy, and practicing gratitude.

Understand your blood pressure numbers.,
Track your diastolic blood pressure regularly.,
Consult your doctor.,
Take prescription medications for blood pressure.,
Consult a naturopathic doctor, if desired.,
Follow your treatment plan as recommended by your healthcare provider.",How to Lower Diastolic Blood Pressure3," The top number of your blood pressure reading is your systolic blood pressure (pressure when your heart beats). The bottom number is your diastolic blood pressure (pressure in between beats). Typically, if one number is elevated, the other number will also be elevated.


As such, practices aimed at lowering your systolic blood pressure will usually lower your diastolic blood pressure, as well.
In rare cases, you might have isolated diastolic hypertension, in which you experience elevated diastolic blood pressure without experiencing elevated systolic blood pressure. This condition usually isn't dangerous on its own, but generally, you'll develop an elevated systolic blood pressure if you don't take care of your diastolic number now--and an elevated systolic blood pressure is much more dangerous., This allows you to determine whether your diet and lifestyle habits are effective at lowering blood pressure, and can be done using a blood pressure cuff at home, at the pharmacy, or at your doctor’s office. High diastolic blood pressure readings come in at 90 mmHg or higher, while those at risk for high blood pressure have diastolic blood pressure readings between 80 and 89 mmHg. The normal diastolic blood pressure range is between 70 and 80 mmHg.If you've been diagnosed with high blood pressure--either overall high blood pressure or high diastolic blood pressure only--start by checking your blood pressure twice a day for a week (once in the morning and once in the evening). Afterward, switch to two or three times a week. Once your blood pressure is under control, you can ease back to once or twice a month.Keep in mind that it is possible to have a diastolic blood pressure that is too low. If you have an abnormally low diastolic blood pressure, it means that your heart is no longer pumping enough blood to reach all your vital organs. As a result, you may inadvertently increase your stroke and heart attack risk. Unless told otherwise by a doctor, always keep your diastolic blood pressure about 60 mmHg, and aim for a range between 70 and 80 mmHg for optimal heart health., Even if you manage to track and lower your diastolic blood pressure at home, it’s still a good idea to consult with your doctor or other healthcare provider about your heart health. Together, you and your doctor can work out a treatment plan that can improve and maintain your health with regards to blood pressure concerns.


Your doctor will be able to guide you on ways to manage your overall heart health while lowering your diastolic blood pressure, and can also advise you on how to lower your diastolic blood pressure to a healthy level without reducing it too far.
Talking to your doctor about your blood pressure is always recommended, but it's especially important if you have a chronic illness/condition or if you're taking any medication.

, Visit your healthcare provider to receive prescriptions for drugs that can help manage and lower your blood pressure. Combining prescription drugs with healthy lifestyle changes has been proven effective at helping you lower diastolic blood pressure.


The exact medication your doctor prescribes may vary, typically based on other health concerns you may have. Thiazide diuretics are the most commonly prescribed drug for relatively healthy people.If you have other heart problems or a family history of heart trouble, your doctor may prescribe a beta-blocker or calcium-channel blocker.
If you have diabetes, heart problems, or kidney disease, your doctor may consider an ACE inhibitor or Angiotensin II receptor blocker.
Note that you generally won't need medication if you only have elevated diastolic blood pressure without also having elevated systolic blood pressure. Diet and lifestyle changes are usually enough to address the problem, but it's still a good idea to consult your doctor, especially when diet and lifestyle changes have yet to fix things.

, If you don’t want to take medication, you can either bring up your concerns to your normal doctor or consult a doctor who specializes in holistic/naturopathic medicine. Holistic and naturopathic doctors can help you lower and manage high blood pressure effectively through nutrition and lifestyle without relying on drugs and medications. If avoiding medication is important to you, you can work with your healthcare provider on developing a natural treatment plan that addresses the underlying cause of your high blood pressure.

, This helps prevent or delay complications associated with high blood pressure, and lowers your risk for related health problems. For example, if your doctor recommends exercising several times per week to lower blood pressure, make physical activity a priority so you can become healthier.On a similar note, if your doctor prescribes medication and that medication has negative side effects, ask your doctor about reducing the dose or switching, but do not stop taking your medication without consulting your doctor first.

Get screened for breast cancer, if you are a woman.All women are eligible to receive routine breast cancer screening tests.,
Get examined for prostate cancer, if you are a man.Most men should start being screened at age fifty-five.,
Opt for regular Pap tests to detect cervical cancer, if you are a woman.The other key screening test for women to receive is the Pap test, which examines the cervix for any pre-cancerous or cancerous changes.,
Monitor your skin for potential skin cancer.Skin cancer is another common form of cancer in both men and women; however, the good news is that, by regularly checking your skin for abnormal lumps or bumps, you can often detect abnormalities early and have them treated by a doctor.,
Start screening for colon cancer at age fifty.,
Check for lung cancer if you smoke.,
Report any suspicious symptoms or health concerns to your doctor.,
Obtain further testing as needed if cancer is suspected.",How to Test for Cancer1," In general, women are advised to begin mammograms at the age of 50, and to receive these every 2 years. A mammogram is a form of x-ray that is specifically designed to look at the breast tissue, and to detect any abnormalities. Suspicious areas of the breast (if there are any) are then followed up with further testing (such as a biopsy, and possibly an MRI).


If you have a family history of breast cancer or other risk factors, your doctor may recommend that you begin routine screening at an earlier age.
You should also go in to see your doctor anytime you feel a suspicious breast lump on self-exam (you can ask your doctor to teach you how to self-examine your breasts if you are unsure how to do so).

Click here for more information on how to screen and test for breast cancer.
If other women in your family have had breast or ovarian cancer before the age of 40, you may want to have a genetic test done to see if you carry the BRCA gene. This gene puts you at higher risk for developing these cancers. Talk to your doctor if you think you are a candidate for this test.;
, There are two types of prostate screenings used. A digital rectal exam tries to detect any lumps or bumps on the prostate, or any hardened or abnormal areas. A prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test takes a blood sample and measures the level of PSA in the blood. Your doctor might recommend either or both tests based on family history, medical history, risks, and symptoms.


PSA testing can help identify prostate cancer in men who do not have any symptoms, but there is also a chance that it will provide a false positive. Before undergoing a PSA test, have a discussion with your doctor regarding the risks and benefits of such a test for you.If you have an immediate family member (such as a father, brother, or son) who had prostate cancer before age 65, you may want to start screening earlier. African-American men are also at high risk.

, A speculum is inserted into the vagina, and a sample of cells is taken from around the cervix for examination under a microscope. Women are advised to receive Pap tests beginning at the age of 21, or 3 years after the onset of sexual activity (whichever comes first). This is because the risk of developing cervical cancer is directly related to the presence of HPV, a very common sexually transmitted infection which many people have and is most often asymptomatic.


Pap tests are typically done every three years.There are also two vaccines available now - Gardasil and Cervarix. These protect against some of the strains of HPV that cause cervical cancer. These vaccines are now recommended to all girls beginning at age eleven or twelve.Even if you have been vaccinated, regular screening for cervical cancer via Pap tests is still advised.
for more information on how to get a Pap test done (which tests for cervical cancer).

, Things to look for include any unusual growths on your skin, particularly if they have an unusual color to them as well (such as blue, black, or multiple shades of brown within one lesion).


To determine if a mole is malignant or not, use the abcde method. A malignant mole is marked by asymmetry, uneven borders, multiple colors, large diameters (that is, a ¼ inch or 6mm size), and evolving or changing shape.If you notice an unusual lesion on your skin that you worry may be cancer, it is best to see your family doctor or a dermatologist (a skin specialist) as soon as possible.
He or she can then examine it, and perform any tests as needed to confirm a diagnosis (cancer or otherwise).
The sooner a possible skin cancer is detected and diagnosed, the better your chances of effective treatment and cure are; therefore, if in doubt, always see your physician.

, For most people, it is recommended to get a colonoscopy every ten years starting at age 50. That said, if you have a family history of colon cancer in relatives under the of 50, you should talk to your doctor about whether earlier screening would be appropriate for you.

Other tests, such as stool tests or a sigmoidoscopy, may also be used. Talk to your doctor about which tests are right for you., For people with a 30 pack-year history or greater, it is recommended to get lung cancer screening with a low dose CT scan. This scan will create multiple images of your chest to check for abnormalities. This advice only applies to those who currently smoke or have quit less than 15 years ago.A pack year is the number of packs of cigarettes you smoke per day multiplied by the number of years you have smoked. To have a 30 pack-year history, you would have to smoke one pack a day for thirty years, two packs a day for fifteen years, or three packs a day for ten years.

, In addition to routine screening for the four cancers described above (breast cancer, prostate cancer, cervical cancer, and skin cancer), you should also be conscious of your overall health and report any symptoms or illnesses to your doctor.


Many cancers do not yet have screening tests available, and as such depend on symptom reporting for their detection.
If your doctor is worried based on your symptoms, he or she may order further investigative tests. However, routine screening tests (for people without symptoms) are not currently recommended for most other types of cancer because there is not sufficient evidence to support their use.
Unexplained weight loss and/or night sweats (not associated with menopause) may both be red flags for possible cancer. If you are experiencing either of these symptoms, book an appointment to see your doctor immediately.

, If any of your screening tests for cancer come back positive, or if your doctor has reason to suspect that you may have cancer, he or she will organize follow-up tests to further investigate and/or confirm the diagnosis. For instance, if your mammogram was positive, you may be scheduled for a breast biopsy, and if the biopsy comes back positive with a cancer diagnosis, you will be scheduled for surgery (a lumpectomy or a mastectomy).


The purpose of screening tests is not to diagnose cancer, but rather, to determine who is at a heightened risk and warrants further investigation.
It is the more detailed and comprehensive diagnostic tests (that normally follow screening tests) which will confirm whether or not cancer is in fact present.

"
Have your colon cancer staged.Before deciding on any course of treatment, the first step is to confirm your diagnosis of colon cancer and to have the cancer, if it is indeed present, staged.,
Have your cancer removed surgically.Assuming that you fall into stages I, II, or III, you will be booked for a surgery to remove your cancer as soon as possible.,
Wear a colostomy bag following surgery.After surgery, the most common procedure to attach the loose end on the proximal (upper) end of your colon to your abdominal wall, so that the opening of your bowel pokes through your skin.,
Opt for ""adjuvant"" chemotherapy for stage II or III colon cancer.If you had stage II or III colon cancer, or if your surgeon detected the spread of cancerous cells to your lymph nodes while performing surgery, you will most likely be offered a course of adjuvant chemotherapy following surgery.,
Proceed with chemotherapy as the mainstay of treatment for stage IV colon cancer.While surgery is the first-line treatment for stages I, II, and III colon cancer, chemotherapy is the key aspect of treating stage IV.,
Talk to your doctor to decide on a drug regimen for chemotherapy.There are several different chemotherapy drugs that may be used, either alone or in combination, to treat stage IV metastatic colon cancer.,
Take medications to manage the side effects.Undergoing chemotherapy treatment for colon cancer can come hand-in-hand with many side effects.,
Be aware that radiation is rarely used in the treatment of colon cancer.While radiation is a frequent method of treating various forms of cancer, it is generally not used for colon cancer.,
Receive regular follow-up tests to look for any recurrence of your cancer.It is key to discuss follow-up tests with your physician following surgical treatment and/or chemotherapy.,
Have your ""CEA"" monitored.,
Receive a CT scan annually for 3 years following treatment.It is also key to follow up with imaging tests.",How to Treat Colon Cancer," Staging is done using additional scanning of the body with CT or PET scanning and a biopsy of the primary cancer lesion that was found. This is important for developing an individualized treatment plan. There are 4 stages of colon cancer: Stage I is limited to the bowel while stage IV has metastasized throughout the body, with stages II and III representing intermediate levels of severity without body-wide metastases.


Stages I, II, and III are generally treated with surgery as the first-line option.
Stages II and III may require ""adjuvant"" chemotherapy (chemotherapy to supplement the treatment following surgical excision of the cancer).
Stage IV is treated predominantly with chemotherapy, and occasional surgery is used as an adjunct (as an addition) to remove masses causing pain, obstruction (blockage of the bowel), or that are otherwise problematical.;
, The surgery is performed under general anesthesia and normally takes a few hours to complete. The affected section of your bowel (where the cancer is present) will be removed, and the lymph nodes in the surrounding areas will be examined by your surgeon to see if the cancer has spread to them.


If the cancer has not spread to the lymph nodes, this is a very good sign. It indicates that your cancer was most likely fully cured by surgery alone.
If the cancer has spread to your lymph nodes, however, there is the possibility of ""micrometastases"" - meaning small cancerous cells that have ""escaped"" into your bloodstream and pose a heightened risk for recurrence of your cancer down the road.
Your surgeon will inform you following the procedure whether or not your lymph nodes contained any traces of cancer.
The excised (removed) portion of your bowel will also be examined under a microscope following surgery, by a medical specialist called a pathologist. The pathologist is able to provide additional diagnostic information about the type of cancer you had based on the appearance of the cancerous cells under the microscope.

, This is called a ""stoma,"" and it functions by attaching an ""ostomy bag"" to the outside of it to collect stool while the rest of your colon heals.


Using a colostomy bag (or ""ostomy bag"") can be a challenge both functionally and socially. For more information on how to use and change a colostomy bag, click here.

After your colon has healed, your surgeon may perform another procedure to re-attach the two ends of your colon and to get rid of the stoma. This is the preferable outcome as people can return to a normal life, passing stool through their rectum and anus as opposed to having to continue using a colostomy bag.
Some cases of colon cancer are more severe, however, and will require the use of a colostomy bag indefinitely. This happens when the section of diseased colon is larger, thus preventing the reconstruction of a functional bowel.

, The goal of adjuvant chemotherapy is to target any ""micrometastases"" (in other words, any small cancerous cells that are undetectable to the naked eye) and to ""kill"" them, so as to greatly diminish the chance of a future recurrence of your cancer.


Adjuvant chemotherapy is not necessary for stage I colon cancer, because stage I cancer is confined to the bowel and holds next to zero risk of having spread anywhere else in the body.
There is an online program called ""Adjuvant!"" that helps both physicians and patients to assess the possible risk of recurrence of their colon cancer, alongside the pros and cons of proceeding with adjuvant chemotherapy.
This tool can be extremely helpful in allowing patients to see the benefits and risks of proceeding with chemotherapy treatment, and to make an informed decision as to whether it is something that interests them.

, Unfortunately, stage IV colon cancer is technically ""incurable,"" because it has already metastasized to other areas of the body. However, seeking treatment can improve your prognosis and expected lifespan, as well as decrease the symptoms you may be suffering from, so it is certainly worth discussing with your doctor as a treatment option.


The reason that chemotherapy is the primary mode of treatment for stage IV colon cancer is that the cancer has spread systemically (throughout your body), and therefore a ""systemic treatment"" (a treatment that travels throughout your bloodstream to all areas of your body, such as chemotherapy), is needed to have the desired impact.
Chemotherapy for stage IV colon cancer is often accompanied by surgery to remove any masses in the colon and/or elsewhere in the body. The purpose of surgically removing masses is to relieve any bowel obstruction, to decrease pain, and to potentially prolong your expected lifespan.

, The option that is best for you will depend on a number of factors. These include:


Your overall health, which determines your ability to ""tolerate,"" or handle, a particular strength of chemotherapy treatment. This is because certain chemotherapy drugs can be too toxic for people with poor health.
Whether this is your first trial of chemotherapy, or whether you have been unsuccessful with other chemotherapy drugs. Generally, the least toxic chemotherapy drugs are used as a first-line treatment for colon cancer. However, with time, the cancer may become ""resistant"" to these drugs and they may stop working. At this time, you may need to switch which drugs you are on and try a second-line or third-line option to combat your colon cancer.
The specific type of colon cancer you have. There are certain subtypes of colon cancer that respond better to certain chemotherapy drugs than others. Your doctor can advise you as to how, if at all, this may impact the chemotherapy drugs that are best in your particular case.
Common chemotherapy drugs used in the treatment of colon cancer include: Leucovorin, 5-FU, Oxaliplatin, Irinotecan, and Capecitabine, among others., Common side effects when undergoing treatment for colon cancer include fatigue, ""chemo brain"" (a hazy brain where your thinking feels less sharp than normal), a rash, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, mouth sores, an increased risk of developing a fever and/or another infection (due to the toxic effect of chemotherapy on your immune system), and nerve pain, among other things. Fortunately, there are medical treatment available to help minimize many of these side effects, should you begin to experience them during your chemotherapy treatments.


You will see your doctor for ongoing visits and monitoring of any side effects throughout your chemotherapy treatments.
It is important to share the side effects you are experiencing with your doctor, so that he or she can offer you medications, if a form of treatment is available to help you to cope.

, It is, however, occasionally used in rectal cancer, oftentimes in combination with chemotherapy and/or surgery.

, The purpose of follow-up tests is to look for any possible recurrences of your cancer. The earlier these are detected (if there are any), the more effectively they can be treated; after having had colon cancer once, you are inherently at a heightened risk of having it again, so do not underestimate the importance of these appointments.


You will have received a full colonoscopy (an examination of your colon using a tube that is inserted through the anus with a video camera on it) prior to surgery to ensure that all polyps (cancerous lesions) were detected and removed at the time of surgery.
You will likely be advised to receive a follow-up colonoscopy at the 1 year mark, and every 3-5 years after that depending upon your risk stratification.
Your surgeon will inform you of the schedule for your examinations, and it is important to show up for each of them.
You should also see your physician for a physical exam, and to report any suspicious symptoms, every 3-4 months for the first 2-3 years, and every 6 months after that.

,""CEA"" stands for ""carcinoembryonic antigen,"" which is a tumor marker whose variation may signify a possible recurrence of colon cancer. The absolute numerical value of your CEA is in itself not highly important. Rather, it is the variation of this number with time (and particularly the INCREASE of it over time), that indicates suspicion of a possible relapse.


Your ""CEA"" can be measured via a simple blood test.
Your doctor will take several measurements of your CEA (with several blood tests performed every few months) to measure how your CEA changes with time.
If the number remains steady, you are unlikely to have a recurrence of your colon cancer.
If the number continues to rise in significant increments, however, this may indicate a relapse of your colon cancer. Further investigative tests will be needed to check if your cancer has come back.

, If you had stage II or III colon cancer, a CT scan is recommended annually for 3 years following treatment. This is not necessary for stage I or stage IV colon cancer.

This ensures you are getting the best care.To find a specialist, search online for a gynecologic oncologist in your area. You can read reviews from other patients to help make your choice, or ask your doctor for a referral to a specialist who treats ovarian cancer. Be aware that you may need to go to a different city to find a specialist in gynecology oncology.
Research shows that women who are treated by gynecologic oncologists and have their surgeries performed by them have a higher success rate, less side effects, and a better chance of having the stage of their cancer accurately diagnosed.The rest of your cancer treatment team will include a medical oncologist who specializes in chemotherapy, and an ovarian cancer nurse.Other specialists on your team may be radiologists, pathologists, dietitians, and other healthcare professionals.;
, After you create your treatment team and stage your cancer, you can start researching options. The most common treatment for ovarian cancer is surgery to remove the tumors. Chemotherapy is often used as complementary treatment to help kill other cancer cells. Talk to your treatment team about the treatments that are best for you.


If you are afraid of how treatment will affect your fertility, talk to your doctor.

, Surgery is necessary for the diagnosis and treatment of ovarian cancer. The two main goals of surgery are to stage the extent of the cancer (outlined below) and debulking, or removing as much cancerous tissue as possible. This usually means you will have a hysterectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy, omentectomy, biopsies of lymph nodes in the pelvis and abdomen and if fluid is present in the abdominal cavity, it will be collected for analysis.You may also have tumors or cancerous cells removed from other areas where it has spread.All removed tissue and fluid samples will be sent to a lab to be examined for cancerous cells.


A salpingo-oophorectomy is a surgical procedure where one or both ovaries and fallopian tubes are removed. If you have stage I cancer and want to become pregnant in the future, you may be able to have only one ovary or fallopian tube removed.
A hysterectomy is usually done for any cancer stage II and up. During this procedure, the cervix and uterus are removed.
With advanced stage cancers, you will more than likely have the lymph nodes in the pelvic area removed. You may also have to have an omentectomy, which removes the fatty tissue that covers the abdominal area and large intestine.
If you have stage IV cancer, your doctor may remove as much of the cancer as possibly by removing parts of the affected organs, such as the spleen, stomach, bladder, colon, or other organs.

, If the doctor has found a tumor, they will perform surgery to remove the tumor. After removing the tumor, they will examine a sample from the tumor under a microscope. This biopsy will help them determine if cancer is present and the stage of the cancer.During the surgery, samples from the pelvic and abdominal areas will also be taken to help figure out the stage of the cancer.Stage I cancer is when the cancer is confined to one or both of the ovaries or fallopian tubes. In stage I, the cancer may be inside the ovaries/fallopian tubes or on the surface of these organs. The outer covering of the ovary may have broken open at this stage. There may also be cancer cells in fluid surrounding the abdomen but not affecting the abdominal organs.
Stage II cancer occurs when the cancer is in the ovaries or fallopian tubes as well as other pelvic areas. This means cancer may be found in both the ovaries and the fallopian tubes. It may also be in the uterus, bladder, colon, or rectum.
Stage III is when the cancer is in the same places as stage II, but also has spread to the lymph nodes in the abdominal area, the abdominal lining, or the surfaces of the liver or spleen.
Stage IV cancer means that the cancer is in the pelvis and abdomen area, but has also spread to other parts of the body. This can include the inside of the liver, spleen, lungs, brain, or other organs, the fluid around the lungs, or lymph nodes of the groin or other parts of the body., Chemotherapy is used as a complementary treatment to surgery. It is used to get any remaining cancer cells that surgery could not. Chemotherapy is when drugs are used to kill the cancer cells. For ovarian cancer, chemotherapy can be given intravenously, orally, or through a catheter into the abdominal cavity. Most often, combination of chemo given through an IV and through the catheter directly into the abdomen is effective in treating ovarian cancer.Generally, a combination of drugs is given every month or so. You will be given the drugs in cycles, so the entire treatment usually takes months.Chemotherapy given after surgery, also known as adjuvant chemotherapy, is to help reduce the risk that cancer cells will come back. If the surgeon didn’t get all the cancer in the first surgery, chemo may be used to shrink the cancer cells, then an additional surgery will be done to get the smaller cells.
You may be given chemo before your surgery if the cancer is too large or widespread to help the surgeon be able to get it all in one surgery.This is known as neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
If your cancer is too advanced for surgery, or your health is not well enough for surgery, chemotherapy will be your main treatment.
Ovarian cancer has been shown to respond well to chemotherapy. Often, the cancer cells go away with the use of chemotherapy.

, Radiation therapy, which uses targeted high energy rays to damage or kill cancer cells in a specific site, is very rarely used to treat ovarian cancer. However, there are a few specific reasons why someone may use radiation therapy. It may be used when the cancer is only in the pelvic area to help kill any remaining cancer cells.Radiation may also be used in advanced ovarian cancer to help kill cancer cells that have spread to other organs.If radiation is used for treatment, it will most likely be external beam radiation, or the use of a machine outside the body to direct x-rays towards the targeted area. Treatments are usually 5 days a week for several weeks, with each treatment session lasting only several minutes, similar to other x-ray testing., You may consider taking part in a clinical trial as part of your treatment. Clinical research trials are an important process in cancer research. Clinical trials use the latest and most advanced treatment options that are being tested for effectiveness before being used for the general public. However, clinical trials are not right for everyone.Talk to your doctor about clinical trials in your area.
You can search online for cancer organizations and hospitals running clinical trials.

, Depending on your specific cancer, you may benefit from other types of treatment. Targeted therapy is a newer cancer treatment that may be available for you. Targeted therapy uses drugs that work like chemotherapy, except they only attack cancer cells and leave healthy cells alone. This leads to less damage and negative side effects.Targeted therapy slows the growth and shrinks cancer cells. This is usually used alongside chemotherapy.
Targeted therapy has not been shown to help prolong the life of women with ovarian cancer.
Targeted therapy may be used if chemotherapy is no longer working., As you go through treatment, you may want to consider discussing your treatment plans with your family.


Tell them about your diagnosis, along with the stage of your cancer. Explain to them the surgeries you will have to remove any tumors you have, and the chemotherapy treatments that will follow.
Talk to your loved ones about any options you have for taking part in a clinical trial or undergoing targeted therapy.
Discuss how your cancer will affect your family life and career.

, Dealing with any kind of cancer can be difficult, but dealing with ovarian cancer may be particularly difficult. The cancer and treatment may lead to infertility, which may cause you emotional pain. You may also experience negative feelings where your femininity is concerned. You may just be scared because you have cancer. No matter what you are feeling, you should seek help if you are having trouble dealing with your cancer.You can get a referral to a therapist or counselor. Your treatment center, clinic, or hospital may have a counselor that deals specifically with cancer patients.
If you are depressed, you may find talk therapy to be helpful, or you may choose to take antidepressants.

, As you go through your treatment, you may find that you need additional support. You may be able to find a support network of friends and family, or you may choose to go to a cancer support group. Talking to others who have gone through what you are going through can help you as you undergo treatment.Many cancer organizations offer 24-hour hotlines where you can call and talk to trained specialists. You can voice your concerns, fears, and questions and receive feedback.
There are also online support groups where you can talk to others who have had ovarian cancer.

, As you go through your treatment, you should make healthy lifestyle changes to help keep you healthy and strong. Eat a balanced diet, get plenty of rest, and find ways to relieve stress.A balanced diet includes a variety of vegetables, fruits, protein, grains, and dairy. You should increase your vegetables and fruits and try to fill each plate halfway up with vegetables. Choose low-fat sources of protein and dairy, and choose complex carbohydrates. Limit refined carbohydrates and sugar.Everyone relieves stress differently. You can try yoga, deep breathing exercises, or meditation. You can go for a walk, spend time with friends and family, read a book, or listen to music.

, Cancer treatments can be emotionally, mentally, and physically draining. When you tell your family or friends about your cancer and treatment, ask them for help. You may need someone to help you with household chores, cooking, or other tasks during this time.For example, say, ""Since I have ovarian cancer, I may need help around the house. Would you be willing to help me out a couple of times a week?""

Ask about genetic testing if you have a family history of cancer.Some forms of cancer, such as breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and certain hereditary forms of colon cancer, are known to run in families and to be directly related to genes.,
Prevent a recurrence of cancer by monitoring tumor markers.If you have had cancer in the past that was cured (or is in remission), you can ask your doctor about tumor marker testing which tests for the presence of any recurrence of your previous cancer.,
Understand that it is the progression of tumor markers over time that matters.Many people worry about the exact numerical measurements of their tumor markers.",How to Test for Cancer2," If you have had a family member with cancer, ask your doctor if there is a potential genetic basis that can be tested for. If there is, having yourself tested can provide you with valuable information. You will either not have inherited the gene from your affected parent (meaning that your risk of cancer is the same as for the general population), or you will have inherited it (which puts you at an increased risk based on your genes).


For breast and ovarian cancer, mutations to the BRCA gene can run in families and may be tested for.
For certain forms of hereditary colon cancer such as Lynch Syndrome (also known as HNPCC), genetic testing can also be performed.,


Examples of tumor markers include Ca 19-9 for pancreatic cancer, Ca-125 for ovarian cancer, and PSA for prostate cancer.., However, this sort of worry is futile because the number itself means nothing (it is highly variable among different individuals). It is the progression of the number over time (with serial measurements) that provides your doctor with valuable information, and gives notice of a potential recurrence of your cancer.


If your tumor marker numbers have been steadily climbing, this is an indication that you may be having a recurrence.
If, on the other hand, during the course of cancer treatments your tumor marker numbers drop, this is an excellent sign that the treatments are effective.
Speak to your doctor for further information on how to interpret your tumor marker values as a means to test for cancer.

, In small amount, alcohol can actually cause your blood pressure to drop. In higher amounts, though, it can cause your blood pressure to increase.


For men and women over the age of 65, drink one glass of wine or a beverage with a similar alcoholic content per day. For adults under the age of 65, you might be able to drink up to two glasses a day.
For tracking purposes, one drink or glass equals 12 oz (355 ml) of beer, 5 oz (148 ml) of wine, or 1.5 oz (45 ml) of 80-proof liquor.
In moderate amounts, wine and other alcohol can lower your blood pressure by 2 to 4 mm Hg.
Note that this is only helpful if you already drink alcohol, however. The results are less pronounced and riskier if you do not drink regularly.
Large volumes of alcohol can decrease the effectiveness of blood pressure medication.

, Milk is packed with potassium and calcium, and both nutrients have been linked to low blood pressure. Dairy also contains vitamin D, which may also help.


Low-fat and nonfat milk is preferable to whole milk. Whole milk contains Palmitic acid, which, according to some studies, can block internal signals responsible for relaxing blood vessels. As a result, your blood vessels stay constricted and your blood pressure remains high., Herbal teas containing hibiscus can lower blood pressure quickly and dramatically if you drink three cups on a daily basis.


Steep the tea for six minutes before enjoying it cold or hot.
If you take no other measures other than drinking hibiscus tea three times a day, you can lower your systolic blood pressure by seven points within six weeks.
Hibiscus tea contains anthocyanins and other antioxidants that strengthen your blood vessels, preventing them from narrowing and causing your blood pressure to spike.

, A glass of cranberry juice can lower blood pressure as effectively as a glass of red wine.


Cranberry juice contains antioxidants known as Proanthocyanidins. These nutrients restrict the body's production of ET-1, a compound known to constrict blood vessels and elevate blood pressure.

, While fruits and vegetables are an important part of a balanced diet in general, some have a notably beneficial effect on lowering blood pressure.


Eat kiwis. In a study done by the American Heart Association, scientists discovered that eating three kiwis a day for up to eight weeks could dramatically lower systolic blood pressure. Kiwis are rich in an antioxidant known as lutein.Enjoy a slice of watermelon. Watermelon contains fiber, Lycopenes, vitamin A, and potassium, all of which have been linked to low blood pressure. It also contains an amino acid called L-Citrulline/L-arginine, which early studies indicate may help lower blood pressure, as well.
Include a wide variety of potassium-rich fruits and vegetables in your diet. Scientists generally agree that potassium is a vital addition to any diet designed to lower blood pressure. Good sources of potassium include peas, bananas, potatoes, tomatoes, orange juice, kidney beans, cantaloupe, honeydew melons, and raisins.

, Coconut water is high in potassium, electrolytes, and other nutrients linked to lower blood pressure.


A study published in the West Indian Medical Journal indicated that coconut water dropped systolic pressure in 71 percent of participants and dropped diastolic pressure 29 percent of participants.

, Soy products contain isoflavones, nutrients that may have a direct link to lower blood pressure.


In a 2012 study, researchers discovered that diets rich in isoflavones were likely to result in blood pressure that was 5.5 points lower than blood pressure linked to low levels of isoflavones.Green tea and peanuts also contain a healthy amount of isoflavones.

, Chocolate in general is rich in flavanols. These nutrients encourage the blood vessels to dilate wider, thereby lowering blood pressure.


While chocolate may help in all forms, dark chocolate and pure cacao contain higher concentrations than milk chocolate and may be the best choices.
Studies suggest that consuming chocolate can reduce blood pressure in individuals with high blood pressure, but the results are less pronounced in individuals with normal or near normal blood pressure.

, Capsaicin, a spicy component of chili peppers, might encourage a drop in blood pressure when consumed.


This was determined by a 2010 study, in which rats with hypertension experienced a drop in blood pressure after consuming capsaicin. Note, however, that it is still unclear whether or not the same results apply to humans.

, Exercising for at least 30 minutes on most days of the week can quickly and substantially drop your blood pressure. You can get exercise through both athletic activities and common chores.Before increasing the amount of exercise you do in a day, you should ask your doctor for guidance. Increasing your physical activity too dramatically can actually put you at greater risk of heart attack or stroke.
Power walking is one of the simplest exercises you can add to your routine. Walking at a brisk pace for 30 minutes can lower your blood pressure by nearly 8 mmHg.
Other athletic activities you can try include volleyball, touch football, shooting baskets, bicycling, dancing, water aerobics, swimming, and jumping rope.
Helpful chores include washing the car, washing windows and floors, gardening, raking leaves, shoveling snow, and walking up and down stairs.

, Slow, meditative breathing relaxes the body, causing it to produce more nitric oxide and fewer stress hormones.


Nitric oxide opens up the blood vessels, thereby reducing your blood pressure.
Stress hormones elevate renin, a kidney enzyme linked to high blood pressure.
Take at least five minutes in the morning and five minutes to focus on inhaling deeply, taking deep ""belly breaths"" each time.
For an even more pronounced effect on blood pressure, consider learning formal meditation, doing yoga, or trying Qigong or tai chi.

, Studies suggest that working more than 41 hours per week increases your risk of developing high blood pressure by 15 percent. As such, if you need to quickly lower your blood pressure, you should try shaving off a little time from your work schedule when possible.


This is especially significant if your job is notably hectic or stressful. Stress hormones cause your blood vessels to constrict, which only makes it harder for your heart to pump blood through them. As a result, your blood pressure rises.

, Listening to soothing music for 30 minutes daily can help drop blood pressure, especially if done in conjunction with deep breathing techniques and hypertension medication.


Choose soothing music, like classical, Celtic, or Indian music.
Studies show that after one week, your systolic reading can drop 3.2 points.

, Nicotine is one culprit behind high blood pressure. If you smoke or are around people who smoke, cutting this from your life is one way to quickly drop your blood pressure.


Smoking increases your blood pressure by 10 mm Hg up to an hour after you smoke. If you smoke continually, your blood pressure will be continually elevated. The same effect applies to people who are continually around smokers.

, Coenzyme Q10 is a natural supplement and antioxidant that has the ability to reduce blood pressure by 17 mmHg over 10 mmHg when taken regularly. The supplement dilates your blood vessels, making it easier for the heart to pump blood through them.


Ask your doctor about the supplement. He or she make recommend that you take a 60 to 100 mg CoQ10 supplement up to three times daily.

, Diuretics flush excess sodium and water out of the body.Since sodium is a known culprit of high blood pressure, the removal of excess sodium can cause a significant drop in blood pressure.

, Beta-blockers cause the heart rate to drop.


As a result, the heart pumps out less blood, thereby lowering your blood pressure.

, ACE stands for ""Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme."" This enzyme causes your body to produce angiotensin, a chemical responsible for constricting the arteries throughout the body.


An ACE inhibitor causes your blood vessels to open, making it easier for blood to flow through them and causing your blood pressure to drop.

, This medication directly blocks the effect of angiotensin, which is responsible for causing the arteries to constrict.


Angiotensin needs to join with a receptor in order to affect the blood vessel. These medications block the receptors, thereby preventing the chemical from having an impact.

, Calcium channel blockers work by blocking calcium from entering the heart and arteries.


Calcium causes smooth muscle cells in these areas to become hard, which means that the heart must use more force to pump blood through the arteries.
This medication relaxes narrow blood vessels, thereby lowering blood pressure.

, Alpha blockers reduce resistance in the arteries.


As a result, vascular muscles relax, making it easier for blood to flow through.

, This medication reduces the function of the sympathetic part of the involuntary nervous system.


This means that less adrenaline is produced. Adrenaline, along with other stress hormones, can cause blood vessels to constrict.

, These are a first-line of defense for patients facing crucially high blood pressure and drop blood pressure quicker than most other medications.


This medication reduces the resistance put up by your arteries and cause your heart rate to drop.

, These medications prevent your blood vessels from contracting quite as easily, thereby making it easier for your blood to flow through them.


Note that the effect is similar to that accomplished by alpha-beta-blockers.

, The brain is the primary target of this group of medications.


Neurotransmitters responsible for telling the smooth muscles of your heart and blood vessels are blocked when taking these medications, so the message telling those blood vessels to constrict never reaches its destination.

, These medications only cause the blood vessel muscles to relax.


As a result, they dilate, allowing blood to flow through with less pressure.

Begin exercising right away.,
Start relaxing right away.,
Quit smoking or using tobacco.,
Drink less alcohol.,
Evaluate the drugs you take.",How to Lower Blood Pressure Overnight1," Exercise is an excellent way to control high blood pressure. It will help you lose weight, reduce stress, and feel good. Talk to your doctor before beginning a new exercise routine to make sure you are healthy enough. If your doctor gives you the ok, these are common recommendations:75—150 minutes of endurance activity per week. You will enjoy it more if you chose activities that like to do. Many people join community sports teams, take classes at a local gym, or simply go outside and walk, run, or bike. Don't jump right into intense exercise if you've been sedentary. Rather, ease into a new routine.
Exercise routines are most effective when they are also paired with strength training like weight lifting. This will help you to keep your bones strong and your muscles sculpted.;
, Stress increases your blood pressure; if you are experiencing a temporary elevation in blood pressure because of stress, this is one instance in which you might be able to decrease it almost ""overnight."" Relaxation techniques may help you to keep things in perspective and reduce the physical toll stress takes on your body. Things to try include:Deep breathing
Meditation
Yoga
Tai Chi

, Tobacco hardens and narrows your arteries, which increases your blood pressure. This is true for both smokers and people who are exposed to secondhand smoke. Quitting will improve your health immediately. If you need help quitting you can:Get support from friends, family, a counselor, a support group, or hotlines
Talk to your doctor about trying medications or nicotine replacement therapy
There are state programs that help people with smoking cessation. Look into state resources to see what is available in your state

, Alcohol is high in calories, making you vulnerable to obesity and increasing your risk of high blood pressure. If you do drink, stay within the recommended limits.Men should drink no more than one to two drinks per day. Women should have at most one drink per day.
A glass of wine, beer or shot of hard alcohol is a drink.

, This includes both street drugs and medications. Street drugs can also increase your blood pressure. Some medications can also contribute to hypertension. If you think this might be the case for you, don’t stop taking your medications. Instead contact your doctor to discuss the problem. Your doctor may be able to recommend a different medication that will work better for you. Some substances and medications that can contribute to high blood pressure include:Amphetamines, cocaine, and crystal methamphetamine
Some decongestants and cold medications
Some nonprescription painkillers (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or NSAIDs, like ibuprofen, Celebrex, Naproxen sodium, etc.)
Some birth control pills

Reduce your fat and sugar intake immediately.,
Reduce your salt consumption right away.,
Increase the amount of fruits and vegetables you eat.,
Switch immediately to eating whole grain carbohydrates.,
Control your meat consumption.,
Evaluate your dairy products.",How to Lower Blood Pressure Overnight2," This will help you to control your weight and lower your risk of heart disease. Eat no more than three tablespoons of fat per day and five sweets per week. Easy ways to quickly cut fat and sugar include:Substituting fruits for dessert rather than the more traditional, fatty and sugary foods like pastries, cookies, cakes, puddings, and candies.
Eat dry sandwiches rather than adding mayonnaise or butter.
Reduce the amount of oil and butter you cook with. Avoid lard, solid shortenings, coconut oil and palm oil.
Do make sure ensure you are eating the proper amount of recommended ""good"" fats, like monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, which are found in foods like olive oil and avocado.

, Eating too much salt can contribute to high blood pressure. The DASH diet, which is stands for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, permits only 2,300 mg of salt each day. Ways to cut salt include:Cutting down on prepackaged, processed snacks. These often have a lot of salt added for flavoring. Look at the packaging to see how much salt they contain. Foods like salted pretzels, chips, and salted nuts are better avoided all together.
Check the labels on canned foods. Many vegetables are canned in salt water. You can reduce your salt intake by purchasing only frozen or fresh vegetables. If it must be canned, the look for veggies in unsalted water.
Reduce the amount of salt you cook with. At first you may miss the salt, but then your palate will adjust and you will enjoy the foods’ natural flavors.

, This is a great way to quickly improve your diet. The DASH diet recommends four to five servings of fruit and four to five servings of vegetables. A serving size is a half a cup. Because fruits and vegetables are great sources of potassium and magnesium, they will start to control your blood pressure right away. Add more fruits and vegetables in your diet by:Snacking on fruits and vegetables between meals. A fresh apple, pear, carrot, or green pepper is neat and easy to pack with you on a busy day.
Buy frozen vegetables. Frozen vegetables make it convenient to eat tasty, nutritious vegetables year round. They are also very easy to thaw and add as a side dish to a meal.
Top off your meals with a salad. This is a great way to add diverse fruits and vegetables. You can go for hearty salads with carrots, tomatoes, peppers, and lettuce or get creative with sweet notes from orange or apple slices. Monitor your use of salad dressings. They are often salty and fatty.

, The DASH diet recommends six to eight servings of grains daily. Whole grains contain more nutrients and fiber than processed white flour. This means that you will get more nutrition per serving and feel less hungry. A slice of bread or half cup of cooked pasta qualifies as a serving. Ways to up your intake of whole grains include:Baking with whole wheat flour instead of white.
Purchasing whole wheat pasta instead of white.
Eating brown rice instead of white.
Reading the packaging on breads to see if they say they are made from whole wheat.

, Lean meats like poultry and fish are best, but don’t overdo it. Meats and fish are excellent sources of iron, zinc, protein, and vitamins. However, because they also have high amounts of fat and cholesterol, they will contribute to clogging your arteries. Reduce your meat and fish intake to six ounces per day.Cook meat in low fat ways. Instead of frying, try baking, grilling, or roasting.
Red meats are often particularly high in fat. If you do eat red meat, trim off any fat you see around the edges.
Salmon, herring and tuna are high in omega-3 fatty acids, which will help control your cholesterol. Try to eat fish once or twice per week.

, Dairy is rich in calcium and vitamin D, but it is best to eat low fat dairy rather than whole milk sources. This lowers the amount of fat you get with it. Two to three cups of low fat dairy per day should be sufficient.Milk, cheese, and yogurt products will generally tell you on the packaging what percentage of fat they have. Low fat or skim products have much less fat than whole milk products.
Start your day with a healthy breakfast of whole-grain cereals with low fat or skim milk or yogurt.

Make a doctor’s appointment if you show signs of high blood pressure.,
Discuss medications with your doctor.,
Call an ambulance if you could be having a stroke or heart attack.",How to Lower Blood Pressure Overnight3," If you do have high blood pressure, it is important to consult your doctor to make a health plan to control it. Most people with high blood pressure don’t have symptoms, so it is best to get checked about every year or two. If you do experience symptoms, you may have:Frequent nosebleeds
Shortness of breath
Blurred vision or see double
Headaches that don’t go away

, Your doctor may suggest that you take medications to reduce your blood pressure. Be sure to tell your doctor about all other prescription medications, over-the-counter medications, supplements, and herbal remedies that you take. Some blood pressure medications can interact with them. Frequently prescribed medications include:ACE inhibitors. These medications lower your blood pressure by causing your blood vessels to relax. Some people get a chronic cough as a side effect.
Calcium channel blockers. These medications cause your arteries to widen, reducing the pressure with which your blood flows. They may interact with grapefruit juice. Ask your doctor about side effects and interactions.
Diuretics. These medications cause you to urinate and lower the amount of salt in your body.
Beta-blockers. These medications cause your heart to beat slower and with less force. Usually the doctor will suggest other medications and lifestyle changes before putting you on beta-blockers.

, High blood pressure increases your risks of both. If you are unsure if you could be experiencing one of these, you should call emergency medical responders immediately and let them determine what you need.


You could be having a stroke if you experience a drooping face, especially on only one side, suddenly have problems speaking or understanding, feel numbness or weakness in an arm, leg, or the face, have vision problems in one or both eyes, lose your coordination, are confused, feel dizzy, or have a horrible headache.You could be having a heart attack if you experience a squeezing feeling in your chest, chest pain, pain that travels to one or both arms, your neck, back, jaw, or abdomen, difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, sweating, lightheadedness, or nausea. You do not have to experience all of the symptoms.
Women are less likely to experience chest pain during a heart attack.Women have more vague symptoms like increased fatigue, nausea, reflux-like symptoms, or feelings of impending doom.

Listen and respond to warning signs from your body.",How to Live With Coronary Artery Disease1," Consume a diet high in fresh fruits, vegetables, and whole grains in order to ensure your overall health. It’s especially important to avoid foods high in saturated fats. Your physician can help you with meal planning or refer you to a dietitian for additional assistance.


Choose lean sources of protein, such as chicken breast and fish that provide a healthy source of energy and help to build muscle mass.
Use healthy, monounsaturated fats, such as olive oil and fish oil, in place of saturated fats like butter and lard to reduce added health risk when cooking healthy foods.;
, When your doctor approves, it’s important to work your way up to at least 2.5 hours a week of moderate intensity exercise. Walking is one of the best ways to move at your own pace, and begin to improve heart health. Start with short intervals, and increase the amount of time spent exercising as you feel able., If you have difficulty quitting, consider a smoking cessation program, prescription medication, or joining a support group., This should be equal to: 12 oz.

Visit your cardiologist regularly.,
Start a cardiac rehabilitation plan.,
Take all prescribed medications for coronary artery disease consistently.,
Complete any surgical care as necessary.,
Find out everything you can about coronary artery disease.",How to Live With Coronary Artery Disease2," Once you’ve been diagnosed with coronary artery disease, you will need to work with your cardiologist to determine how frequently you need to schedule checkups in order to prevent more advanced coronary syndromes such as high blood pressure, heart attack, and stroke., These ongoing care plans may incorporate a number of treatments depending on the severity of your coronary artery disease. In most cases, cardiac rehabilitation begins the moment you’re diagnosed. Your plan typically includes behavior and lifestyle changes, diet and exercise, surgery, prescription medications, and after care. All of this is done under the supervision and assistance of a trained cardiac rehabilitation specialist., Skipping even one day may be detrimental to your prevention or recovery plan. Never discontinue treatment, but contact your physician or cardiologist right away if you experience extreme side effects. Your medicinal regimen may be as simple as taking aspirin daily, or it could include any number of more advanced prescription medications.


Your doctor may prescribe a beta blocker especially if you have experienced a heart attack. Beta blockers help prevent arrhythmia.
ACE inhibitors are often prescribed to prevent advanced coronary attacks as these medications relax blood vessels and increase blood flow.
An aspirin regimen may be the first course of action recommended by your physician, and taking one aspirin each day has proven effective in reducing risk for acute cardiac syndromes in people with coronary artery disease.
If you have conditions that are risk factors for coronary artery disease, such as hypertension, diabetes, or high blood cholesterol, your doctor will also prescribe medications to treat or control these conditions., Surgery can be preventative to stop blockage, or may be used to reduce blockage as an intervening measure prior to a severe cardiac event like heart attack or stroke.


You may need to undergo preventative procedures like balloon angioplasty (opening the artery with an inflatable device) and stent placement (opening the artery by placing a sick-like object to force it open). These procedures are typically completed in-office as a way of reducing blockage or stopping it. These treatments are minimally invasive, and they are completed by a cardiologist who accesses the heart by inserting a small tube through the blood vessels.
Enhanced external counterpulsation is another minimally invasive procedure performed to create a natural bypass around clogged arteries for those patients who are unable to receive angioplasty or stent placement, but whose symptoms have not advanced to the level of needing a full bypass surgery.
Coronary artery bypass surgery is conducted to reroute blood flow around a blocked artery. This is completed by grafting one or more new blood vessels creating a new pathway to the heart., Two common myths that may make you feel less inclined to seek early intervention for coronary artery disease are: only older people develop heart disease and symptoms would be apparent. People can begin developing blockage in their teens and the symptoms are often subtle or nonexistent. That’s why it’s so important for you to understand the basics of coronary artery disease.Angina, chronic or frequent chest pain, occurs when the heart is unable to receive adequate amounts of oxygen rich blood due to blockage. This warning sign of heart disease typically only occurs in advanced stages.
Ischemia, a type of muscular cramp, is another warning sign of coronary artery disease. It occurs when your heart is deprived of necessary oxygen and nutrients due to the blockage in arteries. This commonly occurs during exercise, and can be relieved by resting. Because you can make a full recovery after rest, you may not recognize ischemia as a warning sign of heart disease."
"
Attend regular checkups for early diagnosis.,
Receive testing from a cardiac specialist.,
Design your treatment plan around acute coronary syndrome.",How to Live With Coronary Artery Disease3," In the earliest stages, heart disease will likely have few or no obvious symptoms. By visiting a physician regularly, you diminish their your chances for developing advanced coronary artery disease., If your general physician believes you may be at risk for coronary artery disease due to the results of a checkup, it’s essential to seek an official diagnosis from a cardiologist, a doctor who specializes in heart disease. An official diagnosis may include any number of advanced tests.


Electrocardiograms or EKGs are the most well known tests for coronary artery disease. An EKG essentially measures and records the heart’s electrical activity (heart beats), allowing the doctor to note any irregularities.
Stress tests combine exercise with EKG heart monitoring to note changes in heart function that occur during times of increased movement.
Angiograms are x-rays that capture images of the heart pumping showing the exact position and extent of blockage in arteries., If you do experience an acute cardiac event, you may need to cater your ongoing coronary artery disease treatment plan to include options that reduce risk for the recurrence of these events.


High blood pressure is the most common and easily treatable advanced coronary syndrome resulting from untreated or undiagnosed coronary artery disease. Typically, changes to your diet and exercise routines as well as a prescription medication are enough to bring high blood pressure under control.
Heart attack, or myocardial infarction as it’s medically known, is the second most common result of untreated coronary artery disease. Treatment following your heart attack may include any number of surgical, medicinal, and behavioral interventions.
While strokes affect the brain, they are often associated with coronary artery disease as they occur when blood flow to your brain is decreased or blocked. Treatment for stroke is usually extensive and may include weeks, months, or years of rehabilitation in the hospital and at home."

Make things easier.,
Steer clear of harmful substances.,
Manage your stress levels.,
Eat a heart-healthy diet.,
Quit smoking.,
Exercise regularly.,
Take medications.",How to Live with Atrial Fibrillation1," While living with AF can be challenging, there are ways that you can make dealing with AF easier. These are habits that should be followed every day to help make life easier for you. These include:


Taking all medications exactly as prescribed
Continuing to take any prescription medication unless your healthcare provider says otherwise
Discussing any medicine-caused side effects with your healthcare provider
Monitoring your pulse daily, especially if you have an artificial pacemaker
Keeping a record of your pulse along with the day and time the pulse was taken and notes about how you felt at the time;
, There are some substances that can make your atrial fibrillation worse and that contribute to an irregular heartbeat. Because of this, you should avoid the substances such as:


Sodium, which can increase your blood pressure, which triggers AFCaffeine
Tobacco
Alcohol, which trigger AF in some individuals
Cold and cough medications
Appetite suppressants
Psychotropic drugs used to treat certain mental illnesses
Antiarrhythmic in certain individuals, although they are used to treat arrhythmia as well
Anti-migraine drugs
Drugs for erectile dysfunction
Street drugs such as cocaine, marijuana, “speed”, or methamphetamines

, High stress levels can increase your blood pressure, which can worsen your AF. High stress levels can also cause other heart diseases because it causes the constriction of your blood vessels. To reduce your stress levels:


Reduce your exposure to your stressors
Create a schedule for yourself
Take breaks throughout the day
Practice yoga
Set aside some time each day to meditate, There is not a specific diet that is for AF patients; however, your diet can be tailored to the underlying cause and prevention of AF, as well as to lower the risk of stroke and heart attack. You can also create a diet that reduces the conditions that can make your AF worse. Eat more vegetables and fruit, avoid large portion sizes, and eat whole grains instead of refined carbohydrates, which include white breads, white rice, pastries, and dessert cakes.


A diet that is low in refined sugars can help to reduce your blood sugar levels and lower your chance of AF.
A diet that is low in fat, particularly saturated fat, can help to reduce your cholesterol, which contributes to heart issues.
A diet that is low in sodium can help to reduce your blood pressure, which lowers your risk of AF and other heart issues., Nicotine can cause atrial fibrillation. In addition, tobacco smoke causes the constriction of your blood vessels, which can lead to high blood pressure and can make your AF worse. It also decreases the amount of oxygen in your blood, while the nicotine can do damage to your heart. It can also lead to many other heart problems, including coronary artery disease and stroke. If you are having a hard time quitting:


Talk to your doctor about methods and medications you can use to quit.
Join a support group for people who are trying to quit smoking., Your heart is a muscle, and like any other muscle, it needs to be worked out. Doing cardiovascular exercises will help work out your heart and decrease your risk of AF and other heart diseases. Try to get at least 30 minutes of exercise five days a week for a total of 150 minutes, or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise. Also make sure you include two to three days of strength training.


Focus on light cardio exercises that can help to get your blood pumping. Some light cardio exercises that work well include fast-paced walking, light jogging, casual cycling, and light swimming.
Increase how long or strenuous your fitness levels are when you get stronger. Start moderate to intense cardio or your light cardio for longer periods of time once you get used to light cardio.
Make sure you ask your doctor which exercises you can safely do with your heart issues., There are established guidelines and treatments for atrial fibrillation using certain medications. The three main factors to be considered are the control of your heart rate, conversion of your atrial fibrillation to normal, and anticoagulation therapy. Your doctor will decide on the class of medication and individual dosing to provide you with based on a full physical workup. The four classes of medications for control of the ventricular heart rate are:


Beta blockers such as metoprolol, which reduce blood pressure by blocking the effects of epinephrine
Nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, such as verapamil and diltiazem
Digoxin, which increases the intensity of heart muscle contraction without increasing the length of contraction
Amiodarone, which causes a prolonged phase of the heart contraction

Look for changes around the injection site.,
Inspect the injection site.,
Avoid scratching at the injection site.,
Understand long term effects.",How to Know when Your Vein Has Collapsed1," Common symptoms of a collapsed vein are discoloration, tenderness, and swelling. Monitor the area where the needle was inserted for atypical bruising, discoloration, or sensitivity to touch.A large collapsed vein may also cause extremities such as hands or feet to feel cold, but this is typically more a symptom of a collapsed artery, which is a different and more critical issue.;
, If your vein has collapsed, you’ll experience sharp pain at the injection site. The site may also bruise, or appear black and blue. The injection site may also become itchy., If the injection site begins to itch, this is actually a good sign. While it confirms that the vein was collapsed, the itching indicates that blood is starting to reopen the vein and recirculate. Scratching the itch, however, can interrupt this process and risks permanently damaging the vein., Nearly every intravenous drug user will experience a collapsed vein at some point during their drug use. Often, veins will reopen on their own. When they do not, serious, permanent health complications can follow, including inadequate circulation.Ultimately, very little can be done about a collapsed vein. As such, it is vital to focus on preventing your veins from collapsing.

The accumulation of acids in the body is usually associated with the development of hyperkalemia.",How to Learn and Study the Medical Syndrome of Hyperkalemia in Humans," This article discusses the electrolyte disturbance of K+ ions that is called clinically hyperkalemia. This is one medical syndrome that is manifested by excessive amount of K+ ions in the extracellular space between the cells of the body and in the blood plasma. This excess of this ion in the body has many causes and is associated with distinct clinical symptoms. These clinical symptoms are the direct result of its physiological function in the body. This function of K+ ions is to mediate the formation of action potentials in neurons of the nervous system. This triggered action potential can then allow for the propagation of electrical signals along the anatomical structures of the nervous system between the adjacent neurons.;
, K+ is the main cation inside the cells of the body. The main cation outside the body is Na+. This arrangement of ions across the cellular membrane is the direct result of active transport of Na+ and K+ ions between the inner and the outer sides of the cells of the body.

, The natural selection is that Na+ ions are pumped in the direction outside the cell while K+ ions are pumped in the direction inside the cells. This fact makes the concentration of K+ ions higher inside the cells than its concentration outside the cells. On the other hand, Na+ ions are predominantly found outside the cells while their concentration inside the cells is marginal. The active transport of these two ions across the cellular membrane creates a resting electric potential across the membrane of the body cells.

, The formation of the action potential in a neuron can lead to the propagation of electrical signals between the adjacent neurons. this is the usual manner of communication between neurons of the nervous system and between a neuron and a muscle cell. from this previous discussion we see the importance of K+ ions in this process of cellular communication between the various cells of the nervous system. any disturbance in the concentration of this ion in the extracellular space can therefore have drastic effects on this manner of cellular communication between the neurons of the body.

, The main disorder of K+ that is discussed here is the hyperkalemia medical syndrome. This clinical disorder of K+ is manifested by the presence of large amount of K+ ions in the extra-cellular space between the neurons of the nervous system of the body. this clinical disorder is triggered due to various reasons.

, One of them is a hypoaldosteronism condition in the body. the deficiency of the steroid hormone in the blood is usually associated with the depletion of Na+ ions from the body through the kidney nephrons. At the same time there is conservation of K+ ions into the body by an antiporter mechanism that transports Na+ ions in one direction and K+ ions in the other direction. This leads eventually to the accumulation of K+ ions in the extracellular space and the depletion of Na+ ions form the body. this form of hyperkalemia is always formed due to deficiency of the hormone aldosterone in the blood.

, The other cause of hyperkalemia is due to chronic kidney failure. In chronic kidney failure there is total retention of electrolytes in the body. This includes Na+ and K+ and other electrolytes as well. However Na+ and K+ are the two main ions of clinical impotence to the physician. This conservation of these two ions lead to symptoms of hyperkalemia due to the accumulation of K+ ions in the body. This hyperkalemic state has distinct clinical manifestations such as their effects on the normal performance of the heart muscle. Also the excessive amount of K+ in the body usually leads to problems in the normal function of the cells of the nervous system.

, Another cause to hyperkalemia in the human body is a metabolic acidosis medical condition in the body.

, This can be explained by the antiporter mechanisms that are functional across the cellular membranes. these antiporter mechanisms transport H+ into the cells. At the same time there is transport of K+ ions in the other opposite direction outside the cells. The net result is the accumulation of K+ ions in the extracellular space between neurons and between the other cells of the body as well. This is another form of hyperkalemia that occurs i the body due to metabolic acidosis such as diabetic ketoacidosis and lactic acidosis.

Watch out for bone pain.",How to Tell if Colorectal Cancer Has Spread to Your Bones," Most cases of bone cancer can be identified through an X-ray of the bone. The affected bone may appear to be worn out instead of being firm or solid.


A hole-like structure in the bone can be indicative of cancer. There are also instances where the tumor around the bone becomes visible and is already affecting the surrounding tissues.
Most of the time radiologists can tell whether a tumor is malignant just by looking at the X-ray, but only a biopsy test can confirm the diagnosis.;
, A CT (computed tomography) scan is an X-ray procedure that generates more detailed and cross-sectional images of the body’s structure.


A special device called a CT scanner takes numerous pictures as it rotates around the patient’s body. These images are then transmitted to a computer which in turn produces various images of the affected part of the body.
CT scans are used to determine whether the cancer cells have metastasized to other organs in the body such as the lungs and liver. It can also reveal affliction within any lymph nodes in the body.
Before the procedures starts, the patient is asked to drink a contrast agent (about 1 to 2 pints) or the agent s injected through an intravenous line. This substance can be helpful in outlining the stomach and intestine for better identification of tumors.

, Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans use radio waves and strong magnets to produce a detailed pattern transmitted by the affected tissue. A computer then converts these patterns into a very detailed image of the studied body structure. In some cases, a contrast dye called gadolinium is injected into the patient’s vein to clearly recognize tumors.


MRI scans are often the best option in outlining bone tumor. They are also recommended for brain and spinal cord cases.
MRI scans can cause anxiety for some patients, especially those who have fear of enclosed spaces. During the procedure, patients are placed inside a tube-like machine for up to an hour.
The machine also produces a throbbing noise that can be uncomfortable for some individuals, but other facilities provide headphones with music to address this problem.

, This scan reveals the extent of cancer cells in the body and whether the cancer has already metastasized to other bone structures or not.


It can also provide an earlier detection of metastases than the usual X-ray procedure, and show the damage caused in the bone by the primary cancer.
Before the procedure begins, a very low amount of radioactive dye (technetium diphosphonate) is injected into the patient’s vein. This substance is attracted to damaged bone cells throughout the entire body.
Areas of damaged bone cells can be detected in the bone scan as they appear as dense, gray to black areas (“hot spots”). These areas may be indicative of metastatic cancer.

, This procedure uses a form of sugar (glucose) that contains a radioactive atom. Cancer cells then absorb this radioactive sugar due to its high rate of metabolism.


This radioactivity within the body can be detected by a special camera. Through the use of this procedure, the cancer cells in the body can be identified and tumors can be distinguished as benign or malignant.

, This is a delicate procedure that collects tissue samples from suspected tumors. The sample is then carefully analyzed under a microscope to determine if the tumor is a form of cancer or other bone disease.


If cancer is present, the biopsy can distinguish whether it is a primary bone cancer or a metastatic bone cancer. Various kinds of tissue and cell samples are used to diagnose bone cancer; therefore it is important that only experienced surgeons perform the procedure to ensure efficiency.
The type of biopsy method recommended by surgeons will greatly depend upon the kind of tumor (benign or malignant) and the exact type of tumor (based on bone X-rays, patient’s age and site of tumor).

, The procedure starts by putting a local anesthetic into the area for biopsy. The substance produces a numbing effect on the identified area. The one of two procedures is used, as follows:



Fine needle aspiration (FNA): A very thin needle is connected to a syringe to collect a small amount of fluid and some cells from the tumor. A CT scan can be used to guide doctors as to where the needle should go. This procedure is called a CT-guided needle biopsy and is commonly done by an X-ray specialist (interventional radiologist).

Core needle biopsy: A procedure that uses a larger needle to collect a small cylinder of tissue about 1⁄16 inch (0.2 cm) in diameter and ½ inch long. It can better diagnose a primary bone cancer than FNA method.

, This is a surgical procedure that puts a patient under general anesthesia or a nerve block to numb a larger area of the affected structure. It is important that whichever surgeon performs the biopsy is also the one to remove the tumor later.



Incisional biopsy: The surgeon makes an incision through the skin to reach the tumor mass in order to collect a small tissue sample.

Excisional biopsy: The surgeon makes an incision through the skin to reach and remove the entire tumor mass.

, Reduced sensitivity to external factors may be associated with an increased level of calcium in the body.


Bone tumors compress and destroy bone structures. Because of this, calcium (which is usually stored in the bones) leaks out into the blood, resulting in high calcium levels in the blood, also known as hypercalcemia.
High levels of calcium interferes with how the brain works, leading to a decreased level of consciousness.

, The growing tumor in the bones may break the continuity of the bones and lead to fractures.

, As the growing tumor compresses against the nerves and bones, a sharp and excruciating pain is felt. The pain receptors in the area will send signals to the brain as a response to the compression in the bones.

Reduce high blood pressure.,
Control your cholesterol levels.,
Combat obesity.",How to Live with Atrial Fibrillation2," There are other medical conditions that can make your AF less manageable. On its own, AF is not a serious problem if managed correctly. The problem is the associated increased risk for stroke, heart attack, and cardiac arrest. High blood pressure is one of the most common risk factors that lead to stroke, particularly if you have AF. In addition to lifestyle changes, talk to your doctor about medications you can take to reduce your blood pressure, which may include:Beta-blockers
ACE inhibitors
Calcium channel blockers

, High cholesterol can cause AF and predisposes you to plaque deposits that cause blockages and can lead to a heart attack. You can control your cholesterol through your diet and through medications. You should aim for a total cholesterol level of less than 200 mg/dL, an HDL (good cholesterol) level higher than 40mg/dL, and a LDL level (bad cholesterol) lower than 100 mg/dL.Creating a cholesterol-conscious lifestyle includes:


Eating low-fat foods and avoiding foods that are high in saturated fat
Eating more fruits and vegetables
Taking medications for your cholesterol, such as cholesterol-lowering agents, Obesity and an increased body mass can put strain on your heart and is a risk factor for atrial fibrillation. This is because the excess weight causes your heart to work harder to pump blood throughout your body. You can lose excess weight by:


Creating a healthy diet for yourself, full of lean protein, fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and limited carbohydrates.
Exercising, which can help you to lose weight along with a healthy diet. You need to lose 7 to 10% of your body weight if you are obese, which may help to prevent further complications associated with AF.
The healthy amount of weight to lose will depend on your body type, physical abilities, and an assessment with your own physician.

"
"
Take medication.,
Receive electrical cardioversion.,
Talk to your cardiologist about catheter ablation.,
Discuss other surgical options with your cardiologist.",How to Live with Atrial Fibrillation3," Antiarrhythmics and anticoagulants are commonly used to treat AF. Antiarrhythmics are used to normalize heart rhythm by changing the amount of electrolytes in your heart. Anticoagulants thin your blood to make the formation of a clot less likely. Talk to your doctor about these medications and their potential side effects.


Examples of antiarrhymthics include beta blockers (metoprolol, atenolol, carvedilol, and propranolol); and calcium channel blockers (Diltiazem and verapamil).
Examples of anticoagulants include aspirin and warfarin.

, Your heartbeat is controlled by electrical currents that travel through your heart. Electrical cardioversion uses an electrical shock, delivered via paddles or electrodes on your chest, to reset your heart rhythm. This is done while you are under sedation so you don't feel the shock. It may take more than one shock to restore a regular heartbeat.Your cardiologist will likely have you take an anticoagulant two to three weeks before the procedure, as there is potential for the shock to loosen a blood clot in your left atrium. If the clot travels to your brain, it can cause a stroke. Taking a blood-thinner before the procedure will decrease the risk of this happening.
The procedure usually takes about 30 minutes.

, This is a procedure in which radiofrequency energy is used to destroy the tissue that is causing the irregular beating of your heart. This is usually done only after medication has proven ineffective. The doctor (a specialized cardiologist called an electrophysiologist) will insert a tube through a small incision near your groin and use catheters to view your heart as well as to painlessly send radiofrequency energy to the tissue.This procedure takes two to four hours and is considered a low-risk procedure.
After the procedure, you should not drive or drink alcohol for 24 hours. Avoid heavy lifting and strenuous activity for three days, and follow all other post-op instructions from your surgeon.

, In some cases, it may be necessary to do a more invasive surgery, such as implanting a pacemaker or an open-heart maze procedure. A pacemaker is an electrical device that is implanted near the collarbone with wires connecting it to your heart. It uses an electrical signal to keep your heartbeat regular. An open-heart maze procedure involves a surgeon making a series of small cuts in the upper part of your heart and then stitches them together. This forms scar tissue which interferes with the electrical impulses that cause AF."
"
Familiarize yourself with signs of stroke.,
Recognize signs of a heart attack.,
Prepare yourself for a medical emergency.",How to Live with Atrial Fibrillation4," Stroke is a very real risk with AF because your heart is more susceptible to sending clots to your brain. You and your family should recognize the warning signs of stroke. You may have some or all of the following signs when experiencing a stroke. Don’t ignore these warning signs, even if they go away. Seek immediate medical care. Signs of stroke include:Numbness of the face, arm, or leg, especially on one side of the body
Trouble moving an arm or leg, especially on one side of the body
Slurred speech, confusion, or trouble understanding others
Trouble seeing in one or both eyes
Trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance, or coordination
Severe headache with no known cause

, Because AF can increase your chances of having a heart attack, it is also important to know what symptoms to look for. If you experience some or all of the following symptoms, go to the hospital immediately:Chest discomfort, often in the center of the chest, that lasts more than a few minutes, or that goes away and comes back and manifests as uncomfortable pressure, squeezing, fullness, or pain
Discomfort or pain in other areas of the upper body, such as one or both arms, the back, neck, jaw, or stomach
Excessive sweating
Shortness of breath with or without chest discomfort
Cold sweat, nausea, or lightheadedness

, While AF can be managed, it is always important to be prepared for a worst case scenario. There are many things you can do that will prepare you for any life-threatening situation that calls for immediate medical attention. Ways that you can prepare in case your experience a medical emergency are:Keeping a list of emergency phone numbers with you at all times
Wearing a medical bracelet indicating pertinent conditions you may have, including any allergies and devices such as a pacemaker
Planning in advance the route to the nearest hospital and making sure your family knows the route
Asking family members to take a basic life support course

Eat a healthy diet.,
Exercise.,
Quit smoking.,
Control your alcohol intake.,
Manage any medical conditions you may have.,
Identify the symptoms of a stroke.,
Assess someone you are with if you think they might be having a stroke.,
Provide information to the doctor.",How to Prevent Stroke," A healthy diet will help you reduce your risks of obesity, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and diabetes. Each of those conditions raises your risk of having a stroke. To lower the risks of developing these conditions you can:Reduce your salt intake. This will lower your risk of developing high blood pressure. You can reduce your salt consumption by not sprinkling table salt onto your food, not salting pasta or rice water, and purchasing canned foods that say low sodium. Check the ingredients in processed foods. Many have a high salt content.
Eat a low fat diet. A fatty diet increases your risk of clogged arteries. You can easily eat less fat by choosing lean meats like poultry and fish and trimming the fat off of red meats. Drink low fat milk or skim milk instead of whole milk. Eat eggs sparingly because they are high in cholesterol. Check foods labeled “diet” or low fat- they can surprise you with sodium and fat content!
Control your caloric intake. Eating a high calorie diet places you at a higher risk for diabetes and obesity unless you are extremely physically active. Limit your intake of highly sugary foods like candies, cookies, and pastries. The processed sugar provides calories without the nutrients that will make you feel full. This can make you prone to overeating.
Increase the fruits, vegetables, and whole-grains that you eat. These foods are generally low fat and high in nutrients. They will supply you with the energy that you need without excess fat and calories.;
, Exercise an excellent way to reduce your risks for strokes, diabetes, heart disease and obesity. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Stroke Association make the following recommendations:150 minutes per week of moderate physical activity. Moderate physical activity includes things like power walking, biking, or doing water aerobics. This should be in addition to two days per week of weight training.
75 minutes per week of intense physical activity. These activities cause you to work harder than the moderate activities. Examples include jogging, sprinting, swimming laps, and biking up hill. This should also be paired with weight training twice per week.
Do three 10 minute periods of exercise per day if you do not have the time for more. This may include walking to work, walking during your lunch break, and walking home from work. The exercise doesn’t have to be done all at the same time. Bring a friend with you to make it more enjoyable.

, Smokers’ risks for strokes are twice as high as those of nonsmokers. Smoking promotes clotting, makes your blood thicker, and hardens your arteries. If you smoke and are having trouble quitting, there are many resources available to you. You can:Talk to your doctor
Get support from family and friends
Call a hotline when you are feeling the urge to smoke
Avoid places where you usually smoke
Talk to a counselor
Try medications or nicotine replacement therapy
Go to residential treatment

, Excessive drinking can raise your blood pressure and your risk of a stroke. If you drink, stay within the recommended limits:One drink per day for women and one to two drinks per day for men.
A drink is 12 ounces of beer, a glass of wine (5 ounces), or one and half ounces of liquor.

, Some medical conditions increase your risk of having a stroke. If you have one of these conditions, talk to your doctor about how to best treat it and minimize your risk of having a stroke.High blood pressure. High blood pressure is also called hypertension. It makes you one and a half times more likely to have a stroke. If you have high blood pressure talk to your doctor about what the best way to control it would be. Your doctor may suggest dietary changes, exercise, or medication.
Atrial fibrillation (AFIB). This kind of irregular heartbeat is most likely to occur in seniors or with people who have heart disease, high blood pressure or diabetes. Because of the irregular heartbeat, your blood pools in your heart. This makes it prone to clotting. If you have this condition, your doctor may suggest treatment with anticoagulant medications or electrical stimulation.
High cholesterol and fatty deposits in your arteries (atherosclerosis). Cholesterol is a waxy, fatty material in your blood. If you have too much it can clog your arteries and cause a heart attack or stroke. If you have high cholesterol, your doctor will likely suggest that you reduce it through dietary changes, exercise, and possibly medication.
Diabetes. There are two major types of diabetes: Type 1 where your body doesn’t make sufficient insulin and Type 2 where your body doesn’t react properly to your insulin. People with diabetes often also have high blood pressure, high cholesterol, atrial fibrillation, and difficulty controlling their weight. Your doctor may suggest that you lower your risk of a stroke by making dietary changes, taking medications, exercising, or taking insulin.
Carotid artery disease. This occurs when the carotid arteries get narrower. Because these vessels provide blood to your brain, this makes you more vulnerable to blockages and strokes. Your doctor will probably suggest testing your for this if you have symptoms of a stroke or significant risk factors.

, If you are at risk of having a stroke, be aware of what the symptoms are. If you think you might be having stroke, call emergency responders immediately.Numbness or weakness in your face, arm, or leg. It may occur on just one side.
Difficulty speaking or understanding speech.
Confusion.
Vision problems. This may occur in both eyes or in just one.
Difficulty walking, dizziness, and a loss of coordination.
Headache.

, The acronym is FAST. It stands for face, arms, speech, and time. Call emergency responders if the person does not pass the following assessment or if you are unsure:Face. Evaluate whether the person is able to smile with both sides of their face. If only one side responds, this is a stroke symptom. Have them stick out their tongue and check for gross deformities such as pulling to one side, severe, unusual dimpling, etc. This can be a sign of stroke.
Arms. Tell the person to raise both arms. If one arm starts to sink, this is suggestive of a stroke.
Speech. Have the person repeat a simple sentence. If they slur their words or sound odd, they may be having a stroke.
Time. If the person has any of these symptoms, they need immediate medical assistance. Call emergency services.

, It is important that the diagnosis be made as fast as possible so that treatment can begin immediately. The doctor will likely do an examination, including possibly a CT or MRI scan to determine if a stroke occurred. Other information that will be useful for the doctor to have includes:The person’s medical history
Medications the person may be on
Exactly when the symptoms started

Eat a balanced diet.,
Watch your cholesterol levels.,
Try the DASH diet.,
Reduce your sodium intake.,
Put whole grains into your diet.,
Eat more fruits and vegetables.,
Consume lean protein selectively.,
Have more soy.",How to Prevent a Heart Attack1," To help prevent blockage and reduce plaque buildup in your heart, you need to consume healthy, balanced meals. In general, a balanced diet is rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat or fat-free dairy. It also includes lean proteins, such as poultry, fish, and beans. You should also only eat foods low in saturated fat, trans fats, and cholesterol. Avoid butter, fried foods, and cheese.


Avoid dairy product with added sugar and higher calorie content.
The USDA has many resources available to learn more about how to create a balance diet.;
, CAD and the development of plaque is the result of elevated cholesterol and sugars, as well as chronically elevated blood pressure. To help reduce your cholesterol, reduce your number of carbohydrates, especially the high glycemic and high fructose foods. These are often referred to as simple or bad carbs because they are high in calories but low in the amount of energy they create during metabolism. They are processed and expended by your body very quickly and lead to fat deposition and spikes in bad sugars and fats.


Simple carbs include foods such as cookies, cakes, candy, processed cereals, white bread, white rice, chips, sodas, juices, and non-diet soft drinks.When you consume an excess of fat, sugar, or carbohydrates, your body metabolizes these into a type of molecule called lipids, which include cholesterol and triglycerides. Having unhealthy levels of lipids causes too much fat circulating in the blood. This contributes to the development of fatty plaques in vessel walls., The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet is a medically designed and studied diet plan that focuses on reducing blood pressure. It was shown the significantly lower both levels of blood pressures. The diet is high in vegetables, fruits, low-fat dairy products, whole grains, and lean proteins. It is also low in sodium, added-sugars, and fats.


It emphasizes small portion size, cutting out animal proteins, and getting enough nutrients like as potassium, calcium, and magnesium., Decreasing dietary salt intake can decrease blood pressure by several points. This will help lower your chances of heart attack because your blood will not be moving so quickly through your heart. Current recommendations are that those with high blood pressure should limit their sodium intake to less than 1500 to 2000 mg per day. Look for foods that are no salt added or reduced sodium. Don't add excess salt to your foods either. Avoid many prepackaged meals because they tend to have extremely high levels of sodium.


Be mindful of serving sizes as you eat. Make sure to keep track of the sodium you consume each day and try to keep it below 1500 mg., The DASH diet recommends six to eight servings of whole grains a day. Grains are eaten in foods such as pasta, bread, and rice. Try to eat whole grains over refined grains. If you've got a choice, opt for whole grain pasta instead of regular pasta; brown rice instead of white rice; whole wheat bread instead of white bread.


Always look for labels that clearly state ""100 percent whole grain"" or ""100 percent whole wheat."", Vegetables are delicious, diverse, and extremely healthy. Use fruits both as a natural treat and a substitute for refined, sugary sweets that you might have a hankering for. DASH recommends that you get four to five servings of fruits and vegetables per day.


Eat more squash, tomatoes, broccoli, spinach, artichokes, and carrots to up your vegetables intake as well as increase your daily fiber, potassium, and magnesium.
Leave on the edible peels of fruits for extra fiber. The peels of apples, kiwis, pears, and mangoes can all be eaten and enjoyed along with the fruit., Although a great deal of protein is not suggested, you should eat lean meats and proteins when you do. Eat no more than six servings of lean proteins per day, such as poultry breast, fish, or eggs.


When you do make meat, trim away any fat or skin from the meat before cooking. Cook them by grilling, broiling, roasting, boiling, or poaching instead of frying.
Opt for more fish instead. Fish such as salmon contain heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids, which help ease hypertension instead of contributing to it. , You should eat more soy, which contains isoflavones. These can act to lower levels of bad cholesterol and triglycerides as well as raise levels of good cholesterol. Additionally, soy products are lower in saturated fats than other types of proteins. Supplementing some of you proteins with soy can create a healthier diet.


You can buy edamame, which are soy beans, as well as tofu, soy nuts, or other foods with soy as a main ingredient."

Ask a medical professional about supplements that may help.,
Anticipate medication or surgery.",How to Know when Your Vein Has Collapsed2," Many collapsed veins cannot heal. Permanent damage can also occur in a very short amount of time. If you believe you have a collapsed vein, contact a doctor or clinic to discuss treatment options.In order to give a vein its best chance to heal, stop injecting into that vein altogether.

, Vitamin C and other supplements may help fight inflammation within the veins. That said, no supplement will eliminate the risk of a collapsed vein, nor guarantee that a collapsed vein will fully heal. It’s always best to see a medical professional immediately if you believe you may have a collapsed vein., If you are diagnosed with a recently collapsed vein, a doctor may prescribe blood thinners that will help thin your blood and encourage it to circulate. In other cases, they may recommend surgery to repair damaged veins as much as possible."

Do not repeatedly use the same injection site.,
Avoid injecting into your hand or groin.,
Clean the area and the needle before injecting.,
Perform injections slowly and carefully.",How to Know when Your Vein Has Collapsed3," The best way to avoid a collapsed vein is to eliminate the behavior that causes them. It can be hard to quit using drugs, especially if you’ve been using for a while. Fortunately, there are resources available to help you quit. Start by taking the first step and asking for help., If you have decided not to quit, there are steps you can take to make intravenous drug use less dangerous. Foremost, find a needle exchange program in your area and use it.Used needles with blunted ends are one of the most common causes of collapsed veins.

, Collapsed veins are often the result of repeated vein trauma in the same area. Avoid regularly injecting in the same site. Never inject into a site that is visibly swollen or bruised., Veins in your hands are small, and will collapse easily. Similarly, injecting into veins in your groin can cause especially dangerous circulation problems., Dirt and other debris can enter your vein and cause irritation that may lead to collapse. Accordingly, wipe down the area you will inject as well as the needle before use., There are many aspects of non-medical intravenous injections that can be dangerous. For instance, a tourniquet should never be tied too tightly, and a needle must be removed slowly after injecting."
"
Be aware of the challenges.,
Understand the side effects.,
Get diagnostic test.",How to Live with Atrial Fibrillation5," There are factors that predispose you to AF. Knowing these predisposing factors can help you to manage your AF. While some of these risk factors cannot be controlled, knowing what they are can help you to prepare for them, and will help when coming up with a management plan with your doctor.They include:


Increasing age. Stroke and heart attack affect people of all ages, but the risk increases as you get older.Gender. Men more commonly develop medical conditions caused by AF.
Heredity. People whose close blood relations have had a stroke have a higher risk of stroke, heart diseases, and AF.
History of heart problems. If you have previously had a stroke or heart attack, your chances of having AF or other heart issues increases., Irregular heart rhythms due to AF can cause pooling of blood in the heart, which can lead to the formation of clots. These clots are at risk of being dislodged and traveling to the brain, where they can block blood flow and cause a stroke.


You may also suffer from heart failure due to AF, because it causes the heart to beat irregularly. Over time, the heart muscle can become weak and this can result in poor circulation of blood throughout the body and eventual heart failure., When you have AF, your doctor may choose to routinely monitor your condition through a variety of tests that will provide a clearer picture or you condition. These tests may include:


ECG, a diagnostic test for atrial fibrillation. Your doctor will be able to visualize irregularities in your heartbeat and interpret new and ongoing issues with your heart.
Lab test for thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), because elevated levels can cause your heart rate to rise.
Lab tests for electrolytes such as potassium, sodium, magnesium, and calcium, which work for the proper functioning and timing or your heart muscle. Imbalances can affect your heart negatively.
CBC or PT/INR, which check for the quality of your blood composition which affect your heart’s ability to pump blood.
Imaging, such as a chest X-ray, if cardiopulmonary disease is suspected. This can allow the doctor to actually see what is physically wrong or damaged in your heart."
"
Exercise daily.,
Lose weight.,
Reduce your stress.,
Limit alcohol consumption.,
Reduce caffeine intake.,
Quit smoking.",How to Prevent a Heart Attack2," Incorporating exercise into your daily routine can help you prevent a heart attack. Try to include aerobic exercise, such as walking, jogging, or swimming, and strength training every day to help decrease your blood pressure. The American Heart Association recommends that for overall cardiovascular health, adults get at least 30 minutes of moderately intensive activity at least five days per week for a total of 150 minutes and moderate to high-intensity muscle-strengthening activity at least two days per week.


You can substitute your five days of moderate cardio for at least 25 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity at least three days per week for a total of 75 minutes.
If you feel that this is more than you can manage, try to start small. Doing anything that gets your heart pumping is a good thing. You can work up to longer exercises and eventually reach the recommended amount of exercise per week. Do your best to get as much exercise as you can, even if it is going for a short walk., Being overweight is tough on your heart. You should use diet and exercise to help get down and maintain a healthy body weight. Medically speaking, a healthy weight is defined by body mass index (BMI). This scale estimates your appropriate weight range according to your height and sex. A normal BMI is 18.5 to 24.9. BMIs below 18.5 are underweight, from 25.0 to 29.9 are overweight, and above 30.0 is defined as obese. You can use online BMI calculators to find out where you fall on the spectrum.


Counting calories can be an easy and efficient way to lose or maintain weight. You can estimate your daily calories needs by multiplying your weight in pounds by 10. This is the number of calories a day you need to eat to maintain your weight. If you are trying to lose weight, eat less than this number.
This number changes a bit depending on your gender, age, and daily activity level. You can use online calorie intake calculators or ask your doctor to find out your target calorie range.The healthiest rate to lose weight is at about one to two pounds per week. This is a healthy and commonly recommended rate of weight loss., Stress, anxiety, and depression can increase your risk of developing high blood pressure. Learning how to manage and cope with stress can improve both your emotional and physical health. Participating in hobbies you enjoy as well as meditation and yoga are great ways to rest and relax.Try taking some time everyday to do something that relaxes you, whether it be reading a book, sitting outside in the sunshine, or watching your favorite TV program.


You can try to incorporate a nice, brisk walk and yoga into your daily routine to destress. These activities double as exercise, which means you can help prevent a heart attack in two ways at once.
If you feel like you are struggling with anxiety or depression, speak to your healthcare professional.

, Alcohol is a refined carbohydrate that that turns to sugar in your blood. This can cause plaque build up. Additionally, men who consume more than two servings of alcohol daily, and women who consume more than one serving of alcohol daily, have an increased risk for developing hypertension.


The calories and sugars from alcohol can also lead to weight gain.Heavy drinkers who want to limit their alcohol intake should slowly lower intake over the course of several weeks. Heavy drinkers who suddenly cut back alcohol intake put themselves at risk to develop severe high blood pressure., Caffeine causes an increase in heart rate and blood pressure, especially in those who do not consume it regularly. At high doses, it can even cause irregular heart beats.The current recommendations are to consume no more than 400 mg daily. You should limit yourself to a few small cups of coffee a day or a few other caffeinated beverages, depending on their caffeine levels. If you have high blood pressure, you should limit your caffeine intake even more.


An eight oz coffee has 100 to 150 mg of caffeine, a one oz espresso has 30 to 90 mg, and an eight oz tea has 40 to 120 mg per serving.Other common sources of caffeine include sodas, energy drinks and diet pills.
Over-the-counter decongestants (phenylephrine and pseudoephedrine) can also raise blood pressure, especially if you already have a history of hypertension. Some herbal supplements, such as ginseng and guarana, can also raise blood pressure.

, Smoking is one of the most common and avoidable contributing factors to cardiovascular death. The chemicals in cigarettes cause an increase in heart rate and vessel constriction, which contributes to increased blood pressure.More importantly, cigarette smoking causes stiffening of the arteries over time, which can persist for many years after quitting.


Quit as soon as possible to stop the adverse effects. Talk to your doctor about options that can help you, such as nicotine patches, gum, counseling and support group, and prescription medication to reduce cravings."

Visit your doctor to get assessed.,
Take medicine for blood blots.,
Get cholesterol medication.,
Ask your doctor about thiazide diuretics.,
Try angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors.,
Use blockers.",How to Prevent a Heart Attack3," High cholesterol, high blood sugar, and high blood pressure may not cause symptoms until cardiovascular disease has become severe and resulted in organ damage. For this reason, it is important to schedule annual visits, or physicals, with your doctor to assess your risk of heart disease. You doctor can measure your blood pressure and order blood tests to look at cholesterol levels.


If any of these measurements are abnormal, she may prescribe medication that could be crucial for preventing a heart attack.
You should start cholesterol screening no later than age 45., Medication that help with blood clots are called antiplatelet agents. Platelets are a component of the blood that are triggered to form blood clots when there is injury. Aspirin is the most commonly used medication in this group. It is a pill generally taken once a day in a dose of 81 to 325 mg. Side effects for regular use include stomach upset and, in rare cases, GI bleeding.


Other types of antiplatelet agents include Plavix, Brilinta, and Effient. These are also pills that are generally taken once daily. The common side effect of taking these is easy bleeding and bruising., Cholesterol medications are called statins. They work by lowering bad cholesterol in your system and raising good cholesterol. This prevents the development of plaque in the heart. There are a number of different types, including Lipitor, Pravachol, Crestor, Mevacor, Altoprev, Zocor, and Livalo. These are pills that are generally taken once daily.


In general, this class of medication is very safe and has very few and infrequent side-effects. Studies have suggested that they can rarely cause minor injury to the liver and kidneys. They can also cause muscle toxicity, injury and breakdown. Statin therapy plays an especially important role in reducing cardiovascular risk in diabetic patients.

, Frequently, lifestyle changes are not enough to reduce blood pressure to healthy levels and prescription medications must be used. Thiazide diuretics reduce fluid volume and cause relaxation of vessels in your heart. This medication is taken once daily. Side effects include low potassium, which can cause muscle weakness and irregular heartbeat, as well as low sodium, which can cause dizziness, vomiting, and fatigue.The most effective regimen for lowering blood pressure is a combination of both lifestyle changes and medication. Sometimes more than one type of medication is necessary.

, ACE inhibitors stop a hormone called Angiotensin II, which results in narrowed vessels and increased fluid retention in the heart. It is generally taken one to three times daily. Major side effects include low blood pressure, which can cause dizziness and fainting, elevated potassium, and cough.


Up to 20% of patients taking an ACE inhibitor will develop a dry, hacking cough, generally within one to two weeks of starting the medication., There are three other types of medications that are classified as blockers. Beta blockers, alpha blockers, and calcium channel blockers. Alpha and beta blockers may be used if you do not respond to other medications. These work by blocking signals from nerves and hormones in the body that cause narrowed blood vessels. They are taken one to three times daily.


Side effects for beta blockers include cough and shortness of breath, low blood sugar, high potassium, depression, fatigue, and sexual dysfunction. Side effects for alpha blockers include headache, nausea, weakness, and weight gain.Also try calcium channel blockers. Calcium channel blockers are potent vasodilators, which work by relaxing the muscle in the wall of vessels. These are generally taken one to three times daily. Side effects include swelling in the lower extremities and decreased heart rate."

Use holly leaf.,
Try hawthorn berry extract.,
Consider additional herbal remedies.,
Use nutritional supplements.",How to Prevent a Heart Attack4," Although not scientifically verified, there are several herbal remedies which are thought to help hypertension. Holly leaf extract is used as a tea in China and is supposed to help blood vessels enhance circulation and blood flow to the heart.


This is available in liquid form, and is usually taken as a few drop ingested throughout the day., Hawthorn berry extract is purported to improve the supply of blood to the heart and also help to support the metabolism of the heart. This is available in a capsule or tablet for and is generally taken 500 to 1500 mg daily.


It is important to note that this can interact with other medications and should not be taken in conjunction with other medication for high blood pressure. , There are other herbal remedies that might work to help prevent a heart attack as well. Hibiscus can act like a diuretic and may have actions that mimic ACE inhibitors. Make a tea with one to two teaspoons of dried hibiscus in one cup boiling water. You can drink this tea two to three times daily.


Coconut water contains potassium and magnesium, both of which help with normal muscle function. It is recommended to drink eight oz, one to two times daily. Make sure you keep a check on the calories you are consuming, since coconut water is not calorie free.
Ginger-cardamom tea is used in India to naturally reduce blood pressure. This can be drunk one to two times daily., There are some nutritional supplements which have be shown to decrease the amount of fat in your blood and lessen your chances of a heart attack. Try buying fish oil. Omega-3 fatty acids, specifically the ones called DHA and EPA, are found in over the counter as supplements in pill form. You can also get omega-3 fatty acids from oily fish such as anchovies and tuna or nuts (especially walnuts), flaxseed and leafy vegetables. Eating one to two servings of oily fish or taking 1 gram of a fish oil supplement daily has been shown to reduce levels of triglycerides and the risk of death from heart disease.


You also need to get more plant stanols and sterols. These are found naturally in a variety of fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, and legumes. It is also added to commercially prepared products such as margarines like Promise Activ and Benecol, orange juices such as Minute Maid Premium Heart Wise, and rice milk such as Rice Dream Heartwise. You can also get them as dietary supplements such as Benecol SoftGels and Cholest-Off. Plant stanols and sterols are thought to act by preventing the intestines from absorbing cholesterol.Keep in mind that not all herbal remedies or alternative supplements are FDA approved, nor is there always enough scientific information to support their use or determine appropriate dosing. Make sure to consult your healthcare professional prior to starting new supplements.

Research WCDs.,
View the WCD as short-term option.,
Speak to your doctor.",How to Use a Wearable Defibrillator1," WCDs (or wearable cardioverter defibrillators) are medical devices worn on the body, that help prevent sudden cardiac arrest. WCDs, such as the Life vest, resemble tight-fitting fishing vests and are worn under the clothes. These vests monitor cardiovascular activity, and can deliver life-saving electric shocks to correct the heart rhythm if a problem is detected.Understand that the research is limited. These devices are relatively new and still being researched.;
, There are numerous reasons why an individual may not be able to have a defibrillator implant right away, for instance, if a patient has an infection of the heart stream or has recently given birth. Furthermore, sometimes there will simply be a wait period until individuals can undergo implant surgery. WCDs should be used to protect the patient during these wait periods.The device is commonly used for a period of 30 – 90 days. Other situations in which you might need a WCD include:To prevent SCA while the underlying heart condition is established (such as following a recent heart attack)
If your ICD has been temporarily removed due to infection
If you are in end-stage heart failure or have a life expectancy of less than year, but would otherwise be a candidate for ICD

, If you feel that a wearable cardioverter defibrillator may be a good option for you, speak to your doctor about this possibility. A WCD is only available under the direction of a physician. Many insurance companies cover the cost of the device.You might ask, “Am I at risk for sudden cardiac arrest?”
You might say, “Am I eligible to use a wearable cardioverter defibrillator?”
You might say, “I think wearing a vest like this would help me feel safe.”

Know the stages of high blood pressure.,
Diagnose high blood pressure.,
Understand essential high blood pressure.,
Learn about secondary hypertension.",How to Reduce High Blood Pressure1," If you have blood pressure above 120/80, you have high blood pressure. The stages of high blood pressure change depending on the level of pressure in your heart.


Blood pressures of 120-139 / 80-89 are considered prehypertension.
Stage 1 Hypertension is 140-159 / 90-99.
Stage 2 Hypertension is 160 or higher / 100 or higher.;
, Blood pressure varies regularly throughout the day. It is lower when you sleep and rest, and rises if you are excited, nervous, or active. For this reason, diagnosis of abnormal blood pressure is made only when elevated blood pressure is seen during at least three doctor’s visits, spaced over a period of weeks to months. Additionally, you may have isolated high blood pressure that only affects one of the two pressures measured.Whichever number puts you into the highest stage is the diagnosis you will be given. For example, if your blood pressure is 162/79, you have Stage 2 Hypertension.

, There are two categories of hypertension, essential and secondary.Essential hypertension develops gradually over many years. Causation is generally multi-factorial and it is strongly associated with several independent risk factors. Age is a major factor. The older you get, the more likely you are to develop blood pressure. This is the result of stiffening and narrowing of the arteries over time. Genetic predisposition can also play a role. Hypertension is significantly more common in those people who have parents with hypertension. Studies have shown that possibly up to 30 percent of blood pressure variation is due to genetics.


If you are obese, have diabetes, or have dyslipidemia, you are more prone to high blood pressure. Weight gain is a major risk factor. In early disease, it is the result of increased cardiac output as your body has to work harder against increased weight. Overtime, fat and sugar metabolism is disrupted, which leads to increased blood pressure. Diabetes and dyslipidemia are also diseases of deregulation of sugar and fat metabolism, respectively.
Those who experience a great deal of stress, or have hostile or anxious personalities, as well as those who suffer from depression, have been shown to be more prone to developing hypertension.
Hypertension is more common and more severe in those who are black. This is thought to be the result of both environmental, socioeconomic, and genetic factors., This type of high blood pressure occurs in response to an underlying condition. These factors include such things as kidney problems. Since your kidneys are in charge of regulating the composition of fluid in the blood and secreting excess water, both acute and chronic kidney disease can cause dysfunction, leading to excess fluid retention, increased blood volumes, and the development of high blood pressure.


You can also have this kind of high blood pressure if you have adrenal gland tumors, which can secrete hormones that affect heart rate, contraction of blood vessels, and kidney function, possibly leading to an increase blood pressure.
Other factors include thyroid problems, which cause abnormal levels of thyroid hormones and can affect heart rate and increase blood pressure. Obstructive sleep apnea puts stress on the entire respiratory and cardiovascular systems, which over time leads to hypertension.
Certain medications, both prescription and over-the-counter, have been shown to raise blood pressure. These include certain types of oral contraceptives, NSAIDs, antidepressants, steroids, decongestants, and stimulants. This is also true for illegal use of drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamines, which can raise blood pressure significantly.An unhealthy diet high in salt can also lead to conditions that produce high blood pressure.

Recognize the severity of the condition.Both TIA and a stroke are medical emergencies.,
Seek immediate medical attention if you experience symptoms.,
Look for sudden weakness in the limbs.,
Don't ignore sudden, severe headaches.Two types of stroke — ischemic and hemorrhagic — can cause this symptom.,
Notice any change in eyesight.The retinal nerve connects the eye to the brain.,
Watch for confusion and speech problems.This symptom is caused by poor oxygen delivery to the area of the brain that controls speech and understanding.,
Memorize the acronym ""FAST.,
Ask for a cardiac evaluation.,
Talk with your physician about preventative medication.,
Have any surgeries your doctor recommends.,
Maintain a healthy blood pressure (BP).,
Control your blood glucose.,
Stop smoking.,
Manage your weight.Obesity is defined as a body mass index (BMI) of 31 or higher.,
Exercise regularly on your doctor's recommendation.If your doctor doesn't think you're ready for exercise yet, don't strain your heart and risk stroke or injury.,
Take all medication as prescribed.Depending on the medication you’re taking, you may need to take it for the rest of your life.",How to Prevent a Stroke After a TIA," Although TIA resolves spontaneously on its own, it's important to diagnose and treat it as soon as possible. Early diagnosis and treatment can help reduce the potential of experiencing a stroke that can have more serious repercussions.


The early risk of stroke can be as high as 17% at 90 days after suffering TIA.;
, The symptoms of a TIA are very similar, if not identical to those of a stroke. However, while a TIA only lasts a few minutes and the symptoms of TIA resolve within an hour without medical intervention, a stroke needs medical treatment for recovery. If you experience TIA, there's a high chance that you'll have a disabling stroke in the following hours or days.As such, you should get emergency medical attention if you experience TIA/stroke symptoms.

, When experiencing TIA or stroke, people may lose coordination or be unable to walk or stand steady on their feet. They may also lose the ability to keep both arms raised above their heads. The symptoms that affect the limb often affect just one side of the body.If you suspect a problem, have the person try to pick up small and large objects. If she has trouble, she is losing coordination.
Have her try to write something so you can observe any loss of fine motor control., In ischemic conditions, oxygen-rich blood is blocked in the brain by an occluded blood vessel. In hemorrhagic conditions, a blood vessel bursts and leaks blood into the brain. In both cases, the brain reacts with inflammation. This response and tissue death can cause a sudden and severe headache.

, If the same conditions that cause the headache symptoms — blocked blood flow and leaked blood — occur around this nerve, eyesight is affected. You may experience double vision or lose vision in one or both eyes.

, People having TIA or a stroke will have trouble speaking or understanding what other people are saying. Along with this loss of ability, patients may seem confused or panicked as they realize they can no longer speak or understand speech.

,""The acronym FAST was designed to help people quickly remember and identify the symptoms of TIA and strokes. Early diagnosis and treatment will often result in better outcomes.


Face: Is the person’s face drooping? Ask him to smile to determine if one side is drooping.
Arms: People affected by a stroke may not be able to hold both arms above their head equally. One side may begin to drift downward or they may not be able to raise it at all.
Speech: During a stroke a person may experience the inability to speak or to understand what is being said to him. He may be confused or frightened by his sudden change in abilities.
Time. TIA or a stroke is an emergency and requires immediate medical attention. Do not delay to see if the symptoms resolve on their own. Call your local emergency phone number for immediate care. The longer it takes to treat the stroke, the more damage it will cause.

, After you've had TIA, the doctor needs to assess you for heart problems immediately to see if you are at risk of stroke. One of factors that most commonly leads to the development of a stroke is ""atrial fibrillation.""Patients experiencing this condition have irregular, rapid heartbeats.They often feel weak and have trouble breathing from the resulting poor blood flow.

, If you have an abnormal heartbeat after your TIA, you are at risk of developing blood clots that could lead to stroke. The doctor may recommend anticoagulant drugs like Warfarin (coumadin) or aspirin as a long-term treatment to prevent blood clots formation.Antiplatelet drugs he or she may consider to prevent clots include Plavix, Ticlid or Aggrenox., Depending on her evaluation of your case, the doctor may recommend a medical procedure to reduce your risk of stroke. In this case, imaging studies will show blockages that can be treated with one of the following procedures:An endarterectomy or angioplasty to open blocked carotid arteries
An intra-arterial thrombolysis to break up small blood clots in your brain

, High BP increases the pressure against arterial walls, which can, in turn, make an artery leak or burst, causing a stroke. Your physician will prescribe blood pressure medication that you should take as directed. He will require regular checkups to determine the effectiveness of your treatment. Along with medication, you must make the following lifestyle changes to lower your BP:



Stress reduction: Stress hormones increase blood pressure.

Sleep: Get at least eight hours of sleep a night. Sleep deficiency can increase stress hormones, negatively impact neurological health, and increase the risk of becoming overweight.Weight control: The heart has to work harder to pump blood when you're overweight, raising your BP.

Alcohol: Excess alcohol damages the liver, which increases your blood pressure.

, If you have diabetes or otherwise high blood glucose, it can damage your smallest blood vessels (microvessels) and kidneys. Kidney function is important in the control of blood pressure. By controlling diabetes, you improve your kidney health and reduce the risk of high BP — a risk factor for stroke., Smoking increases the risk of stroke to both the smoker and those who are exposed to secondhand smoke.It increases the formation of clots, thickens the blood, and increases plaque buildup in your arteries.Speak with your doctor about strategies for quitting or medications that might help you achieve your goal. You might consider joining a support group like Nicotine Anonymous.Be forgiving of yourself if you give in and smoke a couple of times before you finally quit for good.
Keep working toward your final goal, and push past the times you fell short.

, It's an independent risk factor for congestive heart disease, premature death, and high BP. While obesity is not itself an independent risk factor for stroke or TIA, it's related to factors that increase that risk. So while it doesn't directly cause stroke, there's a clear (though complex) link between obesity and stroke.

, But once your doctor approves it, you should get at least 30 minutes a day. Exercise has been found to reduce the risk factors for stroke and the other risk factors associated with stroke.


Aerobic exercises like jogging, walking, and swimming are good for reducing blood pressure. Avoid high-intensity activities like weightlifting or sprinting that can cause a rapid BP spike.

, You can’t feel high blood pressure or whether your blood needs antiplatelet medication. You should never stop taking medicine just because you ""feel okay now."" Instead, trust the tests your doctor does to assess your BP and blood clotting values. The doctor's interpretation of your test results will let you know if you still need medicine — not how you feel.

Put the vest on.,
Sleep with it on.,
Anticipate some discomfort.",How to Use a Wearable Defibrillator2," Unlike an implantable cardioverter defibrillator, this lightweight device is worn against your bare skin, under your clothes. It is critical to wear as instructed.Each day after bathing, put the vest on and be sure that the fit is snug. Use the attached Velcro to secure the vest around the chest. Then, attach the defibrillator unit to your belt or use the belt provided. Finally, be sure to switch your unit on., In order for the device to work correctly, it is important to leave it on all the time, including when you sleep. If you should experience SCA during the night, you want to be protected! Remove the vest only for bathing and showering., Not surprisingly, wearing a snug vest under your clothes is not the most comfortable. Around 20% of patients discontinue use due to discomfort. Try to value the lifesaving value of this vest over any mild discomfort you may experience."
"
Listen for a signal.,
Get a shock.,
Seek medical attention.",How to Use a Wearable Defibrillator3," If the device senses an abnormal heart rhythm, it will deliver an audio and vibration alerts.This alarm with get louder and louder until the patient responds by pressing a button (indicating a false alarm). If the patient does not press the button in a certain amount of time, the vest assumes this is life-threatening, and delivers a shock., If the patient is not conscious or otherwise able to respond to the vest’s alarm, the vest will release conductive gel onto the patient’s chest. Then, the vest will deliver a shock to the patient. This shock should correct the rhythm of the heart, preventing sudden cardiac arrest.The shock has been described as feeling like someone kicked you in the chest., If you have experienced a shock from your WCD device, seek medical attention right away for additional testing. If you are alone, you may want to contact emergency medical services. If you are with friends or family, you may choose to have them drive you.You will need to explain what happened to your doctor.
Be prepared to describe:

Any physical symptoms such as shortness of breath, sweating, lightheadedness, or pain.
When symptoms began.
If you went unconscious at any time.
If you experienced a shock.

Test yourself.,
Exercise more.,
Reduce your stress.,
Cut down on alcohol.,
Quit smoking.,
Limit your caffeine intake.,
Use herbal remedies.",How to Reduce High Blood Pressure2," You can have high blood pressure for months to years without any symptoms, but the damage caused by hypertension can eventually lead to severe health problems and even death. Generally speaking, the health problems from high blood pressure are the result of two major health stages. First, the blood vessels in your body narrow and stiffen. Second, and as a result of this, there is a decreased blood flow to different organs and body parts such as the heart, the brain, the kidneys, the eyes, and the nerves. This can lead to severe complications and life threatening situations if left unchecked.


You should test your blood pressure at a pharmacy or purchase your own home blood pressure monitor to see how yours fluctuates. if you think it is running high, you should see a doctor so she can monitor it.

, To help lower your blood pressure, you should incorporate more exercise into your daily routine. You can try both aerobic exercises such as walking, jogging, or swimming and resistance or strength training. The American Heart Association recommends that for overall cardiovascular health, adults get at least 30 minutes of moderate intensity activity at least 5 days per week for a total of 150 minutes. You can also get at least 25 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity at least 3 days per week for a total of 75 minutes and moderate- to high-intensity muscle-strengthening activity at least 2 days per week.If you feel that this is more than you can manage, the AHA insist that you do as much as you can to start. Any activity is better than no activity. Do your best to get as much exercise as you can. Even if it is going for a short walk, that is better than sitting on the couch.This can have the added benefit of helping you lose weight. Both a healthy diet and exercise should result in weight loss, which can lead to significant falls in blood pressure., Stress, anxiety, and depression can increase your risk of developing hypertension. Learning how to manage and cope with stress can improve both your emotional and physical health. Participating in hobbies you enjoy, meditation, and yoga are just a few possible ways to rest and relax.If you feel like you are struggling with anxiety or depression, speak to your healthcare professional.

, If you're a man, try to limit the amount of drinks you have daily to no more than 2. If you're a woman, try to limit the amount of drinks you have daily to no more than 1.


Heavy drinkers who want to limit their alcohol intake should slowly lower intake over the course of several weeks. Heavy drinkers who suddenly cut back alcohol intake put themselves at risk to develop severe high blood pressure., Smoking is one of the most common and avoidable contributing factors to cardiovascular death. The chemicals in cigarettes cause an increase in heart rate and vessel constriction, which cause increased blood pressure. More importantly, cigarette smoking causes stiffening of the arteries over time, which can persist for many years after quitting., Caffeine causes an increase in heart rate and blood pressure, especially in those who do not consume it regularly. At high doses, it can even cause irregular heart beats. The current recommendations are to consume no more than 400 mg daily.


To figure out how much you consume a day, you need to know how much caffeine is in common things you consume. An 8 oz coffee has 100-150mg, a 1 oz espresso has 30-90 mg, and an 8 oz caffeinated tea has 40-120 mg.

, Although not scientifically verified, there are several herbal remedies which are thought to help hypertension. As a rule, however, don't substitute these unverified herbal remedies for proven scientific advice. Instead, supplement your diet with them if they are approved by your healthcare provider.


Try holly leaf extract, which is used as a tea in China and is supposed to help blood vessels enhance circulation and blood flow to the heart.You can also try hawthorn berry extract, which is supposed to improve the supply of blood to the heart and help to support the metabolism of the heart.Taking garlic extract is supposed to help prevent heart disease. High blood pressure and cholesterol are also rumored to be somewhat controlled by garlic.Hibiscus, which you can get as a supplement or drink in tea, can act like a diuretic and may have actions that mimic medications such as ACE inhibitors and hypertension medications. You can also try ginger-cardamom tea, which is used in India to naturally reduce blood pressure.
Drinking coconut water, which contains potassium and magnesium, can help with normal muscle function.
Taking Fish oil, which is a concentration of omega-3 fatty acids, may help with fat metabolism and reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke."

Try the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet.,
Limit your salt intake.,
Put whole grains into your diet.,
Eat more vegetables.,
Incorporate fruits into your diet.,
Eat lean protein.,
Eat nuts, seeds, and legumes.,
Cut down on the sweets you have per week.",How to Reduce High Blood Pressure3," This is a medically designed and studied diet plan focusing on reducing blood pressure. It was shown the significantly lower both numbers measured with your blood pressures. The diet is high in vegetables, fruits, low-fat dairy products, whole grains, and lean proteins. It is also low in sodium, added-sugars, and fats. Most of the dietary advice that follows will take the DASH diet as its model. If you want to know more about the DASH diet and other dietary advice, schedule an appointment with your doctor.

, Sodium can significantly affect how high your blood pressure is. A central goal of the DASH diet, then, is to lower the amount of sodium the patient gets through both table salt and foods themselves.


The current recommended daily intake of salt is set by the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans at 2,300 mg.If your doctor believes that you belong on a low-sodium DASH diet, you should probably consider lowering your daily salt intake to about 1,500 mg. That's less than a teaspoon of salt per day.
Many processed foods contain high levels of sodium. Be careful of processed foods when considering how much salt your body is getting. Even processed foods that don't taste salty may have significantly more salt than is healthy. You can check the packaging on most foods to see how much sodium it has. Sodium is listed in milligrams (mg) on every nutrition label.
Be mindful of serving sizes and track the sodium you consume each day to try to keep it below 1500 mg., The DASH diet consists of 6 to 8 servings of grains, preferably whole grains, per day. Try to eat whole grains over refined grains. There are some smart choices you can make in order to avoid refined grains and eat the ones most healthy for you.


Quinoa, bulgar, farrow, oats, rice, wheat berries, and barley are all good sources of whole grains.
If you've got a choice, opt for whole grain pasta instead of regular pasta, brown rice instead of white rice, and whole wheat bread instead of white bread. Always look for labels that clearly state 100 percent whole grain or 100 percent whole wheat.

Choose food that is as unprocessed as possible. If it comes out of a bag, a drive through, or in a box with more than 3 ingredients, it is probably too processed. If is comes out of a tree or is grown in the ground, it is more than likely healthier.

, Vegetables are delicious, diverse, and very good for your blood pressure and general health. DASH recommends that you get 4 to 5 servings of vegetables per day. Squash, tomatoes, broccoli, spinach, artichokes, and carrots are good examples of vegetables that are high in fiber, potassium, and magnesium.


These vitamins are needed by the body to keep it running and help lower high blood pressure.

, Your body needs the vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that are found in fruit. You can use fruit both as a natural treat and a substitute for refined, sugary sweets that you might want. DASH recommends that you get 4 to 5 servings of fruits per day.


Leave on the edible peels of fruits for extra fiber and roughage. The peels of apples, kiwis, pears, and mangos can all be eaten and enjoyed along with the fruit.

, Adding lean protein to your diet can be helpful, but you need to make sure you limit your intake every day. DASH recommends that you get no more than 6 servings of lean protein, such as poultry breast, soy, or dairy, in a day.


When eating lean protein, be sure to trim away any fat or skin from the meat before cooking.
Never fry your meat. Try grilling, broiling, roasting, boiling, or poaching instead as a way to cook your meat.
Make sure to get lots of fresh (not fried) fish in your diet. Fish such as salmon contain heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids, which help ease high blood pressure instead of contributing to it., Aside from having plenty of omega-3 fatty acids, nuts, seeds, and legumes are rich in fiber and phytochemicals. DASH recommends getting about 4 to 6 servings per week as opposed to per day.


This restriction is because nuts, seeds, and legumes are high in calories and should be consumed in moderation.
Eat foods such as almonds, flax seeds, walnuts, sunflower seeds, lentils, peas, and kidney beans.

, You should only have about 5 servings of sweets per week if you want to follow the DASH diet strictly. If you do have sweets, try going for low-fat or non-fat sweets such as sorbets, fruit ices, or graham crackers.

Use beta blockers and alpha blockers.",How to Reduce High Blood Pressure4," Frequently, lifestyle changes are not enough to reduce blood pressure to healthy levels. In many cases, prescription medications must be used. In this situation, the most effect anti-hypertensive regimen is a combination of both lifestyle changes and medication. Sometimes more than one type of medication is necessary. There are several types of medication that can be used as initial drug therapy.

, This medication, such as chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazide, are believed to work initially by reducing fluid volume, and secondarily by causing the relaxation of your blood vessels. They are taken once daily.


Possible side effects of this medication include low potassium, which can lead to muscle weakness and irregular heart beat, as well as low sodium, which can lead to dizziness, vomiting, and fatigue., These medications, which are sometimes called amlodipine, nicardipine, nifedipine, verapamil, or diltiazem, are are potent vasodilators. They work by relaxing the muscle in the wall of your blood vessels. These are generally taken 1-3 times daily.


Possible side effects include swelling in the lower extremities and decreased heart rate., ACE inhibitors and Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are types of medications that inhibit a hormone called Angiotensin II, which results in a narrowing of blood vessels. It also helps increase fluid retention. They are generally taken 1-3 times daily.


Major side effects include low blood pressure and a lower pulse, which can cause dizziness and fainting. They also cause elevated potassium, which can cause muscle weakness, irregular heart beat, and cough. Up to 20% of patients taking an ACE inhibitor will develop a dry, hacking cough, generally within 1-2 weeks of starting the medication.
ACE inhibitors and ARBs work well for younger patients ranging from 22-51 years old., These medications may be used if you do not respond to other medications. These work by blocking signals from nerves and hormones in the body that cause the narrowing of blood vessels. They are taken 1-3 times daily.


Side effects for beta blockers include cough (if one has a tendency for asthma or allergies) and shortness of breath, low blood sugar, high potassium, depression, fatigue, and sexual dysfunction.
Side effects for alpha blockers include headache, nausea, weakness, and weight gain.
Beta blockers work well for younger patients ranging from 22-51 years old."

You’ll also need help at home for four to six weeks following your surgery.After the four to six week period, you’ll be able to return to work, resume driving, and have a more normal daily life around your house. As you slowly heal during that time, the amount of in-home assistance you’ll need will decrease.
You may need to discuss in-home care with the hospital staff if no friends or family are available.

, It’s important to have your health monitored in the weeks before your surgery, and your doctor and surgeon can advise you about which specific tests you’ll need to undergo. These tests will likely include:A red blood cell count. If your blood cell count is too low, you may be anemic and may need to receive a blood transfusion during surgery.
Clotting tests. These measure the time that it takes for your blood to form a clot. You may need to take these tests if you have recently stopped taking any blood-thinning drugs.
Chest x-rays. This will give your surgeon an idea of the size and shape of your heart and aorta.
An electrocardiogram (ECG). This measures small electrical signals produced by your heart.

, If you smoke, quit smoking before you surgery. Smoking can increase your chances of developing a chest infection, and can increase your risk of developing dangerous blood clots.Continuing to smoke will cause damage to the new bypasses and further damage the heart.

When you go in for surgery, let your anesthesiologist know that you used to smoke and how long ago you quit. This will help them manage any complications related to smoking.Quit as soon as possible to give your body time to heal and recover from smoking-related health issues before surgery.
This includes both cigarettes and marijuana.

, You should have legal documents pertaining to these matters, including a living will, properly filed.Serious complications, including death, are rare from a coronary bypass, but can still occur.

, This is important to reduce the risk of nausea and vomiting from the anesthesia, which can have serious consequences if you aspirate the vomit. If you disobey the surgeon’s instructions, they will cancel the surgery.Do not drink any alcohol within the 24 hours preceding your surgery. It can cause serious reactions with medications given at the hospital.

, The hospital will provide personal care items, so you will not need to bring a toothbrush, toothpaste, shampoo, soap, etc. You should not bring any valuables to the hospital with you. Leave expensive electronics at home. Pack a bag that includes:Personal identification and insurance information.
Emergency contact information.
Comfortable, roomy clothes that you can wear both to and from the hospital.
Any necessary personal items, including glasses, hearing aids and/or dentures.

, Check with the person who will be taking you to the hospital, and make sure that they will arrive to pick you up on time. Also take this time to straighten and clean your home, as you will not have the energy to do this once you’ve returned from the surgery.Since you’ll be largely sedentary for the days following your surgery, put whatever you’ll need during that time (tissues, TV remote, laptop or tablet with charger, etc.) by your sofa or bed.

, It’s important that you clean yourself before you go in for surgery, and not just because it's good hygiene. Bacteria on your body can infect the surgeon’s incision, and lead to serious infection following the bypass surgery.If you enter the hospital without thoroughly showering first, you’ll also introduce bacteria into the hospital environment.
Your doctor may have given you a disinfectant solution specifically to clean your chest with. This solution will reduce the risk of post-surgery infection at the incision , You should plan to get to the hospital at least one or two hours before your surgery so final tests and paperwork can be done. You’ll likely be sent to a pre-admission area before you’re admitted for surgery.The pre-admission area will take your medical history and may also perform an ECG or other quick tests prior to your surgery.
Any hair on your chest will be shaved off the site where the operation will be performed. This makes it easier to clean the skin and will prevent adhesives from tugging painfully on chest hair when removed., Since you shouldn’t eat or drink during this time, you’ll need to take the medicines with only a sip of water.


Try to relax as much as possible during this time. Say goodbye to the family member or friend who drove you to the hospital, and ask the hospital staff any final questions you have about your upcoming surgery.

Eat dinner earlier in the evening.",How to Prevent Low Blood Sugar at Night1," Changes in your bedtime routine such as eating late, exercising in the evening, or other shifts in activity can cause low blood sugar at night.It is best to stick to a regular routine before going to bed, including in relation to when you eat, take insulin shots, and exercise.;
, If you exercise in the evening, you might reduce your blood sugar levels and possibly experience low blood sugar levels during sleep.If you must exercise in the evening, remember to eat a modest snack to help maintain your glucose levels.
Keep in mind if you exercised vigorously or for a prolonged period of time earlier in the day, this can affect your insulin sensitivity for up to 24 hours. You may need to adjust your insulin regimen accordingly.

, If you drink in the evening, your body will be at a higher risk of low blood sugar levels. Your liver may be too busy getting the alcohol out of your system to produce enough glucose during the night., If you eat dinner late in the evening or only a couple hours before going to sleep, you may experience low blood sugar at night. To avoid this problem, try eating dinner earlier in the evening.If you must eat a late dinner, you may need to use a fast acting insulin such as aspart or lispro instead of your regular insulin. Be sure to consult with your doctor. These fast acting insulins stop lowering glucose levels after two to four hours as opposed to three to six hours for regular insulin medications, so you will be less likely to experience nighttime hypoglycemia. However, you should be aware that each unit of fast acting insulin can potentially lower your blood glucose more at nighttime than if you were to take the equivalent unit during the day.
You should also take note of any insulin that remains in your system from previous doses of insulin medication. If you take too much fast acting insulin at night to cover eating late, you can inadvertently cause more nighttime hypoglycemia."

The mix can stay fresh in a large ziplock bag or plastic container until it’s time to use it. Simply mix together:


1 tablespoon salt
1 tablespoon pepper
1 tablespoon garlic powder
1 tablespoon chili powder
1 tablespoon onion powder
1/2 cup of brown sugar
1/2 cup of paprika
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper

, Simply preheat your oven to 428 degrees Fahrenheit (220 degrees Celsius). Place two teaspoons of ghee (clarified butter) in a roasting tray. Place the pan in the oven for one or two minutes.


While the pan is heating up, mix 1 teaspoon of dried oregano, 400 grams of chickpeas (drained and rinsed), 1 teaspoon of smoked paprika, 3/4 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper in a mixing bowl.
Dump the mix in the pan that’s in the oven and give everything a good stir to ensure the chickpeas are evenly coated.

Consult a doctor about taking cayenne.",How to Use Cayenne Pepper to Lower Your Blood Pressure3," Use about 1/4 or 1/2 teaspoon when starting out.


Tinctures, capsules, and cayenne drinks are the most effective way to use cayenne when fighting high blood pressure; however, in addition to getting cayenne in drinks, capsules, and tinctures, you can have a few snacks or meals that incorporate cayenne.
Take a measure of your blood pressure before starting your cayenne pepper regimen so that you can track it as time goes on.
If you’re using cayenne capsules, you can take anywhere between 30 and 120 milligram capsules three times daily.

, If you haven’t been taking 1/2 teaspoon already, start taking that amount after one week. If you’ve already been taking 1/2 teaspoon, you’ll want to level up to 3/4 teaspoon. You can take it once daily or divide the amount between several meals or drinks.


Measure your blood pressure again at this point to see what kind of progress you’re making. If you aren’t noticing a change, consider adding more cayenne to your diet.
For instance, use three-quarters of a teaspoon instead of half a teaspoon.

, For instance, assuming you eat three meals per day, use 1/3 teaspoon with each meal. Take another measurement of your blood pressure after using it at this level for a week. If your results are satisfactory, reduce your daily intake slightly.


If your blood pressure has not declined to a normal level at this point, continue taking cayenne pepper three times daily until it does. Add more (up to 1 teaspoon, three times a day) if you wish to accelerate the process.
Continue to monitor your blood pressure. If it starts ticking back up, add more cayenne to your diet.

, Due to the variability of individual human bodies, it is best to talk to your doctor about whether cayenne can help you lower your blood pressure. The claims behind the healing properties of cayenne might not apply to everyone. Your doctor will help you figure out how much you should take based on your personal medical history and whether you might do better with other medical interventions that could lower blood pressure.

Know that certain addictive substances can cause PVC.",How to Treat Premature Ventricular Contraction (PVC)," If you are a healthy person, have no cardiovascular disease (hypertension, coronary artery disease, heart failure, valvular heart disease etc) or diabetes, no treatment is required for occasional PVCs. In fact, many athletic people often experience PVCs, without any cause for medical concern.;
, If you experience frequent episodes of PVCs, it's important to try to identify what activity is related to the symptoms, so you can cut back on it.


A good way to track your episodes of PVC is to make a chart of your activities and symptoms in relation to time. Draw a table with 24 columns representing 24 hours of the day. Note down your activities in each column under the respective hours of the day. Then put a tick mark under the hours when you feel symptoms.
Just a few days of charting your symptoms will give you an idea about which activity is causing PVCs. Once you have identified the activity, try to avoid it as much as possible.

, Caffeine (found in coffee, tea), alcohol, tobacco, amphetamines, cocaine etc are well known to cause PVC. These substances stimulate the sympathetic system of the body causing hyper-excitability, increased heart rate and contraction.


Try to avoid these substances or at least reduce the amount of intake. It may not be possible to give up all at once. Therefore, you should aim to reduce consumption by 5-10% every week.

, You may be taking medications that cause PVC without actually being aware of it.


These include anti-asthma medications (salbutamol, theophylline), nasal decongestants (pseudoephedrine), thyroxine and other sympathomimetic drugs. These substances excite the heart and make people more prone to developing PVCs.
Some herbal medications and supplements also contain ingredients responsible for rapid heartbeat and PVC.
You should visit your GP with a list of all prescription and non-prescription drugs to check if any of them could be causing the symptoms of PVC. Your doctor will be able to adjust the dose or prescribe heart-friendly drugs.

, Feelings of anxiety and stress trigger the release of sympathetic hormones and chemical mediators, leading to hyper-excitability of the heart. Anxiety is also a known cause of palpitation.


Therefore, you should try to avoid these negative feelings using any means possible, including self-help techniques.
Try meditation, yoga and biofeedback techniques to get rid of anxiety. You can also take help of professional therapist to choose appropriate technique.

, PVC may be the result of some underlying medical conditions like heart attack, electrolyte imbalance etc, as discussed above. In this situation, you need to correct these underlying conditions in order to get rid of PVC symptoms. Some cases can be treated at home but most require hospital care.



Hypoxia can be corrected by oxygen administration and giving medications for the underlying lung disease.

Electrolyte imbalance is usually corrected intravenously at first and then orally. The correction should be slow and strict monitoring is essential because rapid correction may lead to cardiac arrest and death (particularly applicable for potassium).

Drug toxicity is overcome by giving an antidote. It is also hospital supervised.

Heart attack is a medical emergency and must be treated in a coronary care unit (CCU). Treatment options depend on the type, severity and duration of attack.

, Beta blockers such as propranolol can be used to suppress premature ventricular contractions. They are also used for the treatment of hypertension, anxiety and a variety of other medical condition. Beta blockers are comparatively safer than other drugs used for the treatment of PVC and arrhythmia.


Tab propranolol 10-40mg 3-4 times daily will be required to treat PVCs. You should start with low dose and gradually increase the dose until satisfactory result is obtained.
Other drugs are used in more severe conditions. They are actually anti-arrhythmic group of drugs such as amiodarone, flecainide, propafenone etc. These drugs must not be taken without doctor’s advice because inappropriate use may induce serious arrhythmia instead of correcting it.

, This option is reserved for those who remain unresponsive to optimal medical therapy. The area from which ectopic beats arise or abnormal impulse generate is destroyed by radio frequency energy.

, Occasional premature ventricular contractions usually produce no symptom. It is because the person remains unaware during the very short period when it occurs. In those cases PVC is identified in ECG (electrocardiogram) during a routine health check-up.

, After each contraction of ventricles, they need some time to dilate and be filled up with blood. If they contract prematurely, there is a brief pause in signal conduction. During this period the ventricles are overfilled.


When normal signal conduction starts, the ventricles contract more forcefully to eject the accumulated blood. As a result, more blood is pumped and you feel a pounding, jumping sensation or flip-flops in the heart.

, These precede the pounding or jumping sensation. When ventricles contract prematurely, small amount of blood is ejected for which you have no feeling. After that period, the ventricles stop working briefly to restore normal rhythm. This brief pause is perceived as a skipped or missed beat because you would otherwise have a normal beat during this time.

, It is subjective awareness of heartbeat. Palpitation occurs if you have PVCs more frequently for example every 10-20 seconds or so. More frequent premature contraction may lead to a feeling of fluttering.


Under normal conditions, we do not feel our heartbeats because we are adapted to it. Irregular or abnormal beats disrupts this adaptation which is felt as palpitation.

, Sometimes premature contraction can occur in a row. As already mentioned, there is little amount of blood pumped during a premature contraction. If PVC occurs three or more times in a row, there will be continuously low cardiac output during this time.


Low cardiac output means low blood pressure and reduced blood supply to the body. If brain is depleted from blood supply for more than a few seconds, you will lose consciousness transiently (syncope or fainting).

, PVCs may occur in apparently healthy individual without any cause. Signals for rhythmic contraction of the heart originate in sinoatrial node (SA node) located in the right atrium. It is also called pacemaker of the heart. The signal then travels through specialized conducting tissue to the ventricles, causing them to contract.


However, ventricular muscle cells are also excitatory and can initiate self-contraction without any signal form SA node. In normal and healthy subjects there may be occasional self-contraction causing PVCs.

, It is medically known as myocardial infarction. There is damage of heart muscle due to impairment of blood supply. Coronary arteries provide blood supply to heart muscles. If one or more of them are blocked by a blood clot or plaque, the area supplied by them undergoes ischemic necrosis or death.


The damaged heart muscle cannot contract properly and synchronously with the remaining area. As a result, there may be initiation of contraction signal anywhere in the ventricles that spreads to other parts causing a premature beat.
The risk of PVCs is greatest in the hours following heart attack. It should be managed appropriately because it may be the early sign of life threatening arrhythmia.

, It may be dilated or hypertrophic type. Cardiomyopathy occurs as a consequence of long term cardiac disease.


Common causes are hypertension, heart attack, heart valve disease, alcohol, obesity, diabetes, thyroid disease, vitamin B1 deficiency etc. The heart chambers are dilated, muscle wall becomes thick or thin.
The normal architecture of the heart muscle is deranged. It leads to alteration of excitatory pattern of the muscle. There may also be fibrosis in different areas of the heart. All these contribute to abnormal signal transmission and PVC.

, Most common is mitral valve prolapse. Mitral valve is located between left atrium and left ventricle that controls one way blood flow. The cusps or leaflets are directed towards left ventricle.


Long standing heart disease of the valve particularly rheumatic fever may cause damage to the valve which may prolapse into the atrium.

, Chronic hypertension puts extra workload to the heart. It needs to contract more forcefully to eject the blood through resistant blood vessels. As a result, the ventricular walls are thickened in the same way as in a bodybuilder.


The hypertrophied ventricles are likely to produce frequent PVCs.

, Main electrolytes necessary for heart muscle action are potassium, magnesium and calcium. Normal levels of these electrolytes are necessary for excitability and rhythmic contraction of muscle fibers. A shift from normal levels also alters excitability and leads to generation of PVCs.


Low level of potassium (hypokalemia) as in metabolic acidosis, excessive use of diuretics (water pills), vomiting, diarrhea, Cushing’s syndrome, Liddle’s syndrome may lead to PVC and serious arrhythmia.
Low level of magnesium (hypomagnesemia) and high level of calcium (hypercalcemia) also cause abnormal heart rhythm and PVCs.

, It means low level of oxygen in blood. Hypoxia occurs when your lungs cannot work effectively to deliver oxygen to blood or there is reduced hemoglobin in blood to carry that oxygen to body tissue.


Hypoxia causes reduced oxygen delivery to heart muscles as well as other body tissues. As a result, they cannot work properly. This may cause ectopic beats and arrhythmia.

, Some medications cause altered excitability of the SA node and heart muscles. There if usually hyper-excitability resulting in generation of contraction signals in ventricular muscle before actual signal from SA node can arrive.


Common drugs causing PVCs are digoxin, aminophylline, caffeine and sympathetic agonists.

, Alcohol, tobacco etc are natural stimulants to the body and also to the heart. Excessive intake may cause rapid heartbeats and asynchronous beats in between them.

For example subarachnoid hemorrhage of the brain can be triggered and caused in most cases due to a violent traumatic accident that can injure the integrity of blood vessel in the subarachnoid layer of the brain. Usually this type of hemorrhage is serious enough to be a medical emergency that requires immediate intervention of medical personnel. If blood is lost in this type of hemorrhage in large quantities a state of hypovolemia can be occur in the body. This type of hypovolemia that is due to blood hemorrhage is general for all injuries to blood vessels of the body. In the case of hypovolemia due to subarachnoid hemorrhage other clinical symptoms can occur in addition to the hypovolemic state in the body.;
, The most serious clinical symptom that is associated with this type of hemorrhage is the development of intracranial pressure due to increased pressure of the spinal fluid in the ventricles of the brain. This is usually caused due to the blocking of this fluid drainage from the brain cavities through the subarachnoid villi into the subarachnoid space. This blocking of the normal drainage of this fluid can lead to its accumulation within these brain cavities. This can potentially cause an increase in the pressure of this fluid in the ventricles of the brain. The postulated mechanism for the reasons of this blockage is thought to be due to blood clots that form within these brain cavities that can physically block the normal outflow of this spinal fluid out of the brain cavities into the blood sinuses of the brain. Other types of hypovolemia can be caused for example due to the medical syndromes of diabetes mellitus and the medical syndrome of diabetes insipidus. Both of these two medical syndromes have common clinical symptoms of increased urination of body fluids.

, This can cause depletion of the fluids of the body if there is no compensation for the lost fluids to the body through the administration of supplementary amounts of fluids into the body. This can be achieved either through drinking fluids or through the administration of intravenous isotonic solutions of NaCl or glucose. Otherwise state of hypovolemia and dehydration can follow as a result of the water depletion from the body. Also vomiting for various reasons can cause depletion of body fluids which can cause in severe cases hypovolemia and dehydration of the body fluids. Other causes to hypovolemia in humans include the medical emergency of congestive heart failure or CHF. This medical syndrome is characterized by inability of the heart muscle to pump enough blood into the general blood circulation. This can potentially cause low blood supply to the various tissues of the body. The net result is deficient supply of oxygen and glucose to the cells of the body organs. This can cause irreversible damage to these organs of the body due to the hypovolemia.

, Chronic failure of organs such as the kidney and the liver and the pancreas can occur in hypovolemic conditions in the body blood arteries. Hypovolemic conditions in the body can sometimes be caused in the case of hypothermia or low body temperature as occurs in conditions of very cold weather. In this case also the short blood supply to the various organs of the body can lead to its irreversible damage for the same reasons of low oxygen and nutrients supply to these organs. Other causes of hypovolemic conditions in the body include the administration of pharmacological drugs in order to treat hypertensive people. One complication of this treatment is the development of low blood pressure. This is presumably caused due to the excessive dilatation of the blood vessels by the effect of the anti-hypertensive drug. In addition to the aforementioned causes of low blood pressure there are also other causes that are due to hormonal changes in the body. There are three known hormones in the body that have direct effects on the status of blood volume in the arteries. One of them is the pituitary hormone vasopressin. This hormone is a polypeptide hormone that is composed of 10 amino acids.

, It is usually secreted from the posterior aspect of this gland. This hormone has immense effect on the status of blood pressure in the body of humans. Low level of this hormone in the blood is usually associated with hypovolemic state of the blood arteries. This can occur for example due to the medical syndrome of diabetes insipidus. This medical syndrome is the direct result of low level of vasopressin in the blood that is usually the result of surgical procedure to the pituitary gland that can destroy the part of this gland that is responsible for the secretion of this hormone into the blood circulation. The other main hormone that also has very important effect on the status of blood volume in the blood arteries is called aldosterone. This is a steroid hormone that is usually synthesized and secreted into the blood from the adrenal cortex.

, Hypovolemia in this case is caused due to deficiency of this hormone in the blood. This hormone has physiological effect on the level of sodium ions in the body. Usually it stimulates the reabsorption of sodium ions in the kidney tubules. This process of sodium ions reabsorption into the body is also accompanied by the concomitant conservation of water into the body at the same time. Deficiency of aldosterone in the blood can cause depletion of sodium ions into the urine with concomitant loss of equivalent amount of water. The result is the development of hypovolemia. This can occur only if this loss of sodium and water is significant in its value.

If you have malignant high blood pressure, your doctor will assess and treat your specific symptoms.


Malignant hypertension is a somewhat outdated term from the 1920s. Today, this condition is more commonly referred to as a hypertensive emergency. A hypertensive emergency is when your systolic blood pressure is above 180 or your diastolic blood pressure is above 120.
About one-third of Americans have high blood pressure or hypertension, but only 1% of patients with hypertension will experience malignant hypertension or hypertensive crisis. The remainder have benign hypertension.;
, If you have blood pressure that is severely high, your doctor will also look for the following signs of damage to your central nervous system:Headache, which is severe, especially upon wakening. This is the most common presenting symptom if you're showing symptoms at all.
Vomiting, without other gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea
Blurred vision
Stroke
Seizure
Head trauma
Swelling of the optic disc in your eye. Your doctor will dilate your pupil to view the disc which normally has crisp margins. If you have malignant hypertension, your doctor will see a blurry disc with distorted margins.
Tiny bleeds in your eye. These are caused by the bursting of tiny blood vessels in your eye due to high blood pressure.

, Symptoms of malignant hypertension affecting the heart are less common. But, they may appear as shortness of breath when you're not active, you are active, or are lying flat. This is because fluid can accumulate in your lungs as your heart is working to pump against it. You may also notice chest pain because your heart is trying to force blood out against high blood pressure supplying the heart. Your provider will do a physical exam to look for signs that are consistent with congestive heart failure, such as:Jugular veins visible in a bulging neck
Blood rising up in the jugular veins of the neck when your liver is pushed on (hepatojugular reflux)
Swollen Feet (pedal edema)
A third or 4th heart sound called ""gallops"" due to a congested heart ventricle that's overfilled with blood (This can also be seen on an EKG)
Chest x-ray evidence of congestive heart failure, fluid in the lungs, or an enlarged heart
Chemicals secreted by your heart ventricles in congestive heart failure (B type Natriuretic Peptide and Troponin). These are found by lab tests and additional tests may be needed if your doctor thinks something else may be causing the damage.

, Your doctor will run renal lab tests to determine your kidney function. Renal and neurologic findings are commonly found together in malignant hypertension. Your provider will check for:Foot swelling (pedal edema)
A rushing sound over your renal arteries (renal bruits) that signifies obstructed blood flow.
Protein in your urine analysis. Since the kidneys should be filtering out protein, this signals damage to the filtration units from severely elevated blood pressure.
Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) and Creatinine (Cr) ratio in your blood work. A normal BUN/Cr ratio is 1, and accumulates at 1 for each day that the kidneys are being damaged. For example a BUN/Cr ratio of 3 would indicate that kidney damage has been occurring for 3 days.

, Primary simply refers to ongoing benign hypertension that suddenly becomes elevated with target organ damage. Secondary refers to malignant hypertension caused by another underlying disease. Your doctor will order additional lab tests or imaging studies to diagnose these. It's important to treat not only the hypertensive crisis by lowering your blood pressure, but to treat the underlying cause as well. The following are some secondary causes (and treatments):Pregnancy (such as preeclampsia): Ultimate treatment is delivery of the baby, but symptoms can be temporarily treated with medication if the baby's lungs aren't fully developed and the mother isn't showing neurological symptoms. During pregnancy, hypertensive emergencies should be treated with magnesium sulfate, methyldopa, hydralazine, and/or labetalol.
Cocaine use/overdose, which is treated like primary malignant hypertension.
Alcohol withdrawal: Medication (Benzodiazepine) is used to treat the malignant hypertension caused by alcohol withdrawal.
Beta-blocker withdrawal: Suddenly stopping a beta blocker or high blood pressure medication can cause this rebound effect so beta blockers are actually prescribed to treat the hypertension.
Alpha blocker (clonidine) withdrawal
Renal artery stenosis, or narrowing of the renal artery leading to the kidney: Treatment includes surgery (angioplasty) to expand the artery.
Pheochromocytoma: A tumor of the adrenal gland which is usually treated by removing the tumor.
Coarctation of the aorta, a shortened aorta which is a congenital defect. Treatment involves surgical repair.
Hypothyroidism: Medication, surgery, or beta blockers can be used as treatment.
Aortic dissection, or a tear in the aorta. This requires surgery within hours because it is extremely life threatening.

, Because there are so many factors to consider when diagnosing malignant hypertension, there are no universal guidelines on pharmacology or recommended medical therapies. Your doctor will evaluate your medical history and current condition before promptly beginning treatment.Your doctor will need to take into account drug interactions (especially if there's an underlying cause for your malignant hypertension), the resources available at the medical facility, and the level of medical expertise available.

, Your doctor will immediately try to reduce your blood pressure to safe levels within 1 hour (usually this is a 10 to 15 % decrease). Your blood pressure should continue to decrease of the next 24 to 48 hours, while you're in intensive or critical care. Your doctor will then wean you off of intravenous to oral agents to get you prepared for hospital discharge.


Therapy for malignant hypertension is always intravenous agents/medications. When you're being weaned off of them, you'll be given a reduced amount and given oral medications in the same drug class., Labetalol is a beta blocker that blocks the effects of epinephrine and adrenaline. You will receive labetalol if you've had a heart attack (myocardial infarction or angina) because of malignant hypertension. It works quickly to reduce your blood pressure and is an easily adjustable intravenous medication.Because the lungs also have beta receptors, labetalol isn't the first choice for treatment in patients with pulmonary edema from the malignant hypertension.

, Nitroprusside is a vasodilator, a medication used to dilate or open the blood vessels, reducing blood pressure very quickly. Since it's on a constant intravenous (IV) infusion pump, the dosage can easily be changed to anywhere from 0.25 to 8.0µg/kg/min. It does require a sensor line to be inserted in your femoral artery for continuous monitoring.You'll be constantly monitored while receiving nitroprusside. Because of its rapid action, it can cause a steep drop in blood pressure too quickly. This can compromise how much blood gets to your brain. Fortunately, the dosage is easily adjustable.
Fenoldopam is another rapid acting vasodilating agent that's usually recommended for patients with renal (kidney) failure.

, This is a calcium-channel blocker which works on the calcium channels of the cells within the smooth muscles of your blood vessels. This causes them to expand which reduces blood pressure.Nicardipine is easy to adjust for optimum blood pressure control. It's also easy to wean from nicardipine to an oral medication, like Verapamil.

, Depending on your medical needs, your doctor may treat you using one of the following intravenous medications:


Hydralazine: Used to control malignant hypertension in pregnant women, due to safety profile for fetus.Phentolamine: Used exclusively if you have confirmed malignant hypertension caused by a tumor of the adrenal gland (pheochromocytoma).Lasix: Used to supplement treatment for malignant hypertension. It's a diuretic, causing one to urinate excess fluid. It's beneficial if you have pulmonary edema or congestive heart failure as symptoms.Enalapril: This ace inhibitor agent works by inhibiting dilating blood vessels, but it can't be used in renal failure., You'll need to follow your doctor's recommendations following treatment. Be prompt and consistent when checking in with your primary physician.You'll need to work together to create target goals for your blood pressure. Usually, you're goal will be to get your blood pressure to less than 140/90.

, Make sure you consume no more than 2,000mg of sodium a day. Too much sodium can increase your blood pressure and put you at risk for heart attack and stroke.Make sure you're eating fresh fruits and vegetables and avoiding processed foods. These items can high high sodium contents.


Refrain from buying canned goods, since they contain salt in order to preserve the color and to keep the food fresh. If you do purchase canned goods, look for low-sodium or no-salt options.

, Although activity will be limited until you are out of the hospital, you can resume normal activities and exercise once your blood pressure has stabilized. You can do aerobic (cardio), resistance or weight training, and isometric resistance training. These all work to decrease diastolic and systolic blood pressure.Systolic blood pressure is pressure measuring when your heart contracts while diastolic blood pressure measures the pressure when your heart rests between beats.Adults should exercise a total of 2 hours and 30 minutes a week, according to the Surgeon General. Try to do a moderate-intensity exercise like walking, biking or swimming., If you're obese, your arteries have to work harder to supply your body with blood which raises your blood pressure. Determine your Body Mass Index (BMI) using an online calculator. According to the Centers for Disease Control, if you have a BMI of 30 or higher, you're considered obese.Work to lose weight and reduce your BMI to within the range of 25 and 30.


Reduce your caloric intake and exercise regularly. This is the safest way to lose weight.

, Smoking decreases the amount of oxygen going to your heart, increases your blood pressure and heart rate, increases blood clotting, and damages cells that line your coronary arteries and other blood vessels.If you are a current smoker, you are more prone to high blood pressure, which could possibly lead to malignant hypertension.


If you're having difficulty quitting or cutting back, talk with your doctor. Your doctor may be able to offer supplemental medications or counseling to aid in quitting.

Lower your cholesterol.,
Decrease your blood pressure.,
Exercise more often.,
Quit smoking as soon as possible.",How to Treat Peripheral Artery Disease1," One way to treat PAD is to decrease your cholesterol. This can be done with medication, but it can also be done by changing your diet. A diet low in bad cholesterol is a good start.


There are some foods that can really help lower cholesterol. They either bond to cholesterol and help get it out of the body, directly lower cholesterol, or block cholesterol from being absorbed by the body. These include: oats, whole grains, beans, eggplant, okra, nuts, vegetable oils, fruits high in pectin, and fiber supplements.;
, In addition to lowering your cholesterol, it's important to lower your blood pressure. To lower blood pressure you should take blood pressure medication and adopt a low fat and low sodium diet.Also, lowering your stress can help to lower your blood pressure as well.


It can also help your blood pressure to stop smoking and to drink alcohol only in moderation.

, Changing your lifestyle to treat your PAD means that you will need to get moving, literally. Exercise can help to reduce your cholesterol, blood pressure, and weight, but it can also directly help the blood circulation in your limbs as well.You can start off slowly by just taking a short walk every day or doing some simple leg exercises at home. Building up to longer or more strenuous amounts of exercise is better than doing too much right away and then getting frustrated.
Consult with your doctor about your overall fitness level and your overall health. Your doctor may have some suggestions for exercise plans or additional experts to consult.

, Smoking is a large risk factor for PAD, and quitting now can help your condition if you have already been diagnosed. Start a smoking cessation plan today and discuss it with your doctor, so that you can get the support that you need.There are a variety of products that can be used to help you quit smoking, including nicotine patches and gum. Discuss your options with your doctor so that you can make an informed decision about what will help you the most.

Get a medical diagnosis.,
Take medication.,
Consider getting a medical procedure done.",How to Treat Peripheral Artery Disease2," In order for a doctor to treat your PAD medically, they will need to assess the severity of your condition. In order to diagnose PAD, the doctor will need to do an ankle-brachial index test that compares the blood pressure in your foot and your arm. They will then do a imaging test to get a look at the actual blood flow in your limbs.Imaging tests used by doctors to diagnose PAD include CT scans, ultrasounds, MRI scans, and angiography.

, If you are diagnosed with PAD it is likely that your doctor will put you on medication that will lower your cholesterol and your blood pressure. Additionally, your doctor may prescribe medication to prevent blood clots, as clots can occur more easily in arteries that are abnormally restricted.Even if you plan on working to lower your cholesterol and blood pressure through diet and exercise, you will still need to take medication in the mean time.
To prevent blood clots your doctor may tell you to take aspirin or may prescribe clopidogrel (Plavix). In order to treat symptoms they may also prescribe cilostazol (Pletal), which increases blood flow by thinning the blood and widening the blood vessels., For cases of PAD that are very serious, you may need to consider getting a minimally-invasive procedure done to correct the problem. This is not done for mild cases of PAD, but if blood flow to the limbs is severely compromised, your doctor may suggest it.There are several types of procedures done for treating PAD. They include: going into the artery and cleaning the plaque out of it, putting stents in the arteries to keep them open, or having a bypass graft surgically implanted to go around the blockage in the arteries.

Pay attention to pain and numbness in your limbs.,
Notice when infections take a long time to heal.,
Watch for other symptoms of PAD.,
Consider risk factors.",How to Treat Peripheral Artery Disease3," PAD can cause your limbs to go numb or it can cause them to be painful. For example, you may have leg pain when you walk or climb stairs.If you are older, don't assume that leg pain is just part of aging. Have your legs checked out by a doctor to make sure that you don't have PAD.

, If you get a cut or an injury on your limbs, it may take more time to heal if you have PAD. This is because of the decreased blood flow due to blockage in the arteries.In really severe cases of PAD, injuries to the limbs can develop into gangrene, which is tissue death.
In the most severe cases, you can even lose a limb if PAD is left untreated.

, Along with pain and sores that just won’t heal, PAD can have a variety of different symptoms. Some other symptoms you may notice include:Legs feel numb, cold, or weak.
Color changes in your legs.
Slow hair growth or hair loss on your legs.
Slow toenail growth.
Shiny patches of skin on your legs.
Having a weak pulse in your legs.
Erectile dysfunction (men).

, There are some risk factors that could increase your chance of getting PAD. The main risk factors are smoking and diabetes. If you have both of these risk factors, you are more likely to get PAD.Additional risk factors that increase your risk of PAD include age, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and a history of coronary heart disease, stroke, or metabolic syndrome.

Know the numbers and what they mean.,
Consult with your doctor.,
Check your blood pressure using a machine.,
Buy a blood pressure monitor.,
Know what constitutes low blood pressure.,
Increase your salt intake.,
Drink more water.,
Wear compression stockings.,
Maintain a healthy diet.,
Eat smaller portions more frequently.,
Know when to get help.",How to Treat Low Blood Pressure Naturally," When checking your blood pressure, the systolic (top number) should be around 120, and the diastolic (bottom number) should be around 80.Systolic blood pressure measures the pressure that is exerted on the arteries by the force of your blood being pushed through by your heart.
Diastolic blood pressure measures the pressure that exists in your arteries when your heart rests between beats.
Keep in mind that everyone's bodies are different, so there will be some fluctuation. However, blood pressure numbers should be kept as close to these averages as possible.;
, Generally, people start having their blood pressure checked regularly by their doctors as children.This means that you are more likely to catch a problem with blood pressure early on, which is good because high and low blood pressure often have no symptoms until the problem is very advanced.

, Many local drug stores and pharmacies have machines that you can put your arm in that will test your blood pressure for you for free.


However, some experts claim that these measurements are only accurate for people with average sized arms.So it is still best to check with a doctor if you are worried about your blood pressure.

, These are available from nearly every pharmacy or supermarket, and can cost as little as $20. These devices are a great way to keep track of your blood pressure numbers from the comfort of your own home.

, Typically a reading of 90 (systolic) over 60 (diastolic) that is sustained over time is considered low blood pressure and should be treated.


Low blood pressure is not generally an indicator of a problem unless it gets too low. In fact, people strive for lower blood pressure. So, if your blood pressure is a bit low, don't be alarmed until your doctor tells you it is a problem.
If you and your doctor decide that your low blood pressure needs to be treated, try some of the following natural methods.

, Though most doctors recommend that people limit their salt intake because it can raise blood pressure,this can be a good thing for people with low blood pressure.


Make sure you consult with your doctor before significantly raising your sodium intake because excess sodium can lead to heart failure, especially in older adults.If you do start increasing your sodium intake to raise your blood pressure, make sure you continue monitoring your blood pressure numbers over time using one of the previously discussed methods (regular doctor visits, using a home blood pressure monitoring cuff, or using a blood pressure machine in a drug store or pharmacy).

, Drinking water is good for everyone, but it can help raise your blood pressure if it is too low.There aren't any possible negative side effects from drinking more water. So, even if drinking more water doesn't end up working to raise your blood pressure, it will still help your body become more healthy overall.

, These special socks can help lower blood pressure by reducing the pooling of blood in your legs.There are few negative side effects for wearing compression socks, if worn properly. However, if you wear stockings that are too tight or keep them on for too long, they can damage the skin that they come into contact with., Eat a variety of foods including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean chicken or fish. This step can be beneficial for everyone, not just those who have low blood pressure. But it is an effective way to ensure that the arteries get all the nutrients they need.

, Eating smaller meals more often during the day can help prevent your blood pressure from dropping quickly after meals.Try to eat low-carb meals.

, If you attempt to lower your blood pressure naturally using one of these methods and there is no change in the numbers over a period of several months, make sure you consult with your doctor as it may be time to consider medication as a possibility.

Look for symptoms of low potassium levels.,
Look for common causes of low potassium levels.,
Watch for signs of hyperkalemia.",How to Treat Low Potassium Blood Levels1," Having either too much or too little potassium in your blood can lead to health complications. Having a low level of potassium in your blood is called hypokalemia.Effects of hypokalemia can include weak muscles, an abnormal heart rhythm, and a slight rise in blood pressure.Additional symptoms can include:Constipation
Fatigue
Muscle spasms
Muscle tingling or numbness;
, Several common and not so common health-related occurrences can contribute to low potassium levels. You have suffer a drop in potassium levels due to:Taking antibiotics
Experiencing diarrhea or vomiting
Experiencing high levels of sweating
Using too many laxatives
Suffering from chronic kidney disease
Using diuretic medicines (water pills) to treat heart failure and high blood pressure
Suffering from an eating disorder
Having low levels of magnesium

, Hyperkalemia is the presence of too much potassium in your blood.The condition often has few symptoms, but you may notice nausea, a weak or irregular pulse, or a slow heartbeat to the point of collapse.If you experience any of these symptoms in association with an increased-potassium diet, then you should see your doctor immediately.


Your kidneys typically help expel excess potassium through your urine. This makes hyperkalemia more common in those with kidney and other conditions, as well as those with Addison’s disease, those taking taking blood pressure drugs, those with hemolytic anemia, and those with certain tumors."

Avoid caffeinated food and beverages.,
Consume foods that are rich in potassium.,
Use motherwort to control tachycardia.,
Try taking Arjuna (Terminalia Arjuna).,
Consider trying valerian.",How to Treat Tachycardia with Home Remedies1," Stimulants like caffeine can exacerbate the symptoms of tachycardia. Caffeine contains chemical compounds that increase your level of alertness. It does this by stimulating the central nervous system and cerebral cortex of the brain, which causes vasodilation of your blood vessels. This can increase your blood pressure, which in turn can affect the electrical conduction in your heart, leading to rapid heartbeats.


While it depends on the individual, one to three cups of caffeine can increase the average person’s heart rate. Try to avoid drinking more than one cup of coffee, black tea, cola sodas, or eating chocolate at a time. Instead, opt for the decaffeinated option if you still want to consume these items.;
, Having an electrolyte imbalance can lead to tachycardia. Low potassium levels, which is an electrolyte, is a very common cause of tachycardia. To combat this, eat foods that are rich in potassium. However, if you have hyperkalemia or other co-morbid conditions, it is very important that you talk to your doctor about how much potassium you should consume.


Foods that are rich in potassium include bananas, avocados, vegetables, root crops like potatoes, milk and oranges.

, Motherwort is used in traditional Chinese medicine to combat different heart problems, including tachycardia. This herb contain alkaloid leonurine, a natural chemical that acts as a vasodilator. It has an antispasmodic property that can help to relax your heart muscles.To prepare motherwort, pound motherwort leaves to make a tablespoon of extract. Pour a cup of hot water and mix it with the teaspoon of motherwort. Let it sit for several minutes, strain the mixture, and then drink it.

, Arjuna is a common tree in India. Chemical laboratory studies showed that arjuna may contain antioxidants and flavonoids including, essential minerals and co-enzyme Q-10, which may help to regulate heart rhythm.You can purchase arjuna tablets at natural food stores.

, Valerian is a medicinal herb which is thought to help relax the heart’s smooth muscles and normalize heart function. It may also help to promote sleep and relaxation.Use a ceramic kettle and bring a teapot full of water to boil. Add a teaspoon of dried valerian root. Strain and drink.

Work with a doctor to develop a treatment plan.,
Consider medication.,
Get a pacemaker if necessary.,
Get an angioplasty and/or stent if necessary.,
Talk to your doctor about getting a heart bypass if necessary.,
Consider having a heart transplant.,
Eat a healthy diet.Healthy meals and snacks can help reduce your intake of saturated fats, trans fats, and cholesterol, all of which lead to an increased risk of heart disease.,
Avoid eating meat.Meat is high in saturated fat and carnitine, a protein which thickens the artery walls.,
Get active.,
Stay focused when losing weight.,
Get eight hours of sleep each night.While there are many obvious complications which follow accompany a lack of sleep – fatigue, irritability, depression – there are also even more serious threats to your heart’s health.,
Reduce stress in your life.,
Quit smoking.,
Reduce your alcohol intake.Excessive alcohol consumption (more than a glass of beer or wine a day) can raise your blood pressure and triglyceride level, increasing your risk of heart disease.,
Confront depression.If you have depression, you can be at greater risk for heart disease.",How to Treat Heart Disease," Your doctor will familiarize themselves with your specific condition, symptoms, and genetic background to develop a plan suited to your situation. Usually, a doctor will employ medication, testing, invasive procedure, and/or surgery in addition to prescribing lifestyle changes to an individual diagnosed with heart disease.Don't be afraid to ask questions of your doctor about your treatment. Ask for info on success rates and important factors which may have brought on your heart disease. Additionally, ask questions about financial matters like the cost of surgery, medication, or other treatment plans.
With your doctor's help, set benchmarks for yourself to monitor your treatment. For instance, you might aim for progressively lower blood pressure each month until you attain a healthy blood pressure.;
, Sometimes simple lifestyle changes are not sufficient to treat heart disease. Medication is an effective way to treat many types of heart disease symptoms. Drugs can treat elevated blood pressure, heart arrhythmias, heart attacks, strokes, and heart valve problems.


Beta-blockers decrease heart rate and lighten the workload on your heart. They are useful for treating both arrhythmia and high blood pressure. Calcium-channel blockers are useful for treating high blood pressure and arrhythmia.
Anticoagulants are also useful for treating individuals with heart disease because they make the blood thinner, thereby allowing it to flow more easily throughout the body. While anticoagulants do not break up existing clots, they can help prevent future strokes.Always take your medication exactly as prescribed. Never stop taking a heart medication without talking to your doctor first, since this may exacerbate your condition.
All medications have side effects. Familiarize yourself with the potential side effects of the drug you use to treat your heart disease and alert your physician immediately if you experience any. Anti-arrhythmic drugs, in particular, can have serious side effects, so take care to use them exactly as prescribed and ask your doctor if you have any questions about them.
Check with a physician before taking additional medication or supplements — even over-the-counter meds — since some of these substances can interact unfavorably with heart disease medications.

, A pacemaker is a small device inserted in your heart which corrects heart block, arrhythmia and, in some cases, congestive heart failure and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.Before getting a pacemaker, ask your doctor what your maximum acceptable heart rate above your pacemaker’s rate is. Find out the programmed upper and lower heart rate the pacemaker will pump at.Monitor your heart rate as often as your doctor recommends, and keep a record of your heart rate to ensure your pacemaker is operating properly.


Do not eat or drink anything before getting your pacemaker installed.
If you detect a major down-tick in your heart rate, contact your doctor immediately. Your pacemaker’s batteries may need to be replaced, or your pacemaker may be defective.
Avoid putting pressure on the area of your chest where your pacemaker was implanted.

, There are several kinds of angioplasty, but all are useful procedures which open blocked arteries in your heart.Your angioplasty may involve the use of stents, small tubes which are used to open the arteries of the heart, thereby reducing likelihood of heart disease symptoms like chest pain or heart attacks.


Do not eat or drink the night before your angioplasty.
Angioplasty usually takes one to three hours, but the recovery period might require you to stay overnight in the hospital.
Let your doctor know if you are taking any other medications or drugs before getting an angioplasty.
Take aspirin and relaxation medication (provided by the doctor) before getting your angioplasty.

, Heart bypass surgery, or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), can help relieve your heart disease symptoms like chest pain and shortness of breath.A surgeon will reroute your blood around the blocked artery or arteries in order to help your heart get the blood it needs.


The whole procedure takes three to six hours; full recovery may take up to two months; you’ll need to remain under the doctor’s care in the hospital for three to five days.

, If your heart is severely damaged or medicine and other procedures have not worked well to treat your heart disease, you may require a heart transplant.A heart transplant involves swapping out your entire heart for another. Heart transplants are usually successful, and new research has made the mortality rate during heart transplants drop to just 1%.You might get either orthotopic or a heterotopic transplant.


A orthotopic transplant is the most common form of heart transplant. Your heart will be removed entirely and a new heart provided by a donor will be inserted into your chest.
A heterotopic transplant — also called a piggyback transplant — leaves your heart in place but adds a second heart to the right side of your chest. This option is useful because it makes the new heart act as a backup when certain complications arise.Your doctor will inform you as to which transplant option is best.
Recovery times vary from patient to patient and case to case.

, Try to replace processed and junk foods like soda, cookies, and chips with fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and foods high in fiber.


Replace whole fat or 2% milk with skim. If you’re trying to get more calcium in your diet, think about eating oranges, edamame, or figs instead of dairy.
Replace fatty, greasy meat and fries with baked or grilled versions. For instance, instead of fried chicken, try baked or grilled chicken. Instead of fried potatoes, bake or grill them.
High sugar intake can lead to diabetes, which in turn increases your risk of heart disease.Reduce your sugar intake by limiting your consumption of pies, candy, sugary drinks, and sweet goods. Choose artificial sweeteners when available for coffee and tea.
Talk to your physician about dietary changes that could be beneficial to you.

, Red meat is especially high in carnitine, though it is present in other meats like fish and chicken as well. Eating another protein such as beans, tofu, or nuts at an appropriate level can provide you with all the protein you need.


Begin eliminating meat from your diet by going one day without meat. Many people now enjoy a “Meatless Monday.” If you find you have no trouble reducing your meat consumption by one day per week, move on to removing it from your meals two days per week. When you are comfortable, continue to reduce your meat intake until you are at or below the recommended daily allotment for your age and weight.
Processed meats — those which have undergone freezing, curing, grinding, or mixing, or those which include additives — are especially dangerous to heart health.Hot dogs, bacon, and salami are therefore best avoided to reduce heart disease.

, Being overweight can put you at increased risk for heart disease. In addition to eating a good diet, you should stay active and incorporate physical activity into your daily routine. Walk or ride your bike instead of driving. Take the stairs instead of elevator. Remember, every bit of exercise counts.


In addition to daily physical activity, make time to work out. Aim for about an hour of exercise each day.Alternate between vigorous workouts (like sprinting or pedaling your bike as fast as possible) and moderate-intensity workouts (such as lifting weights or jogging at a brisk pace).
Calculate your body mass index (BMI) in order to determine if you are overweight. Use the CDC’s BMI calculator (http://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/adult_bmi/english_bmi_calculator/bmi_calculator.html) to determine if you are within a healthy weight.

, Being overweight increases your risk of heart disease. Losing weight involves adjusting your diet and exercising, but you will need to stay on target to make your treatment last.


Be realistic when losing weight. adjusting your diet. Coupled with regular exercise, you should be able to lose one or two pounds each week.Ask your doctor what a healthy weight-loss plan for someone of your age, sex, height, and weight looks like.
Gain support from family and friends. Let them know that you are trying to reduce your risk of heart disease. We are less likely to veer from the course we have decided on when we share our goals with others.Avoid spending time with people who put you down or discourage you from treating your heart disease. If you know someone who thinks your heart disease is not a serious issue, or discourages you from changing your current unhealthy weight and eating habits, tell them that you value your health too much not to. For instance, if someone tells you, “You will have a hard time not eating potato chips,” you might reply that it might be hard, but no matter how hard it is, reducing your risk of heart disease is worth it.

, Getting enough sleep can reduce your risk of heart disease. While individual sleep requirements vary, you should always aim for about eight hours per night.


If you’re having trouble sleeping, try turning off the television and computer at least three hours before you go to bed. The light from these devices can interrupt your natural inclination to sleep at night.
Set a regular bedtime for yourself to make it easier to fall asleep each night. When your body gets used to the bedtime rhythm, you will more easily fall asleep at the bedtime you’ve selected.

, While stress is not known to be a direct risk factor or cause of heart disease, it has been linked to unhealthy coping mechanisms which are known to increase risk for heart disease like smoking, drinking, and consuming unhealthy foods. In order to avoid these activities, it is best to reduce the stress which could lead to unhealthy coping mechanisms.Learn to laugh.There is an old saying that “Laughter is the best medicine,” and when it comes to heart health, that’s certainly the case. Individuals who laugh often are 40% less likely to develop heart disease than people who laugh infrequently. Laughter reduces artery inflammation and increases your HDL (“good cholesterol”). Watch funny movies with a friend or learn some humorous jokes you can share with someone close to you.
Manage your time so that you are not rushed when trying to finish homework or projects at work. For instance, if you have an exam in five days, don’t wait until the night before to start cramming what you need to know. Study diligently for a few hours each day until the test day. Use a calendar to schedule time specifically intended for studying.
Try de-stressing techniques like yoga, meditation, deep breathing, and regular exercise. Make time for yourself by sitting in a quiet place reading or listening to pleasant music, even if you only have time to do so for 20 to 30 minutes each day.
Find ways to show gratitude and focus on positive experiences. Spend time with people you care about and who care about you. Let them know you appreciate their company and are thankful they are in your life. Don’t dwell on hurtful or false comments made by negative people.
Be generous with your time and energy. Give back to your community through volunteering at your local soup kitchen, homeless shelter, or food bank. Doing good feels good.

, If you are a smoker, you are twice as likely to have a heart disease as people who have never smoked.While quitting is never easy, staying healthy is worth it. Make use of nicotine patches or gum to ease your cigarette cravings.


Don’t replace smoking with another unhealthy habit like another drug or alcohol.
Choose when to quit smoking. You don’t have to quit cold-turkey. Make a timeline in order to plan how you quit. For example, you might plan on cutting down to half a pack each day for two weeks, then cut back to 1/4 pack each day for the next two weeks, and so on, reducing your intake by half every two weeks.
Avoid second-hand smoke as well. If you live with others who smoke, try to find alternate lodging. Avoid social situations in bars or restaurants where smoking occurs. Invite your friends to engage in activities where smoking is difficult or impossible such as going to the movies, or playing baseball.

, If you choose to continue drinking, do it in moderation. While a glass of wine each day could lower your risk of heart disease, it’s best to avoid drinking altogether if you do not drink currently.


If you’re in the habit of imbibing regularly at dinner or after work, try to substitute your alcohol with a healthy alternative like water or iced tea.

, Depression is an enduring state of feeling worried, pessimistic, guilty, sad, worthless, agitated, or suicidal. Seek medical care immediately if you have depressive thoughts. You should consult your general practitioner as well as a good therapist in order to work through your specific symptoms and develop a more hopeful, positive outlook. In addition, depression can be managed through prescription drugs which your psychiatrist might prescribe.Confide in a family member or trusted friend to talk about your depression. Let them offer support and share with them what you’re going through.
Develop a plan for coping with difficult situations.

See your doctor.,
Allow your potassium levels to rebound naturally.,
Add more dairy products to your diet.,
Eat more high-potassium fruits.,
Add more vegetables that are high in potassium.,
Add more meat that is rich in potassium.,
Eat seafoods that are a good source of potassium.,
Add high-potassium nuts and legumes.,
Use molasses in recipes.,
Learn which foods are low in potassium.",How to Treat Low Potassium Blood Levels2," If you suspect that you have low levels of potassium, then you should see your doctor before turning to supplements or other methods of boosting your potassium intake. When straying from a standard diet, you can easily overdo it and end up with too much potassium in your diet. Experts suggest 4,700 mg of potassium a day in a balanced diet.Your doctor will run the appropriate blood tests to determine your actual potassium levels, and he will prescribe the correct course of action for you based on those results.


In most cases your treatment will involve more potassium-rich foods in your diet.
Follow your doctor's recommendations closely to avoid introducing too much potassium into your diet.

, If you recently suffered from the common causes of low potassium, such as diarrhea, vomiting, or sweating due to an illness—or if you recently took a short-term prescription of antibiotics—your potassium levels will most often return to normal as soon as you’re well again. Your doctor will likely suggest adding some potassium-rich foods until you’re well again rather than taking a potassium supplement.

, Dairy products deliver some of the highest sources of potassium you can find in a single serving of food. One cup of yogurt, for instance, contains roughly 579 mg of potassium.One cup of nonfat milk can contain as much as 382 mg of potassium.Opt for nonfat options whenever possible since too much full-fat dairy dramatically increases your daily calorie intake.
Do not turn to dairy options if you are lactose intolerant. You can still find plenty of potassium from other sources.

, Select fruits are great sources of potassium. Make sure you choose a potassium-rich fruit, though, because not all fruits are created equal in this regard. Fruits high in potassium include:422 mg in a medium-size banana
390 mg in half of a papaya
378 mg in three average apricots
368 mg in one cup of cantaloupe
355 mg in 3/4 cup of orange juice
273 mg in 1/4 cup raisins
254 mg in one cup of strawberries

, Fruits aren’t the only potassium-rich options. You can also get plenty of potassium in several common vegetables. Some of the best varieties include:925 mg in a medium-size baked potato with the skin (610 mg without the skin)
694 mg in a large sweet potato
517 mg in 3/4 cup of carrot juice
448 mg in 1/2 cup of winter squash
419 mg in 1/2 cup of spinach
417 mg in 3/4 cup of tomato juice (or 300 mg in a large tomato)
312 mg in one stalk of celery
278 mg in 1/2 cup of broccoli
267 mg in 1/2 cup of beets

, Though not as much as some other options, you can still find a decent amount of potassium in several meat sources. The amount of potassium in a three-ounce serving of common meat options is:383 mg in chicken
290 mg in beef
259 mg in lamb
250 mg in dark meat turkey

, Fish is also a good source of potassium. For a three-ounce serving of fish, you can find:484 mg in canned salmon or tuna
An average of 375 mg in most other varieties of fish

, Many varieties of nuts and legumes are also good sources of potassium. Additionally, they’re often great sources of protein, fiber, and other minerals. High-potassium options include:400 mg in 1/2 cup of cooked pinto beans
365 mg in 1/2 cup of cooked lentils
340 mg in 1/2 cup of unsold nuts
241 mg in 1/4 cup of sunflower seeds
208 mg in two tbsp. of peanut butter

, Though not an ingredient people often use (and an unexpected source of nutrients), molasses contains 498 mg of potassium in one tbsp.Drizzled onto yogurt, oatmeal, of used in smoothies is a great way to easily add the potassium boost of molasses to some common food items., In addition to focusing on high-potassium foods, you should also know the common foods that are low in potassium. Some of these options are still very healthy, but if potassium is your focus, then they do not make good choices. Low-potassium foods include:0 mg in black olives (also very high source of sodium)
3 mg in one tbsp. of butter
20-30 mg in one ounce of cheese
45 mg in three ounces of bacon (also a very high source of sodium)
50 mg in 1/2 cup of blueberries
55 mg in one egg
69 mg in one slice of bread
72 mg in ten medium grapes
81 mg in 3/4 cup of pasta
90 mg in 1/2 cup of applesauce
100 mg in 1/4 cup of corn

Talk to your doctor about potassium replacement therapy.,
Get IV potassium replacement therapy.,
Take potassium in pill or liquid form.,
Follow up with your doctor.",How to Treat Low Potassium Blood Levels3," One of the biggest risks associated with low potassium is arrhythmia, or irregular heart beat. Older adults and those with preexisting heart disease are at higher risk for arrhythmia. If your doctor suspects you have severe low potassium, he may run tests to rule out other conditions, such as renal tubular acidosis, Cushing syndrome, and hypocalcemia, and confirm your diagnosis.Your doctor may run blood tests to check your electrolyte, glucose, magnesium, calcium, and phosphorous levels.
If you are taking heart medication already, such as a digitalis meant to strengthen your heart, your doctor will wan to check your digoxin levels.Your doctor may also order an EKG to detect any irregularities in your heartbeat., If your doctor confirms you have severely low potassium, arrhythmia, or severe symptoms your doctor will likely give you potassium intravenously.The potassium will be administered very slowly, under the observation of a doctor, to make sure it does not affect your heart.IV therapy may be very irritating at the site of injection.

, You will take most potassium supplements orally in the form of either pills, liquids, or powders.Many multivitamins also contain potassium. Ensure that you follow the dosage your doctor has prescribed without going over or under the dosage. This will ensure consistently healthy potassium blood levels.


Since it’s possible for your diet to have too much potassium, you should consult your doctor before adding supplements to your daily regimen. This will likely entail some blood tests to determine how much additional potassium you actually need in your diet.
Doctors commonly prescribe potassium supplements at the same time as another medication that can deplete potassium levels.If your doctor puts you on one of these medications, then she may suggest potassium supplements even if your current levels are within range.

, Your doctor will want to run follow-up tests, checking your potassium levels and checking that her prescribed treatment is working. The follow up will likely be two to three days following your initial treatment."

The ribs attach to the 12 thoracic vertebrae of the spine in the back and most converge and connect to the breastbone (sternum) in the front. A few ""floating"" ribs at the bottom protect the kidneys and don't connect to the breastbone. Your uppermost ribs are located at the base of your neck (underneath your collarbones), whereas the bottom one resides a few inches above your hip bones.Ribs are usually easily detected under the skin, particularly in thinner people.


The most commonly fractured ribs are the middle ones (ribs four through nine).They typically break at the point of impact or where the curve is the greatest, which is their weakest and most vulnerable area.
Rib fractures are much less common in kids because their ribs are more springy (more cartilage and less bone compared to an adult) and require considerable force to break.
A significant risk factor for rib fractures is osteoporosis, a condition common in people over 50 and characterized by brittle bones from loss of minerals.;
, With shirt removed, look and feel around the area of the torso where the pain is coming from. With a small hairline rib fracture, you won't see a deformity, but should be able to pinpoint the tenderness and maybe notice some swelling — particularly if there was blunt trauma to the area. With more serious rib fractures (multiple breaks in multiple ribs or ribs that have separated from the rest of the wall), a flail chest may occur. Flail chest is a term that describes when the broken chest wall moves in a way that is opposite to the rest of the chest during breathing. Therefore, the chest wall in the area of concern will be sucked in when the person takes a breath and the chest expands, and will be pushed out when the person exhales and the chest contracts.More serious rib fractures tend to be very painful, create more swelling (inflammation) and bruise quickly due to broken blood vessels.


A flail chest is sometimes easier to see when the injured person is lying on his back with his shirt off. The condition will be easily spotted while watching a patient breathe, and especially when listening to his lungs.
Healthy ribs are usually fairly springy when you put pressure on them. However, broken ribs feel unstable and can be be depressed with pressure, which generates severe pain.

, Another common sign of broken ribs, even small stress fractures, is increased tenderness or pain with deep breathing.The ribs move with every breath, so inhaling deeply causes pain. With serious rib fractures, even shallow breathing may be very difficult and extremely painful. Consequently, people with significant rib fractures tend to take more rapid and shallow breaths, which can lead to hyperventilation and eventual cyanosis (bluish discoloration of the skin due to lack of oxygen)., Another sign indicative of a rib fracture is reduced range of motion in the torso, especially rotational side-to-side movements.People with broken ribs are either unable or very hesitant to twist, bend or laterally flex their upper body. The broken rib and related muscle spasm may prevent the movements, or the pain may be severe enough to act as a deterrent to any movement. Again, less serious stress (hairline) fractures hamper movement to a lesser extent compared to more injurious fractures.


Ribs that break at the cartilage junction where they attach to the breastbone can be particularly painful, especially with rotational movements of the upper body.
Even with small stress fractures, the combination of reduced mobility, impaired ability to breathe and relative tenderness significantly limits a person's ability to exercise and be active — sports are virtually out of the question until the injury heals.

, If you or a significant other has experienced some form of trauma that has caused lingering pain somewhere in your torso, then seeing a doctor for a thorough physical examination and assessment is the best strategy. Even if the pain is relatively mild, seeing a healthcare professional is a good idea.

, It is essential to get immediate medical attention if you have complications that indicate something life threatening, such as a pneumothorax. Signs and symptoms of a punctured lung include severe breathing difficulty, sharp or stabbing chest pain (in addition to the pain related to the fracture) cyanosis, and extreme anxiety that goes along with the the sensation of breathlessness.A pneumothorax occurs when air becomes trapped between the chest wall and the lung tissue. This can be caused by a broken rib tearing into the lung tissue.
Other organs that can be punctured or lacerated by fractured ribs include the kidneys, spleen, liver and heart (rarely).If you have any of the above symptoms, go to the nearest emergency room or contact emergency services.

, Along with a physical assessment, x-rays can visualize bone and are effective for diagnosing the presence and severity of most rib fractures. However, stress or hairline fractures (sometimes referred to as ""cracked"" ribs) are difficult to visualize on x-rays due to their small size.As such, another series of chest x-rays may have to be taken after the swelling subsides (about a week or so).


Chest x-rays are also useful in diagnosing a collapsed lung because fluid and air can be visualized on x-ray film.
X-rays can also detect bruised bones, which can be mistaken for broken bones.
If the doctor has a good idea where the fracture is, a more focal x-ray of the injured rib can be taken to get a more magnified view.

, Hairline fractures of the rib are not serious injuries and typically just require short-term use of painkillers or anti-inflammatories while they heal on their own. CT scans can often uncover rib fractures that regular radiographs (x-rays) miss and injuries to organs and blood vessels are also easier to see.CT technology takes a variety of x-rays from numerous angles and combines them via computer technology to depict cross-sectional slices of your body.
CT scans are significantly more expensive than regular plain-film x-rays, so it's worth checking with your health insurance to see if they are covered.

, A bone scan involves injecting a small amount of radioactive material (radiotracer) into a vein, which then travels through the blood and into your bones and organs.As the radiotracer wears off, it gives off a little bit of radiation, which can be picked up by a special camera that slowly scans your body. Since fractures show brighter on a bone scan, it's a good tool to see even small stress or hairline fractures — even new breaks that are still inflamed.Bone scans are effective for visualizing small stress fractures, but because these are not clinically significant, the potential side effects related to the procedure may not be justified.
The main side effects are related to allergic reactions to the radioactive material (radiotracer) that's injected during a bone scan procedure.

Practice breathing techniques to lower your stress levels.,
Practice meditation to calm your nerves.,
Sign up for a yoga class.,
Exercise regularly.",How to Treat Tachycardia with Home Remedies2," Stress or emotional upset can trigger tachycardia.Because of this, it is important to try to lower your stress levels whenever you begin to feel anxious. One way to do this is by practicing breathing techniques. To do this:


Breathe in for four seconds through your nose. Hold your breath from a moment, and then release the breath through your mouth for another four seconds. Repeat this process five to ten times until you begin to feel calm.

, Another way to lower your stress levels is practice meditation. Meditation involves letting go of stress by releasing your thoughts. To meditate, find a quiet place to sit. Focus your thoughts on something soothing, such as the motion of waves rolling into and off of the sand.


The length of time you spend meditating is up to you based on your personal preferences. Perhaps sitting quietly will help to calm you down, while other people may need to meditate for an hour.

, Another way to fight stress is to engage both your body and mind by practicing yoga. Yoga can help to strengthen your body, while also acting as a form of meditation for your mind.


You can practice yoga at home, or you can sign up for a yoga class at your local gym or meditation center.

, Exercising often can help to improve blood circulation, which in turn can help to combat tachycardia. At the same time, exercising helps to release endorphins, which combat feelings of stress. Talk with your doctor about how often you should exercise, depending on your physical health.


Exercising regularly generally means exercising for 30 minutes, four to five times a week. Try jogging, bicycling, or swimming to get your blood flowing.

Visit the emergency room for treatment.,

Eat well and take supplements.",How to Treat Broken Ribs," If you've experienced trauma to your chest or torso that's causing significant pain, particularly during deep breathing, then you may have broken a rib or two. This can be associated with more severe injury as well, so it's important you get medical attention. Sometimes a ""crack"" is heard or felt when a rib breaks, but not always, especially if it occurs where the cartilaginous end-point of the rib attaches to the breast bone (sternum).


It's important to seek medical treatment after a significant rib injury because if a rib fractures into sharp pieces (as opposed to a hairline crack), then the risk of injury to your lungs, liver, spleen is much greater.The doctor will verify the type of rib fracture and make recommendations accordingly.
Chest x-rays, CT scans, MRI and diagnostic ultrasound are tools that your doctor may use to better understand your rib injury.
Your doctor will likely give you a prescription for strong painkillers or anti-inflammatories if your pain is severe, or recommend the use of over-the-counter varieties at home if your pain is tolerable.
A potentially fatal complication related to a badly broken rib is a punctured or collapsed lung (pneumothorax). A broken rib can also lead to pneumonia.;
, If the broken rib is stable, but causing you moderate-to-severe discomfort, your doctor may suggest an injection of steroidal medication, especially if torn cartilage is involved. A corticosteroid injection near the injury can quickly reduce inflammation and pain, allow for easier breathing and increase upper body mobility.Potential complications of corticosteroid injections include infection, bleeding, local muscle / tendon atrophy, nerve damage and weakened immunity.
Another type of injection your doctor may administer is an intercostal nerve block. The medication numbs the surrounding nerves and stops the sensation of pain for about six hours.The vast majority of people with broken ribs do not need surgery — they heal quite well on their own with conservative (non-invasive) care at home.

, In the past, doctors would routinely use compression wraps to help splint and immobilize the area around broken ribs, but this practice has fallen out of favor due to the increased risks of lung infection or pneumonia. Do not attempt to wrap or bandage your ribs., Apply an ice pack, frozen gel pack or bag of peas from the freezer onto your rib injury for about 20 minutes every hour you are awake for the first two days, then reduce it to 10 – 20 minutes three times daily as needed to reduce pain and swelling.Ice causes blood vessels to constrict, which reduces inflammation, and it helps to numb the surrounding nerves. Cold therapy is appropriate for all forms of broken ribs and essentially any musculoskeletal injury.


Wrap the ice pack in a thin cloth before applying to the injured area to reduce the risk of ice burn or frostbite.
In addition to sharp pain with breathing, you're likely to also have moderate tenderness and swelling over the fracture site and possibly some bruising to the surrounding skin, which signifies some damaged internal blood vessels., Over-the-counter non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen (Advil), naproxen (Aleve) or aspirin are short-term remedies to help combat the pain and inflammation related to your broken rib(s).NSAIDs don't stimulate healing or speed up the rate of recovery necessarily, but they can provide comfort and allow you to do basic activities of daily living or even return to work after a few weeks if your profession is mainly sedentary. Keep in mind that NSAIDs can be hard on your internal organs (stomach, kidneys), so try not to use them on a daily basis for more than two weeks. Follow the package directions for proper dosage.


Children younger than 18 years should never take aspirin because it’s associated with Reye’s syndrome.
As an alternative, you can take over-the-counter painkillers such as acetaminophen (Tylenol), but they don't impact inflammation and are harder on the liver.

, Some light exercise is a good idea for most musculoskeletal injuries because movement is needed to stimulate blood flow and healing. However, for the first few weeks, avoid cardio exercises that significantly increase your heart and breathing rates because that can irritate and inflame your broken rib. Furthermore, minimize the amount of rotation (twisting) and lateral flexion of your torso while your rib is healing.Walking, driving and computer work should be fine, but avoid most strenuous household chores, jogging, lifting weights and playing sports until you can take a deep breath with very little or no pain.


Take a week or two off work if you need to, especially if your job requires physical labor or lots of jarring movements.
Ask your family and friends for help around the house and yard while you recover. Avoid lifting, and check with your doctor whether or not you should drive.
You'll invariably need to cough or sneeze at some stage after you break your ribs, so consider holding a soft pillow against your chest to cushion the blow and minimize the pain.

, Broken ribs are particularly problematic in the night during sleep, especially if you sleep on your stomach, sides or roll around frequently. Probably the best sleeping position for your broken rib(s) is on your back (supine) because it puts the least amount of pressure on them. In fact, it may help to sleep more upright in a comfortable reclining chair for the first few nights until some of the inflammation and pain subside.You can also prop yourself up in bed with cushions behind your back and head.


If you need to sleep in more of an upright position for a few nights or more, then don't neglect your low back. Placing a pillow underneath your flexed knees will take pressure off your lumbar spine and help to prevent low back pain.
To prevent rolling onto your sides during the night, place a body pillow on either side of you for support.

, Broken bones need the necessary nutrients in appropriate amounts to heal properly, so eating a balanced diet rich in minerals and vitamins is a great strategy.Focus on consuming fresh produce, whole grains, lean meats, dairy products and lots of purified water. Supplementing your diet with extra nutrients may also be helpful to accelerate the healing of your broken rib, so consider adding some calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, vitamin D and vitamin K.


Rich mineral sources include cheese, yogurt, tofu, beans, broccoli, nuts and seeds, sardines, salmon.
On the flip side, avoid consuming things that may hinder bone healing, such as alcohol, soda pop, fast food and refined sugars. Smoking also slows the healing time of broken bones and other musculoskeletal injuries.

When you feel lightheaded, sit or lie down until it passes. You can also get into a squat position and then slowly go back to a standing position. This is often the easiest way to ease your symptoms.Stand up slowly from sitting, lying down, or crouching.;
, Dehydration is a common cause of low blood pressure.In general, men should drink around 13 cups of water and other fluids daily (about 3 liters), and women should aim for 9 cups (2.2 liters).Drink more if you sweat a lot, work out, or live in a hot climate.

Drink extra fluids if you have diarrhea, vomiting, or a high fever. If you’re really nauseated, try sucking on ice chips or popsicles.
If you’re dizzy, quickly drink 2 8-ounce glasses of cold water., When you exercise or go outside in hot climates, you can sweat enough to get dehydrated and lower your blood pressure.Other than hydrating well, keep yourself cool when exercising or outdoors in the heat. Try the following:

Wear light-colored, loose-fitting clothing
Take frequent rest breaks to drink water and cool down
Acclimate yourself to hot environments by starting slow and increasing your activities gradually

, Salt raises your blood pressure, so if you don’t have high blood pressure, you can increase the amount of salt that you eat to 6-10 grams daily.Only do this with your doctor’s help, because too much salt can raise your blood pressure too high.

The ideal blood pressure is 120/80.

, This is especially helpful if you tend to get dizzy after you eat.Refrain from eating large amounts of bread and pasta, and focus on eating lean meats and fresh fruits and vegetables. Eat several smaller meals throughout the day instead of large meals., Alcohol can increase your risk for orthostatic hypotension.If you currently drink multiple alcoholic beverages in a day, start to cut back your drinking. Consult a doctor for help or gradually limit your consumption on your own., Getting at least 30 minutes of aerobic exercise 5 days a week has many health benefits, including lowering your risk of having orthostatic hypotension.Aim to walk, run, swim, bike, play a sport, or do another physical activity on most days of the week.

Talk to your doctor before starting a new exercise regimen if you’re not used to being active or have any medical conditions.

, Compression stockings are tight, knee-high socks that limit how much blood can pool in your legs. It can be helpful to wear them if you’re on your feet a lot, or if you often sit for a long time. Your doctor can probably give you a prescription for compression stockings.Abdominal binders can be used to accomplish a similar goal., Exercise your calf muscles before you get out of bed or stand up – squeeze the muscles tight and release them several times to improve blood flow. If you have to stand for a long time and start to feel dizzy, cross your legs like scissors and squeeze your thighs together to push blood from your legs to your heart.Try to avoid bending at the waist. Squat down to pick items up, instead.
Avoid crossing your legs when you’re sitting down., This can help if you have chronic orthostatic hypotension. Raise the head of your bed by 10-20° or about 4 inches (10 cm)., If you’re stuck in bed for a while due to illness or injury, you’ll probably get weaker. This can cause orthostatic hypotension when you try to stand up.Prepare for this and have someone help you stand and walk for a while, or keep something sturdy near your bed to hold onto. Try sitting up in bed regularly if you’re not allowed or able to stand.Consider working with a physical therapist who can help you regain your strength.

Recognize a broken arm.,
Make the person as comfortable as possible on the way to the hospital.,
Have the doctor splint the arm.,
Allow the doctor to examine the arm.,
Ask the doctor what type of cast will be put on.,
Ask the doctor what the cast will be made of.,
Watch your doctor assemble the necessary materials.,
Allow the doctor to prepare your arm.,
Observe as your doctor applies the cast.,
Tell your doctor if the cast feels hot.,
Monitor the arm for complications.,
Keep the cast dry.,
Do not put anything into the cast.,
Do not pull on the soft lining or break off pieces of the cast.",How to Apply a Cast to a Broken Arm," Broken arms will usually be very easy to identify. If you think you or your child has a broken arm, go immediately to the emergency room so it can be treated. Symptoms include:Extreme pain
Swelling
Bruising
Dizziness or lightheadedness right after the break occurs
The arm is bent in a way that it shouldn’t be
The person is unable to move his wrist or fingers
A snapping or grinding noise when the injury occurred
Bleeding and pieces of bone sticking out through the skin;
, Remember that if the break is complex, it may be necessary for the person to get anesthesia while the doctor moves the pieces of bone back into place. Do not give the person anything to eat or drink.Use an ice pack to reduce the person’s pain and swelling. Wrap a bag of ice or package of frozen peas in a towel. After 20 minutes, give the skin a chance to warm up.
You can use a large towel to help the person support the arm in a sling or prop up the arm. Do not move the arm, that could cause more damage.

, The splint will be put on the arm to immobilize it while the doctor examines it. The splint is hard on one or two sides, but open on the other in case the arm continues to swell. The splint will have several layers:Soft cloth to protect the skin against irritation
Soft padding
Plaster or fiberglass to prevent movement
An elastic bandage to hold the pieces of the splint in place

, The doctor will want to look at the arm, feel the arm, and will probably order X-rays. X-rays will create an image of the bones in the arm and help the doctor determine whether they need to be realigned so that they will heal in the correct position.For minor fractures where the bones remain correctly aligned, no additional procedures may be needed before putting a cast on the arm.
If the bones are not aligned, the doctor will give the person anesthesia to either numb the area or put her to sleep. Then the doctor will try to move the bones back into place.
If this is not possible, the doctor may need to do surgery. This is more likely to be necessary when a joint has been broken. Surgery may also be necessary if wires, plates, screws, or pins are needed to hold the pieces of bone in place.

, Depending upon which bone is broken, the cast may be either short or long.A short arm cast is usually used if a wrist bone is broken. This cast would extend from the knuckles to below the elbow. (Sometimes a long cast will be used to prevent the person from twisting his wrist and putting it out of alignment.)
A long arm cast is put on if the forearm or elbow is broken. The cast would go from the knuckles to the upper arm.
Fractures of the humerus (upper arm) are treated either with a sling or a brace, but not a cast.

, A cast is a hard bandage that protects the bone as it heals. The hard, outer shell is lined within with soft padding that will make it more comfortable. There are two types of materials that casts are sometimes made of:Plaster. Plaster is a white powder that is mixed with water and then allowed to harden into the outer shell of the cast. Plaster is easier to work with because it sets more slowly. This gives the doctor more time to work. It also means it gives off less heat, making burns less likely.Fiberglass. Fiberglass is a type of plastic. It is lasts longer, is lighter, and is better for X-rays than plaster.

, This may include:Tape
Scissors
A basin of water. The water temperature affects how quickly the casting material will set. It will set faster with warmer water. In general for plaster casts, the water should be lukewarm. For fiberglass the water should be room temperature or cooler.
Casting gloves, if your doctor will use fiberglass
Padding
Plaster or fiberglass casting material
Sheets or pads to cover you and keep your clothing clean
A stockinette

, The doctor will put on the padding which will go on the inside of the cast.The doctor will first position your arm so that the bones will heal correctly.
You will first have a stockinette put on your arm. It will likely be about 4 inches longer above and below the injured area that the doctor will put the cast on. The stockinette will likely be 2 or 3 inches wide. The doctor will smooth it to prevent it from wrinkling. The doctor may not use a stockinette if the arm is expected to swell a lot.
The doctor will wrap your arm in padding. Each layer will overlap the previous by about 50%, producing a double layer over your arm when the doctor is done. The doctor may add more layers, particularly over the fingers or other bony areas. The padding used on your hands will likely be about 2 inches wide, while the padding used on your arm may be up to 4 inches wide. The padding should be an inch and a half longer at either end than the area that the cast will cover. It should not restrict blood flow.

, The doctor will wrap the casting material around the arm. Each new layer will overlap the previous by about 50%, creating a double layer without holes. Right before adding the final layer, the doctor will fold back the ends of the stockinette and padding, and add the final layer over them. As the casting materials set, the doctor will adjust their shape by molding them. It is important that the tension be correct:If the cast is too tight it may restrict the blood flow or irritate the skin.
If the cast is too loose or has too much padding it may move on the arm, rub, and cause scratches and blisters.

, The cast gives off heat when it sets and this can be uncomfortable if too much heat is produced. Two factors affect the amount of heat produced. The amount of heat is:Inversely proportional to the setting time. This means that casts that set more slowly produce less heat at any one moment.
Directly proportional to the number of layers used. This means the more casting material used, the greater the amount of heat that will be produced.

, How long the cast will have to stay on will depend on how long it takes to heal. Children heal faster than adults do, but chances are that the cast will have to stay in place for several weeks. If you notice any of the following signs of complications, go to the emergency room to have the cast removed:Increasing pain
Tingling
Numbness
Extreme swelling
White, blue, purple, or dusky colored fingers
Decreased blood flow
Loss of movement that was previously present in the fingers
Blistering or red skin under the cast
Fluid draining from the cast
A bad odor coming from the arm
A fever

, Unless the doctor tells you that your cast is waterproof, you should keep it dry. If the cast gets wet, it can weaken or warp. This will make it less effective at protecting and stabilizing the bones. You can be sure to keep it dry by:Covering it in a plastic bag when bathing
Wearing a raincoat or using an umbrella when you are outside in the rain.

, As the arm heals, it may itch. However, you should avoid doing anything that may damage the cast or injure your arm. This means that you should not:Insert anything like a pen inside the cast to scratch. This may damage the inside of the cast or, if you cut yourself, cause the skin to become infected.
Put anti-itch medicines inside the cast. This includes baby powder, lotions, creams, or anti-itch oils.

, If the cast gets damaged or broken, call the doctor to get a new one put on.


As the arm heals, a child may stop being as careful with the arm that is in the cast. Inspect the cast regularly to make sure that it has no cracks or tears in it.
If you have a cast that you can write on, ask family and friends to sign it with encouraging messages.

See a doctor as soon as you can.,
Get an arm sling or support.,
Take pain pills short-term.",How to Heal from a Broken Collar Bone1," If you experience significant trauma from a fall or car accident and feel severe pain — especially in conjunction with a cracking sound — then head to the nearest hospital or walk-in clinic for medical assessment. A broken collarbone causes intense pain near the shoulder and top part of the chest, and disables most upper arm movements, especially those involving arm raising and reaching. Other signs and symptoms include bruising, swelling, and/or bulging over the fracture site, a grinding noise and pain with arm movements and sometimes numbness and/or tingling in the hand.X-rays, bone scans and MRI are tools that physicians use to help diagnose the location and severity of fractures — small hairline fractures of the collarbone may not show up on x-ray until the inflammation calms down (up to a week or so).
If your broken collarbone is considered complicated — there are many fragments, the overlaying skin is penetrated and/or the pieces are grossly misaligned — then surgery will be needed. Only five to 10% of clavicle fractures require surgery.Collarbones usually break directly in the middle, and much less commonly where they attach at the breast bone or shoulder blades.;
, Broken collarbones are not casted because of their anatomical position — it's impossible to immobilize the bone or general area with a plaster cast. Instead, a simple arm sling or ""figure-of-eight"" wrap or splint is usually used for support and comfort immediately after a collarbone break.A figure-of-eight splint wraps around both shoulders and the base of the neck to help support the injured side and keep it positioned up and back. Sometimes a larger swath is wrapped around the sling to hold it closer to the torso. You'll need to wear the sling or support at all times until there is no further pain with movement — usually takes two to four weeks for kids and four to eight weeks for adults.You'll receive an arm sling or support if you go to the hospital or emergency walk-in clinic, although they're also available at most pharmacies and medical supply stores.
Slings come in all sizes, including ones appropriate for small children, as the collarbone is the most commonly broken bone in kids — usually the result of falling onto an outstretched arm., Your doctor will likely recommend non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen, naproxen or aspirin as a short-term solution to help you deal with the pain and inflammation related to your broken collarbone.Alternatively, you may be given painkillers, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol), or prescribed opioids (like Vicodin). Keep in mind that these medications can be hard on your stomach, kidneys and liver, so it's best not to use them continuously for much more than a couple of weeks. Opioids can be addictive, so use them exactly as your doctor prescribes.


Kids younger than 18 years should never take or be given aspirin, as it’s associated with life-threatening Reye’s syndrome.
For more serious fractures that generate severe pain, your doctor may give you a prescription for more powerful drugs while at the hospital, such as morphine-like opiates, but be aware that they can be habit forming and lead to addiction if abused.

Stop the activity causing the fracture.,
Slow down.,
Use elevation.,
Use ice.,
Take over-the-counter pain medications.,
Increase activity slowly.,
Stretch and strengthen your muscles.,
Try orthotics.",How to Ease Pain Caused by a Stress Fracture1," If you haven't already, you need to stop doing the activity that caused the stress fracture in the first place. You should have some idea of what caused it, as it probably started hurting while you were doing it.Stress fractures are caused by doing the same thing over and over again. That's why you need to not do that particular activity at the moment.For instance, you may need to stop running for a little while to help your leg heal.;
, You need to rest whatever bone you fractured. That means taking a break from all regular activities for that limb, not just the activity that caused the fracture.Your doctor will tell you when you can put weight on your leg again, if the fracture is in your foot or leg., Elevation means putting the injured area above your heart. At the very least, it should be off the ground if it is your leg or foot. Elevation helps cut down on pain and swelling.Try propping the limb up with a pillow.

, If you're not in a cast, which is likely, you may need to ice the injured area for the first day or two. You can apply ice up to four times a day, but make sure you don't apply it to bare skin. Always have a towel or cloth between your skin and the ice pack. With your doctor's permission, you can take off your boot to apply ice to the area, if you have one.Don't apply ice for more than 20 minutes at a time.

, You can take acetaminophen (Tylenol) or NSAIDs such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) or naproxen (Aleve) for pain. The choice is up to you, though they both have advantages and disadvantages.NSAIDs are anti-inflammatory, meaning they can help reduce swelling, which can help with an injury like a fracture.On the other hand, other studies have shown that NSAIDs may not be as good when you're trying to heal a bone due to their blood thinning properties, so it may be better to take acetaminophen.The American Association of Family Physiciansrecommends acetaminophen.
Do not give aspirin to children. If you have heart disease, high blood pressure, kidney disease, or have had stomach ulcers or bleeding, talk with your doctor before using these medicines., Once you start being active again, go slowly. It's important to not start the activity that caused the fracture again right off the bat because you can re-injure yourself, causing more pain.At first, it's best to choose activities that do not put weight on your injury, such as swimming or water walking., Your muscles support your bone, so they need to be strong enough to provide that support.As you heal, you need to perform stretches to lengthen the area. If you're unsure how to begin, consult with a physical therapist to learn which exercises to start with. It's best to begin slowly. Also, focus on strength training exercises, such as weightlifting, to strengthen muscles in that area. Again, it's important to begin slowly, starting with smaller weights and working your way up.In addition to strength training, stretching and aerobic exercise can help muscles re-adjust to a stressful activity.

, Certain orthotics can help reduce the stress on your foot. For instance, you can try inserts for your shoes, the kind designed to take some of the shock off your foot as you step."

Visit your doctor.,
Get a blood test done.,
Keep a diary of your symptoms.,
Recognize hypotension during pregnancy.,
See a cardiologist to check your heart health.",How to Treat Orthostatic Hypotension2," It’s normal to occasionally feel dizzy when you stand up, but if it occurs frequently or lasts longer than a few seconds, see your doctor.They will do a physical exam and take a medical history, check your blood pressure, and possibly do some lab tests or an ECG to try to figure out a cause.See your doctor right away if you become so dizzy upon standing that you pass out.

, Often, your regular doctor can figure out what is causing your orthostatic hypotension with a blood test. They can check your blood sample to see if there’s a problem with your thyroid, adrenal gland, or nervous system, and to see if you’re anemic., If you notice that you have symptoms of hypotension – dizziness, lightheadedness, nausea, confusion, blurry vision, weakness, or passing out – start to keep a journal. Record what symptoms you experience and how long they last. Note what you were doing right beforehand and earlier that day, such as exercising or being in the sun. Take this record with you to your doctor’s office.Some people get low pressure after they eat. Take note if your symptoms occur after a meal.

, It’s normal to experience low blood pressure when you’re pregnant because of the changes your body goes through to accommodate for the baby. Usually, your blood pressure will return to normal after you give birth.Talk to your doctor about it if your symptoms last longer than a few seconds or make you so dizzy you feel like you might faint or fall., Sometimes, postural hypotension can be a sign that something is wrong with how your heart is working. Valve problems, slow heart rate, heart failure, and a history of heart attack can all limit how well your heart works and cause low blood pressure when you stand up.Ask your doctor for a referral to a heart specialist, or cardiologist.

Cardiologists can do special tests to check your heart valves and see how well your heart pumps blood.

Stop taking medications that cause low blood pressure.,
Get a prescription for fludrocortisone (Florinef).,
Try midodrine (ProAmatine).,
Discuss other medication options with your doctor.,
Control your blood sugar.",How to Treat Orthostatic Hypotension3," Some medications can cause postural hypotension. Take a list of your medications to your doctor including any herbal supplements or beverages and ask whether stopping or switching your medicine might help with your symptoms.Never stop taking your medicine without your doctor’s supervision.

Common medications that cause hypotension are those that treat high blood pressure and heart problems (diuretics, alpha-blockers, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, and nitrates). Sometimes lowering the dose you take can ease symptoms.
Other medications that can cause hypotension as a side effect are some antidepressants and antipsychotics, drugs for Parkinson’s disease, muscle relaxants, narcotics, and medicines for erectile dysfunction.

, The medication fludrocortisone raises your blood pressure by increasing how much fluid there is in your blood. For severe, persistent symptoms, this medication can be helpful.See your doctor to discuss this medication, and get a prescription for it.

Medications are only prescribed for chronic, i.e. persistent rather than occasional, orthostatic hypotension., This medication also increases your blood pressure, making it far less likely you’ll experience orthostatic hypotension.Remember that all medications may have side effects.

Midodrine may cause you to have high blood pressure when you lie down. Discuss this risk with your healthcare provider., If a specific disease is causing your postural hypotension, then taking the right medication may help. You doctor can prescribe one of these with other medications to treat the underlying cause:Droxidopa (Northera) is used when Parkinson’s disease causes your orthostatic hypotension.
Epoetin (Epogen, Procrit) can help if the problem is due to chronic anemia.
Pyridostigmine (Regonol, Mestinon) can be helpful for those with neurological problems, and unlike midodrine it doesn’t cause hypertension when you lie down.Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) can be used, as well, but not if you have kidney problems., Low blood sugar and diabetes can cause hypotension.If you’re diabetic, work with your doctor, endocrinologist, or diabetes nurse to keep your blood sugar in a safe range. Low blood sugar can be just as dangerous as high blood sugar, if not more so.

If you’re not diagnosed as diabetic but you often have postural hypotension, discuss your symptoms with your doctor and have your blood sugar and A1C checked.

Move the patient to a safe location and check for other injuries.,
Remove the shoes and socks of both feet and check for common symptoms of a broken foot.,
Control any bleeding.,
Call for an ambulance if the patient is in extreme pain, or if the foot exhibits any major symptoms.,
Splint the injured foot if it is not possible to get an ambulance.,
Ice the injury and continue to elevate the foot to reduce swelling.",How to Treat a Broken Foot1," If the patient has also suffered a head, neck, or back injury, move him as little as possible and be extremely careful when doing so. Both the safety of the patient and the rescuer are more important than the immediate diagnosis and treatment of the foot injury.;
, Compare both feet side by side to check for swelling or any other differences in appearance. The most common symptoms are immediate pain, swelling, and deformity. Other symptoms include:Bruising or tenderness of the foot.
Numbness, coldness, or bruising.
Large wounds or exposed bones.
Increased pain when active, and decreased pain with rest.
Difficulty walking or bearing weight.

, Apply pressure to the wound, using gauze if possible. If the gauze pad or cloth becomes soaked with blood, do not remove it. Add another layer and continue applying pressure. , Some major symptoms are misshapenness, deformity, large cuts or wounds, and severe discoloration of the foot.While the ambulance is on its way, encourage the patient to keep still and stay calm. Keep the patient lying down, with the injured foot elevated higher than the heart., Immobilize the foot by placing a stick or rolled up newspaper along the inside of the foot from the heel to the big toe and pad it with a cloth. Wrap a belt or another piece of cloth around the splinted foot to secure the splint. If no splint is available, wrap a rolled-up towel or pillow around the foot and tape or tie it on with a bandage. Remember the ultimate goal is to limit motion. Tie the splint or wrap reasonably tightly, but not so tight that circulation is restricted., Put a towel or a sheet between the skin and the ice. Leave the ice on for 15 minutes and then remove it for 15 minutes. The patient should not walk on the injured foot if putting weight on it is painful.If you have crutches around, use them.

Rest your injured collarbone and apply ice.,
Lightly move your arm once the pain fades.,
Eat particularly well during your recovery stage.,
Consider taking supplements while recovering.",How to Heal from a Broken Collar Bone2," Once you're discharged from the hospital or clinic, you'll be told to rest your arm and apply ice to the injury while the arm sling or splint is on in order to help decrease the swelling and numb the pain. On the first day following your fracture, apply the ice or cold therapy for 20 minutes of every hour while you're awake.For the following two to four days, ice the inflamed and painful area every three to four hours for 20 minutes at a time. With applying cold therapy and taking NSAIDs, the inflammation should be gone after a week.


Depending on your job and if you injured your dominant arm, you may have to take a few weeks off work to recuperate. In general, healing takes four to six weeks in younger people and as long as 12 weeks in the elderly.Young athletes are often able to resume playing their sport within eight weeks of breaking their collarbones, but it depends on the severity of the break, type of sport and many other factors. Check with your physician when it is safe to resume full activity, including sports
If you don't have any ice handy, then you can use frozen gel packs or bags of vegetables from your freezer — corn or peas works bet. Never apply cold therapy directly to your skin, as it may cause ice burn or frostbite — wrap it in a thin towel first.

, After a few weeks when the inflammation appears gone and the pain has mostly faded away, remove your sling for short periods of time and lightly mobilize your arm and shoulder. Don't aggravate it so that it starts to throb again, but gently reintroduce a variety of movements to the involved joints, ligaments, tendons and muscles. Build up slowly, maybe starting with holding a coffee cup and progressing to a 5-pound weight, and start wearing your sling less.Your collarbone needs to move a little bit during the early stages of the injury to stimulate bone healing.


Lack of activity and complete immobilization of your shoulder/arm, in proportion with the time spent healing, will induce loss of bone mineral, which is counterproductive for fractured bone trying to regain its strength.Some movement and weight bearing seems to attract more minerals to the bones, which makes them stronger and less likely to break in the future.
There are three stages to bone healing: reactive stage (a blood clot forms between the two ends of the fracture), repair stage (specialized cells begin to form a callus, which spans the fracture), and remodeling phase (bone is created and the injury is slowly resculpted into its original shape)., Your bones, like any other tissue in your body, need all the essential nutrients in order to heal properly and quickly. Eating a balanced diet that includes ample minerals and vitamins is proven to help heal broken collarbones and other bones.As such, focus on eating fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, leans meats and drinking plenty of purified water and milk in order to give your body the building blocks it needs to repair your collarbone.


On the other hand, avoid consuming stuff that may impair your healing, such as alcohol, soda pop, fast food and foods made with lots of refined sugars.
Minerals and protein are important for strong and healthy bones. Excellent food sources include: dairy products, tofu, beans, broccoli, nuts and seeds, sardines and salmon.

, Although it's always a good idea to get essential nutrients from a well-balanced diet, supplementing with key bone-healing minerals and vitamins will ensure you meet your higher requirements without increasing your caloric intake. Eating more calories combined with less physical activity often triggers weight gain, which is not a desirable outcome after your collarbone or any injury heals. Remember to buy quality supplements with minimal or no binders and fillers in them, as you body absorbs them better.


Calcium, phosphorus and magnesium are the primary minerals found in bones, so find a supplement that contains all three. Adults need between 1,000 - 1,200 mg of calcium each day (depending on their age and gender), but you may require more for your healing collarbone — ask your doctor or nutritionist.Important trace minerals to consider include: zinc, iron, boron, copper and silicon. A good multi-mineral supplement should include all of these.
Important vitamins that aid in bone healing include: vitamins C, D and K. Vitamin C is needed to make collagen. Vitamin D is crucial for mineral absorption in the intestines, and as a bonus, your skin makes it in response to intense sunshine. Vitamin K binds calcium to bones and stimulates collagen formation.

Get a referral to a physiotherapist.,
Make an appointment with a chiropractor or osteopath.,
Consider trying acupuncture.",How to Heal from a Broken Collar Bone3," Once your remove your arm sling or splint for good, you may notice that the muscles surrounding your shoulder and upper chest look a little smaller and/or feel weaker. If that's the case, then you need to consider some form of physical rehabilitation. Rehabilitation can begin once you are pain free and can perform virtually all arm/shoulder movements. A physical therapist can show you specific rehabilitation exercises to restore muscle strength, joint motion and flexibilityPhysical therapy is typically needed two to three times per week for at least four weeks to significantly strengthen an area that's suffered a fracture.
A physiotherapist can also stimulate and strengthen your weaker shoulder and chest muscles with electrotherapy, such as electronic muscle stimulation.
Most people return to all their regular activities within three months of an uncomplicated collarbone fracture, although age and previous health status are important factors., Chiropractors and osteopaths are doctors who specialize in musculoskeletal injuries and focus on establishing normal motion and function within joints, bones and muscles.After your collarbone and shoulder area heals, the associated joints may be stiff or slightly malpositioned. A chiropractor or osteopath can use manual joint manipulation, also called an adjustment, to reposition joints that are misaligned due to the trauma that broke your collarbone. Healthy free-moving joints allow bones and muscles to function properly, and reduces the risk of degenerative arthritis (osteoarthritis) from developing in the future.


You can often hear a ""popping"" sound with a joint adjustment, which is not at all related to the ""cracking"" sound associated with broken bones.
Although a single manual adjustment can sometimes restore a joint to full mobility and eliminate stiffness, more than likely it will take three to five treatments to notice significant results.

, Acupuncture is the ancient Chinese practice of inserting thin needles into specific energy points within the skin to reduce pain and inflammation — helpful initially for a broken collarbone — and to potentially stimulate healing.Acupuncture is not typically recommended for healing broken bones and should only be considered secondarily, but anecdotal reports suggest it can stimulate healing for fractures and other types of injuries. Acupuncture has a very good safety record and worth a try if your budget allows for it.


Acupuncture reduces pain and inflammation by releasing a variety of compounds in the body, particularly endorphins and serotonin.
Acupuncture stimulates the flow of energy, which is often referred to as chi by practitioners of the art, which may be the key to stimulating healing in bones and other tissues.
Acupuncture is practiced by many types of health professionals including some physicians, chiropractors, naturopaths, physical therapists and massage therapists — whoever you choose should be certified by NCCAOM.

Talk about crutches.,
Ask about a prescription.",How to Ease Pain Caused by a Stress Fracture2," If you suspect you have a stress fracture, visiting a doctor is a must for helping ease the pain. The doctor can assess whether you have a fracture or a sprain and help you better understand how to treat it.In some cases, surgery may be necessary.

, If you have a history of stress fractures, the doctor may diagnose your condition without imaging tests. However, if you are coming in for the first time for this kind of injury, your doctor will want to run imaging tests to see if it is actually broken.One type of imaging test you may have done is an X-ray, where your doctor uses radiation to produce an image of your bones. However, this type of test won't always show stress fractures right away.Your doctor may move on to a bone scan or MRI. With a bone scan, she will first inject a substance known as a tracer into your blood. This substance is radioactive and helps the doctor see the fracture when the bone is scanned.However, sometimes other injuries appear the same as a fracture with this type of scan.With an MRI, magnets are used to produce an image of your bone. You won't be exposed to any kind of radiation with this scan, and it generally produces a good image of the injury., Sometimes, you can get away without wearing a cast, splint, or walking boot with a stress fracture. Nonetheless, having support on the fractured bone can help ease the pain.Sometimes, in place of a walking cast, your doctor may have you were a stiff-soled shoe or sandal.On your shoulder, you might wear a sling.

, You may need crutches, as they take the weight off your foot completely. Not putting weight on your foot can reduce the pain. Your doctor will be able to tell you whether they are a good solution for you., If your pain is severe, your doctor may write you a prescription for pain medication. However, she may ask you to rely on over-the-counter medications."

Get medical help immediately.,
Prepare for surgery in severe cases.,

Get a referral to physical therapy.,
Rest your shoulder.,
Apply ice to your fractured clavicle.,
Take over-the-counter (OTC) medication.,
Lightly exercise after the pain fades.,
Eat nutritiously during your recovery.",How to Treat a Clavicle Fracture," If you fall on an outstretched arm, get into a car accident or are hit while playing a sport and feel intense pain in your shoulder area, then get medical care immediately. Fractured clavicles cause significant pain in the front part of your shoulder, closer to the base of your neck. You'll innately know that something is seriously wrong because you won't be able to lift your arm up. Other symptoms include immediate swelling and/or bruising near the fracture, grinding sounds with arm movements and potential numbness and tingling in the arm/hand.Your doctor will likely have to give you strong prescription pain medication to cope with the injury.


Your doctor will take an x-ray of your shoulder to help diagnose the injury. Other diagnostic tool used can include a bone scan, MRI or CT scan.
Most often the break is diagnosed as a stress or hairline fracture, which is a small surface crack not serious enough to misalign bone or break the skin's surface.
Small hairline fractures of the clavicle don't often show up on x-ray right away. It sometimes takes a week or so until the swelling goes down enough to see the crack clearly.;
, Although most fractures of the clavicle are hairline fractures, in some cases the break is serious enough to require surgery — about 5–10% of cases.An operation is definitely needed if your broken clavicle is diagnosed as complicated, which means there are multiple bone fragments, the overlaying skin is penetrated, and/or the pieces are badly misaligned. Surgery involves realigning the bone fragments and keeping them in place with special metal plates, pins and/or screws.The clavicle usually breaks in the middle, as opposed to the ends which attach to the breastbone (sternum) and shoulder blade.Because there's rarely any fat over the clavicle, you'll likely be able to see and feel the hardware through your skin.
Plates and screws are not typically removed from the bone once it's healed, unless they cause significant discomfort. Often the broken clavicle is stronger after an operation, compared to the uninjured side.

, Due to their anatomical position, fractured clavicles can't be casted like a broken limb can. Instead, a supportive arm sling or ""figure-eight"" splint is typically used for support and comfort, either immediately after the injury if it's just a hairline fracture or following surgery if it's a complicated fracture.A figure-eight splint wraps around both shoulders and the base of your neck in order to support the injured shoulder and keep it positioned up and back. Sometimes a larger swath of material is wrapped around the sling to keep it closer to your body.


You'll need to wear the sling constantly until there is no pain with arm movements, which takes between two to four weeks for children or four to eight weeks for adults.You'll get an arm sling from the hospital or emergency walk-in clinic if you go, although they're also available at many pharmacies and medical supply stores.
Slings come in all sizes, including ones that fit small children, because the clavicle is the most commonly fractured bone in kids — often the result of falling onto an outstretched arm., Once you've recovered and able to remove your arm sling splint for good, you'll likely notice that the muscles surrounding your shoulder and upper chest look smaller and feel weaker. That's because muscle tissue atrophies without movement. If this occurs, then you'll need to get a referral for some physical rehabilitation. Rehab can start once you are cleared by your orthopedist, are pain-free, and can perform all the basic arm and shoulder movements. A physiotherapist or athletic trainer can show you specific rehabilitation exercises and stretches to restore your muscle strength, joint movements and flexibilityGetting properly rehabilitated reduces the risk of degenerative arthritis (osteoarthritis) developing in your shoulder in the future.
Physical therapy is recommended two to three times per week for at least two to four weeks to significantly strengthen and rehabilitate the shoulder area after a clavicle fracture.
Most people return to their normal daily routine within three months of an uncomplicated fracture of the clavicle, although age, health and fitness levels are important factors., Once you're discharged from the hospital in an arm sling, your top priority is to rest your shoulder and not further inflame the injury. Of course the arm sling not only provides support, but it also restricts movement, which is why you should keep it on even during sleep. Avoiding the temptation to move your shoulder and arm will help the bone mend quicker and the pain fade away sooner.


Depending on what you do for a living and if the injury is to your dominant side, you may need to take a couple weeks off work to recuperate.
Healing takes between four to six weeks in younger people and up to 12 weeks in the elderly, but it depends on the severity of the fractured clavicle.Athletes in good health are typically able to resume their sporting activities within two months of breaking their clavicle, depending on severity of the break and the specific sport.
Sleeping on your back (with the sling on) is necessary to keep the pressure off your shoulder and prevent stressing the clavicle injury.

, After you get home from the hospital (regardless if you had surgery or not), you should apply a bag of crushed ice (or something cold) to your injured clavicle in order to reduce the swelling and numb the pain.Ice therapy is effective for acute (recent) injuries that involve swelling because it reduces blood flow by constricting local blood vessels. Apply the crushed ice to your clavicle for 15 minutes three to five times daily until the soreness and inflammation eventually fades away.


Lightly compressing the crushed ice against your injury with a stretchy Tensor or Ace bandage is also helpful for combating inflammation.
Always wrap ice in a thin cloth before you apply it to your body — it helps to prevent skin irritation and frostbite.
If you don't have crushed ice available, then use ice cubes, frozen gel packs or a bag of frozen veggies (peas or corn are convenient).

, In addition to applying ice regularly, you should also consider taking some OTC medication for a short period of time. Anti-inflammatories such as ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil) or naproxen (Aleve) are likely the best choice of drugs for acute injuries that involve significant inflammation, such as bone fractures.Painkillers (also called analgesics) are an option also, but they won't impact the swelling associated with your recovering clavicle. The most common OTC painkiller is acetaminophen (Tylenol, Paracetamol).


Anti-inflammatories and analgesics should always be considered short-term strategies for pain control and should be taken no longer than two weeks for a broken clavicle. Taking too many of them at a time or taking them for too long increases your risk of stomach, kidney and liver problems.
Children should never take or be given aspirin to control pain and inflammation, as it’s associated with life-threatening Reye’s syndrome.
Rub an ointment containing a natural pain reliever over your recovering clavicle. Menthol, camphor, arnica and capsaicin are all helpful for relieving muscle, bone and joint pains.

, After a couple of weeks when the swelling has subsided and the pain has faded away, remove your arm sling for short periods and carefully move your arm and shoulder in all different directions. Don't aggravate the clavicle so that it hurts, but gently reintroduce movements to the involved joints and muscles. Start cautiously, maybe starting with light calisthenics and then progress to holding light weights (five-pound weights to start).Your clavicle needs to move a little bit during the later phases of the injury to stimulate complete recovery.


Complete lack of activity and total immobilization of your arm for many weeks could trigger loss of bone mineral, which is counterproductive for an injured bone trying to get stronger.Some movement and weight bearing attracts minerals to bones, which strengthens them and makes them less likely to fracture again.
After your shoulder/clavicle is pain-free and relatively mobile, make an appointment with the physiotherapist for some rehabilitation (see above).

, All bones and tissues in the body need certain nutrients in order to heal properly and in a timely manner. Eating a nutritious and balanced diet that includes lots of minerals and vitamins is proven to help heal broken bones of all types, including clavicles.Therefore, focus on eating lots of fresh produce (fruits and veggies), whole grains, lean meats and fish to give your body the building blocks needed to properly repair your clavicle. In addition, drink plenty of purified water, milk and other dairy-based beverages to augment what you eat.


Broken bones need ample minerals (calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, boron) and protein to become strong and healthy again.
Excellent sources of minerals/protein include dairy products, tofu, beans, broccoli, nuts and seeds, sardines and salmon.
Important vitamins that are needed for bone healing include: vitamin C (needed to make collagen), vitamin D (crucial for mineral absorption), and vitamin K (binds calcium to bones and triggers collagen formation).
Conversely, don't consume food or drink that is known to impair bone/tissue healing, such as alcoholic beverages, sodas, most fast food items and foods made with lots of refined sugars and preservatives.

Your doctor will be able to confirm the fracture, where it is, and how best to treat it. Before you go to your appointment, take note of the following:Any pain in an area that increases with activity.
Where the pain is located.
How intense the pain is.
If rest makes the pain in that area subside.;
, Your doctor will have some questions to ask you in order to learn more about your possible fracture. Knowing what to expect can help you answer as clearly as you can, which will allow your doctor to best treat your fracture.You should know when you first noticed symptoms.
You may be asked about any activities or sports that you play or are involved in. Let your doctor know about any increase in these activities.
Your doctor may ask you about any previous broken bones or injuries to that area.
Prepare a list of any medications you are currently taking.
Be ready to inform your doctor of any other health issues or conditions you have.

, Since stress fractures are smaller than acute fractures, your doctor will need to perform specialized tests to detect the stress fracture. Beyond the general physical examination, your doctor may want to perform the following examination techniques:X-rays may be ordered if your doctor feels that it may reveal the stress fracture. However, since stress fractures are often small, they may not show up in an X-ray until weeks after the injury.
Bone scans may be used to locate the area of the injury. These scans use radioactive material which is introduced to the body via an intravenous injection. The radioactive material is highly visible during the scan, and shows which part of the bone is injured.
MRI makes use of magnetic fields and radio waves to get a clear image of both bones and soft tissue. This method is also able to detect the injury much sooner than the others, usually within the first week.

, There are a few steps you can take at home to help your stress fracture heal more quickly. This should be used in conjunction with whatever instructions your doctor may have provided.Try to keep the affected area elevated. This will help reduce any swelling, inflammation, and pain.
If swelling is persistent, you can also try applying ice to the area.
Try not to make use of the area with the fracture. If your fracture is in a body part that you often use, such as a foot or hand, try to avoid using it more than necessary.
If your fracture is located in a foot or leg bone, your doctor may prescribe crutches.

, There are many different types of pain reducing medications available. However, they vary in strength and side effects, so you will need to find one that works best for your level of pain. Ask your doctor to help you make the best choice.Over-the-counter pain medications can help with a wide range of pain types. These include acetaminophen, NSAIDs, aspirin, naproxen, and ibuprofen.
There is some controversy regarding the use of NSAIDs. While they can reduce pain, they may also slow healing.If your pain is not manageable with ""over the counter"" medications, ask your doctor for a stronger prescription.

, R.I.C.E. stands for rest, ice, compression, and elevation. Using each step in the R.I.C.E. method can help reduce pain and swelling to area affected by the stress fracture. R.I.C.E. is used during the first two days of sustaining the injury.


Rest the wounded area as much as you can. Keep weight off the injury to prevent further damage or a slower healing rate. If the injury is serious enough you may need crutches or a cast.
Apply ice to the injured area. Never apply ice directly to the skin, always wrap it in cloth. Apply the ice for up to twenty minutes and then remove. Applying ice for too long can cause frostbite or injury.
Compression will help prevent swelling in the injured area. There are some bandages and special tapes that can be used for compression. However, do not apply these too tightly, as it will cause circulation to be cut off.
Elevation is the final method to help reduce swelling in the injured area. If you can, elevate the affected area above the heart. This allows blood to return to the heart more easily and keeps blood circulating.

, After your initial visit, you will have to return to your doctor for a check-up to determine how well your fracture is healing. Even if it begins to feel better, you should still visit to help ensure that everything healed correctly.Talk with your doctor about how your fracture is healing.
Ask your doctor when you can stop using anything they may have prescribed, such as crutches or medications.
Your doctor should be able to tell you when you can resume normal activities.
Call your doctor sooner if you notice any increase in pain.

Recognize your risk factors.,
Watch out for pain.,
Look for swelling and tenderness.,
Examine the area for bruising.,
See a doctor.",How to Treat a Broken Foot2," Stress fractures are fairly common injuries to the foot and ankle. They're especially common in athletes, because they often result from overuse and repetitive stresses, such as those that long-distance runners endure.Sudden increases in activity can also cause stress fractures. For example, if you're usually fairly sedentary but take a hiking holiday, you might end up with a stress fracture.
Osteoporosis and certain other conditions that affect bone strength and density make you more prone to stress fractures.
Trying to do too much too soon can cause stress fractures. For example, if you're new to exercise and start trying to run a 10k every week, you could end up with a stress fracture.

, If you feel pain in your foot or ankle that eases when you rest, you may have a stress fracture. If the pain gets worse during normal everyday activities, it's a good sign you have a stress fracture. The pain will also get worse over time.The pain may feel deep inside your foot, toe, or ankle.Pain isn't just weakness leaving your body. If you experience consistent foot pain, especially if it's even during everyday activities or persists when you rest, see your doctor. Ignoring it could lead to worse injury.

, If you have a stress fracture, you may notice that the top of your foot is swollen and tender to the touch. Swelling may also occur on the outside of the ankle.Sharp pain when you touch an area of your foot or ankle isn't normal. If you experience pain or tenderness when you touch your foot, see your doctor.

, Bruises don't always occur with stress fractures, but they can., You may be tempted to ""tough it out"" with the pain from a stress fracture, but don't. If you do not seek treatment for a stress fracture, it can get worse over time. The bone may even break completely."

Trust your doctor's diagnosis.,
Follow your doctor's advice for follow-up treatment.,
Take any medication as prescribed.,
Undergo surgery, if recommended by your doctor.,
Follow up with an orthopedic doctor or podiatric surgeon.",How to Treat a Broken Foot3," Depending on the symptoms, the doctor may need to run a few non-invasive imaging tests on the injured foot. The most common tests are x-rays, CT (Computerized Tomography) scans, and MRIs (Magnetic Resonance Imaging). These techniques allow the doctor to examine the foot for broken bones and monitor the bones as they heal., In many cases, surgery is not necessary for proper treatment of a broken foot.Often the hospital will put the foot in a hard cast and/or provide crutches to keep the weight off the foot.The doctor will likely advise you to keep the foot elevated and ice the injury to prevent swelling and re-injury.When using crutches, put your weight on your arms and hands. Do not put all your weight on your armpits, which could hurt the nerves that are in your underarms.
Follow your doctor's orders! Failure to comply with keeping your weight off the foot is the number one cause of delayed healing and re-injury for fractures., You may be advised to take over-the-counter NSAIDs (Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflamatory Drugs) such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) or naproxen (Aleve). These will help reduce the pain and swelling associated with the healing process.If you are scheduled to undergo surgery you may need to stop taking medication a week before the surgery takes place. Consult with your doctor or surgeon.Take the smallest dose possible to manage your pain. Stop taking NSAIDs after 10 days to avoid complications.
Your doctor may also recommend upping your consumption of calcium and vitamin D, which are both crucial for bone health., For most foot injuries, your doctor will try to give your foot time to heal itself by putting on a cast and limiting your activity. In some cases, though, your injured foot may need a manipulation (known as an ORIF, or open reduction internal fixation) if the broken ends of the bone are misaligned. This involves the movement of the bone into the proper alignment, after which pins are passed through the skin to hold the bone in place while it heals. The healing process for a reduction takes an average of 6 weeks, after which the pins are easily removed.In more severe cases you may need surgery to implant screws or rods to keep the foot in position while it heals., Even if your injury doesn't require surgery, an orthopedic doctor or podiatric surgeon will be able to monitor the healing process. In the event of re-injury or other impairments to the healing process, the doctor will prescribe the appropriate treatment, therapy, or surgery."
"
Go to physical therapy after the cast is removed, as advised by your doctor.,
Warm up at the beginning of each session.,
Stretch.,
Perform the appropriate strengthening exercises.,
Regularly perform the prescribed exercises.",How to Treat a Broken Foot4," You can learn exercises to improve the strength and flexibility in your injured foot and help prevent further injury., Start with a few minutes of light exercise, such as walking or riding a stationary bike. This will loosen your muscles and get blood flowing., Stretching exercises are a key step to restoring flexibility and range of motion. Following your doctor or therapist's recommended exercises, stretch the muscles and tendons in the injured foot. If you feel any pain during stretching, consult your doctor.A good example of a stretch is the towel stretch. Sitting on the floor with one leg straightened, loop a towel around the ball of your foot. Hold on to the ends of the towel and pull the top of your foot towards you. You should feel the stretch in your calf and down into the heel. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds, and then rest for 30 seconds. Repeat the exercise 3 times., When done properly, strength exercises should help return the strength and endurance required for everyday activities to the injured foot. If you experience any pain during these exercises, consult your physical therapist or doctor.An example of a strength exercise is the marble pickup. Sit in a chair with both feet flat on the ground and put 20 marbles on the ground in front of you. Place a bowl near the marbles. Pick up the marbles one by one with your injured foot and place them into the bowl. You should feel the exercise on the top of your foot., It is important to keep up with your physical therapy to help you return to daily activities and reduce your chances of re-injury."

Find a flat surface, preferably with light padding.,
Lie on your back and stretch.,
Tuck your knees into your chest and wrap your arms around your legs.,
Rock gently up and down on your spine, slowly increasing your motion until every part of your back (except your neck) is rocking on the ground.",How to Mobilize Your Spine1," A carpeted floor works great.;
, Imagine that you're being pulled from your feet and the top of your head. This lengthens the spine

, Tuck your head slightly toward your knees. Try to make your lower back curve out as you do this.

Visit your doctor to discuss physical therapy options.,
Choose a physical therapist that specializes in osteoporosis.,
Schedule an evaluation appointment with a physical therapist.,
Learn proper posture.,
Change your body mechanics to fit your condition.,
Do balance exercises.,
Begin weight-bearing exercises.,
Start a strength-training routine.,
Begin your own preventative exercise routine at home, after 1 to 6 months of physical therapy.",How to Use Physical Therapy for Osteoporosis," Physical therapy is used in conjunction with medication, braces or aides and regular tests. If you recently fractured a bone, your doctor may want you to wait 6 weeks, until you are in the sub-acute phase of your injury.


If you have been diagnosed with osteoporosis, but you have not yet fractured a bone, you may need to approach your doctor about using physical therapy as a preventative measure. The physical therapist can teach you to move, exercise and even fall in a way that prevents serious and painful bone fractures.;
, The treatment regime for people who have lost bone mass is different from physical therapy used to treat other injuries. Ask your doctor for a list of specialized therapists.

, During this appointment, they will test your body mechanics, your physical fitness and your pain levels. The therapist will prescribe a treatment program that could include up to 3 sessions per week for 6 months.


Talk to your therapist about how many appointments your health insurance will cover. In some cases, you can begin doing some sessions at a health care facility or gym. You may need to pay out of pocket to finish the recommended physical therapy program.

, Because of the risk of spinal fracture, proper posture is essential to retaining mobility. Changing your posture is not always easy, and it may include exercises to strengthen muscles, braces or supports and vigilance on your part.

, For most people this means learning to lift properly, learning fall prevention, learning to avoid twisting your spine and asking for help with situations that could cause fractures (such as lifting or reaching). Your physical therapist will lead you through new movements that you can practice at home.

, Exercises that teach you to walk steadily or balance on 1 foot (0.3 m) help you to avoid future falls. You may also be asked to do some light stretching, because this helps to increase range of motion in your joints and prevent falls.

, This is any low-impact aerobic activity that requires you to move yourself around. Regular walking, dancing, elliptical and stair stepping machines all help to slow down mineral loss in your bones.

, Under supervision by a physical therapist, do repetitive motions with small weights, resistance bands or weight machines in order to strengthen the muscles in your back and other parts of your body. Strength-training will increase the strength of the postural muscles and help you to avoid compression fractures, and stooping, along your spinal column.


In healthy bodies, strength-training can increase bone density. In osteoporosis patients, exercises with weight or resistance help you to maintain your current bone mass and avoid future loss of bone density.

, This should include weight-bearing, strength-training and balance exercise almost every day. Regular, careful physical activity should be taken as seriously as taking an osteoporosis medication.

Learn the symptoms of a stress fracture.,
Lower the risk of stress fractures.,
Ease into new routines.",How to Treat a Stress Fracture2," Stress fractures aren't always as obvious as acute fractures. A stress fracture will likely not have the external symptoms, such as bleeding, bruising, or disfiguring. However, a stress fracture does have the following symptoms that can help you identify if you have one:Most stress fractures occur in athletes or people beginning a new exercise program. The most commonly afflicted areas of the body are the foot and lower leg.Pain and tenderness in the area will be the main identifier of a stress fracture.
Many stress fractures will not be noticeable at their onset.If you notice pain during activity, over a large area where you suspect the fracture, it could be a stress fracture. This pain should fade when you stop the activity that caused it.
If left untreated, the pain will intensify and become constant. The pain will also become more localized at the site of the fracture.

, There are a few lifestyle choices you can make in order to help reduce the chances of sustaining a stress fracture. Try implementing some of the following practices in your life:If you are starting a new exercise regime, or increasing an existing one, make your changes slowly. Don't overdo or overwork your body as you work towards your athletic goals.
Try mixing up your training routines. Training one type of action or body part will increase the chances of a stress fracture occurring. By mixing in low-impact exercise in your routine, you allow stressed areas to heal properly.
Make sure you are getting enough calcium in your diet to help build strong and healthy bones.
Check that your shoes are helping, rather than hurting your feet. Most stress fractures occur in the foot, and proper shoes that support and fit the foot can help prevent them.

, If you play a sport or participate in some other physical activity, and have recovered from a stress fracture, you will want to slowly work back up to your normal level of intensity. Jumping back in too quickly can cause you to re-injure the area and wait once again for it to heal.Pay careful attention to any activities that are high-impact, such as running. Start easy and slowly add more intensity and time to your exercise.
Monitor the area as you increase activity. If you notice pain or discomfort returning, rest the area and lower the intensity.

Identify pain near your shoulder joint.,
Listen for a popping sound.,
Look for a bump on your shoulder.,
Check your clavicle for movement.,
See if you have limited range of motion.Your range of motion can change after an injury.,
Feel for numbness in your shoulder.",How to Self Diagnose a Separated AC Joint1," Pain or discomfort in your shoulder or in the area around it may indicate that you have a shoulder injury.You might notice pain at all times or just when you move or apply pressure to the affected area. Pay attention to how your shoulder feels at rest and when you move it.


Joint separations are graded from mild (grade one) to severe (grade three). Grade one is a sprain, grade two is a partial separation, and grade three is a full separation. A grade one AC separation might just feel sore, while a grade three separation might cause intense pain.Grades one through three are the most common classifications, but there are actually three more grades: four, five, and six. These are rare and usually involve tearing of the deltoid and/or trapezius muscles.Along with pain, you might also notice some swelling in your shoulder if you have a grade two or grade three AC separation.;
, As you move your shoulder joint around, it should be silent. If you hear any popping sounds, it may mean that you have injured your AC joint. Gently rotate your shoulder around and listen for any popping or snapping sounds.


Keep in mind that hearing a popping sound is more common with a grade three separation.See your doctor as soon as possible if you hear popping sounds.

, Examine your shoulder and the area around it to determine if you have any bumps. A small bump can form on the top of your shoulder where your clavicle bone stops. This is almost always a symptom of a shoulder separation.Having a bump on your shoulder is more common with a grade three separation.See your doctor right away if you notice a bump.

, Movement of your clavicle bone is a symptom of a separated AC joint.Your clavicle is the bone that connects your breastbone to your shoulder. Place your hand on your clavicle and gently push it to see if it moves or remains stationary. Your clavicle should not move when you press it.


Movement in your clavicle is also more common with a grade three AC separation and indicates that you need to see a doctor as soon as possible.

, Try to rotate your injured shoulder in all different directions. Not being able to move your injured shoulder in the same ways as you can move your other shoulder may be a sign of a separated AC joint. Try moving your shoulder in the following ways:


Lift your shoulder up.
Push your shoulder down.
Pull your shoulder across your body.
Pull your shoulder out to the side.
Pull your shoulder back and stretch it behind your head.

, Cold or numbing sensations in your extremities or fingers can also be a sign that you have suffered a shoulder injury. Apply some gentle pressure to your shoulder and the surrounding area to see if you can feel it.Sit or stand still and begin to press gently into your affected shoulder. Try this with your unaffected shoulder as well to see if both shoulders feel the same.
The sensation you are trying to feel for is similar to when your body parts “fall asleep.”

Contact your chiropractor immediately if you feel more severe symptoms.,
Discuss other adjustments with the chiropractor if your condition does not improve.,
Go see your doctor or another chiropractor if your condition does not improve.",How to Receive a Good Chiropractic Adjustment," Start your search for a reputable chiropractor by asking your primary care physician or your family doctor for a recommendation. Be direct and ask, “If someone in your family needed a chiropractor, who would you recommend?” You can also talk to your physical therapist or a spine specialist.Some primary care doctors will have several chiropractors that they believe are reputable and trustworthy. Finding a highly recommended chiropractor can increase your chances of getting a good adjustment during your chiropractic appointment.;
, You can also reach out to friends who have had good experiences with a certain chiropractor, especially if they have a spinal issue or physical issue that is similar to yours. You should ask friends or colleagues how the chiropractor helped them and how they felt their adjustments went with the chiropractor.Keep in mind that everyone’s definition of a ""good"" chiropractor experience can be different. You should talk to your friends specifically about your needs and ensure that their recommendation is relevant to your needs.

, You can vet the chiropractor recommended by your doctor or by friends by doing some research into her background. Your state’s Chiropractic Regulation & Licensing Board can provide background information on the chiropractor and let you know if there have been any disciplinary actions taken against the chiropractor.You should also confirm that the chiropractor’s college is accredited by the Council on Chiropractic Education, as this will confirm that the chiropractor is properly trained and certified.

, Most people will set up consultations with several chiropractors to get a better sense of each chiropractor before they book an appointment. You can arrange an in-person consultation at the chiropractor’s office or do the consultation over the phone. A good chiropractor will be willing to sit down with you and discuss his techniques and his clinic. He should also be interested in your needs as a patient.A good chiropractor will try to make you feel comfortable and positive, especially if he knows you are nervous about getting a chiropractic adjustment. He should be willing to have a private, one-on-one conversation with you about your needs before you book anything with him.
You should ask yourself several questions during the consultation, such as, does the chiropractor seem friendly and courteous? Do you feel comfortable talking about your needs with the chiropractor? Does the chiropractor appear to be a good listener and take the time to listen to your needs? Does the office appear clean and sanitary?

, You should use the consultation time to ask the chiropractor several questions. You should note if she answers your questions in depth and provides informed, clear answers. You may ask:What type of chiropractic techniques does the chiropractor use? There are several different chiropractic techniques, and most chiropractors have experience with four to five techniques. The chiropractor will then select the one that best suits the patient’s needs.
Does the chiropractor use her hands or an instrument to do chiropractic manipulations? Some chiropractors will use only their hands to do joint manipulations, and some chiropractors may use a small instrument to do adjustments. Chiropractors can also use a variation of techniques, from quick, firm movements to lighter movements. If you are uncomfortable with joint popping and quick movements, you may ask the chiropractor if she also knows how to do low-force techniques that are more gentle and gradual.
You may also ask the chiropractor how many years she has been in practice, and how much training and experience she has with specific techniques.

, In order to adjust you properly, chiropractors look for subluxations. A subluxation is a joint that has lost its full range of motion or is stuck. Stuck joints can cause stiffness, discomfort, inflammation, and an inability to move in certain ways. They can also lead to headaches and other issues related to irritated nerve tissue in your spine.Chiropractors use an adjustment, also called a manipulation, to release a subluxation.Chiropractors will make an adjustment to release pressure in the area and relieve any discomfort or pain. The technique used to make the adjustment will depend on the comfort level of the patient and the needs of the patient.

, It is important to remember that a chiropractic adjustment is not the act of cracking bones or resetting a bone. Instead, the purpose of an adjustment is to open up the joint, also known as gapping the joint. As the joint opens, there is an audible release of gas between your joints. The release of gas is due to the release of oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide. This release can lead to a loud popping sound.If you are uncomfortable with the popping sound, remember that it is simply a sign that the adjustment has helped to open up the stiff joint.

, Prepare for the session by wearing clothing that is loose and breathable, such as a loose top and loose pants or stretchy workout pants and a breathable shirt. Avoid tight, restrictive clothing as this could make it more difficult for the chiropractor to make the necessary adjustments.

, To receive a good adjustment, you should try to approach the session in a relaxed, calm manner. The chiropractor will ask you to lie face down on a padded chiropractic table. You should let your arms hang towards the floor so your spine is relaxed. This will also help to fan out the vertebrae on your spine, which will make it easier to do the adjustment.During the session, you should keep your body relaxed. Avoid crossing your legs or bending your legs, as this can interfere with the adjustment., To make you feel more at ease and to prepare you for the adjustment, have the chiropractor talk you through everything he does during the session. He should instruct you to breath in and out deeply as she applies force to a joint. He may also warn you that you may hear a popping or cracking sound so you are not alarmed by the sound., You can do this by raising your hand if you start to feel any pain or raise yourself off the padded table and telling the chiropractor to use a lighter touch. Be communicative during the session so the chiropractor is aware of your comfort level as this will ensure you have a positive experience.


Often, chiropractors will make the adjustment quickly and with precise force. You may experience aching or soreness around the adjusted joint right after the adjustment. But this is normal. However, you should not experience any intense pain or discomfort due to the adjustment, as this may be an indication that it was not done properly.Once the session is over, you should rise up slowly on your side. Avoid sitting up from your back or straddling the bench, as these movements could destabilize your adjusted joint. You should also avoid rubbing or poking the adjusted area., These are typical side effects and may occur within 24 hours to several days after the adjustment. You may also experience soreness, stiffness, or aching around or radiating from the areas that were adjusted.You can apply an ice pack to the sore, adjusted area to ease any discomfort or swelling. The discomfort should fade within a few days.

, There are rare instances in which a symptom may be more severe. As with any health procedure, there are small risks. The majority of symptoms usually occur within hours of an adjustment. Contact your chiropractor, or if she is not available, seek immediate medical help if you experience any of the following:Increased pain that doesn’t reduce within 24 hours
Nausea, vomiting and slurred speech
Blurred vision
Onset of numbness or tingling into the upper and/or lower extremities
Difficulty controlling bowel and bladder function
Increased numbness or tingling if you already have a disc herniation

, You may consider booking another consultation with the chiropractor if your condition does not improve within two to four weeks. The chiropractor may try to treat a different area of your spine and ask you about any ergonomic stress that could be triggering the painful, tight area. She may suggest you change your habits so the adjusted area does not get irritated.If you experience intense pain around the adjusted area, you should let the chiropractor know. She should avoid using the same technique on the area and re evaluate your treatment plan to find the right adjustment technique for your needs.

, If you are still experiencing the same joint issues or if the adjusted areas do not improve after you have another session with the chiropractor, you may want to talk to your doctor about other types of treatment for your issue.You may also consider setting up a consultation with a different chiropractor to see if your issue can be resolved with a different chiropractic technique.


Some studies have shown that chiropractic can work moderately well on some individuals and may not be for everyone. You may want to talk to your primary care doctor about other options for addressing your joint issues.

Place them to the side of your keyboard or mouse so you don’t have to reach, and thereby upset your proper posture., Chairs might sink slightly or roll away from the desk over the course of the day. When you return to your desk after a break, reset your keyboard, mouse, screen, and chair to their most ergonomic settings.

Seek medical attention for severe symptoms.,
Apply ice to the injury.,
Take an over-the-counter pain reliever.,
Rest your shoulder.,
Ask your doctor about physical therapy.,
Discuss surgical options for a severe injury.",How to Self Diagnose a Separated AC Joint2," You should seek medical help right away if you are in severe pain. If pain or tenderness in your shoulder area increases over time or persists, contact a doctor to get a formal diagnosis.Your doctor will perform a physical exam and x-rays to determine if you have an AC separation or if something else is causing your pain., You can apply an ice pack to your shoulder to soothe the pain and help relieve swelling. Wrap an ice pack (or a bag of frozen vegetables) in a clean, dry towel and place the pack on your shoulder for up to 20 minutes.Make sure that you give your skin a break after 20 minutes and allow it to return to normal temperature. Otherwise, you risk getting frostbite.

, Over-the-counter pain medications such as acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and aspirin can help to relieve pain from a separated AC.Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for dosage.


Ask your doctor if you are not sure about how much to take.

, Your shoulder may take a few weeks to heal. During this time, try not to do anything strenuous with your shoulder and rest it as much as possible. You may even need to wear a sling depending on the severity of your injury.Avoid moving your shoulder in any way that makes it feel worse. Try to keep it in a position that feels comfortable.

, Depending on the severity of your injury, you may need to do some physical therapy. A physical therapist can teach you exercises to strengthen and stretch your shoulder muscles as your AC separation heals.Do not attempt to do strength training or stretching exercises without your doctor’s permission. Also, make sure that the exercises you do are approved by your doctor. Some exercises might aggravate your injury.

, If your AC separation is severe or does not improve with time, then you may need to discuss surgical options with your doctor. A surgeon can fix the torn ligaments in your shoulder and reposition bones that moved out of place during the injury.Keep in mind that surgery is reserved for cases that do not heal with conservative therapy, have persistent pain or a severe deformity.. Most separated AC joints will heal on their own within a few days to 12 weeks."

Try to identify the cause of your injury.,
Consider whether you are at risk.,
Keep in mind that there are some possible complications.",How to Self Diagnose a Separated AC Joint3," The most common cause of a separated AC joint, is a serious fall or a direct blow to the area. Common activities that can lead to a separated AC joint are sports that are high contact, activities involving repetitive overhead movement, or even things like gardening or cleaning.Reflect on your activities over the last few weeks to see if you can identify the cause of your injury. Try to determine if there was a time when you fell down, got into an accident, or experienced sudden pain in your shoulder.

, Anyone who is involved in contact sports or sports where falls are common is at a greater risk of getting a shoulder injury. Participation in the following sports can pose a higher risk:Hockey
Gymnastics
Skiing
Wrestling
Football

, Although most people will heal from a mild injury on their own, is important to seek treatment for an AC separation that continues to cause you pain and/or discomfort. Not seeking the proper treatment may lead to continued pain in your shoulder, which is more likely if you:Develop arthritis
Have a displaced clavicle bone
Damage other structures in your shoulder, such as your rotator cuff

, When you visit your doctor, make sure that they perform an examination of your entire vertebral column, also known as your spine. Your doctor may perform a neurologic exam or a rectal exam as part of the spinal examination. This will help the doctor determine if there is a dislocation or fracture of your tailbone., Your doctor might want to take x-rays to figure out if you are suffering from a fracture or dislocation of the tailbone. X-rays are sometimes taken in both the seated and standing positions to help the doctor diagnose your injury."

The wider base of an electric toothbrush is easier to grasp. Plus, the electric toothbrush will do most of the work for you, as it provides the brushing action.Remember to brush for two minutes twice a day, or better yet, after every meal.;
, You may also find it difficult to floss if you have pain in your hands. Luckily, special tools can make the process easier. Your dentist or physical therapist can tell which tools will work best for you.One simple solution you can try is a flossing stick. These sticks are readily available in most stores. They are a small stick that ends in a piece of dental floss suspended between two small bars. They can make it easier to floss because you only need one hand to do it., Mouthwashes with alcohol in them can dry out your mouth, leading to more dental problems. Dry mouth is particularly an issue if you already suffer from Sjögren’s syndrome, a condition that is sometimes associated with rheumatoid arthritis.It can also help to use a fluoride rinse.

, When you have rheumatoid arthritis you are at a higher risk of developing gum disease. Therefore, it is important for you to watch for any signs of bleeding or redness or swelling of your gums. Signs of gingivitis may include:Swollen, puffy gums
Dark red gums
Bleeding when you brush or floss
Recession in your gums (pulling away from your teeth)
Tenderness in your gums
Bad breath

, Anti-inflammatory medicines, such as NSAIDs, have protective properties for your joints and for your gums.These medications can help to control swelling in both areas. If your doctor has prescribed an anti-inflammatory medication to you, then make sure that you take it., Make sure that you avoid foods that promote plaque and tooth decay. Consuming these foods can lead to a worsening of your condition. Foods to avoid include:Candy
Starchy foods like chips and bread
Sugary drinks, such as sodas

, One of the best ways to help take care of your teeth is to see your dentist regularly. Your dentist can provide a thorough cleaning, which will help your dental health. In addition, they should be able to identify warning signs of problems, such as the development of infections.Discuss what medications you're on with your dentist, as many that you might take for rheumatoid arthritis can affect your dental health.If you're on steroids and have been for a long period, you may need an extra dose before you go to the dentist. Talk to your doctor about whether that's appropriate for you.
If you have trouble keeping your mouth open for very long, ask your dentist if you can schedule a couple of shorter appointments rather than one long appointment. Be sure to explain why. Most dentists will be willing to work with you., Often, those with rheumatoid arthritis also suffer from a condition called Sjögren’s syndrome, which can lead to dry mouth. Even if you don't suffer from this additional condition, some rheumatoid arthritis medications can also lead to dry mouth. If that's the case with you, make sure you are drinking fluids regularly to keep your mouth moistened.Dry mouth can cause problems with chewing, as well as increase the bacteria in your mouth, all of which can lead to dental problems.

, A saliva substitute helps rehydrate your mouth when you don't have enough saliva. You can buy these products over the counter at most pharmacies. Usually, you spray or rinse with the replacement saliva for rehydration., These candies will help increase the saliva in your mouth by stimulating the salivary glands, and you can use them as often as you'd like. Using sugar-free candies is important because they will not contribute to more dental problems., Antihistamines and decongestants can make you drier. While you may not be able to avoid these medications all the time, try to avoid them when you can, so you don't dry yourself out even more., If you often find yourself sleeping with your mouth open, that can lead to an even drier mouth, particularly if you live in a dry climate. Try using a humidifier in your room at night, which will make the air less drying., Not getting enough sleep can increase your stress levels and lead to a flare-up, so it is crucial to get plenty of rest.Aim for eight to nine hours of sleep each night and a two hour rest period in the middle of the day. Go to bed earlier to ensure that you are getting enough sleep.

If you are struggling to get enough sleep, then talk with your doctor.

, If you are overweight, then losing weight may also help to ease rheumatoid arthritis symptoms. Being overweight increases your inflammation, which may intensify your symptoms overall.Talk to your doctor about your options for healthy weight loss.

, If you have problems with mouth ulcers due to your condition, a folic acid supplement may help reduce the number you have. Talk to your doctor about whether this option is a good one for you.If you are having severe pain from ulcers, you can use a numbing mouthwash to help.

, If you suffer from rheumatoid arthritis, you may be on immunosuppressive medications. While these medications may help your arthritis, they can make you more likely to develop bacterial infections in your mouth. The symptoms include swelling in your mouth, pain, fever, and swelling in the nodes around your jaw.You may also have more fungal infections in your mouth, such as thrush or candida. You'll notice a white coating on your tongue with these infections.

, Cigarettes, cigars, and chewing tobacco can all cause damage for your dental health. If you use tobacco, consider quitting. You'll see an improvement in not only your dental health, but your overall health as well.Tobacco products can also dry out your mouth.

Don’t sit for lengthy periods of time.,
Avoid sitting on hard surfaces.,
Sit on a doughnut pillow or cushion.,
Apply ice four times daily.,
Avoid constipation.",How to Treat a Tailbone Injury2," Sitting down for an extended period of time can cause extreme pain if you are suffering from a tailbone injury. If possible, avoid situations where you will be required to sit for a long time. If you must sit for work or other activities, be sure to take breaks., Taking a seat on a hard surface can complicate a tailbone injury and cause additional pain. When possible sit on cushioned surfaces like couches and padded chairs. Avoid sitting on furniture that does not have padding in the seating area.If you must sit on a hard surface, alternate sitting between the left and right sides of the buttocks.
Lean forward when sitting on a hard surface which will shift weight away from your tailbone.

, You can purchase a doughnut cushion that has a hole in the middle that prevents your tailbone from making contact with the surface upon which you are sitting. You can use the cushion at work, while driving, and at home to alleviate some of the pain associated with a tailbone injury., If the cause of your tailbone pain is a traumatic injury, such as getting hurt during a contact sport, apply ice to the tailbone area for fifteen to twenty minutes at a time. Repeat this four times per day during the first several days after the injury occurs., A tailbone injury is often accompanied with pain during bowel movements. Eating foods high in fiber like fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can soften stools and make bowel movements more comfortable.Try natural over-the-counter stool softeners, such as powders made from psyllium.
Stay hydrated and drink plenty of water.

Try nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) like ibuprofen or aspirin.,
Use an over-the-counter stool softener.,
Get a steroid injection.,
Only take prescribed pain medication in serious cases.",How to Treat a Tailbone Injury3," NSAIDs can reduce the pain and inflammation associated with a tailbone injury. Avoid NSAIDs if you have had gastrointestinal bleeding in the past, are taking a blood thinner, or have a history of kidney disease., The pain from a tailbone injury can be complicated by constipation and difficult bowel movements. Your doctor can recommend a stool softener to alleviate these gastrointestinal symptoms and make bowel movements more comfortable., Sometimes your doctor will suggest a steroid injection in the tailbone region to provide temporary relief from the pain and inflammation resulting from a tailbone injury. Your doctor will decide if this is a good treatment option for you. Steroid injections are usually administered at your medical provider’s office., While your doctor can prescribe narcotic pain medication to alleviate tailbone pain, it is important that you only take these medications if you are experiencing severe pain that is not alleviated with an over the counter NSAID. Narcotic pain medications are highly addictive and should be avoided unless absolutely necessary."

Don’t smoke.",How to Protect Your Joints from Everyday Stressors," As more of us spend our workdays sitting at a computer desk, it becomes increasingly clear that this “low impact” positioning actually can cause pain in joints from wrists to knees and beyond. Proper alignment and positioning, though, can significantly reduce stress on your joints while seated.Choose a desk chair that supports your back and neck in an upright position, with adequate lumbar support. Look for armrests that allow your elbows to bend at a ninety degree angle, and a chair height (or footrest) that permits your feet to rest flat while your knees are bent at a right angle.Choose an ergonomic keyboard with a wrist rest, and use a hands-free phone to reduce neck stress. Position the top of the computer monitor even with the top of your head, and about 18 inches from your face. Attach a document holder to the side of the monitor, so you don’t have to look down.;
, You’ve surely heard the advice to “lift with your legs, not with your back.” The more you use the larger, stronger muscles in your legs, arms, and core, the less strain you will place on smaller muscle groups and the nearby joints.For instance, if you have to lift a box off of a table, don’t rely primarily on your hands and wrists to work as a lever. Instead, use your hands only to secure the box, keep your wrists rigid as much as possible, and lift using your arm muscles.
If the box you need to move is heavier and on the floor, consider whether you can slide it instead of lifting it.

, We think of pain and injuries occurring due to movement, but joint discomfort can also be caused by a lack of movement. People with arthritis or other types of joint pain know all too well what can happen after spending an afternoon clenching a garden shovel, using a keyboard without adequate wrist support, or standing on an unforgiving floor. Regular movement can help prevent joint fatigue, inflammation, stiffness, and pain.When working at the computer, for example, try to take a quick ten to twenty second break every ten minutes, and a three to five minute break each hour. Relax your wrists, stand up, flex your joints a bit, and return to your optimal sitting position.
Take breaks during other activities as well. Sit down for short rests if you are standing for long periods. Vary your gardening routine so you are not in the same position (or holding the same grip) for extended amounts of time.

, It could be said that joint protection is built from the ground up. Poor footwear choices and/or unforgiving ground conditions can create joint pain up from the ankles to the knees, hips, shoulders, and neck. A day spent in high heels on a concrete floor, for instance, is a recipe for joint pain.Wear comfortable, supportive, shock-absorbing, well-fitting shoes whenever possible. Consider visiting a specialist for help finding the best footwear for your feet and body. If you can find ways to limit your time walking on hard surfaces — on the grass instead of the walkway in the park, for example — that can ease the stress on your joints as well., Pain always has a story to tell, and it is important to listen when your body starts to “talk.” When your knees ache, your elbow is sore, or your fingers are stiff, don’t ignore the discomfort or try to push through it. Instead, respond to joint pain by making adjustments to your routines and practices.Joint pain is usually due to overuse or improper use, but there can be other causes as well. If you have unexplained joint pain, consult your doctor.

, When it comes to your joints, in most cases “stiffness begets stiffness.” In other words, completely immobilizing a stiff joint is likely to only increase the discomfort. Instead, try to slowly but surely flex and move the stiff joints to loosen them up.For instance, if your fingers are beginning to feel stiff from gripping a racket during a long tennis match, try the “finger fan.” Spread your fingers out as wide as you comfortably can, hold for a moment, clench your hand into a fist, hold again, and repeat.Or, try the “wrist flex” if that is the sore joint. Rest your elbow and arm flat on the desk, palm down, and gently pull back on your hand (toward your elbow) with your other hand.

, The way you jog, sit in a chair, lift a gallon of milk, or hold a telephone could contribute to joint pain. Making small changes in such routines can make a big difference, but it takes time and effort to change habits.Changing how you walk, sit, etc., will be a gradual process. Practice regularly, make yourself reminders, and give yourself time to adjust. Keep working until you establish a new routine.
For example, if you have recurring hand or wrist pain, practice lifting with both hands (and arms) instead of one whenever possible, even if you can lift the weight with one. It will take time to retrain yourself to lift the teakettle with two (protected) hands, but dividing the weight will reduce the strain on any single joint.

, Modern technology has helped make products ranging from lawnmowers to cooking pots more lightweight. This is a positive development if you have joint pain. Choosing lighter products for your everyday tasks can reduce the stress placed upon your joints.If you work around the house regularly, for instance, consider buying a lightweight vacuum cleaner, or a lighter iron for when you're doing laundry.

, While there are few positives about suffering from joint pain, you can at least say that it gives you a reason to take warm baths and get occasional massages. Soothing techniques such as these can help ease the discomfort of sore joints for many people.When you are dealing with joint inflammation, icing the area, perhaps followed later by warm applications, may prove most beneficial. Consider talking to your doctor or joint pain specialist regarding the best combination of techniques for your particular joint pain.

, Whether you don’t know what is causing your joint pain, or recognize the likely cause(s) but aren’t sure what you can do, it is always a good idea to discuss the issue with your doctor. The treatment options you discuss can range from simple exercises to pain medications to surgical intervention, depending on your circumstances.Your doctor may, for example, suggest flexible (“working”) or rigid (“resting”) joint splints, or both. These devices for the hands, wrists, and other joints can provide additional support or immobilize the joint for defined periods of time in order to reduce joint stress.

, Regular exercise — 30 minutes or more per day for most adults — is beneficial to every aspect of health, including joint health. That is, of course, if you exercise using proper technique, and listen to your body if you experience joint pain from exercise. You should also consult your doctor before beginning an exercise regimen, especially if you live a sedentary lifestyle or have preexisting medical conditions.If you already have joint pain, or are looking to reduce the strain on your joints while building up your cardiovascular health, choose low-impact exercises like cycling. Water exercises like swimming and water aerobics are probably the most joint-friendly options, since the buoyancy of the water reduces joint stress.
Strength training exercises build muscle, but they can also help strengthen your bones, which in turn benefits joint health. Also, stronger muscles can help remove more of the burden from your joints when lifting objects, etc.
Yoga is also a very joint-friendly type of exercise, as it improves flexibility and balance.

, Not surprisingly, the same diet that is good for your overall health is also good for joint health. By eating more fresh fruits and vegetables, lean proteins, and healthy fats, you will consume greater amounts of various nutrients that can help strengthen your bones and the cartilage, tendons, and muscles that connect to them in your joints.Calcium is well-known for its association with bone health. Choose lowfat dairy products, leafy greens, fortified foods, and other high-calcium options.
Increasing your vitamin C intake can help repair joint cartilage. Choose foods such as citrus fruits, leafy greens, and tomatoes.
There is also evidence that reducing sodium intake and increasing potassium intake can help to promote bone health. Processed and prepackaged foods are usually loaded with sodium, while options like bananas, yogurt, and lentils are good potassium sources.
Excessive caffeine or alcohol intake can also hinder bone health, so consume either or both in moderation.

, Weight-bearing joints like your knees are particularly impacted by weight gain; by some estimates, each pound gained adds four pounds of stress to your knees. Use a healthy diet and regular exercise as your starting points for weight reduction, for your overall health and your joint health.However, being underweight can also negatively impact joint health, as significantly underweight people are at a higher risk for bone loss. Aim for the healthy “middle ground.”, The more we learn about the dangers of smoking, the more we discover that practically every aspect of health is negatively impacted by it. Joint health is no different, as smoking can reduce bone density, among the numerous other harms it will cause.Quitting smoking can be very difficult, but the health benefits of quitting are undeniable. Talk to your doctor and seek out help with quitting if and when you need it.

Change it up.",How to Use Water Exercises for Back Pain1," If you have balance issues, using water shoes can help. You can find them at most large shoe stores or sporting good stores. Look for ones that have good traction, and make sure they fit comfortably.Water shoes, as their name implies, are shoes designed to be worn in the water. They let water in and dry out more readily when you get out.
In addition, they have soles with traction, which means you'll have a better grip on the floor of the pool.;
, Start in the shallow end. It doesn't matter how shallow the shallow end is. Just start on that end and work your way to slightly deeper water, going to about mid-chest. Water walking is just as it sounds. You spend time walking back and forth across the pool, just as you do on land., It should be long as you go across the pool. Also, make sure you aren't walking on your tiptoes.Also, make sure you are swinging your arms like you're not in water., You want to have straight posture as you do this movement. In addition, keep your core muscles tight so you don't lean to one side or forward.


One reason this exercise works well for back pain is it lets you stay upright while still building strength in your back.However, bending forward or to the side can increase back pain if you're not careful.

, If you find the workout too easy, you can add equipment to make it a bit harder. For instance, you can use webs on your hands to add resistance as you move through the water.You can also add a weighted belt.
Another option is ankle weights.
If you have trouble staying upright, you can use a flotation belt instead, which will keep you where you need to be., You can also move backwards across the pool, being sure to watch out for other people. Another option is side-stepping. These both help improve your range of motion.You can also move to the deep end. If you can't swim, put on a life vest or other flotation device.
To walk in deep water, you simply move your arms and legs as if you were walking to propel you forward. You can also use a water noodle to help you stay afloat. Simply straddle it as you would a horse, pulling it slightly higher in the back."

Do half-suspended jumping jacks.,
Do some knee-tucks.",How to Use Water Exercises for Back Pain2," You'll need to be at the side of the pool for this exercise. Grab hold of the wall with your right hand to keep your balance. Chest-deep works well for this exercise.Have your right leg nearest the wall. Put your weight on that leg alone, bending at the knee.
Lift your left leg up, bending at the knee. Bring it up as high as it will go. Your ultimate goal is to bring it to your chest.
Repeat five times for each leg.

, Face the wall of the pool and hold on. With your back straight, lift up your right leg out to the side. Bring it back down. Your left leg should stay stable on the floor.Don't turn your ankle. Just lift your leg as high as it will go without turning.
Lift that leg eight to 10 times or until you get tired, then move to the other leg.
Try to exhale as you bring your leg up and inhale as you bring it down.

, Slowly extend your body back, with your legs straight. Your body should look like Superman flying.


Hold position for several seconds before bringing your legs down.
Repeat five to 10 times.
Make sure you don’t hyperextend the back when doing the exercise., Balance, or ""proprioception,"" is an important part of a healthy back. Try standing on one leg while standing in the pool. To make the exercise more difficult, try closing your eyes.


Hold this position for as long as you comfortably can.
Repeat four or five more times, and then perform the same exercise with the opposite leg.

, Bicycling in the pool can strengthen your abs, which in turn can help lower back pain. Start with your elbows on the side of the pool, facing outward. You need to be deep enough that you can move your feet without hitting the floor.With your legs slightly out in front of you, rotate them in the water as if you're riding a bike. In other words, bring one knee up, and rotate the foot forward in a circular motion that moves to the back. At the same time, your other foot should be on the other side of the circle you're making, rotating front and back as well.
You can also use this motion to move through the water. Simply use your arms as well, and let your feet move you. You can use a noodle to help keep you afloat.

, Lean against the wall again. Have your elbows on the side of the pool to support you. Lift both legs together, and then push them back down again. Chest deep works well for this exercise.Keep your legs straight.
Another option is to sit on the side of the pool and do the same exercise. Sitting on the side will make it easier.

, Go to the shallow end of the pool. Place your feet at about hip-width. Squat down in the water by bending your knees. Also, stick your butt out in the water.You should reach a position like you're sitting in a chair.
Try not to let your knees go in front of your toes.
Inhale as you squat down, and exhale as you stand back up. As you stand up, make sure to keep your core tight and your back straight.
During this exercise, your arms should be bent but close to your body. Have your palms facing down.

, At the wall, grasp the edge. Use your arms to push yourself down in the water, while making sure your legs are bent. Then, pull yourself up as far as you can. You'll need to be at least chest deep for this exercise.Just go as high as you can. Don't worry if you can't go too high yet.
Of course, if your back starts hurting more, it's important to stop what you're doing.

, Get in the shallow end, and stand with legs together. Start by doing a normal jumping jack, just like you would on land. Kick your legs apart, going outward to the side. As you do, raise your arms above your head.As you come back together, try to not to touch the bottom of the pool before you kick back out. Bring your arms down as you bring your legs in.
You can also do fully suspended jumping jacks by not touching the floor at all.

, These exercises work your abs through water resistance. Basically, you stand still in chest-deep water. Then you bring your knees up to your chest, moving them together.To make the move harder, jump up to bring your knees in faster.
Also, make sure to keep your head high, so you don't dunk yourself.

Try lunges.,
Kick your way across the pool.,
Swim laps.",How to Use Water Exercises for Back Pain3," Lunges in the water work much like they do on land. Work in the shallow end, and give yourself enough room to move forward. You'll need at least 10 to 15 feet in front of you to work.Take a large step forward on your right leg. Bend your left knee down, almost touching the floor of the pool.
Your right thigh should be parallel to the floor, and your knee should be at a 90-degree angle.
Keep moving forward, alternating legs.

, Grab a kickboard to use for floating. You can also use a water noodle. Simply grab hold of your flotation device while on your stomach, and kick your way across the pool.You can alternate kicking legs or try a mermaid kick (legs kicking together like a mermaid tail).
You can also do a frog kick, like you use for a breaststroke.
If you prefer, you can hold onto the side of the pool instead., Of course, you can turn to the old standby of swimming laps, which works your whole body at once and helps with back pain. You can swim the breaststroke, backstroke, the crawl, or even the butterfly, whatever you prefer.To make yourself move a little faster, try setting goals for yourself. Just setting goals for how many laps you're going to swim can make you go faster.
Also, listening to music can motivate you without you even realizing it. Try getting waterproof headphones and waterproof cover for your phone or mp3 player.

Press skin at the end of the tape.",How to Use Kinesiology Tape," Some people may experience an allergic reaction to kinesiology tape. As a result, you should apply a small test strip for up to 24 hours before fully applying the tape. If skin irritation like redness occurs, remove the tape immediately., Small amounts of body hair should not affect the adhesion of the tape. That being said, excessive amounts of hair may make it difficult for the tape to stick to the skin. Clip excessive hair so that it is close to the body. This will also make the removal less painful., Before you apply kinesiology tape to the skin, you need to make sure that the area is clean and free of any oils or lotions. Wash your skin with soap and water or rubbing alcohol prior to applying the tape., Once the skin has been cleaned, make sure that it is completely dry before applying the tape. Moisture can impact the adhesion of the tape. If you are applying kinesiology tape following exercise, make sure that your body is no longer perspiring.You can pat the skin dry using a clean towel.

, Kinesiology tape needs time to stick to the skin. As a result, you should wait at least one hour after you tape your skin before engaging in a physical activity that may cause perspiration. Similarly, you should avoid swimming and showering within the first hour of applying the tape., There are a number of different ways to apply kinesiology tape, and these typically depend on the size of the affected muscle and the results that are trying to be achieved. You should visit a medical professional, such as a physiotherapist, to learn the proper tension and alignment that should be used for taping your particular muscle. As a general rule:Y tape applied in the shape of a Y over the target muscle. This is used to surround the target muscle and can either inhibit or facilitate muscle stimuli. The tape should be slightly longer than the target muscle.
I tape application is used for acute injuries and helps with alignment corrections. In this case, you place a single strip of tape along the target muscle in a straight line.
X tape application is when the tape forms an X shape across the affected muscle. This is used when the origin and alignment of the muscle changes with movement. The tape will move with the muscle providing continued support. For example, it can be used on the rhomboids (upper back and shoulder).
Fan/web tape application is used in a similar way to the X tape; however, the one end remains intact while the other end spreads out in a fan-shape across the muscle.

, Kinesiology tape can come in a continuous roll or precut strips. If you are using a roll of kinesiology tape, unwind and cut off the amount of tape you need. Then, round the ends of the tape by cutting the corners with scissors. This will help prevent the tape from fraying and unpeeling at the ends.If you are using precut strips, tear the strips along the serrated edge.

, If you are applying kinesiology tape to a joint, such as the knee or elbow, you should always begin with the joint in a bent position. If the tape is applied to a knee or elbow in an extended position, the tape will pull off once you begin to move., Tear the backing 2-3 inches (5-7.5 cm) from the end of the tape to create an anchor. This part will be applied directly to the skin. It is important that you do not stretch this section of the tape. If you stretch the anchor section of tape, it may cause the tape to peel off and the application will be less effective., After you have anchored the tape to the skin, you can begin to stretch the tape across the desired muscle. The amount of stretch you use will depend upon the type of treatment. For example, if you want to stimulate a muscle that is struggling to perform, you should use 15%-50% stretch. This will alleviate muscle pain and tension.Alternatively, if you want to relieve pain from a muscle that is overstimulated, you should use 15%-25% stretch.

, This can be done by holding the tape in the middle and gently tearing and pulling at the paper backing. If you peel off all of the backing at once, the tape may stick to itself and ruin the application.Avoid touching the adhesive. This can impact the stickiness of the tape and may cause the tape to peel off the skin.

, The last 2-3 inches (5-7.5 cm) of tape should be anchored to the skin without stretching the tape. Avoid sticking tape to another piece of tape. This will not hold and may cause the ends to roll up., Once the tape has been applied to the skin, you want to activate the tape and ensure that it will not peel off the skin. Use your hands to rub the tape from the center towards the ends. This will help stick the tape to the skin., Clothing or equipment that rubs the ends of the tape can cause the ends to peel. To prevent this, wear clothing styles that do not interfere with the ends of the tape. If this is not possible, you could try taping your clothing to your skin in certain areas so that they do not come in contact with the tape.For example, you could tape your sleeves back if you are wearing kinesiology tape on your shoulders.

, Kinesiology tape can be worn for three to five days and you will likely get the tape wet at some point during that period. To dry the tape, simply pat it dry with a clean towel. Do not rub the tape, because this may cause the ends to peel., If at some point the ends of the tape begin to peel, you can simply trim off the peeling piece using a pair of scissors. Press down the remaining ends of the tape so that more peeling does not occur., Prior to removing the tape from your skin, you can loosen it by dampening the tape with baby oil or vegetable oil. Brush the oil onto the tape and then let it sit for 5-10 minutes. This will help to loosen the adhesive and will make the tape removal easier., To make tape removal less painful, peel the tape away from the skin in the same direction as your hair grows. As a general rule, this is away from the center of the body on the trunk and in a downward direction on the arms and legs., Use one hand to tack the skin down near the end of the tape, then gently pull the skin away from the tape. Then, use your other hand to slowly pull up the tape. This should ease any pain associated with removing kinesiology tape.Do not rip off the tape in a quick motion. This could tear the skin and cause irritation.

Know when you should apply Kinesio tape.,
Get your Kinesio tape.,
Cut your strips.,
Clean your skin.,
Stretch your neck muscles.,
Apply the vertical strips.,
Apply the horizontal “I” strip.,
Rub the tape to heat and activate the glue.",How to Use Kinesio Tapes to Relieve Neck Pain," Kinesio tapes can help with the healing process during and after physical activity, like playing a sport or exercising. This specially made elastic tape can be applied to muscles and joints to decrease pain or swelling, and restore motion, among other benefits.You can use Kinesio tape if you experience chronic pain in your neck due to being sore from exercise, to help blood flow during physical activity, or even if you just sit at a desk all day and need some extra relief.;
, There are several brands of Kinesio tapes on the market and while they all provide the same benefit, the differences mostly come down to how the tape comes packaged. Some brands offer pre cut tapes that are made for specific body parts.Some of the top rated tapes are KT Tape, Performtex, Spidertech, Rock Tape.
To relieve your neck pain with Kinesio tape, you will need three pieces, or strips of tape.
You can find Kinesio tape at most sporting goods stores or online through shops like Amazon.com

, Some Kinesio tapes will come in pre cut strips, but if yours don’t, then you will have to cut them for your neck. To get a clean cut of tape, get a sharp pair of scissors.


Cut a strip of tape about 10 centimeter (3.9 in) long, make a cut vertically along the middle to create a “Y” strip, leaving about 2 centimeter (0.8 in) at the end as the origin point.
You can also just use two separate strips of 10 centimeter (3.9 in) if you wish.
Trim the strips to make curved or round corners to prevent peeling, if they are not already.

, In order for the tape to accurately stick to your skin and lift the epidermis, you need to wash and dry the skin remove any oil and sweat so your tape will stick.


Grab some soap that will lift the oil off your body without drying your skin up too much.
Also make sure that you effectively dry off your skin so the tape sticks.

, Tilt your head forward while in a comfortable sitting or standing position with your feet planted firmly on the floor. Simply bend your neck forward to stretch the Semispinalis, Levator, Scapulae, Upper Trapezius, Scalenes, and Splenius Capitus (the muscles that are in your neck, connecting to your shoulders).


You want to comfortably bend your neck forward as if you are trying to touch your chin to your neck, but don’t stretch it so far that you are hurting yourself.
Stretch the muscles until you feel a taut pulling sensation.

, Your first step is to apply the two vertical primary “I” strips that run vertically and mostly parallel to your spine. Place the strips starting just 1 centimeter (0.4 in) below the hairline.


You want to peel the strips as you place them down the neck as if you’re peeling a band-aid.
As you pull down the vertical “I” strips, you want you to create a slight stretch of about 10 to 15 percent. This means pulling on the tape just slightly with the end that hasn’t been placed on the skin yet.
Depending on if you are feeling pain in the center of your neck or on each side of the spine, you can create an upside down “V” or the fork of a “Y” with the strips or place them parallel. The tails should end near the trapezius muscle, which is just above the shoulder blade.

, Peel the tape and place it horizontally over the area of your neck where you are experiencing pain. You want to place the horizontal strip so that it forms a bit of an “A” shape with the other strips.


For the horizontal strip, you want something closer to 75 percent stretch.
To do this, pull the strip to full stretch and then ease up slightly. Next, place the center of the strip on the skin first and even it out on either side, applying pressure until you get towards the ends, letting them stick to the skin without any stretch.

, To get the glue to become as adhesive as possible, you want to give it a good rub so that you ensure it sticks, and there are no bubbles in the tape.


When Kinesio tape is correctly applied, it it relieves pain by lifting the top layers of your skin, relieving pressure and allowing for better blood flow and muscle movement.If your tape isn’t as adhesive as possible, you may not get the full effects.

Rest and be patient.,
Use cold therapy for acute low back pain.,
Apply moist heat to chronic lower back pain.,
Take over-the-counter (OTC) medications.,
Change your sleeping position.,
Improve your posture.,
Make sure you are using safe lifting techniques.",How to Treat Lower Back Pain1," The spine is a complex and congested collection of joints, nerves, muscles and blood vessels.Thus, there are many structures that can create pain if you move the wrong way, experience trauma or over-stress the area. However, lower back pain (even when severe) can fade away quickly without treatment — often within a few days. This is because the body has a powerful ability to heal and most back pain is due to being a little ""out of whack"" instead of damaged. Be patient if you feel lower back pain, stop any aggravating activities and see if it fades away on its own.


Bed rest is no longer recommended for most types of lower back pain. The medical consensus is that at least some light exercise (walking, stair climbing) is helpful for lumbar pain because it stimulates blood flow and can help ""loosen"" or ""unjam"" any irritated spinal joints or nerves.
If your lower back pain is caused from exercising at the gym, then maybe you're working out too hard or with bad form — ask a personal trainer for advice.
If your lower back pain is work related, speak to your boss about changing to lighter work duties or altering your work area — a cushioned mat for underneath your feet or a chair with lumbar support, for examples.;
, While you're resting your lower back and being patient for a few days, consider applying cold therapy. Applying ice or frozen gel packs to any acute (sudden or new) musculoskeletal injury is effective because it numbs the pain and reduces inflammation.Crushed ice, ice cubes, cold gel packs or a bag of frozen veggies should be applied to the most painful area of your low back for between 10 – 15 minutes every hour, until the discomfort starts to fade away. Once improved, reduce the frequency to three times per day.


Always wrap anything frozen in a thin cloth before applying it to your lower back in order to prevent frostbite or skin irritation.
Compressing the cold therapy against your lower back with an elastic bandage or support can also help prevent inflammation from building up.
Remember that cold therapy is usually not appropriate for chronic (long term) back pain because it can aggravate symptoms — moist heat often provides more relief.

, If your low back pain is chronic and has bothered you on and off for many months or years, then applying moist heat is likely better because it promotes blood flow and relaxes tight muscles and other soft tissues.A good source of moist heat is microwavable herbal bags, especially the ones infused with relaxing aromatherapy, such as lavender. Put the bag in the microwave for a couple of minutes, then apply it to your lower back while sitting or lying down for about 20 minutes. Cover the bag with a towel to insulate it and prevent heat loss too quickly.


As an alternative, soak your lower back in a warm Epsom salt bath for at least 20 minutes a few times a day until your symptoms fade away. Epsom salt contains magnesium, which relaxes muscles and reduces swelling.
Don't make your bath water too hot so that it scalds you and remember to keep well hydrated — warm salt baths pull fluid from your skin and can dehydrate you.
Applying moist heat or soaking in a warm salt bath is usually not recommended for acute back pain because it increases blood flow and tends to promote inflammation.

, OTC non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve) or aspirin can be effective short-term solutions for acute lower back pain because they reduce inflammation and pain.On the other hand, chronic lower back pain may be better served by taking OTC painkillers, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol), because they alter the way your brain perceives pain.


NSAIDs can be harmful to your stomach and kidneys if taken in large doses or for long periods of time (more than a few months), so be cautious and read labels carefully.
Acetaminophen is not so hard on your stomach and kidneys, but it can damage your liver, so don't overdo it.
Another way of relieving low back pain, but without the risk of stomach, kidney or liver irritation, is applying a cream or gel that contains NSAIDs, acetaminophen or natural analgesics such as menthol and capsaicin.

, Your sleeping position and/or sleeping environment may be contributing to or causing your lower back pain. For example, sleeping on your stomach can cause too much of an arch in your low back, which compresses and irritates spinal joints and nerves.The best sleeping positions for your lower back are the recumbent position (on your side similar to the fetal position with your hips and knees bent) and the supine position (on your back with your legs elevated by a pillow). Both of these positions take pressure off your lower back joints and reduces the chances of irritation / pain.


Changing your sleeping environment usually means making sure what you sleep on is supportive for your spine. In general, beds that are too soft tend to promote back pain, whereas firmer orthopedic beds tend to reduce the incidence of lower back pain.
Everyone is a little different, so a good way to judge your bed is if you're waking up sore or not. If you wake up sore, then your sleeping position/environment is an aggravating factor. If you're more sore at the end of the day, then it's likely your job/activities/exercising is to blame.
Keep in mind that most foam and spring mattresses only last about 10 years with constant use, although it depends on your weight. Rotate and flip your mattress on a regular basis (every time you wash your sheets) to increase its longevity.

, Too much slouching while you sit and stand can increase the strain on your low back and lead to irritation or pain. Improving your posture can help reduce back strain and relieve existing back aches. In fact, improving your posture can also help prevent recurrence of lower back pain.However, improving your posture is a difficult task that requires daily effort and dedication.


Strengthening your core muscles is a good strategy to help improve your posture. Core muscles are those in your low back, lower abdomen and pelvis — they all connect to your spine and/or pelvis in some way to help hold your body upright.To maintain good posture while standing: stand with your weight distributed over both feet and avoid locking your knees. Tighten your stomach and buttock muscles to keep your back straight. Wear supportive shoes and alleviate muscle fatigue by periodically resting one foot on a footstool.
To maintain good posture while sitting: choose a firm chair, preferably one with armrests. Keep your upper back straight, but your shoulders relaxed. A small cushion placed behind your lower back can help maintain the natural curve of your lower back. Keep your feet flat on the floor, using a footstool if necessary., Though there is some disagreement about the best way to lift, as it varies depending on the circumstances, but there are a few basic rules you should try to follow.


Test the weight of the load so you are not surprised by and unexpectedly heavy or shifting load. If the load is too heavy, ask for help.
Stand as close to the load as possible before lifting, and keep it as close to your body as you can when you are carrying.
Do not twist, stretch, or turn at the waist — if you need to turn, do so with your entire body.
Appropriate lifting posture may include a squat lift (bending at the knees and hips while keeping your back straight), a stoop lift (keeping your legs straight while bending your back), or a freestyle lift (a semi-squat that allows you to rest the load on your thighs).

Make an appointment with a chiropractor.,
Get a lower back massage.,
Try some acupuncture therapy.,
Consider cognitive-behavioral therapy.",How to Treat Lower Back Pain2," Chiropractors are doctors who specialize in the spine and other joints. They are trained to treat back problems in natural ways, such as with manual spinal manipulation. Manual manipulation, also called a spinal adjustment, is used to unjam or reposition spinal joints that are slightly misaligned, which triggers inflammation and sharp pain.


A single spinal adjustment can sometimes significantly relieve your lower back pain, but usually it takes three to five treatments to really feel much better. Keep in mind that your health insurance may not cover chiropractic care.
Chiropractors also use therapies meant more for muscle strains and ligament sprains, which may be more appropriate for your lower back issue. Electronic muscle stimulation, therapeutic ultrasound and TENS treatments are examples of such therapies.
Tractioning or stretching your spine with an inversion table can also help lower back pain. Some chiropractors use inversion tables, which allows you to recline your upper body and enlist the help of gravity to decompress your spine.

, As noted above, not all lower back injuries are joint related. Many are related to muscle pulls or strains. A pulled muscle happens when the small muscle fibers tear, which causes pain, inflammation and muscle guarding or spasms. Thus, a deep tissue massage can be great for mild-to-moderate strains because it calms muscle spasms, reduces inflammation and promotes relaxation.Start with a 30 minute massage from a licensed massage therapist, focusing on your lower lumbar spine and pelvis.


A single 30-minute massage session may be enough to soothe your lower back pain, but it often takes a few more sessions to see significant results. For chronic back pain, consider increasing your sessions to an hour and include some mid back and/or leg work also.
Drink lots of purified water after any massage in order to flush out inflammatory by-products from your body. Failure to do so might lead to muscle soreness, a headache or some mild nausea.
As an alternative to a professional massage, place a tennis ball underneath your low back and roll on it slowly for 15 minutes a few times daily until the pain fades away.

, Acupuncture is an ancient Chinese healing art that involves sticking thin needles into specific points within your skin in efforts to reduce pain and inflammation.Acupuncture for lower back pain can be very helpful, especially if it's done when your symptoms are acute (fairly new). Acupuncture apparently works by triggering the release of many substances, including endorphins and serotonin, which act to eliminate the sensation of pain.


There is some research evidence that acupuncture really helps chronic lower back pain, but your results may vary.Acupuncture points that provide back pain relief are not all located close to where you feel the pain — some are in distant areas, such as your hand.
Acupuncture is now practiced by many health professionals — whoever you choose should be certified by the National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine., Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) attempts to identify your negative thoughts and beliefs, and then replaces them with more positive ones. More specifically, a CBT approach to treating back pain would focus on how you respond to or perceive your pain symptoms.CBT has shown to help reduce stress and chronic back pain in many people.CBT can be a ""last resort"" treatment choice for low back pain when nothing else seems to be helpful.
Consult your family physician, psychologist or insurance company representative for the names of CBT practitioners in your area. Consider interviewing a couple of them before you decide on which one to proceed with."

Make an appointment with your doctor.,
Get a physical therapy referral.,
Try myofascial trigger point therapy.,
Consider a steroid injection for your pain.",How to Treat Lower Back Pain3," If patience, basic home care and alternative therapies are not real helpful in alleviating your lower back pain, then make an appointment with your doctor. They will examine you to see if your pain is caused by a serious spinal issue: herniated spinal disc, entrapped (pinched) nerve, bone infection (osteomyelitis), osteoporosis, stress fracture, advanced arthritis or cancer.For pain control, your doctor can prescribe stronger NSAIDs or painkillers.


X-rays, bone scans, MRI, CT scans and nerve conductance studies are all methods of viewing and diagnosing spinal problems.
You may also be sent for a blood test in order to see if you have rheumatoid arthritis or a spinal infection (osteomyelitis or meningitis).
You may ultimately be referred to a medical specialist (orthopedist, neurologist, rheumatologist) to better figure out your lower back problem.

, If your lower back pain is chronic (bothering you for many months or years) and related to weak muscles, bad posture and/or degenerative conditions (""wear and tear"" osteoarthritis), you should consider spinal rehabilitation therapy — you'll likely need a referral from your doctor. A physiotherapist can teach you specific stretches and strengthening exercises for your lower lumbar spine, which can relieve pain with time.Physical therapy is usually recommended 3x per week for 4-8 weeks to make a significant impact on chronic lower back issues.


For spinal rehabilitation, physiotherapists tend to use a variety of exercise balls, weighted medicine balls, elastic tension bands, electronic muscle stimulation and/or therapeutic ultrasound devices.
Effective strengthening exercises that you can do on your own for your lower back muscles include: swimming, rowing, certain yoga positions and back extensions.

, Your back pain may be related to muscle injury or strain at a trigger point, which can lead to referred pain, or pain that extends to another area. So, though you may be experiencing pain in your lower back, the trigger point may be located elsewhere on your body.Locate a practitioner who is trained to identify and treat myofascial pain. He may use a variety of techniques to release the trigger point., If stronger prescription drugs and/or back rehabilitation don't prove effective, then an injection of corticosteroid medicine into the joints, muscles, tendons or ligaments of your low can quickly reduce inflammation and pain, and allow better movement.Corticosteroids are based on natural human hormones, which have strong and quick-acting anti-inflammatory properties. The most common ones used by doctors are called prednisolone, dexamethasone and triamcinolone. Your family doctor will likely refer you to a back specialist (orthopedist) for the injection if she thinks it will help.


Potential side effects of getting steroid injections include: local infection, excessive bleeding, tendon weakening, muscle atrophy, nerve irritation / damage, and reduced immune system function.
Pain relief from steroid injections can last anywhere from a few weeks to many months. Doctors don't like to give more than two injections per year.
If corticosteroid injections don't give much relief for your lower back pain, then an operation (there's many different surgical procedures) should be explored with your doctor as a last resort.

Undergo surgery for fractures and damaged joints.",How to Treat Paget's Disease of the Bone1," A common treatment for Paget’s disease of bone is medication. Usually, patients are given medication used for osteoporosis. Many of these drugs are taken orally, but some are given through injection. Oral medication may cause digestive side effects.Some common medications used for Paget’s disease of bone are alendronate (Fosamax), ibandronate (Boniva), and risedronate (Actonel).
For those who can’t take the bisphosphonates used for osteoporosis medication, you may be given calcitonin (Miacalcin).;
, You may be able to undergo supportive therapies to help treat your Paget’s disease. Physical and occupational therapy can help. During these exercises, your therapist will lead you through exercises to help with mobility and everyday tasks.They will also provide techniques to help you manage pain.

, Surgery is uncommon for Paget’s disease of bone. However, there are certain instances where you may need surgery to deal with conditions caused by Paget’s disease. Your doctor may suggest surgery to assist in healing fractures and replace damaged joints with arthritis.You may also have surgery to help align bones that have become deformed or to alleviate pain caused by pressure on the nerves.
If you are to have surgery on bones affected by Paget’s disease, you are at a risk for severe blood loss. Your doctor may give you medication to help with this prior to surgery.

Determine if you need treatment.,
Try over-the-counter pain medication.,
Use walking aids to help with mobility.,
Modify your diet to increase bone health.",How to Treat Paget's Disease of the Bone2," Sometimes, doctors won’t recommend treatment if you don’t have any symptoms. You may not need treatment because the disease is dormant. Even if you have no symptoms, the doctor may recommend treatment if the disease is active and affects certain key areas of your body, like your skull and spine.The treatment despite having no symptoms helps reduce the risk of complications.

, Paget’s disease of bone can lead to pain in your bones or joints. To help with this, you can try over-the-counter pain meds. Ibuprofen, such as Advil or Motrin, and Acetaminophen, like Tylenol, are generally helpful.If you have pain after taking these medications, see your doctor.

, For some with Paget’s disease of bone, help walking is a beneficial treatment. Walking aids can be prescribed to help you take the weight off the bones affected by the disease. This can help your mobility and help reduce your pain.You can try a walker or a cane to help you walk.
Try inserts that go inside your shoe to give added support.
Your doctor may suggest braces that help you keep your spine in the right position.

, A diet that supports bone health is a lifestyle change and at-home treatment that can help. Increasing the amount of calcium and vitamin D in your diet helps increase bone health. Add these vital nutrients to your diet.Dairy contains healthy amounts of calcium. Add more milk and cheese products to your diet.
Green leafy vegetables contain calcium. Try cabbage, broccoli, spinach, and kale.
Soy beans and soy products like tofu contain calcium.
Spending 15 to 20 minutes in the sun each day is a great way to get your vitamin D. You may also want to try oily fish, like tuna.
Some foods are fortified with calcium and vitamin D, so you can try to look for those. Your doctor may also suggest that you take supplements.

Recognize the symptoms.,
Get imaging tests.,
Have a blood test.",How to Treat Paget's Disease of the Bone3," This condition affects the body's ability to create new bone tissue, which leads to weak and misshapen bones. This condition generally affects people age 50 and older. Often, there are no symptoms. If there are symptoms, the most common is bone pain.Commons areas this condition affects include the pelvis, skull, spine, and leg.
In addition to pain, you may experience headaches or hearing loss if the skull is affected, you may become bowlegged or have joint pain in the knee or hip when the leg is affected, and the condition in the spine may make the arms or legs tingle or become numb.

, X-rays are the most common way doctors diagnose Paget’s disease. The bones will look very distinctive if you have Paget’s disease, so the doctor can easily identify it. Your bones may be denser, be abnormally shaped, or be enlarged. Some bones, like in the legs, may have tiny fractures.The doctor may also perform a bone scan. This gives a clearer picture of the bones that are affected by the disease. This helps the doctor figure out how severe your condition is.

, Another way doctors can diagnose Paget’s disease of bone is through blood tests. The blood may be taken for a different reason, but the doctor notices the abnormal blood levels. Elevated levels of serum alkaline phosphatase is an indicator that you may have Paget’s disease."

Sleep in ergonomic positions.,
Sit in ways to support your back.,
Support your back by sitting at the correct height.,
Strengthen your core muscles to support your back.",How to Use Back Supports for Back Pain1," The average worker spends about 7.7 hours asleep each day.When you spend that much time laying down, you want to make sure you are supporting your back to minimize back pain. Your bed should support your back. Ways you can sleep are:


Sleep on your side — Sleep on your side with your legs slightly curled upwards toward your chest. Place a pillow between your knees; this will help support your legs and back while you sleep.Sleep on your back — Place a pillow under your knees, while lying on your back, to help maintain the natural curvature of your back and spine. This may help alleviate minor back pain.Sleep on your stomach — This position may be hard on your back. However, if you cannot sleep any other way, help support your back by placing a pillow under your pelvis or hips.;
, The Cleveland Clinic suggests that you should sit as little as possible to reduce stress on your back.However, if you have a job that you are required to sit all day, this might not be possible. Even so, you should get up and walk around for a few minutes every hour. In addition, there are a few actions you can take to help you sit in a more supportive way.


Use a rolled up towel and put it between your lower back and the chair. This will help support your lower back and force your back into a more natural position while you sit.
Sit with your legs and feet at a right angle (perpendicular to the floor). Try to avoid crossing your legs or feet. This can put stress on your back and lower your blood flow in your lower extremities.
If your chair is too high, use a footrest to help you achieve the perpendicular position of your legs.

, There are some ways you can use the tools around you to support your back. Think about how you might adjust your surroundings to help support your back during your daily routine.


Adjust your computer chair so that your monitor is at eye level when you are sitting in a healthy posture (no back rounding or slouching).
Remove items from your pockets when sitting down. Sitting on your wallet or keys is not comfortable for your back.
Adjust your car seat so that your elbows are 90% parallel to the floor when your hands are placed on the steering wheel., You can use exercise to teach your body how to create its own ""back brace,"" performing core exercises that stabilize the spine.There are several exercises you can perform that will help keep you core strong and your back braced for lifting.


Try cat curls. Start on your hands and knees. Round your spine, tightening your abdominal muscles and allowing your head to drop. Hold for five seconds, then return to neutral. Then arch your back slightly, lifting your head (but not throwing it back). Hold for five seconds, then return to neutral.To do a bridge, lie on your back with your knees bent, feet shoulder-width apart. Your arms should be at your side, you back in a neutral position. Tighten your abs and push yourself up from the floor, lifting your hips and butt until your knees, hips, and shoulders are all in line. Hold for five seconds, then slowly release."

Learn to lift properly.,
Brace your back with lumbar support.,
Use “Back Belts” with caution.,
Check your employee handbook.,
Be patient with your back support.",How to Use Back Supports for Back Pain2," A back brace is of little use if worn without using proper body mechanics. You should learn to squat while lifting, mainly using the force of your legs and thighs to lift the object, rather than your back.


Before lifting, assess the object to see if you should ask for help with lifting. Do not try to lift something that is likely too heavy for you.
Bend at the knees and squat, getting as close to the object as possible. Tighten your stomach muscles and hug the object close to your upper body. Lift with the force of your thigh muscles. Do an opposite motion when you lay the object back down.

, Studies have shown that lower back pain was reduced in patients when wearing a lumbar-supporting brace than patients wearing a brace without this support.There are numerous braces out there designed for both daily routines and lifting. Make sure you purchase one that advertises lumbar support.

, The CDC and The National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health performed a study that reports that there is not a significant amount of data that supports or disproves the benefits of a back belt.


The study suggests that these belts are becoming more popular in the workplace, but cautions workers that wear them. There is no scientific findings that support that they are actually beneficial to lifting., Back belts may be covered by the company. Despite the CDC’s findings, studies by the UCLA School of Public Health and the Annals of Internal Medicine have reported that people suffering from back pain have alleviated symptoms and need to use less medication when they wear lumbar back braces during physical labor., Wear your back brace at any point that you may find yourself lifting. It may take a week or two to get used to, so it is a good idea to wear it more often than not at work. You may not notice that it is on after a while and get extra support out of it.

Consult your doctor.,
Follow your doctor’s instructions to the letter.,
Seek medical attention if you experience acute back pain for over three days.",How to Use Back Supports for Back Pain3," Ask your doctor what areas of your back would most benefit from a back support. Lifting back braces are made in small and large models. Some involve a tapered belt to allow you to twist, while others restrict twisting motions.

, Back or spine injuries can be very serious. Exacerbating a spine injury can lead to paralysis. To avoid this, always listen to your doctor’s instructions and follow his/her recommendations closely.


Take prescribed medication at its correct dose and time.
Full rest is not advisable. It's important to move within pain tolerance as much as you can.
Perform regular physical therapy exercises (if so prescribed).

, Rest while flat on your back, ice the affected area and take an anti-inflammatory while you recover. It is especially important to see a doctor, if you must return to a job that involves physical labor, to rule out non-muscular spinal problems."

Change the position of the goniometer.,
Test radial deviation.,
Check ulnar deviation.",How to Use Goniometer1," Hold the goniometer over the wrist joint, aligning the pin of the instrument with the joint along the thumb-side of the hand.


The subject should hold extend the arm out and hand out straight, keeping the wrist straight in the process.
Line up both goniometer arms so that they are closed and positioned straight over the side of the hand.;
, Instruct the subject to bend the wrist down while keeping the arm and fingers straight. Adjust the movable arm of the goniometer to match the new placement and direction of the hand.The pin and stationary arm of the goniometer should remain in their starting positions.
Read the rotation degrees on the center dial, checking just beneath the center line of the movable arm. This should be your measurement for flexion.

While the full range exists between 0 and 90 degrees, the average measurement is around 60 degrees.



, Instruct the subject to bend the wrist up while keeping the arm and fingers straight. Adjust the movable goniometer arm to match the new position of the hand.


As before, you should not move the pin and stationary arm of the goniometer.

Place the affected finger in an aluminum flexion finger splint.,
Curve the aluminum so that the finger is slightly bent.,
Leave in place for 2 weeks.,
Protect your finger.,
Remove the splint and test your finger's motion.",How to Treat Trigger Finger1," These finger splints use a stiff aluminum frame to hold the finger in place as it heals. Place the splint on the palm side of the finger with the foam against the skin. It should conform to the shape of your finger.


Aluminum flexion splints (or similar splints) can be purchased at nearly any pharmacy for relatively cheap.;
, Gently press the splint into a slightly curved shape that's comfortable for your finger. If it's too painful or difficult to to do this with the affected finger, don't be afraid to use your other hand.


When your splint is comfortably bent, secure it to your finger with the provided straps or metal arms. If none are provided, use medical tape.

, The nodule should begin to regress with enforced lack of movement. Over time, you should experience a reduction in pain and inflammation and the return of your full range of motion.


You may want to take your splint off to bathe and clean yourself. However, when you do so, try to avoid flexing your finger or doing anything else that may aggravate your condition.

, With rest, most cases of trigger finger will self-resolve. However, this requires patience and care to ensure the finger isn't disturbed while it's in the splint. Avoid strenuous physical activities that require the use of your hands, especially sports like basketball, football, and baseball where you may have to catch a fast-moving object. If possible, also avoid using your splinted finger to lift heavy objects or support your weight.

, After a few weeks, take your finger out of its splint and try flexing it. You should be able to move your finger with less pain and difficulty. If your condition is better but you still experience some pain, you may want to wear the splint for a little longer or see a doctor for other options. If your condition doesn't seem any better or seems to have worsened, you should definitely make a doctor appointment.

Use over-the-counter NSAIDs.,
Receive a cortisone injection.,
Consider surgery for especially bad cases.",How to Treat Trigger Finger2," Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) are common, easily-available drugs sold without a prescription. These drugs, including the well-known painkillers ibuprofen and naproxen sodium, ease mild pain as well as reducing inflammation and swelling. For an inflammatory condition like trigger finger, NSAIDs are a perfect ""first line of defense"", providing quick relief from pain and reducing troublesome symptoms.


However, NSAIDs are relatively mild drugs and won't help especially bad cases of trigger finger. Simply increasing the dosage of NSAIDs is ill-advised, as NSAID overdose can damage the liverand kidneys. If your trigger finger is persistent, don't rely on this treatment as a permanent fix.
Long-term use of NSAIDs can also put you at risk for ulcers. Talk to your doctor before using them if you have a history of stomach ulcers., Cortisone is a natural hormone released by the body belonging to a class of molecules called steroids (note: these are not the same as the steroids that are sometimes used as illegal athletic aids). Cortisone has potent anti-inflammatory properties, making it useful for treating trigger finger and other inflammatory disorders. Talk to your doctor about a cortisone injection if your trigger finger won't subside with rest and over-the-counter medication.


Cortisone is given in the form of an injection directly into the affected area - in this case, the tendon sheath. Though this can be done in the doctor's office in a matter of minutes, you may need to return for a second injection if the first provides only partial relief.Finally, cortisone injections aren't as effective for people who have certain medical conditions (like diabetes)., If your trigger finger still persists after lengthy rest, NSAID treatment, and multiple cortisone injections, surgery may be necessary. The surgical procedure that fixes trigger finger involves cutting the tendon sheath. When the sheath heals, it's looser and better-able to accommodate the nodule on the tendon.


This surgery is usually done on an outpatient basis - in other words, you won't need to spend the night at the hospital.
Usually, local, rather than general anesthesia is used for this surgery. This means that your hand will be numbed so that you don't feel any pain, but you'll stay awake.

Start with back extensions.,
Do some spinal rotations.,
Add some pelvic isolations while sitting.,
Perform a bridge-like exercise.,
Do a lower back stretch.,
Switch positions and lay on your stomach.,
Try a ""lat"" stretch.,
See a physiotherapist.,
Schedule an appointment with a chiropractor or osteopath.,
Talk with your doctor.",How to Use an Exercise Ball to Help with Lower Back Pain," Doing back extensions while leaning face-down on an exercise ball targets the thick paraspinal muscles of your low back while simultaneously giving a little stretch to your abdominal muscles in the front of your torso. In a way, it's like doing a ""reverse sit-up."" Weak and strained paraspinal muscles are a common cause of low back pain, so strengthening them on an exercise ball makes sense.Do 3 sets of 10 repetitions with 1 minute rest in between, assuming that you don't feel sharp pain when you extend your spine — if you do feel pain, then see a healthcare professional first.


Lay with your stomach on the exercise ball with your legs outstretched, using your feet/toes for stability (wearing rubber-soled shoes is a good idea). You can also try placing your feet along the bottom of a wall.
Then place your hands behind your head and slowly lift your upper abdominals and chest off the ball, arching your back in the process. Try to focus on contracting the muscles of your low back. Hold for a few seconds while in an extended position and then slowly lower your torso back down to the ball.
Try squeezing your shoulder blades together to engage your upper back muscles.;
, Rotating your spine from side-to-side works out not only the paraspinal muscles right next to your spine, but also other core muscle groups such as the lateral obliques, abdominals and muscles of the pelvis. Having a strong core that works in harmony dramatically reduces the risk of back injuries and pain.If you feel sharp pain when rotating from side-to-side, then see a healthcare professional (such as a chiropractor or osteopath) first because there may be an issue in your spinal joints. Making sure your core muscle groups are relatively strong before you start rotating is a good strategy to reduce the risk of back pain. Spine rotations are another great exercise for strengthening the lower back and preventing pain, because they also simultaneously stretch the muscles of the back and core. You can repeat the exercise five times on each side, two to three times per day.


While sitting upright on the exercise ball, raise your arms above your head (or you can place your hands on your hips), making sure that your feet are firmly on the floor for stabilization.
Then, with your feet planted, rotate as far as you can in one direction (as if you're shoulder checking), holding for a few seconds at the end of the range. Contract the muscles in your core while you hold. Then slowly rotate back to the neutral position for a second before rotating in the opposite direction. Aim for about 10 rotations in both directions on a daily basis.
The low back, or lumbar region, is more susceptible to injury and pain because it supports the weight of the upper body.

, Low back pain is sometimes caused by weak muscles in surrounding areas which forces the low back to over-compensate or overwork, resulting in injury. Your pelvic muscles are part of your core group and sometimes weakness there is responsible for low back pain.As such, strengthening your pelvic muscles is a good strategy to deal with (or help prevent) low back issues.


With your arms by your sides or on your hips, sit on the exercise ball with your feet planted firmly on the floor. Then, gently tilt your pelvis, pulling the stomach muscles in and moving the hips forwards and upward, as if moving your hip points upward, in order to flatten the small of the back. Hold for a few seconds and then return to the starting position.
Next, slightly arch your low back, pulling the hips backwards. Hold this position for a few seconds, then return to the starting position. This exercise can be done back and forth 10 times continuously on a daily basis.
Alternatively, while in the same position, do slow circular rotations in one direction (clockwise) for a few minutes, then switch to the opposite direction (counterclockwise). This movement is very similar to keeping a hula hoop rotating around your hips.

, Using an exercise ball to form a ""bridge"" with your body is excellent for building strength in virtually all core muscle groups, including the low back, pelvis, and abdominals.Keep in mind that any exercise that utilizes the abdominal and back muscles in coordinated fashion is a good core exercise. Bridge-like exercises can be done on the floor without an exercise ball, but using one creates more instability (movement) that forces your muscles to automatically compensate for in order to maintain balance. In short, using an exercise ball makes the exercise more challenging.


Lie down on your back with your legs straight. Lift your legs and rest your calf muscles on top of the exercise ball. Keep your arms by your side with the palms of your hands flat on the floor.
Then, place the bottom of your feet on the ball and push your butt/pelvis off the floor. The key is to keep your torso and spine as straight as you can (which looks like a bridge). Hold the position for 10–30 seconds, then return to the relaxed position for a few seconds before repeating. Repeat the exercise five to ten times on a daily basis.
For a more advance version, put one foot flat on the ball while straightening your other leg about six to 10 inches in the air. Keep your leg straight as you lift your butt off the ground, hold for 10–30 seconds then lower and repeat with the opposite leg.

, Using an exercise ball for stretching muscles and mobilizing the spine is effective, fairly safe, and even fun. The stability ball effectively stretches the lower back by providing a broader stretching area and greater freedom of movement. Laying with your back extended over an exercise ball doesn't really stretch the low back muscles (although laying over it on your stomach does), but it does traction or stretch your spine, which can also help to alleviate lower back pain. On the other hand, extending your back over the ball does stretch your abdominals and some pelvic muscles.


Start by sitting on the exercise ball and then walk your feet to maneuver yourself such that the ball is under your lower back area. Let your arms fall away to your sides and slowly start to extend your back and head over the ball, using your feet for stability.
Go as far as you can go without pain and see if you can touch the floor with your outstretched arms, which provides a good stretch for your upper back, chest, and shoulders. Hold this position for 30 seconds and aim for five to 10 times on a daily basis. Remember to breathe in and out deeply while stretching.
As an alternative to the exercise ball, a great activity that stretches the back and other core muscles is yoga. The challenging body poses of yoga also act to strengthen your core and leg muscles and improve your overall posture.

, Switching positions on the exercise ball and laying on your stomach will tend to stretch your low back and mid-back muscles better. To get the best back stretch, you may want to switch to a bigger ball so that you have more height to let your body bend over without bumping into the floor.


Start by positioning your chest and stomach on top of the ball, using your feet for stability and guidance. Once balanced on top of the ball, extend your arms above your head and try to touch the floor. At the same time, extend your legs and allow your torso to sort of wrap over the ball.
Go as far as you can go without pain and hold this position for 30 seconds. Aim to do this five to 10 times on a daily basis. Remember to breathe in and out deeply while stretching.

, The latissimus dorsi (or lat, for short) is one of the largest muscles in the body. It spans the entire upper back (including a portion of the upper arms) and extends down to the lower back.This muscle is certainly a contributor to back pain and should be addressed during your ball exercise routine


Kneel on a mat with the exercise ball in front of you. Place your palms on top of the ball and move the ball as far away from your body as you can by leaning forward with your hips and “walking” it away with your hands.
Stop when you feel a stretch near the armpits and sides of the torso. The lower back will also be stretched in this position. Bring your chest down to the floor as far as the stretch allows you to. Hold for 30–60 seconds and aim for five to 10 repetitions daily.

, If your low back problem is recurring (chronic) and caused by weak spinal muscles, poor posture or degenerative conditions such as osteoarthritis, then you should consider seeking professional help for figuring out a rehabilitation program. A physiotherapist can show you specific and tailored stretches and strengthening exercises (utilizing an exercise ball) for your back issue.Most physiotherapists offices have a wide variety of exercise balls to choose from and other equipment that can help you get over you lower back pain.


Physiotherapy is usually required two to three per week for four to eight weeks to positively impact chronic back problems.
If need be, a physiotherapist can treat your sore back muscles with electrotherapy such as therapeutic ultrasound or electronic muscle stimulation.

, Chiropractors and osteopaths are spinal specialists who focus on establishing normal motion and function of the small spinal joints that connect the vertebrae, called spinal facet joints. Treating the joints of your low back may be necessary before you start to use an exercise ball at home. Manual joint manipulation, also called an adjustment, can be used to unjam or reposition low back joints that are slightly misaligned, which triggers inflammation and sharp pain — particularly with movement.


Although a single spinal adjustment can sometimes completely relieve your back pain, more than likely it will take three to five treatments to notice significant results. Keep in mind that your health insurance may not cover chiropractic care.
Many chiropractors use exercise balls in their offices for spinal strengthening and rehabilitation purposes, so they can often be a good source of information and advice on how to use them safely and effectively for your specific back issue.

, If working out on an exercise ball for many weeks is not effective for alleviating your lower back pain, then make an appointment with your family physician in order to consider any potentially serious spinal issues such as a herniated disc, nerve entrapment, infection (osteomyelitis), osteoporosis, stress fracture, arthritis or cancer.These are not common causes of low back pain, but mechanical causes (such as sprains, strains and slightly jammed joints) usually get resolved within a few weeks or so.


In about 1/3 of people who experience low-back pain, the pain lasts for more than 30 days if they don't do anything about it (exercises, stretches, treatments).
X-rays, bone scans, MRI, CT scan and nerve conductance studies are tools that your doctor may use to help diagnose your lower back pain.
Your doctor may also send you for a blood test to rule out arthritis or a spinal infection such as meningitis.
Your doctor may refer you to medical specialists such as an orthopedist, neurologist or rheumatologist in order to better figure out your back condition.

Upgrade your current travel neck pillow.,
Choose your seat early for the best space.,
Inflate your pillow.,
Recline your seat.,
Flip your neck pillow.,
Direct pillow stuffing for extra comfort.,
Lie back on your pillow.",How to Use a Neck Pillow1," Gone are the days of minimally comfortable, plastic blow up travel neck pillows. You can now get very comfortable travel neck pillows that can help you sleep in even the most crowded spaces. Take the opportunity to upgrade your current neck pillow to a cushy version that can enhance your travel experience.Consider your specific needs. Do you have neck or back pain? An option that holds your head upright may be best for you. Do you want to be able to move around and not disrupt your fellow passengers? Consider a traditional donut-shaped pillow filled with gel.
Make sure to explore your different options. Getting suggestions from fellow travelers or reading product reviews may give you more insight into specific models.
Think about the pillow’s portability. If you like to travel light or without any awkwardly shaped items that you have to strap to your suitcase, look at the weight and size of each pillow option.;
, Seat location can make a big difference in how comfortable you are—and how you can best use your upgraded pillow. If you are able, choose your seat as soon as you can so that you’re not locked out of a prime spot for sleeping.Select or request a window seat if you can. You may even want to consider paying a bit extra for a window seat to increase your comfort. Window seats have a couple of benefits: they give something on which you can lean and help you avoid people crawling over you to get to the bathroom or for a walk. You can also control the window shade, which may help you sleep better.
Sit near the front of the place if possible. There is generally more noise at the back of the plane because of the place of the engines. However, you may be more likely to get a full row or two seats to yourself towards the back of the plane. This could make up for the extra noise. Ask an attendant at check-in what’s available and change seats to better options if you can.
Avoid bulkheads and exit rows. Although you’ll have extra legroom, you may not be able to recline the seats or move the armrest.

, Depending on what option you purchased, you probably need to blow up your neck pillow. Getting the right amount of air into the pillow can promote your ability to sleep as well as your comfort.Take your pillow of its case and look for the inflation valve. Start to either pump or blow air into the pillow until it is full. Lay back on the pillow to see if it is comfortable.
Open the valve and slowly let out air until it reaches a level with which you’re comfortable. If you want a firmer pillow, add more air.

, Sitting up straight can cause back pain and many people find it difficult to fall asleep in this position. Reclining your seat as far back as you are able will take pressure off of your lower back. It may also contribute to more optimal use of your neck pillow.Be considerate of the person sitting behind you. For example, if you are on a plane and it’s mealtime, only recline your seat a bit or wait until the meal is over. You can always adjust your seat as the situation allows.

, Some may find sleeping with a bulge behind their heads slightly uncomfortable. Your head may also keep falling forward. In either case, think about flipping your neck pillow in the opposite direction to protect your head while keeping your neck aligned., Many neck pillows have some type of stuffing such as beads or gel. Move the stuffing over to your most preferred side of the pillow for added comfort. Tie off the end with a hair tie or another item that will keep the stuffing from shifting., Once you’ve got your seat reclined, it’s time to put your pillow to use. Lie back and close your eyes. If you feel uncomfortable, make adjustments to the pillow’s air until you are able to lie back and relax.Try wedging your pillow in the small space between seats or up against the window.

Place two fingers under your chin and press gently, applying a little resistance, while opening your mouth. Perform this exercise six times per session, six sessions per day.Never persevere through any exercise that is painful or uncomfortable, especially when applying resistance. If your pain is acute, seek advice from your dentist or doctor.;
, Open your mouth, and place two fingers under your bottom lip. Press gently, applying a little downward resistance, while closing your mouth. This will help strengthen your jaw muscles to ease your TMD. Perform this exercise six times per session, six sessions per day., With good posture, pull your chin straight back towards your chest, as if trying to make a double chin. Hold this chin tucked position for three seconds. This helps build the muscles surrounding your TMJ, taking some pressure off the joint. Repeat this exercise 10 times per day."

Slide your neck onto the pillow.,
Check your alignment.,
Be careful if you are a stomach sleeper.,
Give yourself time to settle.,
Start with the lobes facing downward.,
Turn over the pillow.",How to Use a Neck Pillow2," When you’re ready to lie down in bed, place your neck in or on your neck pillow. Do this in the spot you want to sleep so that you don’t have to move out of the proper position, which may increase your risk of neck pain.


Make sure that the back of your shoulder(s) and your head are touching the surface on which you’re lying., Once you’ve put your head down on the neck pillow, it’s important to see if you are in the proper alignment. This can ensure that you protect your neck and get the most comfortable night’s sleep possible.Make sure your neck pillow is supporting you without your head tilting forward or backward if you are a back sleeper.
See if your neck is supported and your nose in line with the center of your body if you are a side sleeper.
Keep in mind that both of these will work if you are a combination sleeper.

, Neck pillows are designed for back, side, and combination sleepers.Most professionals don’t recommend sleeping on your stomach because it not only can cause neck pain but also strain your lower back., It takes your neck about 10 to 15 minutes to relax and settle onto your pillow. Before your start thrashing around because you’re uncomfortable, stay in one position to see if that’s best for you. If not, move into a different position until you find one in which your neck can relax.Remember to give yourself one week of sleeping on a neck pillow to figure out if it is the right one for you. If the pillow still isn’t comfortable after a week, consider returning it and/ or getting another option.

, Most neck pillows have lobes to help keep your neck properly aligned during the night. If you’re new to sleeping with a neck pillow, you may find it difficult to sleep on the side with the lobes. For the first few weeks, consider sleeping with the lobes facing downward to help your head and neck adapt to the need sleeping position.Recognize it may take a bit of trial and error to see where on the pillow is most comfortable with the lobes facing downward. Go with whatever provides the most support and is the most comfortable.

, After 1-3 weeks of sleeping with the lobes facing downward, turn over the pillow to the lobed side.This allows the pillow to return to its natural shape and can ensure that you get continued excellent neck support.


Consider turning over your any pillow you have every few weeks.

Talk to a medical professional.,
Figure out your dominant sleeping position.,
Look for the right firmness and height.,
Take into account the pillow material.,
Consider other factors.,
Try out different pillows.,
Make your final selection.",How to Use a Neck Pillow3," If you have chronic neck pain and are seeing a medical professional about it, ask what type of neck pillow is optimal for your specific needs. This can help you narrow down the list of potential choices.Make sure to give your doctor any potentially relevant information about the way you sleep such as position, snoring or sleep apnea, or even if you sweat a lot. Your doctor may know of specific brands that can accommodate all of your needs.
Ask for a couple of different suggestions from your doctor in case you don’t like one of the pillows. Let your doctor know if you are using the pillow for your bed or for travel, which may influence his or her suggestions.

, Your dominant sleeping position is the position into which you settle and is likely your favorite way to sleep. Establishing your dominant sleeping position can help you determine the best type of pillow to get you comfortably through the night or a long flight.The following are the types of sleeping position you may be:


Side sleeper, which is the most common sleeping position
Back sleeper, which is often associated with snoring and sleep apnea
Stomach sleeper, which may cause your neck to twist more easilyCombination sleeper
Travelers, who often sleep upright, slightly reclined, or leaning onto something, Each dominant sleeping position has different needs in order to maintain alignment and comfort. When buying your pillow, make sure you look at models that are the appropriate firmness and height for your sleep position. The following options are best for each dominant sleeping position type:Side sleepers: a firm or extra firm pillow that is 10 centimeters (4 inches) high
Back sleepers: a medium-firm pillow that is a medium loft, which is the pillow’s height when it’s lying flat on the bed
Stomach sleepers: a thin and soft, scrunchable pillow
Combination sleepers: a pillow with softer and firmer sections that is higher on the sides and lower on the center for when you change positions
Travelers: pillows that provide maximum comfort for your specific needs and how you sleep. This includes neck support and ability to shift in your seat., Just as the firmness and height are important to your neck pillow selection, the material can also make a difference. Materials like memory foam or down may be better for certain positions over others. Sleepers may want to consider the following materials for a more comfortable night’s sleep:Side sleepers: contoured memory foam or latex foam
Back sleepers: down alternative, memory foam, latex foam
Stomach sleepers: down, feathers, down alternative, polyester, or thin foam latex
Combination sleepers: buckwheat hulls and multiple-material pillows
Travelers: memory foam, gel, plush fabric, For as simple as sleeping seems, it can actually be slightly complex. Factors such as your mattress and size as well as how long you’re traveling can also have an impact on your pillow choice. In turn, this may affect the type of neck pillow you use.Think about how soft your mattress is. If it is on the softer side, it may cause your body to settle more in relation to your pillow. This means you should get a lower loft, or height, pillow.
Consider your body temperature. Do you get very hot at night? If so, you may want to consider a gel foam cooling pillow or a buckwheat hull version.
Keep your body frame in mind. If you have a smaller frame, see if you can get a smaller neck pillow to fit your body.Think about how you normally sleep when you travel. Do you shift positions frequently and need a little bit more space? You may want a larger travel pillow that allows you to fully relax in your space.

Keep your teeth slightly apart as often as you can.,
Open and close your jaw.,
Try “goldfish exercises.” While goldfish aren’t stretching their jaws when they mouth, so-called goldfish exercises can release tightness in your TMJ.,
Try chin tucks.,
Breathe to release tension.",How to Treat Temporomandibular Joint Disorder (TMD) with Jaw Exercises2," This will relieve the pressure on your jaw. Put your tongue between your teeth to control clenching or grinding during the day. As you go off to sleep try to consciously relax your jaw and don't clench your teeth shut. Ask your dentist about wearing a mouth guard as well., Hold your tongue on the roof of your mouth as you slowly open and close your jaw. Relaxing the jaw will release tension and is a necessary part of any routine that also involves strength training. Place your tongue on the roof of your mouth just behind your front teeth. Drop your jaw, allowing the muscles to relax. No need to hold this open position, simply repeat this exercise six times per session, six sessions a day., Place two fingers on your TMJ joint (you can localize it by where you feel the most discomfort at the hinge of your jaw near your ear.) Then, place one finger from your other hand on your chin. Drop your mouth open, while applying light pressure against the TMJ. Repeat this exercise six times per session, six sessions per day.Don’t apply resistance to your chin when you open your mouth. This exercise is to relax the jaw, not strengthen.

, You can also use chin tucks to relax your jaw. With your shoulders back and chest up, pull your chin back creating a “double chin” and hold for three seconds. Then, release and repeat 10 times., Stress can cause you to clench your jaw, which can in turn aggravate TMD. Practice breathing in slowly through your nose for five seconds, while releasing the tension in your jaw completely. When you breathe out, also for five seconds, try to relax your jaw even further, really concentrating on slackening each muscle you use to chew. You can perform this exercise as often as you like."

Place an item between your teeth to exercise your jaw with a forward motion.,
Place an item between your teeth to exercise your jaw side to side.,
Improve your posture.",How to Treat Temporomandibular Joint Disorder (TMD) with Jaw Exercises3," Place an item of 1/4-1/2 inch or 1/2-1 1/3 cm thickness, such as a tongue depressor or a chopstick, between your top and bottom teeth. Orient the object such that the length of it is sticking out in front of you, rather than out of the sides of your mouth. Now, shift your bottom jaw forward to try to point the object towards the ceiling. When you master one object comfortably, gradually increase the thickness to give you greater range of motion.Try to select an object that is made to go in the mouth, such as those indicated above. Other household objects may accidentally chip your teeth during the exercise, if you are not careful.
Perform this exercise as needed when you feel you need more mobility in your jaw, such as before a meal.

, Place your 1/4-1/2 inch or 1/2-1 1/3 cm item between your top and bottom teeth again, but this time, place it horizontally. Move your bottom teeth from side to side rather than up and down. This will help increase your lateral jaw mobility.Perform this exercise as needed in response to pain or when you feel you need more jaw mobility.

, Many people carry their heads slightly forward when they walk. This brings the spine out of alignment, aggravating TMD. Stand against a wall and tuck your chin, bringing your jaw to your chest, while pressing your shoulder blades together behind your back. This stretches the spine into a more neutral position that can alleviate TMD symptoms and increase jaw mobility."

Do arm circles.,
Try water exercises.,
Learn tai-chi.",How to Use Physical Therapy to Relieve Arthritis Symptoms1," These exercises are prescribed by physical therapists to help your joints go through their full range of motion. They also help relieve stiffness.Range of motion exercises typically involve rotating a certain joint all the way around several times to strengthen the joint.;
, Try holding one arm out to the side and begin rotating it forward in a circular motion. Start by doing large circles, and then transition to smaller circles. This will help improve mobility in your shoulder joints.You can also try rotating other joints – like your ankles and wrists.

, Consider beginning range of motion exercises in water, as the more weightless environment puts less initial strain on your body. You can practice reaching your arms forward in the water, rotating your wrist and finger joints, or even bending your elbows.Try arm circles while you are in the water. This will make these exercises even gentler on your body.

, You can also do tai-chi to improve range of motion and balance. The gentle, fluid motions are perfect exercises for joints with arthritis. And the low-impact nature of tai-chi is great for people of all ages.Try joining a tai-chi class at a local gym or physical therapy center. You can also try following along with a tai-chi video at home, if you feel comfortable learning the routines without the help of an instructor.

Purchase capsicum plasters.,
Cut plaster into pieces (optional).,
Apply plaster to skin.,
Use up to three times a day.,
Observe all warnings.",How to Use Cayenne for Back Pain1," “Capsicum plasters” are essentially patches that contain capsaicin. These patches can be purchased at most pharmacies or online. They are adhesive on one side, and are applied to the skin in order to relieve back pain. These plasters are often sold in packages of three., Capsicum plasters are sold in different sizes. Additionally, these plasters can be cut to the exact size you desire. Using sharp scissors, simply trim the patch into the size or shape you need., Remove the backing from your capsicum plaster, and apply the patch directly to your skin. You will likely feel some heat, and possibly even a burning sensation., You can leave the capsicum plaster in place for up to 8 hours, but you may also remove it as soon as you no longer feel it tingling. Capsicum plasters can be used up to three times per day. Discard the capsicum plaster after use.

, There are several important warnings to observe when using capsicum plasters. Carefully review all instructions and warnings contained with this product.Some warnings include:


Never apply patches to open wounds or irritated skin.
Avoid getting the medicine on contact lenses, dentures, and other items that can come into contact with sensitive areas of the body.
A mild burning sensation is expected. If this sensation becomes too much, remove the patch and wash the area with soap and water.
Seek medical attention immediately if you experience severe burning, swelling, or blistering of the skin.

Use cold therapy.,
Try heat therapy.,
Take it easy for a few days.,
Get regular exercise.,
Wear a neck or back brace.,
Use a support pillow.,
Change your lifestyle.",How to Treat Spondylosis1," Cold therapy reduces swelling by causing a decrease in the diameter of blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can also numb deep pain. Cold therapy can be applied using cold packs, bags of ice, cold rags, or bags of frozen vegetables or fruit.Do not use ice packs or other cold therapy methods on the area for more than 15 to 20 minutes at a time.
Always place a towel between the skin and the cold source.
Refrain from using topical pain relievers at the same time you are applying cold.
Do not use cold therapy if you have poor circulation.;
, Heat therapy increases the diameter of blood vessels (vasodilation), which increases circulation. It also reduces muscle spasms and alters the sensation of pain. Heat therapy can be applied using heat packs, heating pads, or hot water bottles, or soaking a washcloth in warm water and applying to affected area.You can also soak in a hot bath or shower.
Do not use heat therapy for more than 15 to 20 minutes.
Put a cloth between the skin and the heat source.
Do not use topical pain relievers at the same time you are applying heat.
Test the temperature to avoid burns. Avoid hot tubs or spas if you have high blood pressure or heart disease.

, Taking it easy and getting bed rest for a few days can be helpful in some cases of severe pain due to spondylosis; however, any bed rest should be restricted to no more than one to three days, because any longer may prolong recovery.Long-term bed rest also increases an individual’s risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), or a blood clot in the lower extremities. A DVT can lead to a pulmonary embolus (PE), or a blood clot in the lungs, which can be life-threatening.

, Regular exercise, even if modified during a painful episode of spondylosis, can help speed recovery. It is recommended to continue normal or near normal activities. Low-impact exercises, such as walking or swimming, are good choices. Yoga is a good form of exercise too. It’s been noted that individuals who walk daily are less likely to experience neck or low back pain.In addition to thirty minutes of cardio exercise three times a week, you should do core exercises, such as pelvic lifts. This helps strengthen the core to support the spine.
You should always talk to your physiotherapist before starting a new exercise. You and your physiotherapist can come up with an exercise routine that will be right for your specific condition.

, Temporary bracing may help relieve the pain of spondylosis. Make sure not to wear it any longer than one week. Bracing allows muscles to rest. Long-term bracing is discouraged since it can weaken muscles and lead to more pain in the neck or low back.You can obtain a soft neck brace from a pharmacy or doctor.

, Sleeping with a firm pillow below the neck or between the legs may help relieve the pain of spondylosis, especially if your pain is in the mid to lower back. Special pillows have been developed for the cervical spine or neck, which offer additional support that may help relieve pain. The pillow changes the direction of your spine, giving it added support and keeping it straighter while you rest.There are special pillows designed for this function, but if you cannot locate one of these pillows, simply use the fullest pillow on your bed.

, Lifestyle modification may be helpful for the spine at any age. Consider less strenuous work if your work entails an overabundance of bending or heavy lifting. If you are overweight or obese, losing weight can reduce stress on the spine. Quitting smoking can improve bone health, especially in the spine.You should also consider your posture. If you slouch while sitting or standing, put more effort into correcting your posture and keeping your back and neck straight.

Benefit from strengthening exercises.,
Use an exercise ball.,
Strengthen your muscles and joints by using weights.,
Use resistance bands.",How to Use Physical Therapy to Relieve Arthritis Symptoms2," Improving muscle strength actually increases bone density, an important element with arthritis and osteoporosis. Your physical therapist will teach you isometric exercises, which rely on keeping a muscle or group of muscles in a static, flexed position.Isotonic exercise works by using your body weight or small weights to help you build muscle mass.
When done properly these exercises add stability to your joints and decrease pain.

, Using an exercise ball can help strengthen your core, increase balance, and decrease pain. Just sitting on an exercise ball can improve core strength. You can also lie on the exercise ball on your stomach while alternating between lifting each leg.You can use different sized balls for different exercises.

, Try using free weights or a weight machine to improve your mobility and ease joint pain. Focus on lighter weights with more repetitions rather than adding on extra weight. This will help you avoid a flare up of your arthritis symptoms.Be careful not to overdo it when you are using the weights. You don’t want to push your body too hard.

, Resistance bands are pieces of rubber that you can use while exercising that help strengthen your muscles and joints. They work by adding additional resistance to the movements you are already doing.Try looping the resistance band around your foot and pulling it toward you with both arms.
Try positioning the resistance band around your elbow and flexing your arm up while holding the resistance band in the hand of the same arm.

Start doing low or medium intensity aerobic exercise.,
Start swimming.,
Try walking.",How to Use Physical Therapy to Relieve Arthritis Symptoms3," Most arthritis sufferers are recommended pool therapy. You can attend water aerobics classes, do water walking, or learn a water therapy routine with your physical therapist.This is a crucial element of physical therapy if you need to lose weight. It will increase endurance and improve daily function.

, In addition to other water aerobic routines, you can try some low-impact swimming. Take a few easy laps around the pool if you’re able to. This can really help minimize your symptoms of arthritis.

Try some slow breast strokes, or even just floating on your back for a few minutes at a time.

, Walking is a great way to remain active in your daily life. Take a nice stroll around your neighborhood, or find a track nearby that you can walk.

Make sure you don’t push yourself too hard or walk for longer than your body can handle.
You could also try bicycling as an alternative to walking. Both outdoor biking and riding an indoor stationary bike can help reduce your arthritis symptoms.

Continue with your physical therapy schedule.,
Learn proper body mechanics.",How to Use Physical Therapy to Relieve Arthritis Symptoms4," Make an appointment with your doctor to discuss exercise and physical therapy. PT is a treatment that is often prescribed by your doctor and covered by insurance. Discuss your current pain and mobility problems and create a general exercise plan.Choose a physical therapist that specializes in treating people with your type of arthritis.
You may find that a therapist is used to treating people with osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, or elderly or younger patients.
They may also specialize in a specific anatomical area, such as the knees or back.

, Go through an evaluation with your physical therapist before you get started with exercises or other therapies. The physical therapist will test muscle strength, mobility, pain, and body mechanics. Ask your physical therapist to write down a plan based on the results.Ask your physical therapist if weight loss would possibly ease your symptoms. If you are overweight and have arthritis in your ankles, knees, back and shoulders, then weight loss should be one of your primary physical therapy goals.

, Plan to visit the physical therapist twice per week for a few months. Regular meetings can help to relieve more symptoms of arthritis and mobility issues than occasional sessions.In many cases, patients need to increase their muscle mass, which can only be done with regular exercise.

, Before beginning to exercise, the therapist will make sure that you can get out of bed, get up from a chair, and walk without putting undue pressure on your joints. The therapist will teach you how to change your body mechanics, if you do not do things properly.Use aides as prescribed by your physical therapist. If you are unable to perform regular day-to-day motions without increasing the stress on your joints, you may be prescribed a cane, walker, sock gripper, shower stool, or other device. Use them as directed, and you may notice a gradual decrease in your pain.

Develop a weekly exercise plan.,
Use rest to treat active symptoms.,
Apply ice and heat.,
Build a physical therapy routine that you can do at home.",How to Use Physical Therapy to Relieve Arthritis Symptoms5," Muscles support the joints, and an unused muscle can lose three percent of its function in a day if it is not used. Create a weekly exercise routine that you can do from home, or at least unassisted.Stick to your exercise routine. The more consistent you are, the more it will help your arthritis symptoms.

, Learn how to treat arthritis properly at home. Your doctor has likely prescribed non-steroidal anti-inflammatories or other medicine; however, these do not directly treat arthritis flare ups. Use rest as your first line of defense against arthritis symptoms. Get to know your signs of fatigue. Lay flat on a bed or take a nap to reduce stress on your back or other joints.
You may have the option of braces to rest your joints as well.

, Ice should be used to treat inflammation and numb pain, as tolerated. It is especially effective if you have a new, acute injury. Moist heat should be used to treat muscle spasms. Take a hot shower or use a microwaveable ice pack for twenty minutes to treat symptoms.Remember that overuse of heat can increase inflammation.
Your physical therapist may use an ultrasound machine for heat therapy while you are in the office.

, Physical therapy will not end once you stop going to sessions; it is intended to change your lifestyle so that you can become more active. Create a weekly plan that is feasible within your current schedule.You may also need some adaptations in your home like a shower stool or shower bars. These can help you minimize the impact of your arthritis symptoms in your daily life.

Gather supplies.,
Infuse the oil.,
Wait and reheat.,
Strain the oil.,
Add your beeswax.,
Transfer to jar.",How to Use Cayenne for Back Pain3," If you prefer a more DIY approach, you can create a cayenne salve at home. The process is pretty simple, although it does take some time. To begin, you will need: 4 Tbs. ground cayenne pepper, 1/2 cup of oil (olive, coconut, grapeseed, jojoba, or a mix of these), cheesecloth, beeswax pellets, and a glass jar. You will also need a double boiler (or a glass/metal bowl in a pot of warm water on the stove). This recipe will make about 4 oz., Combine your carrier oil and cayenne pepper in the inside of your double boiler (or glass/metal bowl). Heat water in your double boiler (or pot on the stove) to boiling, then reduce heat to low. Insert the container with your oil-cayenne mixture into the warm water, and allow it to steep on low for one hour.This is referred to as a “warm bath.”

, Allow your mixture to cool. Wait a few hours and reheat your oil-cayenne mixture, following the same procedure as before. This ""double-infusion"" process will ensure a powerful oil., After your second infusion, you will want to strain out the cayenne. Simply drape cheesecloth over another bowl and pour your oil through.Your salve will work just as well with the cayenne left in, but it may feel gritty against your skin.

, Add the beeswax to your infused oil, and return it to the warm bath. Set your burner to low and stir until the beeswax is completely melted. You want the beeswax to melt slowly, so avoid turning the heat up too high., Transfer your salve to a glass jar, and allow it to cool completely. You will want to use a glass jar with a tight-fitting lid. Store your salve in a cool, dry place. It can be kept for up to one year.This mixture can be used just the same as store-bought capsicum cream.
As with any capsicum cream, wash your hands after application.
Try to give this product at least two week to see a noticeable reduction in back pain.

Try muscle relaxants.,
Talk to your doctor about a narcotic pain medicine.,
Ask about anti-seizure or antidepressant medications.,
Get an epidural steroid injection.,
Determine if you need surgery.,
Talk to your doctor about spinal decompression surgery.",How to Treat Spondylosis2," The pain and other symptoms of spondylosis, whether acute or chronic, can be treated with home methods. Generally, the pain caused by spondylosis frequently improves after a few days. One good way to treat the pain is to use over-the-counter pain relievers.Examples of OTC meds that help with this condition include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as aspirin (Bayer, Ecotrin), ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil), and naproxen (Aleve). Acetaminophen (Tylenol) is another medicine that may also be helpful as a pain reliever.
Acetaminophen is a safer option for individuals with a history of asthma, high blood pressure, liver disease, heart disease, or stomach ulcers.

, Topical pain relievers can complement or be used an alternative to oral pain relievers. They can be administered in multiple ways, such as in creams, foams, gels, roll-ons, sprays, and sticks. The most common ingredients found in this class of medication are:Counterirritants. Examples of counterirritants include camphor, menthol, and methyl salicylate (oil of wintergreen). They work by creating a cooling or burning sensation that distracts an individual’s mind away from the pain. Popular brands include Bengay, IcyHot, and Tiger Balm.
Capsaicin. Capsaicin is obtained from chili peppers and has been found to be very effective for topical pain relief. It causes a tingling or burning sensation upon the skin and may take several days before it actually relieves pain. Popular brands include Capzasin and Zostrix.
Salicylates. Salicylates give aspirin its pain relieving qualities. They may be absorbed into the skin for local pain relief. A popular brand of topical salicylate is Aspercreme.

, There are several varieties of prescription strength pain medications that your doctor may give you to treat the pain associated with this condition when non-prescription drugs are no longer sufficient. Your doctor may prescribe prescription-strength NSAIDs that will reduce any inflammation associated with spondylosis.Popular prescription NSAIDs include diclofenac (Voltaren), meloxicam (Mobic), nabumetone (Relafen), etodolac (Lodine), and oxaprozin (Daypro). Common side effects of NSAIDs may include dizziness, headache, nausea, diarrhea, and excess gas. Caution should be used if taking NSAIDs for longer than one week, as prolonged use increases the risk of stomach ulcers, kidney damage, and heart attacks., Muscle relaxants may be prescribed to treat muscle spasm associated with spondylosis. Popular muscle relaxants include carisoprodol (Soma), cyclobenzaprine (Flexeril), methocarbamol (Robaxin), and metaxalone (Skelaxin).Common side effects of muscle relaxants may include drowsiness, dizziness, dry mouth, and difficulty urinating.
The use of muscle relaxants should be restricted to short-term due to their high risk for dependence or addiction.

, Depending on your level of pain, your doctor may choose to prescribe a narcotic pain medicine. Commonly prescribed narcotic pain medications include codeine, hydrocodone, and oxycodone.


Common side effects of this class of medication may include drowsiness, constipation, dry mouth, and difficulty urinating.
Narcotic pain medications should not be mixed with alcohol or other medications containing acetaminophen (Tylenol), as the combination can greatly increase the risk of liver damage.
Use of narcotic pain medications should be curtailed to less than two weeks, because of the increased risks of tolerance, dependence, and addiction., Medications originally used to treat seizures, or epilepsy, have been found to be helpful in the treatment of chronic pain. Low doses of antidepressants have been used for years to treat chronic neck and back pain. Spondylosis can in a minority of cases lead to chronic neck or back pain.The most commonly prescribed anti-seizure medications used to treat chronic pain are gabapentin (Neurontin) and pregabalin (Lyrica). It remains unclear how these medications control pain. Drowsiness and weight gain are common side effects of gabapentin. Common side effects of pregabalin may include drowsiness, dizziness, dry mouth, and constipation.
Commonly prescribed tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) helpful in the treatment of chronic pain include amitriptyline (Elavil), imipramine (Tofranil), and nortriptyline (Pamelor). Duloxetine (Cymbalta) is a novel antidepressant used in the treatment of chronic pain. Both TCAs and duloxetine work by increasing levels of the brain neurotransmitters norepinephrine and serotonin, which are instrumental in blocking the transmission of pain signals in the brain. Common side effects of these antidepressants may include drowsiness, weight gain, dry mouth, constipation, and difficulty urinating.

, An epidural steroid injection (ESI) is a minimally invasive procedure that may be used to treat pain caused by spondylosis. The injection is a combination of a long-acting steroid (triamcinolone, betamethasone) and an anesthetic agent (lidocaine, bupivacaine). The medications are injected into the epidural space of the spine, which is the area between the protective covering of the spinal cord (dura) and the backbone (vertebra). The duration of pain relief from an ESI varies and can last weeks, months, and sometimes even years.It is recommended no more than three ESIs be performed in a 12-month period because exceeding this limit could weaken the spine.
Potential complications of ESIs include infection, bleeding, and nerve damage.
Types of physicians qualified to administer ESIs include physiatrists, anesthesiologists, radiologists, neurologists, and surgeons.

, The majority of patients suffering from spondylosis do not require spinal surgery. Nonsurgical treatment is successful in at least 75 percent of spondylosis cases, but in some instances, surgery does become a necessity. If you begin to experience neurologic deficits, like a loss of bowel or bladder control, surgery will likely be considered your best option. Loss of feeling or function in your arms, legs, feet, and fingers can be another sign of such deficits.Under these circumstances, a nerve is being pinched or your spinal is being compressed. The underlying damage to your nervous system could worsen if these conditions are not fixed.

, Spinal decompression surgery is a general term used to describe different surgical procedures that can relieve pressure on the spine. You will need to work with your doctor to determine the best technique for your circumstances.During a laminectomy, bony arches of the spinal canal called lamina are removed, thereby increasing the size of the spinal canal.
During a laminoplasty, the lamina are left in place but cut free along one side of your spinal cord.
A discectomy is a technique that removes a portion of an intervertebral disc that has previously put pressure on a nerve root or on the spinal canal.
With both the foraminotomy and the foraminectomy, the openings where the nerve roots exit the spinal canal are enlarged by the removal of tissue.
You may undergo osteophyte removal, during which bone spurs are physically removed from areas in which they cause pinched nerves.
During a corpectomy, a surgeon will remove an entire vertebral body and its discs.

Undergo physical therapy.,
Try spinal manipulation.,
Consider acupuncture.",How to Treat Spondylosis3," Physical therapy (PT) may be prescribed by a physician for long-standing neck and back pain secondary to spondylosis. PT may combine passive treatments, such as ice and heat, ultrasound, and electrical stimulation, with therapeutic exercises to stretch and strengthen neck, abdominal, and back muscles.Physical therapy is usually prescribed for chronic pain that has lasted for several weeks without responding to other treatments.
Massage therapy may also be introduced into your physical therapy routine. A professional massage therapist will work on the muscles in your back to soothe and relax them after you have exerted them.
The goal of PT is to prevent recurring pain.

, Spinal manipulation performed by a chiropractor may also help relieve the pain of spondylosis, especially with the first month of pain. It works by realigning vertebrae, which have been misaligned due to weakness in the spine brought on by spondylosis. Overall, it is a safe procedure.The most common side effects are generally minor and include fatigue and temporary muscle soreness. Extremely rare complications of spinal manipulation may include weakness, loss of feeling in legs or arms, and bowel or bladder problems.

, Acupuncture is a popular treatment for long-standing neck and back pain. Acupuncture for spondylosis involves inserting very thin needles, about the size of a human hair, into the neck or back. The needles can be twirled, electrically stimulated, or warmed to augment the results of treatment.It is thought that acupuncture balances the chi of the body, which flows in meridians. An alternative explanation may be that acupuncture causes the release of chemicals that reduce pain and inflammation.

Avoid extended bed rest.,
Go for ice instead of heat.,
Walk briskly for two to three miles per day.,
Perform bridge stretches to strengthen the joint.,
Take anti-inflammatory medication.",How to Treat Sacroiliac Joint Dysfunction1," Low-impact exercises eventually play a major part in treating SI dysfunction. These exercises include walking or cycling.However, you should avoid high-impact, strenuous activity, like sprinting, contact sports, and weight training. If you’re an athlete, you’ll have to avoid your sport until your inflammation and misalignment have been corrected., While you don’t want to use motions that aggravate your pain, staying in bed will worsen SI dysfunction. The condition involves joint misalignment and imbalanced muscle use. Ligament and muscle atrophy that results from extended bed rest will push your joint further out of alignment., Heat expands ligaments, which can cause your joint’s structure to fall further out of alignment. Instead, ice the affected area to reduce inflammation and relieve intense pain. Apply an ice pack or compress for 15 to 20 minutes, and wait another 15 to 20 minutes before reapplying.You should continue icing in 15 to 20 minute intervals whenever you’re feeling acute pain for up to two weeks.

, A daily walk will help stretch and strengthen your SI ligaments. This in turn will help restore your joint’s proper structure.Choose soft surfaces, like a grassy park, for your walks, and try to avoid hilly or rocky terrain.


Consult your doctor or a spine specialist if you are unable to walk or perform other low-impact strengthening exercises.

, Lay flat on your back on a yoga or exercise mat with your legs bent. Your heels should be about two feet from your buttocks. Slowly lift your hips off the ground as you clench your buttocks and place weight on your feet. Hold the pose for five breaths, then bring your hips back to the ground. Repeat the sequence 10 times.

, Over the counter anti-inflammatories can help treat pain and, more importantly, reduce the muscle swelling involved in SI dysfunction. It’s best to take any medication in consultation your primary doctor or spine specialist.Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) such as aspirin or ibuprofen will reduce both pain and stiffness. Always talk to your doctor before starting a new medication on your own.
Your doctor might recommend an anti-inflammatory, even if you’re not experiencing pain. You should take the medication as long as they recommend, as stopping prematurely could interfere with their treatment plan.

High-fructose corn syrup
Certain medications



, If you suspect that you're dealing with the redness, swelling, and pain of a gout attack, talk with your doctor about following a regimen when an attack of gout disables you. Your doctor will have a list of activities that you can follow and medications that you can take in

, This should reduce the pain and inflammation of the joints.

, NSAIDs stand for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and they refer to common household and prescription items such as ibuprofen, naxopren, or indomethacin.


Although aspirin is an NSAID, it's best not to take aspirin for an attack of gout because aspirin can make symptoms worse by changing uric acid levels quickly.

, Colchicine is a medicine in tablet form that blocks inflammation caused by uric acid crystals.Colchicine may also be beneficial in reducing the pain associated with gout for those patients who cannot take NSAIDs, although it can be taken in combination with NSAIDs. There is some evidence to suggest that taking colchicine may reduce the chances of future gout attacks., Corticosteroids for gout reduce many of the symptoms associated with gout, including pain, redness, and swelling.Corticosteroids should be used when:


You're dealing with gout in a single joint
You're dealing with a gout attack that does not respond to NSAIDs
Your medical history precludes you from taking colchicine or NSAIDS such as naxopren

, See your doctor about reducing your uric acid by taking certain medicines. These medicines may include:


Uricosuric agents. Uricosuric agents basically supercharge the kidneys, which in turn help remove excess uric acid.Uricosuric agents have adequate results for about 75% of patients.
Xanthine oxidase inhibitors. These types of medicines basically keep a chemical called xanthine oxidase from forming.Xanthine oxidase is instrumental in helping uric acid buildup.

, Exercise will help you to lose weight as well as help you deal with the pain that comes with arthritis. 30 minutes a day is all it takes to see improvement. Light walking, aerobic exercise, or strength training can help you deal with long-term care of gout.

, Alcohol, but especially beer, blocks the release of uric acid into your urine, causing it to get bottlenecked in your body. Beer, especially, contains a lot of purines, which are broken down into uric acid eventually.

, Some medication that you are currently taking may interfere with the medications you're using to treat gout, in addition to affecting the amount of uric acid your body produces. Talk to your doctor about any adverse pharmacological interactions you might be experiencing.

, Avoid joint injuries and repetitive movements that can aggravate afflicted joints. Walk or run on softer surfaces (artificial track or sand, for example) instead of concrete.

, Foods that are at high-risk to worsening your gout contain purines. Purines raise uric acid levels in your body, causing the painful joint inflammation. Foods that are especially high in purines include:


Animal organs such as liver, kidney, sweetbreads, and brains
Meats, especially red meats, such as bacon, beef, lamb, and other gamey meats
Anchovies, sardines, scallops, mackerel and herring
Gravy
Beer

, Foods that should be consumed with caution and moderation include:


Seafood and fish (other than high-purine seafood)
Oatmeal

, The following foods can be eaten without worrying about their effect on your uric acid buildup:


Green, leafy vegetables
Fruits and fruit juices
Processed (non-whole grain) breads and cereals
Chocolate and cocoa
Butter, buttermilk, eggs, and cheese
Beverages like coffee, tea, and carbonated sodas
Nuts and assorted nut butters

, Foods that are low in purines don't necessarily help your gout. (Neither do they hurt.) The following foods may actually help you on your quest to stay symptom-free:


Nonfat or low-fat milk
Low-fat yogurt

Consider weight loss.Post-traumatic arthritis is normally caused by an injury (often a sports injury, or an injury at work), and it is exacerbated (or made worse) by continual weight bearing and stress and strain on the joint.,
Choose lower-impact sports and activities.Particularly if the injury that first led to your arthritis was sports-related, you may want to consider avoiding this sport, or reducing our involvement in it, to prevent further injury to the same joint or to other joints.,
Ask for modified duties at the workplace.,
See a physiotherapist.One way to reduce the pain in your joint from post-traumatic arthritis is to see a physiotherapist who can prescribe exercises for you to strengthen the muscles surrounding your injured joint.,
Modify your diet.Consuming more turmeric and ginger (both of which can be used as spices on your food) helps to combat inflammation and the pain from post-traumatic arthritis.,
Consult a naturopath.There are a variety of supplements that have been shown to help with osteoarthritis (the type of arthritis that most often develops post-traumatically).",How to Treat Post Traumatic Arthritis1," If you are overweight, weight loss is one of the key lifestyle modifications you can make to decrease the stress on your arthritic joint, and hence to reduce the pain.


Note that if you are not currently overweight, this strategy does not apply to you. It only applies if you are currently above your ideal body weight.
Speak to your doctor or to a nutritionist about a healthy weight loss plan for you, and ask him what your ideal body weight should be.
It is important to lose weight in a way that does not compromise your nutrition (such as extreme dieting), and in a way that is sustainable for you in the long term.;
, Sports that put you at a higher risk of injury and that can lead to arthritis include ones with a lot of pounding such as running, as well as skiing, snowboarding, basketball, hockey, and football, among others.


For many people, giving up a sport they love in order to prevent further injury can be a challenging decision. Many people who injure themselves in athletics are very passionate about the sport they play.
It is important to consider not only your short-term satisfaction of playing the sport, but also your long-term quality of life, which may be compromised if you continue to put undue stress on your injured and arthritic joint.
Think about whether there are any other lower-impact sports or activities you enjoy. Perhaps you can try swimming, riding a bicycle, or water running, as all of these activities are excellent for your cardiovascular health and fitness and also low-impact for your joints.

, If you have a physically demanding or strenuous job that stresses your injured joint, ask your boss if you can switch to alternative duties at work. Perhaps there is a desk job you can do, or another task that does not involve the same amount of physical stress and strain.


Consider getting a medical note from your doctor that explains to your boss the importance of not further stressing your injured and arthritic joint, particularly if the initial traumatic injury was sustained at work.
If you were injured on the job initially, look into the possibility of worker's compensation and/or employment insurance. You may receive coverage. If your injury is particularly severe, you may get disability pay without needing to return to work.

, Strengthening the surrounding muscles can help to reduce the impact and the load on the joint itself.


The exercises prescribed to you by your physiotherapist will depend upon the nature of your injury, and which joint specifically is affected.

, It is also recommended to consume more fish, which is rich in omega-3 fatty acids, and/or walnuts and flaxseed which also contain omega-3 fatty acids. Finally, consume plenty of organic fruits and vegetables; the antioxidants contained in these can help with post-traumatic arthritis.

, These include evening primrose oil, omega-3 fatty acids, chondroitin, and glucosamine sulphate. Speak to your naturopath if you are interested in trying natural supplements as a means to treat your post-traumatic arthritis.

Lift objects with your legs.,
Improve your posture.,
Use back-friendly sleeping postures.,
Avoid sit-ups, bending from the waist, and other harmful motions.,
Lose excess weight.",How to Treat Sacroiliac Joint Dysfunction2," Never bend over from your waist to pick up an object. Bend your knees and bring you buttocks over your heels. Stare straight ahead with your head up and bring the object as close to your chest as possible. Lift it using the movement of your legs as you straighten them back into a standing position., Whether you are standing or sitting, it is important that you have good posture with a straight, upright back. Try not to hunch, slouch, or bend forward.

When you stand, keep a straight line through your shoulders, hips, knees, and ankles.When you sit, avoid slumping back against the chair. Instead, maintain an upright, straight back.

, Avoid falling asleep in a curled up fetal position. Try to sleep on your back with one pillow under your neck and a larger pillow or set of pillows under your knees. You can also try sleeping on your side with a pillow between your legs.Improper sleeping postures are just as bad for your back as lifting improperly.

, Talk to a physical therapist about which movements you should avoid. Healthy movements will help strengthen your SI joint, but unhealthy motions will pull it further out of place.Some movements you should avoid include:


Any movement that brings your knees to your chest
Bending forward with your knees straight
Sit-ups
Seated twists
Seated forward folds with straight knees

, Maintain a balanced diet and consider shedding some weight to decrease the stress on your back and hips.Try using an app or other resource to calculate your body mass index (BMI) and create a personalized meal plan. For example, use the US Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Super Tracker tool: https://www.supertracker.usda.gov/.


Choose low-impact exercises like walking instead of more strenuous exercise, even if you’re trying to lose weight.

Ask your insurance provider about your coverage options.,
Get a referral from your primary care physician.,
Visit a physical therapist.,
See a chiropractor.,
Ask about an orthotic brace.,
Discuss further treatment options.",How to Treat Sacroiliac Joint Dysfunction3," Before seeking a referral to a spine specialist, you should consult your insurer to avoid unexpected costs.


Ask, “Does my policy cover specialist care, like a chiropractor or physical therapist? Can you provide me with a list of in-network specialists in my area?”
Be sure to ask if any specialist care or procedures require prior approval from your insurer. Ask, “Do I need to get prior approval to have my cortisone shot covered? What are your company’s procedures for getting prior approval?”
When you call your insurance provider, ask whomever you speak with for their name and position. Write down their information and save it in your records.

, If your pain is severe or does not respond to self-management techniques, first make an appointment with your primary doctor. You shouldn’t rely on them alone, since they likely don’t have specialized training in spinal care. However, they can provide you with a referral to a spine specialist, chiropractor, or physical therapist.

, A physical therapist can recommend exercises that may help your condition. They will teach you how to do the right exercises with good posture and proper movement. They will also warn you about which exercises and movements you should avoid., A chiropractor will manually reposition your misaligned SI joint. For best results, a series of adjustment appointments is typically recommended. Your chiropractor may also assist you with controlled physical exercises to strengthen your SI ligaments., A wide, belt-shaped orthotic brace is sometimes used to stabilize the SI joint. Using the brace while exercising or stretching will help keep the joint in correct adjustment while you strengthen the surrounding ligaments. This support is especially helpful if your work requires you to move in ways that might aggravate your joint pain., Most cases respond well to moderate rest, ice, proper exercise, and manual realignment. If, over several weeks or a few months, your SI dysfunction doesn’t respond to these, your doctor or spinal specialist might suggest a variety of other procedures. They’ll help you decide which option is best for your particular circumstances.Corticosteroid injections reduce inflammation and pain, but can only be administered a few times a year because they weaken joints and tendons.
An electrical stimulation implant can help reduce pain associated with SI dysfunction.
Surgery is rarely used to treat SI dysfunction, but in extreme cases a joint fusion procedure replaces the joint with metal hardware.  
Remember to call your insurer ahead of time to ask if any special procedures require their prior approval.

Opt for over-the-counter painkillers.One way to treat the pain associated with post-traumatic arthritis is to purchase over-the-counter painkillers from your local drugstore or pharmacy.,
Ask your doctor for a corticosteroid injection.Corticosteroids work to reduce pain locally (when they are injected into the affected joint) by diminishing inflammation and swelling in the area.,
Inquire about hyaluronic acid.Hyaluronic acid is a type of synthetic joint fluid (kind of like an artificial synovial fluid, which is the fluid that naturally lubricates your joints).,
Consider surgery as a last resort.When lifestyle modifications and medical treatments are no longer sufficient to help you manage your joint pain from post-traumatic arthritis, it is likely time to consider surgery.",How to Treat Post Traumatic Arthritis2," One option to try is Acetaminophen (Tylenol). Follow the dosing instructions on the bottle, which is normally 500–1000mg every four to six hours as needed.


Another option is an NSAID such as Ibuprofen (Advil). Again, follow the dosing instructions on the bottle, which is normally 400–600mg every four to six hours as needed, with a total dose for 24 hours to be no more than 4000 mg., Ask your doctor to try a corticosteroid injection and see if it helps you. The improvement in pain will normally last for a few months, at which point you may need another injection. Having a few corticosteroid injections is okay, especially if you are finding them helpful with pain relief; however, if you find them minimally helpful and if it requires several to make a difference, your doctor will likely recommend another mode of treatment.


There is a limit to the number of cortisone injections given in one area, and the side effects include atrophy of the tissue, discoloration and infection., Injecting hyaluronic acid into the joint affected by post-traumatic arthritis can help to alleviate the pain as well as to lubricate and smooth out the motion of your joint. Speak to your doctor if you are interested in receiving this treatment.

, Surgery is generally reserved as a last resort; however, in many cases, it can be very successful at alleviating your pain.

Have your joint surgically debrided and reconstructed.Surgical ""debridement"" refers to a ""cleaning out"" of the joint.,
Understand the risks of surgery.All surgery comes with certain risks, such as the risk of infection, the risk of causing further damage to the structures in your joint, and the risk of bleeding.,
Be aware of the expected recovery time.On average, surgical repair of a joint with post-traumatic arthritis leads to very good results.",How to Treat Post Traumatic Arthritis3," Your surgeon will remove any scar tissue and damaged areas, as well as any other debris found in your joint. She will then reconstruct or replace the worn out surfaces in your joint as needed.


Surgery on a joint can most often be done laparoscopically. What this means is that only a few small incisions will be made, and the surgeon will then use cameras inside your joint and small tools to clean the joint and to make repairs and replacements as needed.

, However, these complications are very rare, and the benefits of surgery tend to far exceed the risks.

, Most people experience a reduction in pain, and perhaps even complete resolution of their pain. However, it usually takes a few months to completely recover from surgery and to regain function in the affected joint. You will need to be persistent and dedicated throughout the recovery process.


There will be discomfort initially following surgery.
You can ask your physician about which pain medications to use to help control the post-surgical pain in the initial stages following the procedure.
Some people need to use crutches, a cane, a walker, or a sling temporarily while the affected joint heals.
You will likely be referred to a physiotherapist for a formal rehabilitation program following surgery on your injured joint.

Apply frozen cabbage leaves to the inflamed area.,
Take 3,000 milligrams of alfalfa daily to help treat gout and lower your uric acid level.

",How to Treat Gout With Natural Alternatives," Drink a glass of cherry juice or snack on a dozen fresh cherries. Blueberries, blackberries, raspberries and hawthorn berries also will relieve gout symptoms. The dark coloring in these fruits serves as an anti-inflammatory agent and counterbalances the uric acid.;
, Immerse the irritated area in lukewarm to hot water (about 95 degrees Fahrenheit or 35 degrees Celsius) for roughly 20 minutes. Add one-third to one-quarter cup of ground ginger. The water relaxes and eases the tender region, unleashes endorphins and induces sweating, which aids in eliminating superfluous uric acid.


Alternate hot and cold packs to reduce pain and improve your circulation.







,

Restore your body's energy flow and allow it to self-heal. The traditional Chinese practice known as acupuncture achieves this with needles.






Take advantage of acupressure, another ancient healing method. Acupressure applies pressure to pivotal points on your skin's surface, which energizes your body's own healing powers. Hands and feet do the work instead of needles.







, Vitamin C supplements also can lower your blood's uric acid levels. Too much of a good thing isn't always better so ask your doctor how much vitamin C is safe for you. Taking too much could actually be counterproductive.

, Refrain from eating fried and sugary foods and restrict the amount of beans, poultry, yeast, fish, nuts and red meat you eat. At the same time, increase your servings of green and starchy vegetables, corn, fruit, rice and dairy products and drink plenty of fluids that include purified water.

Eat more vegetables and fruit.,
Eat whole grains daily.,
Add some healthy spices to your food.,
Meet your daily protein requirements, but avoid excessive red meat consumption.,
Eat foods that are rich in omega-3 fatty acids.",How to Treat Arthritis Pain Through Diet1," A colorful diet is recommended because the carotenoids and flavonoids that give fruit and vegetables their color are powerful antioxidants that can help fight inflammation.


Try to consume roughly nine servings of fruits and vegetables each day.Vegetables you should include are: dried beans and peas, sweet potatoes, red cabbage, pumpkin, squash, carrots, and beets.
Fruits you should include are: blueberries, cherries, other colorful berries, watermelon, tomatoes, bananas, and oranges.;
, People who eat whole grains have lower levels of C-reactive proteins (CRP); these proteins indicate the amount of inflammation in your body.You should try to eat roughly three ounces of whole grains each day. Whole grain foods include:


Whole wheat bread
Oatmeal
Brown rice
Popcorn
Crackers
Wild rice
Tortillas
Whole grain pasta

, Certain spices contain properties that can help reduce the inflammation caused by arthritis.


These spices can include: Ginger extract (blocks COX-2, which is a chemical in your body that causes pain), garlic, turmeric, cinnamon and honey (Drink a mixture of hot water, ½ teaspoon of cinnamon powder and a tablespoon of honey every day before breakfast.))

, The recommended daily intake of protein is 50 grams, and a 3-ounce piece of meat has 21 grams of protein.Eating excessive amounts of meat may exacerbate symptoms of gouty arthritis by depositing urate crystals within your joints.Although meat is the main source of protein in a non-vegetarian diet, other good sources of protein are milk, cereals, eggs and yogurt.
You can, however, eat a 3-ounce serving of pasture-raised meat once or twice a week.

, Omega-3 fatty acids are a type of lipid essential to your well-being.Omega-3 fatty acids can reduce inflammation because the eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) in omega-3 fatty acids replaces arachidonic acid, which reduces your body’s production of arachidonic mediators, a source of inflammation.The American Heart Association recommends that you eat fish high in omega-3 fatty acids at least two times a week.Many canned and processed foods are artificially enriched with omega-3 fatty acids, so read the ingredients before using processed foods. You can find omega-3 fatty acids and oils in numerous food categories, including:

Seafood: sardines, salmon, halibut, herring, mackerel, oysters, trout, and tuna.
Fresh vegetables: brussels sprouts, kale, mint, parsley, spinach, and watercress.
Oils: canola oil, cod liver oil, flaxseed oil, mustard oil, soybean oil, and walnut oil.

Compare your affected knee with your other knee.,
Bend and straighten your leg.,
Test walking on your leg.,
See your doctor.",How to Treat a Swollen Knee1," Look for puffiness around the kneecap or around the sides of the knee. Comparing your two knees is a good way to check to see if there is swelling or redness and to see if is something wrong.


There might also be swelling at the back of your knee. This could signal a Baker’s cyst, which is when extra fluid is pushed into tissue behind your knee. It can cause swelling at the back of your knee which may worsen when you stand up.If your affected knee is redder and warmer to the touch than the other knee, see your doctor.;
, If you have discomfort when you move your leg, you may have some level of injury that needs to be treated. You may feel this discomfort as pain or stiffness. The stiffness will most likely be due to fluid in your knee., An injured leg may be painful to stand on. Try putting your weight on your leg and walking to see if your leg can handle load bearing exercise.

, While you may be able to diagnose swelling in your knee, you may not know the exact cause behind the swelling. It’s best to check with your doctor if the swelling is persistent, painful, or doesn’t go away in a couple of days.


Some possible conditions that cause knee swelling include: an injury such as a torn ligament or cartilage; irritation from exerting your knee too much; osteoporosis; rheumatoid arthritis; gout; infection; bursitis; or other conditions."

Meet daily calcium recommendations.,
Get enough vitamin D. Some people have difficulty absorbing calcium properly because of arthritis medications.,
Take dietary supplements.,
Supplement your diet with omega-3 fish oil.,
Drink plenty of water.,
Drink tea.",How to Treat Arthritis Pain Through Diet2," Calcium is important for bone and joint strength, both of which are particularly important to bear in mind when you are suffering from arthritis.


The recommended daily intake of calcium is generally 1000 milligrams for an average adult.Pregnant and lactating women need 1300 milligrams of calcium daily.Calcium-rich foods include: Fortified oatmeal, sardines, cheese, milk, yogurt, soybeans.

, Vitamin D is fat-soluble, which means that it helps the body absorb calcium.Vitamin D can be derived from exposure to the sun, eating a balanced diet, and taking supplements.
Vitamin D-rich foods include egg yolks and liver.

, People with arthritis often develop deficiencies in vitamins C, D, B6, B12, and E levels. They also often become deficient in folic acid, magnesium, zinc, selenium, and calcium levels.Increasing your intake of antioxidants by taking dietary supplements may decrease the damage your arthritis causes to your joint linings, thereby reducing swelling and pain.
Your physician should be able to tell you which supplements will best meet your particular needs.

, Arthritis is slowed and its severity is lessened when you add fish oil supplements to your diet.Try to consume at least two to three grams of omega-3 fish oil per day.You can purchase fish oil at your local pharmacy. If you don’t like taking a spoonful of the oil, you can also get fish oil supplements in capsule form.

, Staying hydrated can help keep your joints lubricated, which means that your pain will be reduced. Everyone needs a different amount of water, but average adult women generally need to drink around 2.2 liters (0.6 US gal) of water a day to stay hydrated.Adult men generally need to drink around 3 liters (0.8 US gal) of water a day to stay hydrated., Green, white and oolong teas are full of polyphenols, which are plant-derived compounds that boost your immune system and reduce inflammation.


A substance found in green tea (EGCG) might actually stop the progression of arthritis by blocking the Interleukin-1 cel, which is a pro-inflammatory cell with the ability to damage cartilage.You should try to drink two to four cups of tea each day.

Make an appointment with your doctor.,
Ask about surgery.,
Visit a physical therapist.,
Visit an orthopedist.",How to Treat a Swollen Knee2," Go to the doctor if there is significant swelling or if you can’t bear weight on the knee. You should also visit the doctor if there is any obvious deformity or if you have a fever and redness in your knee, which may indicate an infection. Also see the doctor if you don’t notice improvement after about 4 days. Your ligaments might be damaged.


Your doctor will evaluate your knee to determine what condition is causing the swelling. He may administer an imaging test such as an x-ray, ultrasound or MRI. These tests will detect bone, tendon or ligament injuries.
Another procedure that your doctor may try is an aspirate of the joint knee fluid to check for infection based upon the number of white cells and bacteria in the fluid.Your doctor may inject a steroid into your knee to try to reduce the swelling.
Finally, the doctor will take your temperature to make sure that you do not have an infection of the knee.

, Depending on the condition causing knee swelling, your doctor may recommend that you get surgery. Some of the most common types of knee surgery are:Arthrocentesis: Fluid is removed from your knee to relieve joint pressure.
Arthroscopy: Loose or damaged tissue is removed from around the knee.
Joint replacement: You can get a replacement knee joint if it becomes clear that your knee is not getting any better and your knee pain is intolerable.

, Your doctor may prescribe physical therapy. A physical therapist will examine your leg. He will also give you specific exercises, based on your condition, to strengthen the muscles around the knee joint.

, Foot problems like flat feet and other conditions may contribute to knee pain and swelling. Visit a foot specialist and ask this person to assess your feet. He might recommend that you wear orthotics, which are inserts that go inside your shoes.The orthopedist may need to assess your back and hip as well. Pain resulting from the back, hip, or feet is called referred pain.

Wear knee pads.,
Avoid knee bends and squatting.,
Refrain from high-impact exercise and sports.,
Eat foods with anti-inflammatory properties.,
Avoid smoking.",How to Treat a Swollen Knee3," If you spend a significant amount of time sitting on your knees, such as for landscaping or housework, wear cushioned knee pads.


If possible, take “micro breaks” of 10-20 seconds frequently. During these breaks, stand up and stretch your legs. Allow your legs to return to their resting position.

, Repetitive motions that use your knees should be avoided if you want to prevent swollen knees.

, Many sports, especially those that require a lot of jumping and running, can be damaging to your knees. Avoid skiing, snowboarding, running, football, baseball, and basketball until your knees have healed completely., Your diet can contribute to increased risk for swelling in your knees or elsewhere in your body. Try to stay away from processed, fried or sugary foods. Increase your intake of fruits, vegetables, proteins and whole grains.


Omega-3 fatty acids are high in anti-inflammatory properties. Eat more salmon and tuna to increase your omega-3 fatty acids.Flaxseed oil is also a good source of omega-3 fatty acids.
Try the Mediterranean diet. This diet is rich in lean protein such as fish and chicken. It also relies on lots of vegetables, olive oil, and beans.

, Smoking decreases the flow of oxygen and blood in your body. This in turn restricts the ability for tissue to repair itself."

Rest your knee.,
Ice your knee.,
Avoid heat for the first 48 hours.,
Use a compression bandage.,
Gently massage your knee.,
Alleviate pain with an over-the-counter pain reliever.",How to Treat a Swollen Knee4," Stay off your leg and do as little walking as possible.


Keep the knee elevated above your heart while lying down. Prop the knee and foot on pillows or on the arm of the couch.
Use crutches if it hurts to straighten the leg or to put weight on it.

, Apply ice directly on the swollen part of your knee for 10-20 minutes. Do this 3 times a day to reduce the swelling.You can also use a frozen cold pack or a bag of frozen vegetables like peas instead of ice.

, If you have sustained an injury that results in a swollen knee, avoid placing heat on your knee. This includes hot packs, hot showers, or hot tubs., Wrap your knee in an elastic bandage to apply compression. This will help decrease the swelling. Try an elastic bandage with a fastener that sticks to the bandage so that you don’t need clips.


You can purchase a compression bandage at a local pharmacy.
Be careful not to wrap your knee too tightly. If you feel any numbness, tingling, odd coloring, or increased pain, your bandage is wrapped too tightly.

, Massage at a very gentle rate may help increase blood flow to your knee. If it hurts, refrain from massaging this area., Try an anti-inflammatory drug such as aspirin, acetaminophen, naproxen or ibuprofen - all are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). When taking this type of pain reliever, be sure to carefully follow dosing instructions on the label.
You can also try a topical painkiller. Talk with your pharmacist for proper application. You can also try a patch that contains the analgesic lidocaine for pain relief.

Ask your doctor about radiofrequency treatment to find out if it is right for you. Your doctor will be able to refer you to a specialist in radiofrequency and pain relief.;
, To determine whether radiofrequency is an appropriate therapy, your doctor will first consider the source of your pain. It generally provides temporary relief for patients with chronic lower back and neck pain related to the degeneration of joints from arthritis., Prior to the procedure, your doctor will need to identify which nerves are causing you chronic pain and ensure that they do not control any major muscles in your back or neck. Your doctor will administer a nerve block to identify the nerves and make sure that the procedure is possible.An anesthetic is injected near the nerves that are connected to the joint that is causing pain. If this results in temporary pain relief, then the doctor is able to identify the joint causing the pain and can proceed with the procedure.
The nerve block is typically administered at an appointment prior to the actual procedure.

, Your doctor may provide you with some literature regarding what to expect on the day of the radiofrequency treatment. This literature will contain instructions regarding how to prepare for the treatment. For example, it may list what medications you should avoid on the day of the procedure. Some doctors, for instance, will ask patients to stop using any blood thinners prior to the procedure.

, On the day of the procedure, you should not eat or drink anything for at least 6 hours leading up to the treatment, discluding clear liquids, which you can drink up to 2 hours before the procedure., Bring all medications with you so you can take them after the procedure. Do not discontinue any medication without first consulting with your doctor.If you have diabetes and use insulin, ask your doctor about how you should adjust the dosage of insulin the day of the procedure. Also bring your diabetes medication with you so you can take it after the procedure.

, In most cases, you will receive an intravenous (IV) as part of the treatment. As a result, you will be unable to operate machinery or drive a vehicle for the next 24 hours.Make arrangements to have a friend or relative accompany you to the doctor for treatment and then drive you home once you are discharged., Before undergoing radioactive treatment, you should understand all of the potential side effects. Immediately following the procedure, you will likely experience mild numbness and pain around the treated area. More severe side effects can include:Bleeding.
Infection.
Long-term numbness.
Paralysis.
Nerve injury.

, Prior to the treatment you will be asked to wear a hospital gown and lie on your stomach on the X-ray table. At this point, your back will be cleaned and an X-ray machine will be positioned so that the doctor can precisely maneuver the radiofrequency needles.

, An IV line will be started in your arm or hand to administer a mild sedative. The sedative is used to keep you still and relaxed throughout the half-hour procedure., Immediately before the procedure, the doctor will give you a local anesthetic to numb the skin directly around the injection sites. This way you will not be able to feel any discomfort during the treatment.The doctor will then use the radiofrequency needles to target the nerves that are causing back pain. This will disrupt their ability to send pain signals to the brain.

, Immediately following the procedure, you will be placed in a recovery room to rest until you are ready to go home. Typically it takes about 20-30 minutes to recover from the procedure. Prior to being discharged the doctor will ask you to perform a few simple movements to see if pain reduction has occurred. Expect to spend to the rest of the day resting and relaxing.Patients should wait a few days before resuming their regular activities., It’s unsafe to partake in any strenuous activities, such as working out, for at least the first day of recovery. Make sure not to operate any heavy machinery or drive a car either., You’ll need to keep your bandages on for several hours. Once you’re getting ready for bed in the evening after having the procedure done, you can remove the bandages and gently clean the area., Patients will typically experience mild pain for a few days after the procedure. This is associated with the nerves dying from the radiofrequency treatment. In order to ease the pain you can place on ice pack on the sore area.Your doctor may recommend using an ice pack for about 20 minutes, three to four times a day.

, After this procedure, you can continue eating as you normally would. There are no dietary limitations during the radiofrequency ablation recovery process., You should not use a heating pad to treat the aches and pains associated with the procedure. Because the procedure uses radio waves and heat to burn the pain-causing nerves, cooling the area is the best way to ease pain., You should not take a bath for two days following the procedure. If you want to clean your body, you can begin to shower in warm water about 24 hours after the treatment."

Go to physical therapy or visit a chiropractor.,
Ask for injections.",How to Treat a Back Spasm," This method often works to reduce a lot of painful muscle spasms. Before moving, rolling over, or getting up, place all four fingers or fingertips close to the spine and over the spasm. Press down. Try to move––if the muscle spasms, press harder and wait for the spasms to stop before trying to move again. When you have moved or stood up completely, wait a few seconds.









Try walking with your fingers on the muscle spasms.;
, In the shower, turn on the hot water and focus it on your back for 2-3 minutes. Alternate with a blast of cold water on the back for 30 seconds. Repeat until pain has somewhat subsided.








, Stretching the muscle fibers can help them relax and further soothe the back spasm. Always stretch before performing physical exercise.








, If you are a bodybuilder, make sure to balance your back muscle training with other muscle groups.









Pull-ups work the upper back and biceps, but don't neglect the scapular retractor muscles. When you do exercises to work your upper back, make sure that you squeeze your shoulder blades together to strengthen these muscles.
Do any type of light rowing exercise (1 dumbbell, cable, elastic tube or machine) using a full range of movement. Those stabbing pains between your shoulder blades will quickly disappear.
Rearward fly exercises can also work well if you only have light weights. Doing rows with a 1-pound dumbbell may take too many repetitions, so do flys instead to save time.

, Whether you are lifting 25 pounds or 1 pound, follow these steps:









Approach the object that you plan to lift. Place your feet on either side of the object, slightly behind it.
Bend at the waist and knees. Try not to round out your spine.
Pick up the object. Make sure you have a good grip.
Stand up using your thigh and butt muscles. Tighten your abdominals to support your back as you stand up.

, Apply ice for 20 minutes, remove for 1.5 hours, then re-apply for 20 minutes. Repeat this cycle as often as possible during the first 2 to 3 days after a back spasm begins.









Use a thin barrier between a chemical ice pack and your skin, such as a towel, so that the ice can be effective and prevent conditions such as frostbite. Ice will reduce the inflammation that can cause spasms, and can effectively reduce the use of dangerous and addictive painkillers.

, Moist heat, such as damp heating pads, hot showers or hot tubs is usually recommended. Heat helps to promote healing by drawing healthy blood cells to the area of the back spasm. Heat also relaxes the nerves and muscle fibers.









Try an ice/heat cycle after the first 72 hours. Some physical therapists suggest using heat applications before stretching and ice after stretching., Acetaminophen is a very popular OTC drug for back pain, and generally has few, if any, side-effects.Acetaminophen, unlike non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, relieves pain by lessening its perception in the brain. There is little chance of addiction to acetaminophen, and patients tend not to develop a tolerance to the drug.








, You don't have to go on strict bed rest, but you should avoid any activity that aggravates or causes back spasms including heavy lifting or certain exercises.









Get plenty of rest both at night and after periods of intense back muscle use.

, Prolonged bed rest can be more harmful than helpful when treating back spasms.








, Some patients report feeling better after they elevate their legs. As you elevate your legs, try diverting the mind from the pain of the spasm and try focusing on relaxation techniques.









Use pillows as simple props.
Lie down of a stiff mattress, or the floor, with your legs propped up or a support (or chair), maintaining a 90-degree bent on the knees.
Prop your feet or lower legs onto a footstool while sitting down.

, Since back spasms are often associated with dehydration and electrolyte loss, it's important to get enough water to drink.Be especially vigilant about water intake if you live in a warm environment or are nursing an illness with fever or vomiting.








, Back spasms are painful, exhausting, and debilitating. Know when to stop trying to treat yourself and solicit the help of a professional. Call a doctor if:









Your back spasms are severe and unbearable.
Back pain and back spasms occur frequently, or have a history of occurring frequently. Back spasms can be an underlying symptom of other problems.
Your back spasm or pain has lasted for longer than two weeks.

, Doctors commonly recommend over-the-counter naproxen or ibuprofen.









For more severe pain, your doctor may prescribe muscle relaxants or short-term narcotics regimens. Typically, muscle relaxants are prescribed early on in treatment, and on a short-term basis.
In some cases, certain tricyclic antidepressants are helpful in treating spasms. Tricyclic antidepressants are commonly prescribed for pain even when a patient doesn't demonstrate depression.
In most cases, your doctor should prescribe you some NSAIDS, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. OTC varietals of NSAIDS include ibuprofen and naproxen, but your doctor should be able to give you stronger drugs for more extreme cases.

, In the beginning, these professionals will use treatments like heat, ultrasound and muscle release techniques to fight spasms. Then, they should provide exercises to increase flexibility and strengthen back muscles, which can prevent pain from recurring.


Some people have reported improvement of chronic back spasms after acupuncture.Look for a licensed, reputable acupuncture practitioner who has experience in relieving back spasms.

, A cortisone injection may provide pain relief for a few months, especially if the spasms are causing pain to radiate down your leg."

Look for symptoms.,
Make an appointment with your doctor.,
Know which tests your doctor may perform.,
Discuss different treatment options with your doctor.",How to Treat Compression Fractures with Back Surgery1," When compression fractures occur suddenly, this will cause severe, “knife-like” pain in the middle or lower half of your back. At first, you’ll feel the pain suddenly when you put minor stress on your back. You’ll most likely feel pain at the location of the fracture, but it can also spread across your back and around your trunk.Compression fractures caused by osteoporosis, however, may cause no symptoms at first. Instead, over time, you may notice:


Back pain that gets worse while walking (but may not be felt while resting)
Pain when bending or twisting
Loss of height (as much as 6 inches)
Stooped posture or hump (also called kyphosis)
Worsening of existing spinal curves;
, If you are experiencing pain or other symptoms, make a plan to speak to your doctor. Come prepared to answer a series of questions, which will help the doctor diagnose your condition.


You should know when you first noticed symptoms.
You should be able to describe the instances when you feel pain.
You may be asked where your pain is located and whether or not it radiates.
You may be asked about any activities or accidents that could have contributed.
You should know how tall you were prior to this injury.
Prepare a list of any medications you are currently taking.
Be ready to inform your doctor of any other conditions you have.

, In addition to listening to your answers, your doctor will perform a series of tests to help diagnose your problem.These tests may include:


Physical examination (to look for kyphosis and tenderness around the affected bones)
Spinal X-ray
Bone density test (to evaluate for osteoporosis)
CT or MRI scan (if the fracture may have been caused by an accident or injury)

, Most compression fractures due to injury heal in 8-10 weeks by taking proper dosages of pain relieving medication such as analgesics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs), taking muscle relaxants, and getting plenty of rest. Surgery may be recommended after all of these more conservative treatments have been exhausted. There are several different surgical procedures that treat compression fractures, so make sure to discuss options with your surgeon in order to decide which one is best for you."

Use diet to help control the condition.",How to Treat Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis with Exercise," When a child suffers from rheumatoid arthritis, their joints become stiff and painful, making it difficult for them to move around, play and perform everyday tasks. Performing specific types of exercises can help the child to regain mobility by increasing their flexibility, muscle strength and overall fitness.


The best exercises for treating JRA will vary depending on the age of the child and the severity of the condition, but they will usually involve a combination of stretching/flexibility exercises, strength exercises and aerobics.
For best results, the exercise plan should be combined with doctor prescribed medications and a healthy diet.;
, Once JRA has been diagnosed, your child will be referred to a physical therapist who will assess your child's condition and come up with an exercise plan that best fits their needs.


Physical therapists have an in-depth understanding of how the muscles, joint and bones all work together. They will observe your child during the first couple of sessions to make sure the child understands the exercises and knows how to do them properly. In time, the child will continue to perform the exercises at home, under parental supervision.
You child may also be required to see an occupational therapist. Physical therapy helps to keep the joints moving and the body operating as it should, whereas occupational therapy helps patients to perform specific everyday tasks, such as writing or brushing your teeth., Before any exercises are performed, it's a good idea to warm up the child's joints using heat. This helps to relax the muscles and relieve joint stiffness.


Try pressing a hot pad or warm compress against the child's joints, or allow them to have a hot shower in the mornings. Warm paraffin can be helpful for the hands and feet. Performing some light aerobic exercise, like riding a bike, can also help to warm up the body before more intense exercises and stretches.

, Exercise programs for children with JRA are designed to increase joint mobility and reduce inflammation, but if the child is pushed too far or the exercises are too tough, it can actually make the condition worse, triggering further inflammation and swelling.


Therefore, it is very important that the child starts slowly and builds their way up to tougher exercises. The exercises outlined in the sections below should test the joints, but they should not cause any real pain. The child should stop and take a break if they experience any pain.
Over time, the child may build up to exercises like swimming and biking. As their condition improves they can do these activities more frequently and for longer periods of time.

, Walking is an excellent way of exercising the painful leg joints caused by juvenile arthritis, as it helps to strengthen the muscles and the bones.


Make sure the child is wearing good quality, flat sport shoes that provide adequate support. Encourage the child walk for 15 to 30 minutes per day, starting at a slow pace and working their way up.Walking underwater (in a pool) is also a great exercise. The water provides more resistance, making the exercise harder but more effective. It is particularly effective for strengthening the muscles in the knees.

, These leg raise exercises help to strengthen the quadriceps (the muscles at the front of the thighs). Strong quadriceps support the knee joints and make them more stable.Encourage the child to lie flat on their back with their legs extended. They should lift one leg a couple of inches off the floor, keeping their abdomen sucked in and their lower back pressed against the floor.
They should hold the leg up for a count of five, then slowly lower it back to the floor. Repeat 5 to 10 times, then repeat with the other leg.

, This exercise helps to strengthen and stretch the hamstrings muscles (located on the back of the thigh). These muscle are attached to the knee joints, helping to support the.


Encourage the child to lie on the floor with both legs bent. Ask them to lift one leg slowly, bringing the knee back towards the chest. The child should link both hands behind their thigh and attempt to straighten the leg.
The straight leg should be pulled back towards the head until the child feels a stretch. This position is held for 30-60 seconds, then the knee is bent slowly and the leg lowered back to the floor. Repeat with the opposite leg., This exercise helps to strengthen the back muscles, the glutes and the muscles on the front of the thighs. Strengthening these muscles supports the hip and knee joints.


Encourage the child to stand up straight with their feet one shoulder width apart. They can hold onto the back of a chair for support, if they like.
Get the child to bend their knees and push their butt out, until they are half-way into a sitting position. They should keep their chest up and avoid leaning forwards.
The child should hold this position for 5 seconds before returning slowly to the starting position. This exercise should be repeated ten times.

, This exercise strengthens the muscles in the front and back of the thighs, along with the glutes. This provides support for the hip and knee joints.


Encourage the child to stand up straight, between two chairs (which they can hold onto for support). Ask them to lift one leg approximately 12 inches (30.5 cm) off the ground and hold it there.
Keeping the back straight, the child should bend the standing leg, lowering their body as if they were about to sit in a chair. Remind them not to cross the lifted leg in front of the standing leg.
Hold the dipped position for 5 seconds, before returning to the starting position. The child should repeat the exercise 10 times, then repeat with the other leg.

, This exercise helps to stretch and strengthen the joints in the shoulders, while also increasing flexibility. To begin, encourage the child to lie on their back on the floor, with their arms beside their body.


Get them to slowly lift one arm straight into the air above the shoulder, keeping the elbow straight.
Ask them to slowly lower the arm back to the floor, then repeat the exercise three times before switching to the other arm.

, This exercise helps to stretch and strengthen the muscles in the neck, increasing neck mobility.


Ask the child to sit in a chair with their back straight, then slowly move their head to the right, until they are looking over their right shoulder (or as far as they can go).
Repeat the same movement to the left. Repeat the exercise 5 to 10 times on each side.

, This exercise helps to stretch and strengthen the neck, chest and shoulders, all in a single exercise. To begin, encourage the child to lie on the floor on their stomach, with their arms down by their side.


Ask them to slowly raise their head and shoulders off the floor, as far as they can go. Hold this position for a count of the three, then relax and return to the starting position.
Repeat this exercise ten times, inhaling on the way up and exhaling on the way down.

, To do this exercise, hold your hand out in front of you and bend the thumb towards the palm. Try to stretch for the bottom of the pinky finger with the thumb. If you can't quite reach the pinky finger, just stretch your thumb as far as it will go.


Hold this position for two seconds, then return the thumb to its original position.
The exercise should be done ten times, then repeated using the other hand.

, Hold your palm out in front of you, then bend all four fingers down towards the palm and curl them inwards so they form the letter ""O"".


Hold the fingers in this position for several seconds before straightening them. Repeat this exercise 10 times with each hand.
This exercise is an excellent one for when the hands are feeling particularly stiff.

, Open your hand and rest it, pinky side down, on the table. Your thumb should be pointing directly upwards.


Bend your fingers inwards (towards the palm) until your hand forms an upside-down ""L"" shape.
Repeat this exercise ten times with each hand.

, Place one hand on the table with the palm facing down. One by one, lift each finger off the table and hold it up for two seconds before lowering it back to the table.


Start with the thumb and work your way towards the pinky. The exercise should be performed in a very slow and deliberate manner.
Repeat the exercise 5 to 10 times with each hand.

, JRA is an autoimmune disease in which the immune system attacks healthy tissues in the joints, causing them to become swollen, stiff and inflamed. Certain children are genetically predisposed to developing JRA, and the disease can be triggered by environmental factors, like bacteria and viruses. There are several different forms of JRA, as follows:


Systemic JRA: This accounts for 10 to 20% of JRA cases. It is characterized by an intermittent fever, which can last from 3 days to 2 weeks,. Systematic JRA may also be accompanied by symptoms such as an enlarged liver, spleen or lymph nodes, pericarditis (inflammation of the membrane surrounding the heart) or pleuritis (inflammation of the membrane surrounding the lungs) or a pink, non-itchy rash.
Oligoarthritis: This accounts for about 50% of JRA cases. This type of JRA mainly affects large joints, and usually hits between one and four joints within the first six months.
Polyarticular rheumatoid arthritis: This accounts for approximately 30% of JRA cases. It mostly affects smaller joints, such as the hands, and usually hits five or more joints within the first six months.
Psoriatic arthritis: This is when the arthritis is accompanied by an autoimmune skin disease called psoriasis, which presents as a moderate to severe skin rash.

, All types of JRA share the same basic symptoms, including pain, inflammation, swelling, warmth and tenderness at the affected joints, accompanied by varying degrees of stiffness. This stiffness is usually worse in the mornings and later in the evenings. Stiffness in the knee joints may cause the child to limp while walking.


Some JRA sufferers may experience asymmetric growth at the affected joints, where the bones of the affected joints grow faster or slower than normal.
Oligoarthritis commonly results in eye inflammation, due to abnormal blood proteins that cause swelling.
Systematic JRA may lead to intermittent fever and skin rashes, along with swollen lymph nodes.

, JRA is diagnosed using a variety of methods, including physical examination, blood tests and x-rays. The doctor will also conduct a full medical history to find out if there are any risk factors that would make the child more prone to JRA.


Once symptoms have been present for more than six weeks, the doctor will conduct a physical exam to look for inflammation or deformity around the joints. The doctor will also check the lymph nodes in the neck and armpits to look for swelling.
The doctor will take a blood sample and use it to conduct a number of tests. He or she will look for ANAs (anti-nuclear antibodies) which are proteins that attack the healthy cells. The doctor will also look for the rheumatoid factor (RF) which can be used to differentiate between different kinds of JRA.
X-rays are used to identify any early abnormalities in the soft tissues surrounding the affected joint, or any bone deformities or over-growth. X-rays can also help to rule out other conditions that could affect the joints, such as bone fractures or cancer.

, Aside from exercise JRA will also be treated using medications, which help to bring down swelling and relieve pain. This can give the child increased mobility in the joints and help them to live a normal life. Massaging the joints and applying heat can also help to relieve pain and swelling.


Your child's doctor will normally prescribe non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) which are ideal for controlling JRA as they block the release of chemicals that cause swelling and relive any pain.
Two popularly prescribed NSAIDs are Ibuprofen and Voltaren. They are available in many forms, from tablets, liquids and suppositories to effervescent sachets, injections and topical creams. Your doctor will prescribe the appropriate dosage for your child.
Aside from NSAIDs, your child may also need to take anti-rheumatic drugs (such as Methotrexate), which delay the progression of JRA. In serious cases, corticosteroids may be used to bring down severe joint inflammation.

, Children who suffer from JRA are prone to both weight gain and weight loss. Both of these issues can be addressed by providing the child with a healthy, balanced diet that nourishes their body and helps to keep their energy levels up.


Children with JRA sometimes lose weight due to inflammation of the jaw (which makes it difficult from them to eat) or a loss of appetite due to psychological issues. If this is the case, you should encourage your child to eat more frequently throughout the day, using a number of small snacks that are healthy but high in calories, such as a chunk of full-fat cheese or a slice of wholewheat bream with peanut butter. If they suffer from an inflamed jaw, you can also make them more protein-rich soups and smoothies, which are easier for them to eat.
Children with JRA sometimes gain weight due to certain medications or loss of mobility (which prevents them from burning off calories). In this situation, you should try to remove any harmful fats in your child's diet and replace them with good, healthy fats, such as omega -3s which have anti-inflammatory properties.OMega-3s are found in nuts, seeds and oil fish. Also try to cut as much sugary or processed food from your child's diet as possible, and encourage them to eat more fruit, veg and whole grains.

Limit your intake of poultry, fish and meat products.,
Avoid certain vegetables.,
Know which foods are low in purine.,
Include fruits in your daily diet.,
Increase your fluid intake.,
Limit your alcohol intake.",How to Treat Gout Caused by Kidney Failure1," Poultry, fish and meat products contain high levels of purine, a chemical compound that gets broken down into uric acid in the body. High levels of uric acid can aggravate gout.


Therefore, if you been diagnosed with gout, you need to limit your meat intake to only 4 to 6 ounces or 113 to 170 grams per day.
Meat products that are particularly high in purine are organ meats (such as liver, brains, kidneys), anchovies, mackerel, herring, beef, lamb, pork, lobster, scallops and tuna. ;
, Some vegetables also have a high level of purine, such as oats, wheat germ, bran, asparagus, cauliflower, green peas, mushrooms and spinach. Do not eat more than ½ cup of these vegetables per day., It may be helpful for you to make a list of some low-purine foods, as these are the foods that you can safely eat when suffering from gout.


Some of the foods low in purine are eggs, peanut butter, low fat cheese, milk and yogurt, meat-free soup, fruits, bread, rice, cake, pasta, popcorn and more., There are a lot of fruits which contain natural compounds that may help to treat and relieve gout. These include the following:



Bananas: This fruit contains very low amounts of purine and has a lot of B vitamins, vitamin C, and potassium. This can prevent gout attacks. 2 to 4 serving daily is recommended.

Apples: Apples contain malic acid which helps to neutralize uric acid in the body. Apples are best eaten after every meal.

Cherries: Cherries contain minerals and phytochemicals that help to treating gout by lowering uric acid levels in the body. A daily serving of 10 to 15 cherries is recommended.

, Uric acid is solute substance and water can act as a solvent. Therefore, increasing your water intake will help to dilute the uric acid in your blood and make it easier for the kidney to eliminate excess uric acid.


It is recommended for you to drink 8 to 16 glasses of water per day. This is equivalent to 4–6 liters (1.1–1.6 US gal) per day. , Alcoholic beverages, such as beer, contain a high amount of purine. Thus, it is recommended that you limit yourself to one glass per day or better yet, avoid alcohol as a whole to prevent aggravation of gout."

Explore kyphoplasty.,
Learn about vertebroplasty.,
Investigate anterior/posterior reconstruction or spinal fusion.",How to Treat Compression Fractures with Back Surgery2," Kyphoplasty (sometimes called balloon kyphoplasty) is a minimally invasive procedure used to treat compression fractures. During this procedure, a needle is inserted into the spinal bone. Then a balloon is inserted into the needle, into the bone, and then inflated. This helps to restore the lost vertebral height. Finally, cement is inserted into the space to ensure that this space does not collapse again.This procedure aims to reduce or eliminate pain by addressing spinal deformity.
Kyphoplasty may be done with general anesthesia (meaning you go unconscious) or local anesthesia (meaning you are awake, but not feeling pain).
Although you will be able to walk, you should rest for at least 24 hours after the surgery. The surgery may be minimally invasive, but you’ll still need to take a little time to properly heal.
You will need to avoid lifting and strenuous activity for at least six weeks after the surgery.
While kyphoplasty is generally safe, complications may include bleeding, infection, allergic reaction to medicine, nerve injuries, breathing or heart problems related to general anesthesia.

, Vertebroplasty is another minimally invasive procedure similar to kyphoplasty, but no balloon is used. During this procedure, low-viscosity cement is injected directly into the collapsed vertebral area to stabilize the bones.This procedure works to reduce or eliminate fracture pain.
Unlike kyphoplasty, this procedure does not address spinal deformity.
This can be done with either general or local anesthetic.
Recovery is similar to kyphoplasty and the patient typically goes home the same day or after a 24 hour hospital stay.

, If there is evidence of serious and sudden instability of the spine or if other treatment options have failed, more invasive surgical options may be explored as a last resort. For example, if a compression fracture leads to a loss of 50% of the vertebral body's height, anterior/posterior reconstruction may be a good option. This may also be explored if bone fragments in the spine are interfering with recovery.”Anterior” reconstruction surgery means that the incision will be made into your chest. This approach is used when there is pressure being placed on the spinal cord.
”Posterior” reconstruction means that the incision is made in the back.
In both types of procedures, the patient is given general anesthetic.
After the incision is made, bone fragments may be removed.
The spine is then stabilized using a combination of bone grafts from the patient or a cadaver, metal screws, metal plates, and/or metal rods.
The patient usually stays at the hospital for 3-4 days when getting these procedures.
These are serious surgical procedures and will require a recovery period of several months.
Natural movement of the two fused vertebrae is eliminated by spinal fusion, which limits movement and increases stress on the surrounding vertebra.
Even after full recovery from a spinal fusion, the patient will have to avoid certain lifting and twisting activities.

Plan your pain control regimen.,
Take good care of your body.,
Follow all pre-op guidelines.",How to Treat Compression Fractures with Back Surgery3," Most procedures will cause mild to severe post-operative pain, and having a plan in place to control this pain will lead to a safe, successful recovery.Ask your doctor to provide realistic expectations for postoperative pain.
Discuss pain medication options. You may inquire about patient controlled analgesia (PCA), time-contingent scheduling, and/or options for analgesic medications.
Pain may be severe to require a short course of opioid analgesics.
Muscle relaxants such as cyclobenzaprine can be given to promote relaxation of the muscles and healing in your back.

, If you have some time before your surgery, use it to do whatever you can to improve your health. Better health can improve your chances of a smooth surgery and recovery.



Eat a healthy, balanced diet.

Quit smoking, or at least cut back. Smoking increases the risk of complications during surgery.
If possible, do some mild, low-impact exercise. Try some gentle walking (20 minutes 1-2 times per day), swimming (30 minutes twice a week), or stretching, as long as it doesn’t cause you pain.

, Your doctor will provide you with a list of instructions to follow prior to your surgery. It is crucial that you follow all instructions carefully.You may be advised to stop taking certain medications for up to one week prior to surgery.
You may asked to take a pre-op shower the night before. (Your doctor may provide instructions on what products to use).
You will asked to refrain from food and/or drink for a period of time prior to your surgery.

Elevate legs at a 45-degree angle.,
Apply a cold compress to the affected joints for pain management.",How to Treat Gout Caused by Kidney Failure2," Elevating your legs helps to treat gout with the aid of gravity. This is because elevating your legs decreases inflammation and swelling and causes the fluid in the joints to return back to proper central circulation.


Elevation also helps uric acid to flow back into the blood stream, which prevents it from building up in the joints. When uric acid builds up in the joints it can crystallize, causing a hard lump.
To elevate your legs correctly, your feet should be higher than heart-level .A 45-degree elevation will do. You can put 3 to 4 pillows at the end of the bed and allow both legs to rest. This can be done several times a day.

, A cold compress slows down blood circulation near the joints by narrowing the blood vessels. This reduces the inflammation causes by excess blood at the affected joints. A cold compress also help to numb any pain.


You can apply a cold compress by wrapping an ice pack in a clean cloth or towel and applying it to the affected joints for no longer than 30 minutes, 3 to 4 times a day. Be sure to allow the area to return to its normal temperature before applying the cold compress again.
Do not use hot packs or hot compresses as this will only make joint inflammation worse. Heat dilates the blood vessels (vasodilation), causing a sudden rush of blood that leads to inflammation, swelling, and pain.

Never use aspirin to treat uric acid.,
Take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or NSAIDs.,
Take colchicine.,
Take corticosteroids.,
Take allupurinol.,
Take probenecid.",How to Treat Gout Caused by Kidney Failure3," Aspirin is known to increase the uric acid in the blood by slowing its excretion. This can worsen the symptoms of gout., This group of drugs are known to relieve pain and decrease inflammation – two of the most common symptoms of gout.


Ibuprofen should be taken by mouth in doses of 800 mg, every 3-4 hours. However, your doctor may adjust the dosage depending on the condition of your kidney.Indomethacin should be taken four times a day in doses of 25 to 50 mg dosage. Dosage adjustment may also be necessary depending on the patient's overall treatment plan for the kidney failure., This drug is effective in preventing gout flare ups. Though it is not completely known how colchicine works, it is believed that it suppresses the activity of neutrophil and leukocytes, leading to decreased inflammation.Take an initial dose of colchicine during a gout flare up. It should be 1.2 mg by mouth and 0.6 mg an hour later.The maximum dosage of colchicines that can be taken in an hour is 1.8 mg by mouth. A very high dose of colchicines may lead to gastrointestinal upset., If you have a known allergy to NSAIDs, corticosteroids may be a good alternative. Corticosteroids act by inhibiting and suppressing inflammation in the body.


Corticosteroids are also known as immunosuppressant drugs – meaning they suppress the body's immune system.
Take 30-40 mg of oral corticosteroids once per day.., This drug is usually used for the long-term management of gout since it is more likely to be tolerated by the body and is relatively inexpensive. To produce uric acid from purine metabolism, xanthine oxidase is needed. With the help of allupurinol, the production of xanthine oxidase is inhibited.The initial dose of allupurinol is 100 mg per day. This dosage may be increased to 200 to 300 mg (for mild gout) or 400-600 mg (for moderate to severe gout) per day.Allupurinol is especially prescribed to people with kidney failure who suffering from gout as a result.

, This drug is a uricosuric agent which works to lowering uric acid by promotion the elimination ability of the kidneys. It should be noted that probenecid should never be used as part of the initial treatment of gout flare-ups, but rather it should be used as a maintenance drug.The maintenance dosage is 500 mg by mouth, every 12 hours. Your doctor may decide to increase this dosage by 500 mg each month, until uric acid is decreased and controlled."

Usually two or three days is enough time for most mild-to-moderate back strains to heal or feel significantly better.


About 80 to 90 % of acute low back strains resolve within the first 12 weeks, regardless of the treatment prescribed.Pain from muscle strains is usually described as dull, achy and/or throbbing — sometimes sharp with movement.
Muscles recover quicker if you rest them from vigorous or repetitive activity, although complete inactivity (such as bed rest) can make back muscles even more stiff. Some movement, such as slowly walking and/or doing household chores, increases circulation and helps back muscles heal faster.
Get up and slowly walk around for a few minutes every hour.If your back strain takes longer than a few weeks to settle down, then that's an indication of a more serious back injury that needs professional attention.;
, If your back strain is new (acute, within 48 to 72 hours of an injury) and not something that is constantly recurring, then inflammation is likely involved and contributing to your pain. Applying cold therapy (ice or something frozen) to acute musculoskeletal injuries is greatly beneficial because it constricts the small blood vessels around the injury and prevents inflammation from building up.Preventing inflammation reduces swelling, which reduces pain and stiffness. Apply the cold therapy for about 15 minutes at a time (or until numb) every hour until the pain and inflammation are significantly reduced. A few days of cold therapy may be needed if you acute injury is moderate-to-severe.


Effective forms of cold therapy include crushed ice, ice cubes, frozen veggies and frozen gel packs.
Whatever form of cold therapy you use, never apply it directly to your skin due to the risk of frostbite or irritation. Instead, wrap the cold item up in a thin cloth before applying it.
Moderate-to severe muscle strains are usually intensely painful and involve bruising below the skin's surface due to torn muscle fibers and damaged blood vessels. Applying cold therapy will typically limit bruising and cause it to dissipate quickly.

, If your injury is chronic (lingering for a few months) or constantly recurring, then applying moist heat may be more appropriate and effective than using cold therapy. Chronic muscle strains are not typically too inflamed; rather, the injured muscle tends to be weakened, too tight and in need of more nutrients (such as oxygen) via blood flow. Thus, applying moist heat can expand local blood vessels, increase blood flow and reduce muscle tension or spasms.Moist heat is a much better choice than dry heat (from an electric heating pad, for example) because it doesn't dehydrate muscle tissue or other tissues such as skin.


An effective and convenient way of using moist heat on your back strain is by buying a microwavable bag that contains some kind of grain (wheat, rice, corn) mixed with herbs and essential oils.
Zap the herbal bag in your microwave for 1-2 minutes, then apply it to your sore muscle(s) for 15-20 minutes, 3-5x daily, until the pain and tension fades away.
As an alternative, run a warm bath and add Epsom salt, which contains lots of muscle-relaxing magnesium. Soak in the salty bath for 20-30 minutes on a nightly basis to get relief and to promote better sleeps.

, Over-the-counter non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) are particularly helpful for acute and chronic back strains because they reduce swelling and pain.They are often better choices than regular painkillers (such as acetaminophen), because analgesics don't impact inflammation. Widely available NSAIDs include ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve) and aspirin. Always take NSAIDs on a full stomach and limit their use to less than 2 weeks because they are irritating to your stomach and kidneys. Keep in mind that NSAIDs are for symptomatic relief only.


Ibuprofen and aspirin are not usually appropriate for young kids, so always ask your doctor before giving any medications to your children.
Some medicinal lotions and creams contain NSAIDs, which are absorbed through the skin and into the strained muscle(s) without risking stomach irritation.
If your back strain is chronic (long-term), then taking muscle relaxants (such as cyclobenzaprine) is an alternative worth exploring. These medications reduce muscle tension and spasms, although they don't reduce inflammation or have a big impact on pain.

, After resting and dealing with the inflammation / pain for a few days, doing some light stretches may be helpful for your back strain as long as your pain isn't severe. Muscle stretching is helpful for recovering from strains because it lengthens the muscle fibers (preventing spasms) and promotes better blood flow.Stretches for the low back generally involve trying to touch your toes, either while standing or sitting. Try the ""hurdler's position"" while seated and one leg off to the side. Actually touching your toes is not important; feeling a nice pull or stretch in your low back muscles while reaching for your toes is the important thing.


Start with 3 back stretches each day and hold them for 20-30 seconds each time while taking deep breaths. The stretches should become easier day by day. Don't ""bounce"" the stretches.
Stop stretching immediately if your muscle pain significantly increases or the type of pain suddenly changes (from achy to electric pain, or numbness extending into the lower extremity, for example).
Make sure you back muscles are warmed up prior to stretching. Cold muscles get tight and are more prone to injury.

, If resting and applying the above home remedies does not significantly reduce your back strain within a few weeks, then call your doctor and make an appointment. Your doctor can examine your back and take x-rays if they think your injury is not primarily a strain. Other relatively common causes of back pain include arthritis, joint sprains, compression fractures, nerve irritation and herniated discs.If you pain is severe, your doctor can give you a prescription for stronger medications.


X-rays primarily show the condition of bones, such as your spinal vertebrae and pelvis. MRI, CT scan and diagnostic ultrasound can show the condition of soft tissues such as muscles, tendons, ligaments and nerves.
Your doctor may order a blood test if they think your back pain might be caused by rheumatoid arthritis or a spinal infection (osteomyelitis or meningitis).
Your family doctor is not a back specialist, but they are a good medical professional to see first in order to rule out the serious causes of back pain.

, Chiropractors are back (spinal) specialists and use manual (physical) techniques to restore normal function to the joints and muscles of the back. A chiropractor can thoroughly examine your spine, take back x-rays and analyze your posture while standing, sitting and walking. Chiropractors use a variety of therapies tailored toward healing muscle strains, such as electronic muscle stimulation, therapeutic ultrasound and infrared (heat) therapy. If spinal joints are also involved with your injury, then your chiropractor can use spinal adjustments to establish normal position, motion and function of the joints.


Traction of your spine and back muscles with an inversion table may also help your back strain. Many chiropractors have inversion tables, which positions you upside down (safely) and allows gravity to decompress your spine and stretch your back muscles.
Although a single appointment with a chiropractor can sometimes completely relieve your back strain, typically three to five treatments are needed to notice significant results. Keep in mind that your health insurance provider may not cover chiropractic care.

, Most back strains respond well to deep tissue massage because it reduces muscle spasms, dissipates inflammation, alleviates pain and promotes relaxation.Make an appointment with a registered massage therapist and start with a 30-minute session focusing on your sore back muscles. Allow the therapist to go as deep as you can take it without wincing. More sessions and perhaps longer sessions may be needed to notice significant results, so be patient and follow the therapist's recommendations.


Alternatively, ask a friend, partner or spouse to massage your back muscles. There's lots of video instruction on the internet that teaches the basics of massage therapy, although they are no substitute for professional training.
If you can't convince someone to massage your achy back, then consider using a tennis ball or foam roller instead. Depending on where your back strain is, use your bodyweight to roll over the tennis ball and/or foam roller until you feel the pain melt away.
Always make sure that you do not roll on the foam roller directly on your lower back. Angle your body slightly while rolling to prevent hyperextension of the low back.
Drink lots of water after a massage in order to flush inflammatory by-products and lactic acid out of your body.

, If your back strain persists for more than a few months, then ask your doctor for a referral to a physical therapist for some back rehabilitation. A physical therapist can show you specific stretches and strengthening exercises to help your chronic back strain to recuperate.Your therapist may use a combination of free weights, machines with pulleys, rubber bands and exercise balls to strengthen your back muscles. Back extensions (the opposite of sit-ups or crunches) are the most common back strengthening exercise.


Physical therapy is usually needed 2-3x per week for 4-8 weeks to positively impact chronic back strains.
Other general back-strengthening exercises include rowing, swimming and doing squats with weights.

Manage your pain.,
Attend rehab and/or follow up appointments.",How to Treat Compression Fractures with Back Surgery4," If your surgery is a non-invasive procedure (such as kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty), you may be able to leave the same day. If your back surgery involved anterior or posterior reconstruction, you may need to stay in the hospital for a day or two. While you are in the hospital, your care team will help you to focus on the first four elements of your recovery: eating, walking, urinating, and pain control.After your surgery, you must ease back into eating. Start eating a little bit at a time, making sure you can tolerate food.
Patients who begin walking right after back surgery have been shown to recover more easily. Your care team will help you begin moving around.
After back surgery, urinating can be difficult. Your care team will help ensure that you can urinate effectively and often.
Once you are able to tolerate food, you can begin taking oral pain medication. Communicate with your care team if your pain becomes too much.
Make sure to ask what position is best for you to sleep in.

, Your mobility is going to be limited when you return home after your surgery, so it is best to prepare your living space beforehand. Alternatively, you can ask a friend or relative to prepare your home while you are gone.Move items that you commonly use to areas above waist-level.

, You will be given a prescription before you leave the hospital, according to the pain management plan you have previously outlined with your doctor. It is important to fill this prescription right away and follow all instructions provided. Additionally, there are some non-pharmacological methods you can use to reduce your pain and heal effectively.These include:


Movement – Try to get up a walk at least 4-6 times per day. This increases blood flow and helps you to heal.
Ice – Place a cold pad (or ice pack) on the site of your incision. This helps to reduce pain and swelling. You can do this as often as you like.
Relaxation – Staying relaxed can help you to heal effectively. Try listening to an audio meditation or soothing music.
Distraction – Sometimes just getting your mind off of the pain can help. Try watching a funny movie or talking with a friend.

, Depending on your specific surgery, you may need to do some rehabilitation, physical therapy, and exercising. You will also need to see your doctor for follow up appointments to discuss your recovery process and address your specific needs. Program these appointments into your calendar, and make arrangements for transportation (if needed). These visits are essential! They will ensure that you are healing properly."

Wear appropriate clothing while exercising.,
Make sure your shoes provide enough support.,
Practice standing on one foot.",How to Strengthen Your MCL1," Start with a mild or moderate exercise routine and gradually increase how long and hard you exercise. 20 minutes three times a week is a great amount of time to spend per week exercising when you first start out. You don't want to stress your body or muscles because that also increases your chance of injury.;
, Your muscles rely on you to keep them hydrated so they can continue to work well. Dehydrated muscles are more prone to injury. It's also not good for your body.


Drink at least 16 oz. of water several hours before your workout. Remember to drink water while you workout as well.

, Your body will let you know when it is reaching its limits. If you experience pain or become light-headed, it means you pushed yourself too far and you need to dial back the intensity of your activity. It's your responsibility to pay attention to what your body is telling you and to stop exercising and let your body heal. Continuing with what you are doing will lead to acute or chronic injury.

, Active stretching helps to jumpstart the body during a warm-up before you do any exercise. Stretching prepares your muscles for the kind of swift, forceful movement they are exposed to during sporting activities. The following leg swinging exercise is an example of an active stretch which helps to warm-up the MCL.


Stand in front of a wall, with your feet shoulder-width apart. Press your palms against the wall at shoulder level, keeping your stomach muscles engaged.
Lift one leg sideways until it is above hip level, then swing it back down so it crosses in front of the other leg. Continue swinging for 10 to 15 repetitions, then repeat with the other leg. Do two to three sets for each leg.

, Passive stretching helps to improve flexibility in muscles and ligaments during your cool down after exercise. These stretches are important to avoid injury. The following quadriceps stretch is a good example of a passive stretch which helps to maintain the elasticity of the MCL.


Stand in front of a wall, pressing the palm of your right hand against it for support. Lift your right foot by bending your knee, until the right heel touches the left butt cheek. Use your left hand to grip your ankle and hold the foot in place for 30 to 60 seconds. Repeat with the left foot.
Keep in mind that this exercise (and other passive stretches) should never be performed before exercise since they relax the muscles and ligaments, possibly leaving them more prone to injury during exercise. These should only be performed during a cool down.

, Allowing your body adequate rest time after strenuous physical activity is an essential part of avoiding injury. Your body needs time to heal after exercising, usually at least one full day of rest. This helps your muscles strengthen and maintain good health.


During exercise, the MCL sustains mini tears. These mini tears will heal on their own, making the MCL stronger as a result during rest time. But if no rest time is given, the micro tears will not heal and the MCL becomes much more prone to injury.

, Wearing appropriate clothing while exercising helps you to avoid placing unnecessary stress on your MCL. You don't want to wear clothing that is too tight or that restricts movement. When the MCL becomes stressed, such as that caused by inappropriate clothing, it becomes more prone to injury.


When doing activities that involve running, it is recommend that you wear loose shorts that cut off above the knee. Longer, tighter shorts can restrict knee movement, putting more stress on the knee joints.

, Wearing shoes with adequate cushioning and support is essential for preventing injury to the MCL. Shoes meant for running are a good choice for use during sports activities. Replace old shoes and make sure you have enough sole support.


Worn-out shoes are ineffective at reducing impact to the knees, stressing the MCL and making it weak. Running shoes should be replaced every 300 to 500 miles (480 to 800 km).
People with flat feet should also ensure that their shoes provide enough sole support. Having flat feet puts extra strain on the MCL, making it more prone to injury. Adequate sole support alleviates this strain — an orthotic may need to be added to get the desired support.

, Standing on one foot improves your balance, training your MCL to become stronger and more stable. Greater stability goes a long way to prevent injury. It trains your muscles to hold their place and keep your knee stable.


Stand up straight with your shoulders back and your stomach muscles engaged. Slowly lift one foot off the floor and try to hold this position for 30 seconds.
If you start to wobble or lose your posture, try closing your eyes. This will help you to focus on your balance and leg coordination.
After 30 seconds, switch to the opposite foot and repeat the exercise. Repeat the exercise three times on each foot.

See your family doctor.",How to Stop Neck Cracking," Tight neck muscles is a reason some people try to crack their neck, likely in efforts to reduce the tension and discomfort they feel. Instead of trying to constantly release the joints of your cervical spine, gently stretch your neck muscles, which might alleviate your neck issue and eliminate the urge to crack it.Use slow, steady movements and take deep breaths during your stretches. In general, hold stretches for about 30 seconds and repeat 3-5x daily.


Stretching directly after a warm shower or the application of moist heat is recommended because your neck muscles will be more pliable.
While standing, reach around your back with your right arm and grab a little above your left wrist. Gently pull on your left wrist while laterally flexing your neck in the opposite direction, such that your right ear approaches your right shoulder. Hold for 30 seconds, then do the other side.;
, If your neck is stiff and has poor range of motion, then maybe the problem is more joint related. In this case, trying to crack (or unjam) your neck joints is certainly warranted, but typically the stiffest joints don't release with self manipulation. Instead, the joints above and below the stiffest joint keep cracking, which may make them a little too loose (hypermobile) and unstable over time.Start with moving your head in circles, first clockwise and then counterclockwise, for about 5-10 minutes each way. You may hear some clicks, cracks and pops in your neck, but focus on the movement and not the sounds.
Target the main movements of your neck: forward flexion (looking down at your toes), lateral flexion (ear towards your shoulders) and extension (looking up towards the sky). Go as far as you can in each of the four directions about 10x daily. After a week or two, you should notice an increase in range of motion, which might negate the desire to constantly crack your neck.

, Strengthening the muscles of the neck is good for stability. Muscles are not only for movement, but they are also important for providing protection and stability to the bones and joints that lay underneath them.Weak neck muscles increase the amount of instability in the cervical spine, which might trigger the desire to crack the spinal joints. Consequently, strengthening the cervical muscles may diminish the desire to crack them.


Tie an elastic exercise band around your head and attach it to something stable that's at the level of your head. Walk a few steps away from it until you feel tension in the exercise band. Then do the four main neck movements (flexion, extension, right / left lateral flexion) under tension 10x each on a daily basis. After a week or so, change to a thicker exercise band with more tension.
Alternatively, see a physical therapist, who can show you specific and tailored stretches and strengthening exercises for your neck., Your neck may not feel right because your sleeping environment may not be suited to your body. Mattresses that are too soft or pillows that are too thick may contribute to neck and upper back issues. Avoid sleeping on your stomach as it can cause your head and neck to twist in ways that irritate the joints and muscles of the cervical spine.Try sleeping on your side with your arms below the level of your head and your hips and knees slightly flexed (the fetal position).
Try using an orthopedic pillow, which is designed to support the natural curves of your neck.

, Neck problems are often caused by repetitive motions at work or minor injuries related to physical activity.If your problem is work related, then talk to your boss about switching to a different activity or altering your work station. Maybe your computer is positioned such that it's straining your neck. If so, position it directly in front of you and at eye level.


Instead of constantly cradling your phone to your ear and kinking your neck, use the speaker-phone function.
If your job involves lots of driving, change the position of your seat backing such that your head can rest comfortably against the headrest, which will reduce the tension in your neck.

, Maybe your neck issue is related to exercising at the gym or at home. As such, take a break from the causative activity (if you can identify it) for a few days and allow your neck to recuperate. Furthermore, you may be working out too aggressively (either too much weight or repetition) or with bad form—consult with a personal trainer, if you're unsure.


Positioning the weighted bar on the base of your neck while doing squats can cause cervical joint sprains.
Using your head as leverage while doing abdominal crunches can lead to a strain or sprain in your neck.Over the head movements like military press exercises can also lead to neck discomfort.

, Chiropractors and osteopaths are spinal specialists who focus on establishing normal motion and function in the neck, back and peripheral joints. Manual joint manipulation, also called an adjustment, can be used to unjam stiff joints or reposition neck joints that are slightly misaligned. It may seem odd that getting a chiropractor to crack your neck may stop you from cracking your own neck, but releasing the stiffest joint(s) instead of the most hyper-mobile ones might cure you of your habit.


Although a single neck adjustment can sometimes completely relieve your neck issue, more than likely it will take a few treatments to notice significant results.
Chiropractors and osteopaths may also use other therapies for your neck issue, such as traction or massage techniques. Make sure to see a reputable chiropractor or osteopath.

, Your desire to crack your neck may be tied to an underlying muscle strain, perhaps from an old sports injury or motor vehicle accident. A deep tissue massage is helpful for mild-to-moderate strains because it reduces muscle spasm, combats inflammation and promotes relaxation.Start with a 30 minute massage, focusing on your neck and shoulder areas. Allow the therapist to go as deep as you can tolerate without wincing. Don't over do it - a light massage may be your best option.


Always drink lots of water immediately following a massage in order to flush out inflammatory by-products, lactic acid and toxins from your body. Failure to do so might cause a headache or mild nausea.

, Acupuncture involves sticking very thin needles into specific energy points within the skin / muscle in efforts to reduce tension, discomfort and swelling.Acupuncture can be effective for a variety of neck issues, which may in-turn impact your desire to crack it.


Acupuncture points that may provide relief to your neck issue are not all located near where you feel the discomfort—some can be located in distant areas of the body.
Acupuncture is practiced by a variety of health professionals including some physicians, chiropractors, naturopaths, physical therapists and massage therapists. Acupuncture may be used as an auxiliary treatment.

, The habit of cracking your neck may be due to a serious underlying medical condition such as arthritis, osteoporosis, cancer or a structural deformity.Degenerative conditions of the neck often cause creaking and cracking sounds with all heads movements. In reality, these are not likely causes for your neck cracking habit, but if all other methods fail to get you to stop, then more serious problems need to be considered.


X-rays, bone scans, MRI and CT scans are modalities that physicians may use to help diagnose your possible neck issue.
Your doctor may also send you for a blood test to rule out rheumatoid arthritis or a spinal infection such as meningitis. If you are female, you are at risk for cervical subluxation with rheumatoid arthritis. A neck x-ray will be needed before general surgery to rule out this condition. Airway and neck assessment is crucial with cervical subluxation because of the potential risk of spinal cord damage.
If no physical issues exist in your neck, then your doctor may refer you to a mental health professional in order to explore any psychological issues.
Psychologists sometimes use hypnosis to break unwanted habits.

Depending on your condition, there may be other things you need to do first.If you have significant balance or coordination issues, tai chi may not be well-suited for you. This is also true if you take medications that make you dizzy or lightheaded as a side effect.
In addition to advice, your doctor also may be able to recommend specific classes or instructors in your area that you could try.;
, Breathing is fundamental to tai chi. Basic breathing exercises can give you an introduction to the practice and help ease stress and tension, even if never combined with movement.Breath in tai chi is like a continuous circle, with no pauses between the inhale and the exhale. As you inhale, expand your chest and belly to make room for the air. When you exhale, suck in your belly and think about squeezing the air out gently.
Breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth, resting the tip of your tongue against the roof of your mouth. It should be in the same position it would be if you were going to say ""laugh"" or ""light.""
When you've got the deep breathing down, let your focus drift to parts of your body that are tense. Focus on relaxing and loosening them up with your breath.

, When practicing tai chi, standing in proper alignment is essential. In the neutral position, you help release tension from your body and find balance and stability. While there are several tai chi stances, the neutral position is typically the first you will learn.Start with breathing exercises to relax your entire body. When you're ready, stand with your feet hip- or shoulder-width apart, parallel to each other. Make sure you're comfortable and stable.
Distribute your weight evenly and keep your back straight. Your feet should be far enough apart that you feel stable, comfortable, and relaxed. When your hands line up over your feet, you're in correct alignment.
Bend your knees slightly, tucking your pelvis so that your tailbone points toward the ground. You should still be able to see your knees. Keep your shoulders flat and neutral and relax your chest. Continue to breathe deeply.
As you breathe, start to have awareness of each part of your body in the position. You can close your eyes if it feels right, but you should keep your head up and your neck straight.

, There are a number of videos available online for free that will help introduce you to the practice of tai chi and teach you some basic principles. Many of these videos are specifically geared toward those who want to treat arthritic knees with tai chi.For example, you can find videos on the Tai Chi for Health Institute's website. These videos use a form of tai chi practice that was modified by doctors and health professionals specifically to treat osteoarthritis.
Focus on videos for beginners. Watching more advanced practitioners at this stage could be intimidating.

, Loose, lightweight attire is most suitable for practicing tai chi. Whatever you wear should allow you full range of motion without binding or constricting your movement. Lightweight clothing will more easily move with your body.You typically don't have to buy any new clothes to start a tai chi practice. Some people even wear regular street clothes to class. The slow, gentle movements of tai chi mean you shouldn't expect to break a sweat or need special exercise clothing.
You may want to dress in layers if you tend to get cold, depending on where you want to practice tai chi.

, The Arthritis Foundation has developed a 12-movement program specifically for treating arthritis pain. This beginner's program is offered throughout the United States at locations listed on the Foundation's website.Look for locations by going to arthritis.org. Click on the Arthritis Resource Finder, or search for ""tai chi"" to bring up more information about tai chi practice and the Foundation's program.
You also can find locations and more information about the program by calling the Foundation at 1-800-283-7800.
You may be able to connect to other possibilities in your area through the Foundation, even if the specific program isn't available anywhere convenient for you.

, Before you get started, it's usually best to watch a class in progress so the movements and the atmosphere will be more familiar to you and you'll be more comfortable when you get started.Tai chi is for people of all ages and all levels of physical ability. While you typically want to observe a beginners' class, it isn't necessary to find a class specifically for seniors or specifically for people with arthritis – unless that would make you more comfortable.
As you're observing, be quiet and still. Once the class is over, you'll have the opportunity to talk to the instructor and some class participants, but you should refrain from interrupting while the class is going on.
If you were unable to find a class through the Arthritis Foundation, you typically can find a class near you by checking at your local library, community center, or fitness center. Senior groups of clubs also may offer tai chi classes.

, There is no universal accreditation program for tai chi instructors. Before you sign up for a class, you need to find out more about their credentials, experience, and reputation in the practice.You may want to also do some research on the instructor's background online. Find out where they've taught before, and look for any reviews.
Practitioners who have been in the class for a longer time period, or practitioners in intermediate or advanced classes taught by the same instructor, also can be good sources of information about the instructor.
If you're taking a class not specifically designed for people with arthritis, you need to explain your condition to the instructor so they can make the necessary accommodations for you.

, The best way to start a tai chi practice is to go to a formal, weekly class. This will help structure your practice and teach you the basic movements so you can eventually start practicing at home as well.The other class members also are available for guidance and advice in addition to the instructor.
Be open to the experience as well as to camaraderie from other practitioners. It may be intimidating at first, but keep in mind that you are all beginners.

, You'll get the most benefit out of your tai chi practice if you do it every day. After you're comfortable with the basic movements, you can start doing it every day at home to supplement your weekly class.There are some classes that meet several times a week, but you may find that a weekly class is a better fit for your budget. Unfortunately, tai chi classes aren't covered as a treatment for arthritis by most health insurance programs, even though the practice can be just as beneficial as physical therapy.

, The 70 percent rule is fundamental to the practice of tai chi. According to this rule, when you perform any of the tai chi movements you should only do 70 percent of what you can do.In terms of arthritis, this means that your 100 percent will be as far as you can go without experiencing pain. Your movement in tai chi should only be about 70 percent of that.
Keep in mind that this range may change from day to day. Grow in your body awareness so that you understand where the line is and how far you can go on any given day.

, Cycles and circles are at the center of many tai chi movements. The principles of tai chi are based on concentrating and harnessing the energy flowing through your body, just as your breath moves in and out in a continuous cycle.Think of your body as a circle, or your limbs as moving in circles. Try to feel the energy cycling through your body.
The energy ball exercise is typically one of the first things you'll learn when starting tai chi. The exercise involves rubbing your hands together, pulling energy into them, and then slowly pulling your hands apart, feeling the energy connecting your hands together. Over time, you may find you are able to actually physically feel the energy ball you've created., When the cycle of energy is in harmony with your continuous cycle of breath, you will achieve the most benefit from your tai chi practice. Typically, your instructor will start each class with breathing exercises to help center you.You should start your home sessions with breathing exercises as well. Try to keep your mind focused on that cycle.
If you find you're losing your breath, or that your mind has drifted away from your breath, take a moment to recover it. Stop moving and stand in a neutral position, turning your mind to your breath.

, It isn't necessary to advance at a certain pace, or to learn and practice many different movements, to treat your arthritic knees with tai chi. Learn at your own pace, keeping in mind that tai chi isn't competitive.In the beginning, you may find it frustrating, or have difficulty keeping up. If you feel yourself becoming frustrated, take a break and return to your breath until you are calm.
Keep with it, even if you have a hard time understanding the movements or aren't able to do everything you can. Have patience, and remember that tai chi should be slow and gentle.
Once you've learned basic movements, you might commit to learning one or two new forms or movements each month so you can gradually expand your practice.

Perform lunges.,
Do leg curls.,
Try pillow squats.,
Perform calf exercises.,
Give sumo deadlifts a try.,
Practice contracting your quads.,
Do hip abductions.,
Use the leg press machine.,
Exercise with a loop band.",How to Strengthen Your MCL2," Lunges are are the perfect exercise for stretching and strengthening the muscles and ligaments in the knee, including the MCL. By strengthening this entire area of your knee, you put less strain on your MCL. Try doing lunges regularly to keep your MCL healthy.


To perform a lunge, stand with your feet slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. Keep your back straight, your tummy tucked in and your eyes looking straight ahead.
Take a big step forward with your right foot, bending the knee until your thigh is parallel with the floor. The knee should not extend past the tips of your toes.
Bend the back knee until it is almost (but not quite) touching the floor. Hold this position for 10 seconds, then return to the starting position and repeat with the other leg.

, Leg curls are another great exercise for strengthening both the MCL and hamstrings (a set of four muscles at the back of the thigh which are essential for flexing the knee). These exercises are even more effective if you place a resistance band or ankle weight around your ankles as you perform them. Here's the correct way to do them:


Lie face down on an exercise mat, with your legs stretched out behind you. Place an ankle weight or resistance band around your ankle, then slowly lift up your right foot until your heel touches your behind.
Slowly lower your right foot back to the floor. Remember to keep your hips pressed into the mat at all times — if you raise them, you risk straining your knee instead of strengthening it.
Repeat the exercise for three sets of 10 to 20 repetitions, then do the same with the opposite leg.

, Pillow squats (exactly what they sound like — squats with a pillow between your knees) help to strengthen the MCL, along with a number of other muscles and ligaments in the inner knee. Strengthening the muscles and ligaments surrounding the MCL is important since they are basically the MCL support system. Squats target the highest number of muscles and ligaments in a single exercise, so don't forget to include them in your workout.


Stand up straight and place a thick pillow between your knees. Thicker pillows work better since using a thin pillow will significantly increase the difficulty level of the exercise. You could even use a medicine ball instead, if you prefer.
Stand with your feet about hip-distance apart, keeping your back straight, your tummy tucked in and your eyes looking straight ahead. Bend your knees as if you are about to sit in an invisible chair, sticking your butt out behind you.
You don't need to do a full squat (with your thighs are parallel to the floor). You can just do a half-squat to reap MCL-strengthening benefits.
Slowly return to the starting position, then repeat the exercise for three sets of 10 reps. Allow one minute of rest time between each set — rest time is necessary for optimum muscle strengthening and growth.

, When performing leg strengthening exercises, it's important to exercise the entire leg throughout your routine (not just specific parts). If you only focus on specific areas, you could be left with a weak area. Calf exercises help to strengthen the MCL while also building the calf muscles, which support the knee and help to relieve pressure on the joints and ligaments.


Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. Make sure that you have something to grab onto for balance like an exercise bar or the back of a chair.
Lift both heels off the ground, rising up onto the balls of your feet as high as you can go. Then slowly lower your heels, flattening your feet back onto the ground.
Repeat this exercise for three sets of 15 to 20 repetitions.

, Sumo deadlifts train the muscles and ligaments in the inner knee, including the MCL and the VMO (the vastus medialis obliquus, a teardrop-shaped muscle that helps to stabilize the knee). The VMO helps to disperse stress within the kneecap, which is essential for preventing injury to the MCL.


Place your feet wider than your hips. Turn your toes out at a 45 degree angle — this is very important in order to make the exercise as effective as possible.
Keep your back straight, your shoulders back and your stomach muscles engaged. This will help you to maintain good posture as you complete the exercise.
Lower yourself by bending your knees and pushing your butt backwards, as if you were using it to close a door behind you. Slide your hands down along your thighs as you descend.
When your hands reach your kneecaps, stop and slowly return to the starting position. Repeat for three sets of 10 repetitions, resting for one full minute between each set.

, Contracting the muscles in your quadriceps (the muscles at the front of your thighs) engages the muscles and ligaments in the knee. This helps to strengthen the MCL. Building up the quads themselves is also a good idea, since this will provide more support for the knee joints.


Lie down on an exercise mat on your back, extending your legs fully. If your knees need some extra support, place a rolled up towel or piece of foam underneath them.
Contract (or squeeze) the muscles in your quads and hold for ten seconds before relaxing. Do 10 to 20 contractions, relaxing for thee seconds between each.

, Hip abductions are another great exercise for strengthening the MCL. Having strong, flexible hips will help absorb some of the impact while running. It also takes pressure off the knees.


Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, holding onto the back of a chair for balance. Place an ankle weight or resistance band around your right ankle.
Slowly lift your right foot off the floor and extend it out to the side, as high as your leg will go. Return to the starting position and repeat for three sets of 10 to 20 repetitions, before repeating on the other leg.

, Most gyms are equipped with a leg press machine. This machine is excellent for strengthening the muscles surrounding the knees, including the VMO. It also helps to provide a sturdy support system for the MCL.


Sit into the machine, lying back against the seat (which should recline at a 30 degree angle). Place your feet on the vertical plane in front of you.
Adjust the weight according to your strength level, then use your feet to push the weight away from your body by extending your legs. Don't lock your knees when you extend your legs. Try to keep them slightly bent.
Slowly return to the starting position, then repeat the exercise for two or three sets of 10 to 20 repetitions. Rest for a full minute between each set.

, Exercising with a loop band is a great way to engage the MCL. The band creates pressure against the outside of the knee, which forces the MCL to push the knee outward. This recreates the type of stress the MCL is exposed to during normal physical activity.


Place the loop band around your ankles and stand with your feet hip-width apart, toes pointing forwards. Keep your back straight and your knees slightly bent.
Take five sideways steps towards the right, using your hips and maintaining your stance as much as possible. Now take five sideways steps towards the left. This is one full set.
Do three sets of this exercise, resting for one full minute between each set.

Do plyometrics.,
Practice hopping over a cone.,
Do single leg hops over the cone.,
Perform the scissors jump.,
Do shuttle runs.,
Practice diagonal runs.,
Do bounding runs.",How to Strengthen Your MCL3," Plyometrics incorporate jumping movements and strengthen the muscles. This type of exercise also increases the speed and agility you need for most sports. Do these exercises to help get your body used to quick movements and using a lot of power.You need to land lightly while doing plyometrics so that you catch your weight on the balls of your feet. Roll back to your heel, knees slightly bent and hips straight.

, You will hop over a cone to increase strength and control of your MCL. Practice doing several sets of 20 reps. Stand with a 6 inch cone to the left and hop to the left over the cone landing softly as described in the plyometrics step.


Repeat this with the cone to your right, hopping to the right.
Now, jump forward over the cone. Practice jumping backwards over the cone too.
Do not snap your knee back to straighten it. Keep your knees stable.

, You should practice hopping over the cone with one foot, doing 20 reps. This will further increase the power, strength and control you have over your MCL. Hop forward and backward over a 6 inch cone, landing lightly on the balls of your feet and maintaining a slight bend at the knee.


Switch feet and practice hopping over the cone with the other leg.

, Do 20 reps of the scissors jump to increase strength and power. This will help significantly with jumping during sports. Make sure your knees are stable during this exercise, and do not allow your knee to cave in or out.


Use your right leg to lunge forward, keeping your knee directly over your ankle.
Push with your right foot so your left leg moves into the lunge position.

, Sprinting trains your knee, ankle and hip to remain stable during sudden movements. This increases strength and agility. Practice shuttle runs regularly to maintain speed, strength and dynamic stability.


Start at a cone and sprint forward to a second cone, a short distance away. Run backwards to the third cone and forward to the fourth. Practice going forward and backwards from cone to cone.

, Diagonal runs are basically shuttle runs that focus on the outside of each leg and foot. This stabilizes the knee, ankle and hip complex. It also increases agility and makes your MCL stronger.


Run to a cone placed to your left. You will want to pivot off the left foot as you run to the next cone. Pivot off your right foot to the next cone.
Maintain proper form and don't allow your knees to bend inward. Always keep your knees slightly bent so they are directly over the ankle joint.

, A bounding run involves running across 44 yards. You will start at shorter distances and increase your distance over time with practice. This exercise has multiple benefits, increasing flexibility, strength, power and speed.


You will want to begin along the sidelines. When you run, push your knees high up toward your chest. As your legs come down, land on the balls of your feet. Your hip needs to be straight and knees slightly bent.

Water is essential for optimum health of fibrocartilage of the discs. Dehydration will make it harder and difficult to regain normal shape and function.


Drink about 3 liters (0.8 US gal) of water each day. Blood circulation to your back area should be good to reach that water.;
, Our normal body pH is 7.4 which is slightly alkaline (pH 7 is neutral). It helps to deposit calcium in immature bones and cartilage. If the body's pH becomes acidic, various alkaline substances including calcium tend to neutralize the excess acid. Therefore calcium is lost from bones and cartilages, drying them out.


Coffee, cigarettes, alcohol, refined sugar, junk foods, fast foods, overcooked foods, refined breads, meat, etc. make our body acidic. Try to avoid them.
Raw foods, particularly vegetables, are good to maintain alkalinity of blood and body tissue.
Consuming too much milk also makes the blood pH acidic although it is a good source of calcium.

, Calcium is the building block of the bones. It is also important for optimum health of cartilage. Calcium strengthens vertebral discs as well as fibrocartilages. It is particularly important for the elderly and post-menopausal females, who are more prone to develop calcium deficit and fractures.


Nut-milks, nut-butters (not peanut butter), nuts, seeds, green vegetables like broccoli, green leaves and sprouts are examples of calcium rich foods.
You may also take calcium supplements if you are doubtful about dietary sources or if you have a recognized calcium deficit. Take Tab Calcium 500 mg or Tab Calcium+ Vitamin D preparation once daily until your symptoms disappear completely.

, Regular exercising is very good for bones and joints functioning. Any form of exercising like yoga aerobics or simple walking, can be employed. Here's how it helps:By strengthening back muscles, weight bearing potential is improved.
Increases spinal flexibility.
By strengthening belly muscles and muscles of legs and arms, weight is evenly distributed and this reduces back strain.
Age related bone loss is significantly minimized, thus making the spines strong and able to withstand the stress., You might have noticed that obese people complain more of backache, disc prolapse and all other sorts of spine problems. When you are upright, your weight is supported by the spine, so the spine has to bear the additional stress when a person is obese. This causes minor injuries and degeneration. Try to keep your weight at an ideal limit for your height.Your doctor will be able to pinpoint a good weight for you and start you on a plan to lose weight and exercise safely. Even a few pounds can make a difference!

, Good circulation is necessary to transport nutrients and water to the discs, keeping them hydrated. If you take rest all day long or sit idly, blood circulation will be sluggish. Activity and massage are the best ways to do this.


Engage in ordinary activity to improve circulation. Get up regularly and take a brief walk if you are sitting down for a prolonged period.
Massaging the back will also improve blood supply to some extent. You may need the help of another person in this regard. Ten minutes once or twice daily would benefit you well.

, Glucosamine and chondroitin are essential components of cartilage. They are important to maintain flexibility of the cartilage. You can use these supplements to boost and renew your cartilage.


Take Tab Glucosamine 500 mg three times daily or Tab Glucosamine + Chondroitin one to two tablets three times daily. The dose can be tapered after 60 days or according to response.
You can also use Glucosamine sulfate cream locally on the affected area. It will reduce inflammation and expedite healing of the fibrocartilage. Apply a thin layer of cream over the painful area and gently rub with pulp of the fingers. Use it two times daily until pain subsides.

, When you take precautions against disc degeneration, you're also protecting your back against disc dehydration. You have several options:



Complementary and alternative medical therapies (CAM). These work well during the initial stages of disc dehydration, when they can reduce the progression of the degeneration significantly and may cause some regeneration also.

Chiropractic care. In this type of care spinal manipulations are done by hand to restore the alignment of spinal joints. Chiropractors manipulate the joints and restore alignment with controlled force; this relieves the stress to a greater extent. Only a trained and certified chiropractor should do this.Massage therapy. This relieves associated muscle strain and improves blood circulation to the affected joint. Various types of massage therapy like heat and cold alternating massage therapy, panchakarma massage therapy, etc. are done with variable results.Spinal decompression by traction: This helps by increasing the disc space, thus facilitating the flow of water to rehydrate the damaged disc. This form of therapy is restricted to chronic cases only; it should not be tried if there is acute swelling and pain at the site.
Other modalities like ultrasonic or electrical stimulation, bracing, pool therapy, posture training, flexibility and strength training are also popular. All such modalities may work wonders in some and they are worth trying but under the supervision of an expert and with your doctor's okay.

, We need to adopt different postures for daily activity because these have a crucial impact on our spinal discs and disc dehydration. Some postures tend to displace the discs and put stress on them. Your every movement and activity should be such that the discs remain relaxed.


Keep your torso straight as much as possible. Keep pillows under your knees while lying on your back and between your legs to support your lower back while lying on your side.
Sit with your back straight, keeping your whole back in contact with the backrest of the chair. Put your buttock as far backward as possible while sitting on a chair.
While standing, keep your back straight and contract abdominal muscles all the time.
If you need to lift an object from the floor, squat at first, then take the object in your hands. Lift one knee and keep the object on that knee. Stand up keeping your back straight.
Do not sit or stand for a prolonged period of time.

, Repetitive movements using incorrect postures can lead to wear and tear of the discs. The primary position to avoid is repetitive flexion (forward bending). If you are bending to lift something, bend with your legs and your back straight. Make sure you keep objects close to your body.

Also avoid repetitive twisting and rotation. If you are going to rotate, make sure you move with your feet first, turning your entire body, not just twisting at the waist. For example, if you were to twist to the right, rotate your right foot out first and then follow with your body. This allows the body to minimize rotation at the spine.

, This is mandatory in all cases, as it relieves back pain very effectively. In a standing position the spine takes the load, but when you are resting the weight is shifted from the spine and back muscles; this relieves the stress and makes you comfortable.


Complete bed rest is not advisable, since it will weaken the back muscles. Get up and walk around, even for a few minutes, every hour or so.

, Painkillers and anti-inflammatory drugs are often helpful for the patient to resume normal activity. They also help you to exercise routinely, eliminating pain, and stretching out your back so your discs can properly lubricate.


NSAIDs are the first line of treatment in back pain associated with disc degeneration. Examples are ibuprofen, ketoprofen, aspirin, indomethacin, diclofenac, etc.
Narcotics like morphine, Codeine, pentazocine, etc. are given sometimes when there is excessive pain not responding to NSAIDS. Take them for a short duration of time, because side effects can create other problems. Most common side effects are nausea, vomiting, constipation, giddiness. These drugs are only available by prescription and are associated with abuse potential.
Muscle relaxants commonly prescribed like chlorzoxazone are associated with drowsiness, depressive tendencies and lethargy so should not be taken for more than 2 to 3 days. These reportedly help with muscle spasms.
When there is excessive pain and all other treatment modalities have failed, doctors sometimes advise to inject the mixture of cortisone and local anesthetic into the space around spinal cord — this is known as epidural block. Before having an epidural, the cause of pain is determined by either CT scan or MRI of the back, and baseline investigation are advised., The type of surgery depends upon the cause of disc injury. For example:


Laminectomy and dynamic disc stabilization can improve disc rehydration in cases of lumbar spinal stenosis.
Spinal fusion is the treatment of choice for all refractory cases of degenerative spondylosis.Disc regeneration using mesenchymal stem cells is definitely the future of all disc degenerative disorders, but at present it is still under the trial phase.Surgical correction may not be successful in all cases and it is associated with certain risks, so it should be tried only when all other conservative methods have failed



, It helps to relieve the pain due to nerve compression (lumbago or sciatica). However, before doing any exercise it is best to consult a doctor or physiotherapist. It is because some exercises may further damage the disc instead of benefiting it. The purpose of exercise is to strengthen back muscles to support the spine and reposition the disc to its normal position. That being said, here's the knee pull:Lie flat on your back and grasp one knee with interlaced fingers.
Pull the knee to your chest while keeping your back straight. Hold for 20 seconds.
Do the same for the other knee. Repeat this about 20 times in a session. Perform 2 sessions daily.

, This will, as the name suggests, tilt your pelvis forward.


Lie flat on your back with knees bent and feet flat on the floor.
Press the floor with your lower back and buttock by relaxing back muscles and tightening abdominal and buttock muscles.
Keep pressing for 20 seconds. Do the same number of repetitions for the forehead to knee stretch.

, This is to develop abdominal and side muscles.


Lie flat on your back with knees bent and feet flat on the floor.
Take your hands behind the head with fingers interlaced.
Slowly and gradually lift your head and shoulder blade while keeping your back on the floor. You will feel tension in your abdominal muscles.
Hold your head for five seconds and then gradually lower it down.
Initially repeat this five times in a session. Gradually increase the repetition to about 20.

, As you learn to keep balance, gradually increase the degree of leaning to near lying position and return to upright position again. Here's how:


Sit on the floor with your back straight and knees bent.
Stabilize yourself with your arms stretched out in front of you.
Now lean backward slowly and slightly keeping the abdominal muscles tight.
Try to avoid falling backward by using your abdominal and side muscles. Hold this position for 20 seconds.
Repeat this 20 times per session. Two to three sessions per day are sufficient initially.

, This exercise helps to push the spinal discs forward and release compression on the nerve roots.


Lie on your stomach comfortably.
Raise your head and shoulders and support yourself by putting the palms of your hand on the floor.
Hold for 10 seconds and return to normal position.
Relax for 20 seconds and repeat the exercise. Initially do five repetitions and increase by twos.

Sleep on your back.,
Avoid sleeping on your stomach.,
Try not to sleep on your side.,
Train yourself to sleep in a new position.,
Invest in a good mattress.,
Use supportive pillows.,
Follow your doctor's instructions about wearing your brace.,
Stay active.,
Keep it dark.,
Be patient while adjusting to your brace.,
Manage your pain.",How to Sleep with Scoliosis," The best sleeping position for people with scoliosis is flat on the back. This is a neutral position that does not cause any unnecessary strain or create any unnatural curves in the spine.This position is especially preferred for people who have a lateral spinal curvature.;
, Sleeping on your stomach is very bad for your back if you have scoliosis. This is because the position forces the middle and lower sections of your spine to be straight, and your neck to twist., While not as bad as sleeping on your stomach, sleeping on your side is also not ideal for scoliosis patients. This position may cause unnecessary pressure on your pelvis, neck and shoulders., If you're not used to sleeping on your back, it may feel unnatural. If you find yourself instinctively changing to a different sleeping position during the night, you may need to use some tricks to break that habit.One option is to create a barricade around yourself with extra pillows so that you can't roll over.
Another option is to tape uncooked peas (or any similar item) to your sides. This will make it uncomfortable to sleep on your side, so you will roll back onto your back.

, It's extra important to have a comfortable, supportive mattress if you have scoliosis. For most individuals, a medium to firm mattress is the best choice, although it's most important that you are comfortable.Memory foam may not be the right choice for people with scoliosis, as it does not always provide as much support as a traditional mattress., Many people who have scoliosis do not have the proper amount of curvature in their necks and low backs. Try sleeping on a cervical pillow and a lumbar roll to help encourage your spine to curve in a healthy way.A single pillow or roll is preferable to multiple pillows. Sleeping on a stack of pillows can be harmful.

, If you have a brace to correct the curvature in your spine, it's important that you wear it as much as your doctor tells you to. Most patients are supposed to wear their braces 21 hours or more each day, which means they must keep them on at night., Staying active during the day may help alleviate any back pain you have. It will also help you burn energy, which will make it easier to fall asleep at night.


Aerobic exercise, stretching, and core-strengthening exercises are all great for people with scoliosis.Avoid contact sports, as well as competitive swimming, which can strain your back.

, People with scoliosis may produce lower levels of the hormone melatonin, which helps us sleep.Nighttime light, whether it's from a lamp, the television, or any other source, disrupts melatonin production for everyone, and this is especially bad for individuals who produce less of it to start with. Keep your room nice and dark to avoid disrupting your body's melatonin production.Children with scoliosis tend to have higher levels of growth hormone. When there are high levels of growth hormone in the body, melatonin levels will usually be low., If you have just been given a brace to wear for your scoliosis, you may feel like sleeping comfortably in it will be impossible. Luckily, most people get used to their braces quickly, so it probably won't bother you at all after a week or two.If you continue to have discomfort while sleeping after the first few weeks, talk to your doctor and see if any adjustments can be made to the brace.

, While some people do not experience any pain from scoliosis, others suffer from severe pain. If pain is keeping you awake at night, talk to your doctor about the best treatment options for you. There are a variety of ways to treat scoliosis pain, depending on the severity of your condition.For mild pain, you can take over-the-counter NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen. If your pain is more severe, your doctor may suggest that you take prescription pain medication.
Your doctor may also recommend spinal injections to help relieve pain, although these will only provide you with temporary relief.
Physical therapy or chiropractic treatment may help you achieve long-term pain relief.
If nothing else works to control your pain, your doctor may recommend surgery. The most common types of surgery performed for scoliosis are decompression surgery, which is done to remove a disc or bone that is compressing a nerve, and spinal fusion surgery, which is done to fuse two or more of the vertebrae together, thus improving the shape of the spine.

"
Diminish your time spent at the computer.Because repetitive strain injury (RSI) in the wrists, arms, or fingers is often caused by ongoing computer use, the less time you spend on your computer as you are trying to recover the better.,
Modify your work environment.,
Take regular breaks.Especially if you are unable to change your work duties and need to be on the computer for most of the day, it is important that you prioritize breaks every one to two hours to get up and walk around.,
Consider the psychosocial factors at your workplace.Stress at the workplace has been consistently linked to worse RSI, as well as to reduced speed of healing of the condition.,
Begin a regular exercise routine.Many people do not immediately think of an exercise routine as a potential solution to their RSI.,
See a physiotherapist or a physician sooner rather than later.If you find that your RSI has persisted beyond a few weeks without improvement, it is best to seek professional help sooner rather than later.",How to Recover from Repetitive Stress Injury Due to Computer Use1," The caveat to this, however, is that the majority of people who develop RSI are those whose livelihood depends on computer use. If this is the case for you, speak to your employer to see if there are any alternate duties you can take on for a while, instead of constant computer use.


If your pain is particularly severe, you may want to look into a leave of absence from work for a while as you recover. This may or may not be covered under your insurance.
If your work does not require a computer but you have developed RSI from excessive computer use at home, discipline yourself to spending significantly less time on your computer as you recover.
Consider meeting with friends in person, or watching shows on TV, as alternate modes of entertainment to substitute for being on your computer.;
, Make sure you have a comfortable seat to sit in while typing, to minimize stress on your shoulders and neck as you do your computer work. Also make sure that the screen is positioned so that your work is easily visible, without having to be in an awkward position to see your computer screen. Ensure that the keyboard is positioned at a comfortable height and distance from you to minimize stress and strain on your wrists as you type., Breaking up your typing pattern will help to prevent ongoing repetitive motions, all of which contribute to worsening RSI. Even getting up for 10–15 minutes can help to loosen up your muscles. An added bonus is that the mental break may also clear your thinking and allow you to be more productive when you return to the computer!


Try setting a timer to remind you to get up every hour.

, If you are finding that work is a draining environment for you emotionally and psychologically, consider speaking to your boss and/or your coworkers about strategies to reduce your stress. You may very well find that, as your mood at work increases, your pain diminishes, as a number of studies have shown this correlation.

, However, exercises releases endorphins, which are natural pain-killers in the brain. Therefore, regular exercise has been correlated with significant pain reduction throughout the body. Try swimming, riding a stationary bike, or whatever activity interests you. As long as you do it for at least 20–30 minutes, three or more times per week, and as long as it is something that gets your heart rate up and breaks a sweat, you will reap the benefits!

, People who receive treatment sooner have been shown to end up with better healing and results than those who wait to have their RSI evaluated by a professional.

"
"
Try over-the-counter painkillers.One of the quickest ways to diminish your symptoms of RSI is to opt for an over-the-counter painkiller.,
Get an injection.A less common medical option (normally reserved for more severe cases) is to get a steroid injection in the area where you are experiencing pain.,
Book an appointment with a physiotherapist.A physiotherapist (or physical therapist) can suggest exercises to strengthen and/or relax the affected muscles.,
Be aware of your expected recovery time.",How to Recover from Repetitive Stress Injury Due to Computer Use2," Common choices are Acetaminophen (Tylenol), which helps to mask the pain, or Ibuprofen (Advil), which helps with both pain and inflammation. The benefit of over-the-counter painkillers is that they can ease your pain and thus allow you to remain productive in the workplace. The downside, however, is that easing your pain with medication does not indicate true healing of your RSI.


Additional medical options to consider include muscle relaxants and/or tricyclic anti-depressant medications (which, in addition to treating symptoms of depression, can be very helpful at easing nerve-related pain). Speak to your doctor if you would like to consider these options.

, This may or may not be accompanied by an injection of a local anesthetic. Speak to your doctor to see if your RSI is severe enough to warrant this treatment.

, He or she can also provide insight as to how best to modify your posture at work to minimize the strain on the areas that are causing you the most pain. Additional treatments offered by physiotherapists include:


Ultrasound treatments
Infrared treatments
TENS (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation) which blocks pain signals using a mild electrical current.

, Most people suffering from RSI recover within 3-6 months.The speed of recovery will depend on factors such as your ability to take time away from the computer, the severity of your underlying injury, and your willingness to comply with the recommendations of your physiotherapist and/or physician.

"
Engage in self-care.,
Use positive self-talk.,
Get support.,
Think about your future.,
Learn more about arthritis.,
Focus on the good things in life.",How to Stay Positive when You Have Arthritis1," Self-care describes the process of being kind, forgiving, and generous with yourself. Treat yourself to a new perfume or a cool jacket you like. Schedule time at your local massage parlor or spa. Or just give yourself time to relax and decompress at home by reading a book or watching TV. These small acts of self-kindness will make you feel better about your situation., Instead of saying to yourself, “I am a loser because I have arthritis,” you should say, “It’s not my fault I developed arthritis. It happens to many people.” When you encounter a negative thought, push it away and counter it with a positive thought.For instance, if you observe yourself thinking, “I will never get better. My every waking moment will be filled with pain,” envision it as a red balloon in your mind’s eye. Then, let the balloon go and imagine it floating far away from you, never to return.
Picture a group of blue balloons floating down to replace the red one, each representing a positive thought like “I have a happy future ahead of me” and “There are many options for treating arthritis symptoms.”

, Surround yourself with people who care about and love you. Find and join an arthritis support group. Connecting with others who are going through the same thing you are will help you maintain a positive perspective and make you feel less alone.Talk to your support group. Family, friends, and support group members are there to listen and sympathize with you. Confide in them and be honest about your condition, whether you’re doing well or poorly.
Maybe set up standing lunch dates or other ways of spending time with your support network to help ensure that you see them regularly.
Avoid people who say things like, “Your arthritis is not that serious” or “Everyone has personal problems – don’t be a baby.”
You can find a support group by asking your doctor for recommendations or contacting arthritis organizations like Arthritis Introspective or the Arthritis Foundation.Pain management is also a very common theme in therapy. Seek out a therapist who can help you learn to cope with pain and deal with co-occurring depression or anxiety.

, Staying focused on your future means you’re not focused on your discomfort in the present, and that can help you maintain a positive perspective. You should look forward to both the near and long-term future, and imagine managing your arthritic pain and symptoms.In the near-term, you might look forward to going to see a movie with friends, or enjoying a great meal with your neighbors. Remember that it is very important to have things to look forward to! Again, standing appointments can help with this.
You might also look further into the future, to think about career goals, educational opportunities, and – most importantly – a life with few to no arthritis symptoms.
Make a list of your goals, hopes, and dreams.
Develop a realistic strategy to meet your goals and work to follow it. For example, if your goal is to graduate from college, you should investigate local colleges, find one that matches your interests and needs, and send in a few applications.

, In life, the unknown is often a source of great anxiety and fear. If you don’t know much about arthritis, it can be hard to have a positive perspective about it. The more you know about your condition, the better you’ll be able to maintain a realistic perspective, and avoid sliding into misery and negative thinking. Use conversations with your doctor, reputable online resources, and books at your local library to answer questions like:


Can I die from arthritis? (Your doctor should tell you that you cannot die from arthritis.)
Is there a cure for arthritis? (There is no cure for arthritis, but there are many symptom management techniques.)
What are the best foods for arthritic people? (Fruits and vegetables are the best foods for people with arthritis.)
Is arthritis contagious? (Your research will reveal that arthritis is not contagious.)

, Even if you have limitations due to arthritis, remember that you can still enjoy lots of things, such as beautiful weather, reading, and great conversations with your friends. Identify things you enjoy doing and people you enjoy spending time with. Take time out of your day to appreciate them.For instance, if you really like painting, write a “Thank you” note to your paints and brushes. You might write: “I enjoy painting so very much. Without art, life would be very bland and boring.”
If you’re thankful for a person, you should call them, write them a letter, or let them know in person that you really appreciate having them in your life. You could, for instance, say, “I am very thankful to have you in my life. Thank you for being there for me.”
Try to express gratitude for someone or something each day. One way to do this is to keep a gratitude journal and read it regularly. Perhaps start your mornings with affirming gratitude to set the tone for a positive day. For example, you might express gratitude for a good night’s sleep, a good cup of coffee, or a beautiful sunrise.

"
"
Exercise regularly.,
Get enough sleep.,
Eat right.,
Take action.",How to Stay Positive when You Have Arthritis2," Exercise releases endorphins – biological compounds that can improve your mood, relieve stress, and give you an emotional boost. Moving about can seem a chore when you have arthritis, but could should engage in exercise anyway. Talk with your doctor before beginning any exercise regimen.For instance, you could try weight training. Choose a pair of light hand weights and lift them to your chin at least 12 times. Rest briefly and repeat two more times. If you find you are not tired after lifting this mass, increase the weight slightly in two-pound increments. Lift in this way every other day.Walk for about 15 minutes each day. As your stamina increases, increase the time you spend walking in 5 minute increments.
You might experience some pain when you first start exercising, but it will dissipate in the short term as you continue your workout and in the long term as you build strength.
If you have serious pain – from moderate to severe – before working out, engage in a lighter workout, or try working out another area. For instance, if your arthritis is in your knees, just try lifting weights, or walking for five minutes instead of 15.
Stop exercising immediately if you have moderate or severe pain during your workout., If you don’t get enough sleep, you are more likely to experience depression and anxiety. Sleeping enough can not only improve your mood and keep you positive, but it can also reduce your arthritis symptoms. Adopt a regular bedtime and wakeup time.Aim for about eight hours of sleep each night.
Don’t eat or look at any LCD screens within three hours of your bedtime.
Make your room as dark as possible when sleeping. Close your blinds and turn the lights off.
Regulate the temperature and try to keep it between 60 to 67 degrees Fahrenheit. This is the optimal temperature range for sleep.Keep your phone off or far away from you so that you aren’t awakened by its sounds during the night.

, Some foods will exacerbate your arthritis, while others will relieve your arthritis symptoms. Try keeping a food journal to keep track of what foods seem to make your arthritis worse and what foods agree with you. Making positive decisions about your meals is empowering and will improve your attitude.Fish, soy (either tofu or edamame), olive oil, broccoli, green tea, and cherries are among the best foods for reducing arthritic inflammation.On the other hand, you should avoid processed foods loaded with sugar, salt, and unhealthy fats. Steer clear of potato chips, sweet candies, soda, red meat, cookies, and donuts. Alcohol, too, can cause inflammation and should be avoided.

, Many people use their arthritis or other medical conditions to conduct outreach and draw attention to their situation. You could, for instance, start an arthritis support group in your hometown, or create a website where people with arthritis can congregate and talk about their experiences. Using your arthritis as an inspiration to do something positive for others can help buoy your mood."
"
Keep your pain in perspective.,
Confront your fears.,
Don’t try to be upbeat all the time.",How to Stay Positive when You Have Arthritis3," Take your mind off suffering by volunteering to help others who are suffering in different ways. For example, you could volunteer at the local homeless shelter or soup kitchen to help people who struggle to get enough to eat and pay their bills. Thinking about how other people are struggling, too, will help you feel less alone in your fight against arthritic pain., Much unhappiness stems from an inability to really identify what it is you’re worried or unhappy about. While it might be easy for you to recognize that the physical pain of arthritis makes you unhappy, you might have a harder time understanding or recognizing the deeper fears arthritis inspires.For instance, you might fear that people won’t respect you, or people will think you are weak just because you have arthritis. Analyze your thoughts carefully and write these fears down.
Simply writing your fears in a diary or journal can lead to a more positive tomorrow.Talk to a trusted friend or therapist about your fears, so that they can help give you objective perspective.

, It is unrealistic to feel good about your situation all the time, even for people who don’t have arthritis. While you should always try to look on the bright side, don’t beat yourself up for feeling blue.Honor that you are having a bad day, and tell yourself ""tomorrow will be better.""


Don't try to put on a brave face for the sake of others, or out of fear that others will think you are weak. Be honest about your feelings and fears.

"
Evaluate the initial injury.,
Be aware of ""red flags"" that warrant immediate medical attention.,
Be sure to rest.,
Avoid strenuous activity.,
Use ice and/or heat.,
Consider the duration of the injury.,
Opt for physiotherapy and/or massage.Especially if you have a muscular injury affecting your back, receiving physiotherapy and/or massage treatment may help to speed recovery and to diminish the pain.,
Look into a chiropractor or an osteopath.Sometimes an ""adjustment"" is needed in your back to help you heal.,
Adapt your sleeping situation.,
Pay attention to proper posture and lifting techniques.,
Ensure a gradual recovery plan.,
Check into worker's compensation if this applies to you.",How to Recover From a Back Injury1," This can be difficult when you have pain throbbing up and down your spine, as it may seem to come from every part of the back; however, with an injury there should be one main focal area. Press gently along your spine with your fingers, starting with the lower back and moving upwards. You may need someone to help you do this; some areas of the spine are difficult to get to.


Assess the quality of the pain — note whether it is dull and achy, sharp and stabbing, burning, or whatever other ""descriptors"" you would use for your pain. Keep a record of this for a few days after your injury to see how the pain progresses.
To get a good baseline, rate your pain on a scale of one to 10, with 10 being the worst pain you’ve ever had. After a few days, rate it again. You can do this every three to four days to see if you are improving. Research shows that this is a valid way to monitor your current pain.If you do end up needing to see a doctor for your back injury, having information regarding the quality of the pain, and the progression of the pain (improving or worsening following the injury), can be very helpful in establishing a diagnosis and treatment plan.;
, If you are in so much pain that you cannot walk or are finding it hard to feel your legs, get somebody to take you to the hospital. Do not try to take yourself there; if your back worsens and you find you cannot move you may end up stuck somewhere on the way, and you possibly may end up in danger. You may also want to seek immediate medical attention if you develop the following symptoms:A feeling of numbness in the pelvis or lower back, and the area surrounding it.
Shooting pains down one or both legs.
Feeling weak or unsteady when you try to stand, or your legs suddenly giving way beneath you either when you are standing normally or bending.
Problems with controlling your bowels or bladder.

, Assuming your back injury is not severe enough to warrant going to the hospital, allow yourself some rest time at home to see if your back pain improves. You may wish to spend the first few days in bed until the pain becomes more comfortable. Watch some DVDs or some TV, read a few good books, and keep yourself entertained. Do not spend too long in bed though, because this can make your back stiff, which can slow the healing process.


Note that while rest is important initially after an injury, lying in bed for too long can delay recovery. It’s best to only rest for 24 hours. If you can, make sure you get out of bed, even if only for a few minutes every hour. Becoming active sooner can reduce a delay in recovery.

, Especially during the initial stages of your injury, it is important to take it easy and to not do anything that worsens your back pain or could possibly further the injury. Take time off work if needed, and file a workers compensation claim if the injury was sustained at the workplace. Or, if you cannot take a ""leave"" from work, perhaps ask your boss if you can have alternate duties such as a desk job for a while as you recover (if your usual job consisted of heavy lifting or other manual labor).


As you recover, avoid standing or sitting in the same position over prolonged periods of time if this exacerbates your back pain.Also avoid sports or physical activity that risk further damage to your back. See a physician for guidelines on when and how to return to activity in the safest manner possible.

, If you are in a good deal of pain while you are healing, you could try applying ice or heat. Ice will help control inflammation, and is especially effective right after the incident (for an acute injury). Heat should not be used until around three days after the injury has been sustained, as it can contribute to inflammation during this time. After those three days however it is effective in relaxing painful muscle spasms and relieving tension in the ligaments and muscles.


To ice your back, wrap a cold pack, bag of ice, or even a bag of frozen vegetables in a thin towel and apply it to your injury for 15 – 20 minutes. Allow your skin to return to normal temperature before you begin to ice again. Never apply ice directly to your back.If you still have pain after three days or if your back pain is chronic, you can apply heat. Try a heating pad, a hot water bottle, or a heat pack.Again, the heat should not be applied directly to your skin – use a thin towel or even a t-shirt to wrap the heat source and protect your skin.

, There are two types of back pain: acute and chronic. Acute is a type of injury that is there for a few days and then goes away, best described as ""coming and going."" Symptoms are often reasonably intense and heal in around four to six weeks. Chronic pain is more of a persistent pain that lasts between three to six months, or longer.


Particularly if your back pain is not improving, it is important to see a doctor sooner rather than later. Medical studies have shown that faster intervention from your doctor can help to prevent an acute (short-term) injury from becoming a chronic (long-term) one.

, You may receive some coverage for these if it is a work-related injury.

, Seeing a chiropractor or an osteopath for an assessment is an excellent idea if you find that your back pain is not getting better on its own.

, If you are suffering from ongoing back pain, it might be worthwhile to consider buying a new mattress (if you are finding your current one uncomfortable).Another option to consider is sleeping with a pillow between your legs. For some back injuries, this can diminish the stress put on your back while sleeping and thus reduce pain.

, Once you begin resuming basic activities of daily living, make sure that you are paying attention to proper posture. Keep your back straight when sitting, making sure you take frequent breaks and move around at least once every 30 to 60 minutes. When getting out of bed, make sure you practice proper techniques. To start off, lie on your back and keep your knees bent and feet flat. Then roll to the side, slowly moving your legs over the bed. From this position, use your arm that is against the bed to help slowly push you up into a sitting position. When lifting, make sure you use your legs. If you are going to lift an object, make sure you keep it close to your body at all times.

, The most important thing when recovering from back pain is to have a ""slow and steady"" approach - in other words, not to rush back to work or to activities, as you do not want to cause further damage. Speak to your doctor and/or physiotherapist or other healthcare professional about a gradual return to work and to activities.

, If you injured your back ""on the job,"" you may be eligible for financial compensation that can help to cover lost time at work, as well as any medical treatments, medications, and physiotherapy sessions. It is definitely worth looking into as it can significantly cut back on the costs of treatment.

Take over-the-counter painkillers.,
See your doctor for prescription painkillers.,
Get an injection.Depending upon the specific type of injury in your back, sometimes an injection (of a corticosteroid medication, normally, which works to fight inflammation and pain) can be of great help.,
Consider an implantable device and/or surgery.As a last resort for severe back pain, surgeons can either implant a device that stimulates your spinal cord to help diminish pain, or they can perform back surgery if there is an anatomical injury that can be resolved through surgery.,
Be aware of depression as a co-morbidity with back pain.,
Understand the possible diagnoses that cause back pain.Knowing the cause of your back pain can be very helpful to healing it effectively.",How to Recover From a Back Injury2," For back injuries that are not overly severe, taking Acetaminophen (Tylenol) and/or Ibuprofen (Advil) for pain control and inflammation may be of help.Both of these medications are available over-the-counter at your local pharmacy or drugstore. Follow the dosing instructions on the bottle.


Robaxacet is another option for pain control that also contains a muscle relaxant property.If your back pain is caused from a strained or injured muscle, this is likely to be your best bet to help to alleviate the pain, as well as to speed recovery.

, If you have sustained a more severe back injury, you may need to opt for stronger pain medications. Interestingly enough, medical trials have shown that getting the pain under control early in a back injury is key to optimal healing. This is because chronic back pain can become a neurological pattern in the central nervous system which makes it more difficult to get rid of the longer you have had it for.


Stronger painkillers include prescription strength Naproxen or Tylenol #3 (Tylenol mixed with Codeine), among others., Speak to your doctor if you are interested, or to your naturopath for ""prolotherapy"" (which is the ""natural equivalent"" to a corticosteroid injection).

, Note that both of these are ""last resort"" options that are only considered after you have ""failed"" to improve with lifestyle methods, rest, and medication., More than 50% of people with chronic back pain develop temporary or ongoing depression alongside the back pain, oftentimes related to the disability they face as a result of the injury. If you feel like you may have depression, or be at risk of developing it, speak to your doctor for guidance and medication if needed., Some of the most common causes of back pain include:


Poor posture at work, with too much standing or continually sitting in one position.
A muscular injury leading to muscle spasms.
Degenerative disc disease.
A herniated disc.
Spinal stenosis - where the vertebral canal (housing your spinal cord) narrows over time.
Other more rare conditions such as a tumor, a fracture, or an infection in your spinal canal.

Educate yourself about arthritis.,
Assemble a healthcare team that respects and listens to you.,
Become your own advocate.,
Find a support group.,
Trust yourself.",How to Stay Positive Through Arthritis Pain1," In order to stay positive through arthritis pain, you need to stay informed about your condition.

A good place to begin is the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases., Taking control of your arthritis means putting together a group of experts that can help you navigate your pain and stay positive. This team can include an arthritis specialist, a primary care practitioner, and even a mental health professional if you are suffering from associated depression or anxiety.Your team will depend on your needs. You might see a rheumatologist to help identify the kind of arthritis you have, for example. You might also need to work with an orthopedic surgeon, an osteopathic physician, a podiatrist (for foot issues), or physical and occupational therapists.
Your team should listen and ask questions about your pain, how treatments are working, your mental health, and your feelings about specific approaches to dealing with your arthritis.
Ideally your healthcare team will communicate with one another to provide the best possible treatments for your arthritis symptoms, including pain.

, Managing your pain and condition in a positive way means you will need to become your own advocate. Stay up to date on current research, and always ask questions about any tests or treatments your doctor orders as well as alternative treatments. Ask for a record of all tests and medical files after each visit, and keep a chronological medical file at home.Being your own advocate means keeping track of doctors’ appointments, medical records, laboratory tests, prescriptions, and possible drug interactions.

, It’s important to have a good support structure in place when you are dealing with arthritis. You can learn from the experiences of others, and you can also teach others what you have learned on your journey. These connections can help you stay positive. Try looking for a support group in your area or search online for one., Over the course of your illness you will encounter multiple healthcare professionals, friends, family members, acquaintances, and co-workers. Many of these people will not fully understand your illness or how it is affecting you as an individual. If you experience pain, feel a treatment is not working, or realize you need to make a lifestyle change because of your illness, trust your body and yourself.

Use food as medicine.,
Get enough sleep.,
Move your body according to your ability and situation.,
Keep a journal.,
Don’t be afraid to ask for help.",How to Stay Positive Through Arthritis Pain2," Many people suffering from arthritis pain are successful in alleviating it to some degree through diet.

Explore different dietary approaches and try one that fits with your lifestyle and nutritional needs.Add anti-inflammatory foods to your diet. These include fruits such as pineapple, tart cherries, and beets. You can also try fish rich in omega-3 fat like salmon, tuna, and mackerel, and other healthy oils like olive oil.
Try eliminating foods known to trigger inflammation, including transfats and gluten.
Include foods in your diet that strengthen bones and boost your immune system, too. Good foods for bone strength include broccoli and dairy, which are rich in calcium and vitamins D and K. Try things like green tea and citrus fruit to help your immune system.

, Sleeping well is an important part of cultivating positivity when you are dealing with arthritis pain. Aim for eight hours of sleep each night, and avoid alcohol and caffeine in the hours before you sleep., Exercise boosts your mood and is an important part of managing arthritis. You should exercise according to your ability, pain level, and disease progression. Talk to your doctor before starting a new exercise regimen.Yoga, swimming, walking, and spinning are all exercises that can be beneficial to those suffering from arthritis.

, Dealing with chronic disease like arthritis can be an emotional rollercoaster. Keeping a journal can help you maintain balance and stay positive when you are dealing with arthritis pain. You can also use a journal to track your symptoms and possible triggers, which can help you maintain better control of your arthritis.

, One of the hardest parts of having arthritis is not being able to do things you once did without pain, and asking for help can be even more difficult. Learning to ask for help can ease your pain, improve your mood, and deepen your connections with others. Don’t be afraid to ask friends, family members, or coworkers to lend a helping hand when pain prohibits you from doing something.


Try saying, “Sis, going grocery shopping is really tough for me because lifting the bags flares up my arthritis. Do you think you could help me once a week?”
Before yoga class, you can say to your teacher, “Bruce, I cannot do poses that put pressure on my wrists, like downward facing dog. Could you give me some alternate poses instead?”

Maintain a positive self-image.,
Nourish your social relationships.,
Establish healthy coping strategies.,
Reframe the negative aspects of arthritis.,
Practice gratitude.,
Consider seeing a counselor or therapist.",How to Stay Positive Through Arthritis Pain3," It’s important that you cultivate a positive self-image in the face of arthritis pain. It can be easy to get down on yourself when you’re suffering, especially if you’re struggling to do things that were once easy for you. It’s possible to challenge these doubts, though, and to accept and love yourself.Try making a list of all your positive qualities. You can also ask a loved one to help and describe what they think are your positive qualities. Post this list somewhere you’ll see it every day.
Set reasonable goals for yourself and recognize achievement. Negative self-image dwells on faults and weaknesses. Say you used to walk three miles per day but now manage one. One is still impressive! Rather than focus on what you can’t do, look at what you are still able to accomplish.

, Stay connected with friends, family, and co-workers. They will make you laugh, listen to your problems, and celebrate your victories. If you feel you need deeper connections in your life, try meeting new people by joining a group that organizes an activity you enjoy, like traveling, swimming, or hiking., Dealing with pain is one of life’s biggest challenges. It is important to develop healthy coping strategies as part of your arthritis management program. Instead of turning to unhealthy strategies like abusing alcohol or drugs, try going for a nature walk, taking a long bath, or reading a novel.Try meditation. Deep breathing and meditation can reduce pain by helping you relax and ease tension. Repetition is key – try focusing on your breath, a word, or a phrase and block out distractions. You can even try taking a meditation class.
Reduce stress. Stress and anxiety can sharpen your body’s sensitivity to pain. De-stressing by playing calm music, reading a good book, treating yourself to a hot bath or massage, or exercising can give relief from chronic pain.
Avoid alcohol. Pain makes it hard to sleep and alcohol can worsen sleep problems, which will not improve your quality of life. Using drugs and alcohol to manage pain can also lead to serious substance abuse problems.

, When you are suffering from a chronic disease, it is easy to focus on all the negative aspects of your struggle. Think about ways your arthritis has actually had a positive impact on your life.


For example, maybe your experience with chronic pain has made you a more empathetic person.
Or perhaps your experience with arthritis has made you less judgmental of others, because you now know that many people struggle with invisible pain and disease.

, Staying positive means taking time to be thankful for what is good in your life. Gratitude helps put things in perspective and can help foster a healthier sense of self. Try writing in a gratitude journal each day. You can also create a gratitude jar and place one positive thing for which you are thankful in the jar every day., Mental health professionals can help you cultivate resilience and maintain positivity when you are dealing with a chronic disease like arthritis. Talk to your health insurance provider about what types of counseling services your plan covers, and then contact a provider who might be able to meet your needs.

Check for swelling in and around the joint.,
Look for red and shiny skin where you are experiencing pain.,
Look for peeling or flaky skin around the joint.,
Ask yourself whether you have limited mobility in the impacted joint.",How to Recognize Gout Symptoms1," Ask yourself whether it feels very sensitive and painful. Pain and discomfort in the big toe is a common sign of gout., Consider whether any of these joints feel uncomfortable or painful. Gout can impact any joint in the body but most commonly manifests in these joints. If you are experiencing discomfort in one or more of these joints, your doctor may come to the conclusion that you have gout., Touch your joint and feel whether it is hot and tender. If so, you may be experiencing a symptom that is common with gout., If you see redness and swelling of the joint, you are experiencing another symptom that is commonly associated with gout., If the skin around the joint is very red and shiny, you have another symptom of gout.Consider whether your skin looks very red around your joints, which is also common with gout.

, This symptom is also commonly associated with gout.Check if the skin is flaking off your ankles or toes. If you have a lot of flaky skin, this could be a sign of gout.

, This is another common symptom of gout.For instance, try wiggling your big toe up and down. If you are able to do this movement without pain, it is a good sign.

Determine if your pain is mostly at night.,
Record the intensity of your symptoms.,
Record the total duration of your painful attacks.,
Figure out whether your symptoms are becoming worse over time.",How to Recognize Gout Symptoms2," Although the pain of a gout attack can come at any time of the day, most people experience it the worst at night., Determine whether your joints feel very painful all of a sudden and for a few hours at a time. Gout attacks typically develop fast and over a few hours at the beginning stages of the condition.An acute gout attack will be most painful about 12 to 24 hours after it starts., Typically, a gout attack will last between three and 10 days. If the attack is not treated, it will last longer.


Try recording the duration of your symptoms in a health journal.

, If untreated, gout symptoms (e.g., pain, swelling) will become worse over time. If you are experiencing these symptoms, you should see a doctor."

Figure out whether you are in a high risk demographic.,
Look into whether you have a family history of gout.,
Find out if you are overweight.,
Assess your diet with a food diary.Write down everything you eat for one week in order to determine your level of consumption of meat, seafood, sugar, and alcohol.,
Assess medications that may increase risk.,
Reflect on your recent history of surgery and trauma.",How to Recognize Gout Symptoms3," Typically, men are at a higher risk for gout than women and the level of risk increases with age. So, older men are definitely at an increased risk for gout. The risk for gout increases significantly for women who have already gone through menopause.Men are at highest risk of developing gout between the ages of 30 and 50., Figure out whether your father, mother, grandparents, or great grandparents experienced gout. You could ask your parents or other family members if they know of any family history of gout. If you have a family history of gout, you are more at risk of getting it., If you are too heavy, your body makes more uric acid and your kidneys have a harder time getting rid of it. These factors make you more susceptible to gout.


Use a body mass index calculator online. This index is a measure of body fat based on height and weight. Enter your height and weight into an online body mass index calculator, and then hit “calculate.” You can then compare your body mass index to the healthy index projected for your age and sex.Ask your doctor to determine whether you are overweight. Your doctor has a number of different measurements and tools that they can use to determine your current and healthy weight.

, Once you have tracked your level of consumption of these items for one week, you should review your patterns of consumption (e.g., how often you drink sugary soft drinks and at what times of the day). If you regularly consume a lot of meat, sugar, and alcohol, you are at a higher risk for gout.Findings suggest that if men maintain a diet that has a lot of sugar from soft drinks they are more likely to get gout. Drinking soft drinks on a daily basis will greatly increase your risk.Eating a diet with a lot of meat and seafood (high-purine foods) is a risk factor for gout.
Alcohol consumption is a trigger for gout attacks. Drinking will likely trigger an attack within 24 hours and your risk increases relative to the amount you drink.If you are unsure of your diet, you could go see a dietitian or doctor. It can help to bring your food diary with you, so they have an idea of how much sugar, meat, and alcohol you currently consume., Medications used to treat hypertension as well as drugs that suppress the immune system, such as those prescribed to people to treat rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, or who have undergone an organ transplant can sometimes increase the risk of gout., If you have recently experienced surgery or trauma, you may also be at a higher risk for gout.If you have any kind of surgery, you are at an increased risk.Undergoing chemotherapy can also be a trigger for gout."
"
Start your initial recovery in the hospital.When the general anesthesia following your joint replacement surgery wears off, you will find yourself in a place called the ""recovery room,"" also known as the post anesthesia care unit, or PACU.,
Have your pain managed with medication.After the numbing effects of the anesthesia (used during surgery) wear off, you will need to be put on pain medication to ease the pain following surgery.,
Work with a physiotherapist.You can expect to receive a visit from the hospital physiotherapist the day following your joint replacement surgery to begin a rehabilitation program.,
Monitor for any post-surgical complications.Another reason that it is important to stay in the hospital following your joint replacement surgery is so that the nurses and doctors can monitor for any post-surgical complications, and handle these immediately should they arise (they occur in approximately 2% of patients).Things your doctor will be looking for include proper wound healing with no signs of infection, as well as preventing the formation of blood clots (both by monitoring you as well as providing blood thinning medications and sometimes compression stockings).,
Plan your next steps after discharge from the hospital.You will most likely be working with a PT (a physical therapist therapist) and a discharge planning nurse to organize your next steps after you leave the hospital.,
Continue with regular physiotherapy.After being discharged from the hospital, people who have received a joint replacement surgery are generally advised to continue with physiotherapy 3 to 4 times per week.,
Recruit help from family and friends.If you are returning home and are not yet capable of completing all living tasks on your own, now is the time to reach out and ask for help from family and friends.,
Contact your employer and discuss your return to work.Depending upon which joint you received surgery on, as well as the nature of the job you do, you may need to take a short leave of absence from work as you recover.,
Ensure that your surgical incision is healing well.You will want to keep an eye on your surgical wound as the weeks go by to ensure that it is healing properly.,
Attend all scheduled follow-up visits.Following a joint replacement surgery, follow-up visits are generally scheduled with your surgeon at the 3 week mark, the 6 week mark, the 3 month mark, the 6 month mark, and the 12 month mark.,
Return to physical activity as directed.An essential part of a good recovery is returning to physical activity as recommended by your physiotherapist and healthcare team.",How to Recover from Joint Replacement Surgery," This is where patients stay until they wake up, and even a few hours after that to ensure that the initial recovery from surgery is going well. There is supervision from nurses in the recovery room, and your surgeon may come in to check on you to ensure that you are doing well following the procedure.


After a few hours in the recovery room, you will be transferred to a hospital bed where you will be spending anywhere from one to five nights.
It depends upon the type of joint replacement surgery you had (which joint was operated on), as well as the severity and degree of repairs needed.
Your doctor will inform you of how many nights you need to stay in hospital, and she, or he, will check in on you daily, in addition to the rest of your healthcare team (nurses, physiotherapists, etc).;
, Your doctor will prescribe these and the nurses will administer them. You will most likely be receiving pain medications orally (in pill form), and the dose will continually decrease as your body heals following surgery.


Keep your surgeon and the nurses looking after you informed about how well the pain medication is working for you.
If the dosage prescribed by your doctor is insufficient to control the pain, let the staff know so that they can offer you additional strategies for pain control.

, In the initial stages following surgery, the movements suggested by your physiotherapist will be small and minimal. The goal in the initial stages is to keep the circulation flowing to the affected joint (the one that was operated on), while not moving too much so as not to disrupt the alignment of the joint or interfere with joint healing in any way.


The extent of the physiotherapy exercises will increase in the weeks following surgery, after initial healing has taken place.
While in hospital, you can expect to see a physiotherapist one or two times per day.

,


The risk of blood clots following surgery is heightened due to your relative immobility during the initial recovery phase as well as the surgical site is in proximity to the veins.

, After receiving joint replacement surgery, some people (particularly elderly patients) go on to spend a few days to a few weeks in what is called an ""intermediate care facility"" or ""rehabilitation facility."" This is a place where they can receive additional care that is not at the level of a hospital, but that is much more helpful than trying to cope alone at home.


If you have people who can help you in the initial recovery stages at home, an intermediate care facility may not be needed.
Also, if your surgery was more minor and will not interfere with your ability to function day-to-day around the home, you may be able to manage returning home immediately after you leave the hospital.
These decisions will be made on a case-by-case basis in conjunction with the expertise of your healthcare team.

, This is one of the mainstays of treatment following surgery, and will be a key factor playing into how well you recover (better adherence with physiotherapy correlates with a better recovery).


You may also receive a mobility aid, such as a walker, a wheelchair, or crutches, depending upon the type of surgery you have had. If it is surgery involving your shoulder joint, you will likely be given a sling.

, For instance, they may be able to give you a hand with cleaning, shopping, and other errands during the first couple weeks following surgery. They may also be able to help by driving you places, if the joint you received surgery on prevents you from being able to drive on your own.


In more severe cases, you may also need help with bathing, dressing, cooking, and with other day-to-day tasks.
You may be comfortable asking a family member to help you with these things.
Alternatively, you can hire nursing support, either for a few hours per day or as a 24 hour live-in support, to help you in the initial stages as you recover from your surgery.
You can also ask family and friends to help move furniture so that your home is set up in a way that poses the least hassle to you for ambulation.
If possible, you may ask that things be arranged so that you can stay on one floor of the house (as opposed to having to climb stairs, if this is a challenge for you following joint replacement surgery). Check with your surgeon if you are restricted from using stairs and for how long.
You may also need assistance getting in and out of the car, or changing positions in general, if you are severely set back following surgery. Your surgeon can provide advice on this if it is an issue for you.

, Another option, if you cannot do certain physical aspects of your job after surgery, is to ask your boss about giving you alternate duties at the workplace.


If you need to take time off work to recover, look into employee insurance and any other benefits you may have to help cover healthcare costs.

, You will most likely be returning to your surgeon approximately 14 days after surgery to have the staples removed - staples are what tend to be used these days to hold the edges of your wound together after surgery. At this time, your surgeon can also provide his or her opinion on your wound healing to date.


You can use an ice pack for 10 to 15 minutes as needed to help with pain and/or swelling around your incision.
Avoid using creams, lotions, or ointments over the incision as these may interfere with proper healing.
Your surgeon will have instructed you about the dose and type of pain medication you are advised to take to control any pain at the incision point and in the joint itself following your joint replacement surgery.
Contact your doctor if you notice unusual redness and heat around your incision (this may be a sign of infection), if there is any drainage from the wound, or if the pain is progressively getting worse rather than better.

, After that, you can expect to receive annual check-up to assess your implant and to ensure that it is still functioning well. In order to set yourself up for optimum recovery and the best health moving forwards, it is key that you attend all follow-up visits. You can also bring up any additional concerns or questions with your doctor at this time.

, If you remain sedentary after a joint replacement surgery, or do minimal activity, your chances of developing a strong and optimally mobile new joint are much smaller than if you adhere to the physical activity recommendations.


While it is important to be physically active, it is also wise to avoid hazardous activities that could potentially re-injure your joint. Practice caution and moderation as you recover.
Physical activity recommendations may include a gradual return to walking, followed by more complex activities like climbing the stairs (for joint replacement surgeries that are severe enough to have set you back in your basic day-to-day functioning).
For more minor joint replacement surgeries, and/or for younger individuals who normally play sports, your return to physical activity will include recommendations as to how to get back into your sport of interest in the safest way possible (often starting with non-contact drills and proceeding to more intense play once your joint is fully recovered).

You know your body and back best. Though you should choose a mattress based on personal preference, try staying away from soft mattresses.
It's true that a soft mattress may conform nicely to the natural form of your body; however, if it's too malleable, the mattress may actually twist your joints at night, which could lead to discomfort.Other considerations include features such as the coils and springs, to the padding and depth of the mattress.;
, If you’ve never used oils, consider giving them a try now. Oils are often used in aromatherapy to promote healing on both a physical and mental level. Though they can be used in a variety of ways, it is most common to apply them directly onto your skin.


The most common way to use oils is to massage them into your skin.
Consider purchasing spruce. Not only does it stimulate your immune system, but it has proven helpful in easing a variety of symptoms from arthritis and rheumatism, to lower back pain.
Those who frequently use oils will agree that lavender is their go to oil for relaxation and pain relief.Never consume these oils. They should be applied to your body as directed on the bottle.
You can purchase oils online or through major retailers such as Walmart.

, Though there are many ways to reduce back pain, more than ever people are seeking natural remedies to ease symptoms such as pain and inflammation. Some of these remedies have been used for hundreds of years; however, there is often little scientific evidence to back the use of supplements and they are not regulated by the FDA, so speak with your doctor before trying any of the following.


Fish oil is one supplement to consider. One of the best, natural remedies for inflammation is Omega-3 polyunsaturated fats, which are found in fish oil.Green tea is another great product to try.

, Hot packs can be used in combination with ice packs, so don't forget to add those to your list as well. Heat actually helps to improve oxygen in the blood and aids in the treatment of back spasms and pain.Apply the hot pack for about 10–15 minutes. Don't leave it on there for too long!
Heat is best used to treat chronic pain.

, Chronic back pain may be due to muscle knots, or also known as trigger points. These muscles knots can be addressed by applying direct pressure on muscle knots, helping you relieve pain and discomfort.

For the pelvic tilt, sit on the ball with your feet hip width apart. Your back should be straight and your hands should be resting on your legs. Without moving your glute and leg muscles, bring your pelvis up and slightly forward so that your lower back is flat.
Do hip circles. Start in the same position as the pelvic tilt by sitting on the ball with your feet hip width apart. Place your hands on your hips and sit up straight. Roll your pelvis in small circles. You can widen the circles for a more in-depth workout.

, In correspondence with back exercises, take the time to strengthen your core. The abdomen, pelvis, hip, butt and lower back are known as the core and are actually responsible for posture and stability, which can help to improve back pain.


Try swimmers. Lay facedown on a yoga mat. Stretch your arms straight out in front of you. Keep your spine straight as you slowly raise both your right arm and left leg a few inches off the mat. Slowly lower them back down, then repeat the motion using your left arm and right leg.

Do a side plank. Position yourself on your side, with your body straight. Support your upper body on your elbow, while raising your core off the ground. Make sure you keep your back in a straight line. Hold position as long as you comfortably can. Repeat four to five times more.

, Stretches should be another crucial part of your exercise routine, as they help to improve flexibility. There are many easy stretches you can do from home.


To ensure a healthy lower back, it's important to increase flexibility in key muscles such as the abs, hamstrings, hip flexors and lower back.Try the cat stretch. This stretch is easy to do from home and will help to improve flexibility. Kneel with your arms on the floor in front of you shoulder width apart. Push your spine to the ceiling and hold, then push your spine down and lift your head.

, Not only is it a great way to relax, but getting a massage can actually help to relieve lower back pain. You will want to speak to the massage therapist ahead of time to indicate which areas are the most problematic.


There are two key areas to focus on when getting a massage: the quadratus lumborum (QL) and the gluteus medius.
You should ask your massage therapist to spend the majority of time on these two muscles.
If you are already being treated for severe back pain, talk to your doctor first before booking a massage.
It is not recommended that you let an amateur work on your back. Seek the help of a professional.

Recognize the symptoms.,
Go to the doctor if you think you have a herniated disk.,
Get imaging tests if your doctor recommends it.,
Get nerve tests.",How to Recover From a Herniated Disk1," The most frequent areas for herniated disks are in the lower spine and the neck. If your herniated disk is in your lower back, then you will probably have pain in your legs. If the herniated disk is in your neck, then your shoulder and arm will probably hurt. Symptoms include:Pain in your limbs. The pain may become more intense when you cough, sneeze, or move in certain ways.
Numbness or feelings of pins and needles. This occurs when the nerves that run to that extremity are affected by the herniated disk.
Weakness. If your lower back is affected you may be more likely to trip and fall. If your neck is affected, you may have difficulty carrying heavy items.;
, The doctor will do a medical exam to determine exactly where your pain comes from. The doctor will likely ask about your medical history including any recent injuries. The doctor may also test your:Reflexes
Muscle strength
Coordination, balance, and ability to walk
Sense of touch. The doctor may test whether you feel light touches or vibrations on various different areas of your body.
Ability to raise your leg or move your head. These movements stretch the spinal nerves. If you get increased pain, numbness, or pins and needles, it may suggest that a disk is herniated.

, These tests can be used to exclude other possible causes of your pain and to let the doctor see exactly what is happening to your disks. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or think you could be pregnant because it may influence which tests the doctor recommends.An X-ray. Your doctor may ask you to get an X-ray to verify that your pain is not caused by an infection, tumor, broken bone, or misalignment of the bones in your spine. The doctor may also suggest a myelogram with the X-ray. This involves putting dye into your spinal fluid which will show up on an X-ray. It helps the doctor see where disks might be pressing on your nerves.
A computerized tomography scan (CT scan). During a CT scan you will lie on a table that moves into the scanner. The scanner will take sequential X-rays of the area of interest. The doctor may ask you to hold your breath briefly to make sure the picture will be clear. It will not hurt, but you may be asked to fast for a few hours before the test or be given a contrast dye beforehand. The test will probably take about 20 minutes or less. This test can help the doctor determine exactly which disks are affected.Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). An MRI scanner uses magnets and radio waves to create pictures of your body. An MRI is especially useful for determining exactly which disk has herniated and what nerves it might be pressing on. This test does not hurt, but requires that you lie on a table that will slide into the scanner. The scanner will make loud noises and you will probably get earphones or earplugs to wear. It may take up to an hour and a half.This is the most sensitive imaging test, but also the most expensive.

, If the doctor is concerned that you may have damage to your nerves, you may be asked to get nerve conduction tests and an electromyogram.During the nerve conduction tests the doctor may administer a small electrical pulse to determine if it is correctly conveyed to specific muscles.
During the electromyogram, the doctor inserts a thin needle into your muscle to measure the electrical pulses that arrive.
Both procedures may be uncomfortable.

Consult your doctor.,
Choose activities that accommodate you.,
Try a variety of activities.,
Plan on warming up and cooling down.",How to Stay Active with Psoriatic Arthritis1," Most people with psoriatic arthritis can safely develop their own physical activity regimen based on their needs. However, if you have a complicating factor – heart disease, arrhythmia, or a similar condition – you should consult your doctor before adopting a new physical activity regimen.If you’re taking prescription medication, you should also ask your doctor how you can stay active with psoriatic arthritis.;
, Do not attempt exercises that exceed your capabilities. Pushing yourself too hard could result in injury. If you are elderly or infirm in addition to having psoriatic arthritis, stick to moderate-intensity exercises when staying active with psoriatic arthritis.Rest as needed.
Do not irritate painful joints. For instance, if your elbow hurts due to psoriatic arthritis, try running or walking instead of lifting weights., You might not like every activity, but in trying various sorts of activities, you might discover some new ones to relieve your psoriatic arthritis. And trying a variety of different activities helps you prevent boredom with a predictable physical activity regimen., Warmup and cooldown exercises should precede and conclude, respectively, any period of physical activity. Work with your physical therapist to identify beneficial warmup and cooldown exercises. These might include:extending your arms straight out from your sides and rotating them in concentric circles forward and backward
lunges
pushups
sit-ups
reaching down and touching your toes, and holding the position for ten seconds
swinging your legs forward and back, and from side-to-side, in the manner of a pendulum

Take notice of any joint pain.,
Look for joint swelling and redness.,
Watch for joint stiffness.,
Be aware of unusual fatigue.,
Be aware of reduced range of motion.,
Take note of sudden weakness.,
Look for any joint deformities.,
Watch for any skin changes.,
Understand what OA is.,
Learn about RA.,
Don't confuse gout with OA or RA.",How to Recognize Arthritis Symptoms," Joint pain is the most characteristic symptom of all types of arthritis.You might notice the pain after exercising or using the joints extensively, which is the case with ""wear and tear"" arthritis (OA), or upon waking and after periods of disuse, which is more characteristic of RA.


Arthritic pain is usually described as dull, achy and/or throbbing. The more destructive types of arthritis can also generate sharp and electric-type pain.
Arthritic pain usually starts out mild, then progressively gets worse. The pain levels of OA gradually worsen, whereas some really inflammatory types (such as gout attacks) become extremely painful very suddenly.;
, Although the term arthritis literally means joint inflammation, some types involve much more swelling than others. In general, the wear and tear of OA doesn't lead to much swelling or redness. In contrast, RA involves lots of swelling and redness because the body's immune system attacks the lining of the joint capsule (synovial membrane).Gout is also known for lots of inflammation due to the deposit of sharp uric acid crystals within joint capsules, particularly of the big toe.


PsA also involves the immune system attacking joints, which is why it's classified as an autoimmune disorder, so swelling and redness are more noticeable.
RA not only causes severe inflammation in affected joints (usually of the hands and wrists), but also low-grade inflammation throughout the body.
Not being able to remove your rings is a sign of swelling in the joints of the hands.

, Stiffness is another common early sign of virtually all types of arthritis.It's the inability to freely move joints due to pain, swelling and/or some degree of joint destruction. Along with stiffness, you may also feel or hear creaking or cracking sounds as you move joints after periods of inactivity, especially with OA.


Initially, stiffness doesn't usually involve reduced range of motion, but it's a sign that there's a problem in the joint that will likely get worse.
Stiffness and other symptoms usually occur on only one side of the body with OA and gout, whereas both sides are typically involved with autoimmune types, such as RA and PsA.Stiffness is usually worse in the morning with RA and PsA, but worse at the end of the day with OA.

, Fatigue (extreme tiredness) can be another early sign of some types of arthritis, but not all types.The autoimmune types (RA and PsA) tend to cause inflammation and other problems throughout the body, not just individual joints. As such, the body gets fatigued and rundown from trying to combat all the inflammation. Chronic fatigue can adversely affect emotions, mood, sex drive, attentiveness, creativity and productivity.


Fatigue from RA and PsA can also be associated with poor appetite and weight loss.
Other types of arthritis, such as OA, can trigger chronic fatigue if the joint pain is great enough to significantly affect your sleeping and eating patterns.

, As pain, inflammation, stiffness and/or damage progresses within joints, you eventually begin to lose the ability to move them normally. As such, reduced range of motion (limited movement) is a common sign of advanced arthritis and one of the main causes of disability.You may not be able to bend down as far or be as flexible as you once were.


Reduced range of motion is slow and gradual with OA, as the cartilage wears down and the bones come into contact with each other and as you form bone spurs or osteophytes.
With RA and PsA, range of movement often depends on the degree of joint swelling, which can come and go. However, with time, RA and PsA are destructive to cartilage and severely limit joint movement.
Septic arthritis is caused by an infection in the joint and is characterized by sudden, severe pain and difficulty using the affected joint. This type of infection can destroy a joint quickly — within weeks., Associated with progressive pain and reduced range of motion within joints is weakness. The weakness may be due more to trying to avoid pain or it may be due more to destruction of the joint's integrity. Furthermore, lack of exercise (common with arthritis sufferers) leads to loss of muscle tissue, which leads to loss of strength.You may notice you can't lift as much or walk as far as you once could. Your grip strength and hand shake may not be as firm.


Muscle atrophy (shrinking and loss of strength) is common in muscles that surround arthritic joints.
Weak muscles and joints feel unstable and usually shake or twitch a little when put under heavy loads.
Associated with progressive weakness is loss of agility, dexterity and coordination. If you have arthritis in your hands, you may feel clumsy and drop things often.

, Joint deformity or disfigurement eventually occurs with all forms of arthritis, although it can develop quicker and be more noticeable with certain forms. RA is notorious for severe joint deformity in the hands and feet because the inflammation leads to erosion of cartilage and bone, as well as ligament laxity (loosening).Long term, RA is more destructive than virtually all other types and causes the most disability in people.


OA can lead to joint deformity also (often described as knobby), but not the extreme crookedness characteristic of RA.If you notice any nodules (large tender bumps) near your joints, that's likely a sign of RA. Nodules occur in 20–30% of RA cases, usually in the hands, feet, elbows and knees., Another late-stage sign of arthritis is associated skin changes.Aside from potential nodules, RA and PsA often cause characteristic changes in skin texture and color, both near painful joints and in distant locations of the body. RA tends to make the skin look more red, mainly due to swelling of small blood vessels beneath the skin's surface (called vasculitis).


In contrast, PsA usually involves psoriasis of the skin, which involves the formation of thick, silvery scales and itchy, dry, red patches.Gout flare-ups are usually associated with crusty formations on skin near the painful joint.
All types of arthritis that involve significant swelling and inflammation increase the heat underneath the skin and can make it feel and look more leather-like.

, Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common type of arthritis and is caused by the gradual wearing out of joints due to overuse, obesity and/or joint injuries.OA doesn't involve much inflammation and can often be managed by losing weight, switching activities/exercises that are more gentle on joints and changing your diet (less sugar and preservatives, more water and fresh produce).


OA most often affects weight-bearing joints, such as the knees, hips and spine, although OA in the hands is common also.
OA is diagnosed by a physical exam and x-rays. Wearing away of cartilage and the development of small bone spurs are characteristic of OA on x-ray.
Treatment for OA centers around lifestyle changes and either non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, or painkillers like acetaminophen.

, Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is not nearly as common as OA, but it seems to be more prevalent compared to past decades. What causes it is a bit of a mystery, but it's assumed that the immune system gets confused and attacks joint tissues and other parts of the body by mistake — also described as an over-active immune system.RA is characterized by lots of inflammation and pain, which can come and go (called flares).


RA usually affects the body bilaterally — the same joints on both sides of the body at the same time.
RA seems to have more of a genetic link, so if your close relatives have it, you're much more likely to develop it.
Women are much more likely to develop RA compared to men.
Unlike in OA, children can be affected by RA — called juvenile idiopathic arthritis or JIA.
RA is diagnosed by a physical exam, x-rays and a blood test. Inflammation and joint deformity are characteristic of RA on x-ray. Between 70–80% of people with RA test positive for a marker in their blood called rheumatoid factor.Treatment for RA centers around taking strong NSAIDs, as well as disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and biologic response modifiers (biologics).

, Gout is caused by high levels of uric acid in the blood from having a purine-rich diet.High levels of uric acid eventually precipitates out within the blood, forming sharp crystals, which get deposited in and around joints. The sharp crystals quickly create lots of inflammation and severe pain, most often in the big toe, but also in other joints of the feet, hands and limbs. Gout attacks are typically short-term (a few days or so), but can re-occur on a regular basis.


Uric acid crystals can form crusty lumps or nodules called tophi around affected joints, which can mimic RA.
Purine-rich foods include organ meats (liver, kidneys), bacon, shellfish, sardines, anchovies, chicken and gravies . Too much beer and red wine can also trigger gout attacks.
Gout is diagnosed by a physical exam, dietary history, x-rays and a blood test. People with gout will have high levels of uric acid in their blood (called hyperuricemia).
Treatment for gout is centered on short-term use of NSAIDs or corticosteroids, as well as colchicine (Colcrys). Long-term prevention is based on dietary changes.

Take anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs).,
Use hot and cold compresses.,
Take regular baths with epsom salts.",How to Relieve Back Pain1," Follow the manufacturer’s recommendations. NSAIDs, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, help decrease inflammation and relieve pain.Over-the-counter drugs such as Motrin, Aleve, or Bayer Aspirin can provide quick relief and are readily available at your local pharmacy. Common side effects include gas, heartburn, nausea, dizziness, or diarrhea. If symptoms persist, stop the medication and consult a doctor.Many doctors say that people under 18 shouldn't take aspirin because of its association with Reye's Syndrome - a rare, but serious liver and brain disorder.;
, Start with a warm compress for 15 minutes, followed by a cold compress. Alternate every 2 hours for 5 days. Hot and cold packs can reduce inflammation for people with acute, subacute, or chronic pain.For cold compresses, wrap a gel-based ice pad or ice pack in a shirt or towel before placing it directly on the skin. Otherwise, it can be shockingly cold.

, This is particularly useful if you have back pain from manual labor or standing too much. Epsom salts contain minerals that relax inflamed muscles. Doctors call this “hydrotherapy”. Don’t make the water too hot. You don’t want to scald yourself. These baths get your nervous system revved up and help circulate blood to strained or injured areas.Give yourself a hot bath massage. Since your muscles will be loosened by the water, now is a good time to work out any tight areas. Take a baseball or tennis ball and put it under your lower back and move your hips from side to side. Then do the same for your upper back."

Apply ice or heat as needed.,
Stay active, if you can.,
Adjust your sleeping position.,
Get social support.,
Manage stress.,
Talk to a physical therapist about alternative therapies.",How to Recover From a Herniated Disk2," The Mayo Clinic recommends these as home remedies for dealing with the pain of a herniated disk. Which one you chose to use may depend on the stage of your injury.In the first few days, cold packs can help reduce inflammation and swelling. You can use an ice pack or package of frozen vegetables wrapped in a towel. Apply it for about 10 minutes, then give your skin a chance to warm up. Do not apply the cold pack directly to your skin.
After the first few days, you can use warmth to relax tense muscles. Use a hot water bottle wrapped in a towel or a heating pad. Do not put the heat source directly on your bare skin to avoid burns.

, You may need to rest for the first few days after the disk herniated, but after that, staying active will keep you from stiffening up and help you recover faster. Talk to your doctor or a physical therapist to find out what exercises they may recommend for you.Avoid doing activities that could make it worse. This may include carrying heavy items, lifting, or reaching.
Your doctor may suggest swimming because the water will support your weight and relieve the pressure on your spine. Other possibilities include biking or walking.
Try pelvic tilts if your doctor approves it. Lie on your back with your knees up and put your hand beneath your lower back. Tilt your pelvis so that you are pushing down on your hand. Hold it for five seconds. Repeat this 10 times. If this causes pain, stop and talk to your doctor.
Do buttock squeezes. While lying on your back with your knees up, squeeze your buttocks together and hold it for five seconds. Repeat this 10 times. This should not cause pain. If it does, do not continue and discuss it with your doctor.

, You may get relief by lying in positions that take the pressure off your spine and your nerves. Your doctor or physical therapist may suggest:Lying on your stomach on pillows so that your back is rounded. This may reduce the pressure on your nerves.
Lying in the fetal position with a pillow between your knees. The side with the herniated disk should be up.
Lying on your back and stacking pillows underneath your knees so that your hips and knees are bent and your lower legs are parallel to the bed. During the day you may want to lie on the floor and rest your legs on a chair.

, Living with chronic pain is extremely stressful and can trigger depression and anxiety. Maintaining your social network will help you to cope and feel less alone. You can get social support by:Talking with friends and family. If there are physical activities that you can no longer do alone, let them help you.
See a counselor. A counselor can help you learn coping techniques and determine if you have unrealistic expectations for your recovery. Your doctor may be able to recommend someone that specializes in helping people cope with pain.
Join a support group. This may help you to feel less alone and to learn coping mechanisms.

, Stress makes you more sensitive to pain. By developing techniques for dealing with stress, you may be able to better handle the pain. Some people benefit from the following techniques:Meditation
Deep breathing
Music or art therapy

Visualizing calming images

Progressive tensing and relaxing the different muscle groups in your body

, There may be ways that you can change how you move or sit to avoid making your condition worse. You may also benefit from alternative methods of pain management, but always talk to your doctor to be sure that these methods will be safe for you. Possibilities include:Short-term bracing for your neck or back to protect it and give you stability
Traction
Ultrasound treatments
Electrical stimulation

Deal with moderate pain with over-the-counter painkillers.,
Combat severe pain with prescription medications.,
Get cortisone injections for the pain.,
Discuss surgery with your doctor.,
Follow your doctor’s instructions when recovering from surgery.",How to Recover From a Herniated Disk3," This is likely to be the doctor's first suggestion if your pain isn't too severe.Possible medications include ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB) or naproxen (Aleve).
Though non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can be very helpful, they may not be right for you if you have high blood pressure, asthma, heart or kidney problems. Talk to your doctor about these medications before you start because they can interfere with other medications, including herbal remedies or dietary supplements. NSAIDS are especially known to cause gastric ulcers. Consult your doctor if over-the-counter medications do not help within 7 days.

, Depending upon your symptoms and medical history, your doctor may suggest:Nerve pain medications. These medications are increasing in their popularity because the side effects are often less severe than those produced by narcotics. Common ones include gabapentin (Neurotin, Gralise, Horizant), pregabalin (Lyrica), duloxetine (Cymbalta), and tramadol (Ultram).
Narcotics. These medications are likely to be prescribed when over-the-counter medications weren’t strong enough and nerve pain medications weren’t helpful. They may cause side effects including sedation, nausea, confusion, and constipation. These medications often have codeine or a mixture of oxycodone and acetaminophen (Percocet, Oxycontin).
Muscle relaxants. Some people get painful muscle spasms and these medications can help this. A common one is diazepam. Some muscle relaxants may cause sedation and dizziness, so they are best used at night, just before bed. Read the packaging to determine whether you should avoid driving or operating machinery while taking them.

, Cortisone can suppress inflammation and swelling. If need be, your doctor may offer to give you an injection directly into the area that is causing the pain.Your doctor may also use oral steroids when trying to decrease swelling.Corticosteroids are often used to delay or possibly eliminate the need for surgery.The hope is that once the inflammation goes down, the body will naturally heal over the long-term.
When given at high doses over the long-term, cortisone can cause weight gain, depression, diabetes, high blood pressure, osteoporosis, increased bruising, acne, and a vulnerability to infections., Your doctor may recommend surgery if other options are not improving your symptoms, your nerves are badly compressed. There a few different types of surgery your doctor may suggest:Open discectomy. During this procedure the surgeon makes a cut into your spine and takes out the damaged part of the disk. If the damage is extensive, the surgeon may remove the whole disk. If the whole disk is removed, it may be necessary to fix the vertebrae around the missing disk to give you stability. This is called fusion.
Prosthetic intervertebral disk replacement. During this procedure, after the surgeon removes the damaged disk, it is replaced with a prosthetic disk.
Endoscopic laser discectomy. During this procedure the surgeon will make a small cut into your spine, then insert a thin tube that has a light and a camera on it (an endoscope). The damaged disc will then be removed using a laser.

, Surgery helps most people who get it, but it may take you several weeks to recover. You may be able to go back to work after two weeks to a month and a half after the surgery.If you notice signs of any complications arising from the surgery, contact your doctor immediately. Though rare, possible complications include infections, damage to the nerves, paralysis, hemorrhaging, or temporarily losing sensitivity to touch.
Spinal surgery works for a while. But if the patient fuses two vertebrae, the load is often transferred to the next adjacent vertebrae, which may require additional surgery. An important question to ask the doctor is if you may require additional surgeries in the future.

Walk more often.,
Ride a bike.,
Go swimming.,
Try cross-country skiing.,
Try tai chi.,
Try yoga.,
Engage in social dancing.,
Try a sport.,
Find ways to incorporate physical activity into your daily routine.",How to Stay Active with Psoriatic Arthritis2," Start by going on walks around your block. Walk alone or with friends for about 15 minutes daily. Over time, add time to your walks in five-minute increments. For instance, if you start out by walking for 15 minutes daily, extend your walk to 20 minutes after a week or so. After another week, try walking for 25 minutes daily. Continue in this way until you’re spending an amount of time walking that accord with your lifestyle and fitness level., Riding a bike is a great way to stay active with psoriatic arthritis. If the weather is poor, you could visit your local gym to use a stationary bike. If you have room in your home and really love riding your bike, of course, you could get a stationary bike of your own., If you live near a beach and the weather is appropriate, head out for a swim. The buoyancy of the water makes working your arthritic joints easier. You could also swim in your own backyard if you have a pool. Even if you don’t have a pool in your backyard, you might be able to access one in your area. Many municipal athletic programs offer open swim sessions at local high schools or community athletic centers.If you’re interested in swimming at a community athletic center, check their website to see if and when they offer open swimming sessions.

, Cross-country skiing is a winter activity that requires snow. To get started, you’ll need some skis, which are elongated shoe-like devices. With your skis on, push yourself along with your two ski poles, one in each hand.You can often rent skis at the trailhead of your local cross-country ski trails. Contact the parks and recreation department that manages your cross-country ski trails for information about the availability and cost of renting skis.
Alternately, you could visit your local gym and use the ski machine, a stationary device that simulates cross-country skiing.
If you really love cross-country skiing and you have space in your house, you could invest in a ski machine of your own.

, Tai chi is an ancient practice devised in China. It consists of moving through a sequence of slow and graceful movements, and is appropriate for people of all ages. Try doing tai chi to stay active with psoriatic arthritis.To get started with tai chi, visit your local traditional tai chi instructor and sign up for lessons. Use the Tai Chi Health Institute’s online instructor database to find an instructor near you.
While you could start doing tai chi using a book or instructional DVD, it’s best to learn from an instructor who can give you personal tips and correct your form as needed., Like tai chi, yoga is an ancient form of physical activity that consists of moving the body into different positions. Yoga can help you develop flexibility, strength, and balance. The exercises can also help you improve your breathing.Yoga is also like tai chi in that it is best to start with an instructor rather than a DVD or instructional book. Once you master the poses, you can begin practicing yoga without an instructor.Locate a yoga studio near you to get started.

, Social dancing means dancing with a partner. There are many sorts of social dancing. For instance, you might like ballroom dancing, a sort of dancing with a partner that typically accompanies waltzes. Or you might enjoy a hoedown, a type of traditional folk dance native to the American South. Whatever sort of dance you enjoy, there’s probably a club in your area that empowers you to explore social dancing of one sort or another.


To find opportunities to engage in social dancing in your area, try typing a word string like “social dancing ” into your preferred search engine.

, Try to find a sport you enjoy and can participate in regularly. However, beware of high impact sports or sports that involve twisting the joints, like some of the motions in racquet sports like tennis. Some people will tolerate some sports or motions better than others so start slowly and try a different sport or exercise if you seem to have more pain during or after playing., Instead of (or in addition to) going out of your way to get physical activity with psoriatic arthritis, you could make your day-to-day routine more physically active. One way is to incorporate walking into your daily routine. For instance, walk to the store or to work instead of driving. You could also choose to ride your bike. And instead of taking an elevator, climb the stairs.Daily chores like mowing the grass or other yard work also provide valuable opportunities to engage in moderate physical activity.

Lift weights.,
Try pushups.,
Use resistance bands.,
Engage in intense gardening.",How to Stay Active with Psoriatic Arthritis3," There are many ways lift weights. For instance, you could choose a set of free weights or dumbbells and perform curls. Curls are a common weight-lifting exercise that involves holding the weight in your hand, then bending your arm at the elbow to bring the weight up toward your shoulder. Alternately, you could use a bench press to push a heavy weighted bar up and down. Experiment with a variety of weight-lifting techniques at your local gym in order to discover one you enjoy., To perform a pushup, lay on a soft mat or carpeted area with your belly down. Plant your hands on the ground just to the outsides of your shoulders. Push yourself up and straighten your arms. Straighten your legs and tense your feet so that your toes are pointed straight toward the ground. Keep your back straight and bend your arms at the elbows. When your elbows form a 90-degree angle, push off the ground by driving your arms straight down.When you first begin doing pushups, you will probably only be able to do a few. Try to gradually increase the number of pushups you can do by adding one per week until you are performing a quantity that you feel really challenges you.

, Resistance bands are like large rubber bands that can help you develop strength and stay active with psoriatic arthritis. For instance, you could wrap a resistance band around your thighs. Lift one leg off the ground by moving it laterally away from you. Continue to move it to the side until you cannot move it further. Bring the leg slowly back to the center and repeat on the other leg., Repetitive motions likes chopping, digging, or shoveling are great ways to work your muscles without the need for specialized gym equipment. Of course, you’ll need something to shovel, dig, or chop, so your opportunity to do so will be limited."

Know when to seek help.,
Visit a doctor.,
Consider a steroid injection.,

See an acupuncturist.,
Use a nerve stimulator.",How to Relieve Back Pain2," Seek professional help from your doctor immediately if you feel any numbness or tingling in your groin or legs, if you lose control of your bladder or bowels, or if your walk is affected.You should also see your doctor if you are unsure of the cause of your back pain or if it is getting worse. You will need further evaluation if you develop a fever or any new symptoms.

, Schedule an appointment. Be able to describe the exact nature of your back pain, how frequently your back hurts, what activities have become unbearable due to back pain, and any additional information that your physician might find useful. Your doctor will prescribe NSAIDs for general back pain, but can prescribe stronger medications if the pain becomes unbearable.

, Depending on the severity of the back pain, a doctor may suggest a steroid injection. Some people get relief for months or years when a steroid is injected into areas of the spine that suffer from extreme inflammation., Chiropractic professionals are dedicated to the non-surgical treatment of musculoskeletal conditions. Generally, they focus on your spine and the surrounding areas. Chiropractors use manual (hands-on) treatment to focus on lower back pain and herniated disc issues. , This trained professional will prescribe necessary exercises much like a doctor prescribes medication. Physical therapists will teach you how to stretch and strengthen your back muscles. They’ll also help you prevent unnecessary strain.


Egoscue practitioners specialize in posture therapy. He’ll focus on your back pain and identify any posture problems you may be having. He’ll examine the way you walk, sit, and sleep. Afterwards, he’ll outline a series of exercises that will help reduce pressure and tension in your back., The two best massages for lower back pain specifically are a quadratus lumborum (QL) muscle massage and a gluteus medius massage.


The QL massage focuses on the connection between your ribs and your pelvis - an area that is normally a source of lower back pain. This area becomes strained when your lower back remains mobile while your upper body sits still or when you sit slumped in a chair. Your therapist can stretch and massage this area with a QL massage.The gluteus medius massage works wonders in tandem with the QL massage. When the area between your ribs and pelvis becomes strained, it immediately causes strain in your upper buttocks region as well., A practitioner will insert thin needles into precise points throughout your body. Most acupuncturists argue that their needles stimulate the production of endorphins, serotonin, and acetylcholine. These are powerful painkilling chemicals naturally produced in your body. While the medical community is still out on the exact scientific effects of acupuncture, on-going clinical trials are hopeful. Certainly, there is a lot of anecdotal evidence (by patients) to support acupuncture’s effectiveness., A Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulator (TENS) unit may be used as a treatment option to help block severe nerve pain. This is not a cure. It is merely a pain management technique. It essentially blocks pain signals to the brain, so you don’t notice your back pain as much or at all. Only consider this technique after consulting your doctor and if all other methods have failed."

Change your sleeping position.,
Invest in better footwear or insoles.,
Ditch the heavy bags.",How to Relieve Back Pain3," Lie on your side with your back straight. Lift your knees forward into a fetal position. Place a long pillow between your knees and your ankles to support your hips. Hug a pillow near your chest to relax your neck and arms., If you are on your feet, make sure comfort is your first priority. You want to make sure that you’re shoes have excellent arch support. This will help you maintain balance without putting too much strain on the base of your foot. See a podiatrist if you suffer from pronation or supination., Pack pragmatically. Don’t carry around things that you might need. Pack what you will need, so you can keep it light. And then purposefully switch your bag to different arms over the course of your day. Put it on your left shoulder, right shoulder, carry it on your arm or in your hand, and put it on your lap or the floor whenever you are seated. This way the strain of the bag will be displaced evenly across your body. "

Stretch several times per day.,
Strengthen your core with wall squats.,
Do pelvic lifts to build your core.,
Do leg reaches.,
Perform Swiss ball stabilizing exercises.,
Add more cardio exercise to your daily workout.,
Do yoga.",How to Relieve Back Pain4," The following stretches can greatly reduce pain if done at least once per day:


Do the knee-to-chest stretch. Lay on your back with your knees up and your head on the ground. Lift your right knee and grab it with both hands. Pull the knee lightly toward your chest for 30 seconds. Release and repeat 2 times with both legs.Do the piriformis muscle stretch. If you suffer from pain in your sciatic nerve, the piriformis muscle is most likely extremely tense. Lie on your back with your knees up. Place the outside of your right calf on the top of your left thigh. Lift your left thigh and grab it with your hands. Bring the thigh toward you until you feel a stretch in your right buttock. Hold for 30 seconds and release. Repeat twice on each side.Focus on your neck. Stiff necks often accompany stiff backs. Lean your head forward so that your chin touches your chest. You should feel the muscles in the back of your neck stretch. Hold for 30 seconds. Lift your head up and then lean your head to the right, bringing your right ear close to your right shoulder. The muscles on the side of your neck should be pulled taught. Hold for 30 seconds and then lean your head to the left, in the same way. Hold for 30 seconds.

, Stand with your back against a wall. Then gradually lower yourself so that you are in a seated position. You should feel your back, abdomen, and quads start to tighten. Hold for 5-10 seconds depending on how long it takes you to feel the burn. Then slowly straighten your legs and return to a standing position.

This will help you design a regimen that limits the amount of weight placed on your joints and strengthens key muscle groups.Ideally, you want to get at least 150 minutes of low-impact aerobic exercise every week.Do not overdo high-impact exercises. Although important for your overall health, too many high-impact exercises are more likely to cause an injury and can diminish your joint strength over time.

, Properly strengthening your muscles is essential to maintaining joint health. Incorporating weight training into your exercise routine will ensure proper joint stability and limit the damage done by high-impact exercises. However, when engaging in weight training, be sure to use the proper form and avoid initially lifting heavy loads. Poor form and overburdening yourself can lead to injury.Basic squats and lunges are a good weight resistance exercise for strengthening your joints.
Consult a physical therapist or exercise physiologist before beginning a weight training regimen.
You should practice weight resistance at least twice a week., If you notice any soreness or pain in your joints, stop and rest. Too much exercise can cause serious damage to your joints and muscles. Be sure to take some time off and let the injury heal. If it persists, contact your doctor or a physical therapist., At the end of a workout, you should spend some time performing some cool down exercises. Take a few minutes and stretch your body.

Consult with your doctor.,

Talk to your doctor about spinal surgery.,
Understand the causes of adult scoliosis.,
Understand the limitations of preventing scoliosis.,
Increase strength, flexibility, and range of motion with exercise.There are some things you can do to strengthen your muscles and possibly prevent scoliosis from worsening or from increased pain.,
Eat nutritious foods.",How to Prevent Scoliosis," If you think your child has scoliosis, either due to a positive screening at school or because somebody noticed that your child's back / body looks lopsided, then make an appointment with your family doctor or a medical specialist, such as an orthopedist. Scoliosis can progress very quickly in teenagers, so the sooner you seek medical advice the better.Doctors cannot prevent scoliosis completely, but they can properly assess it and provide you with options to combat its progression.


The doctor will likely take an x-ray and measure the angle of your child's scoliotic curve. Scoliosis is not considered very significant until the curve is greater than 25 – 30 degrees.Scoliosis affects females more than males and it runs in families, so it can be hereditary in some cases.;
, A common option for teenagers with progressive cases of scoliosis is wearing a back brace. Bracing can't prevent scoliosis, but it can help keep it from getting worse in some cases.Depending on how serious the scoliosis is and where the unnatural curves are, braces can be made of rigid plastic or stretchy elastic with metal inserts. They typically cover most of the torso and can be worn underneath clothing. Brace treatment is generally used when: a curve is greater than or equal to 25 degrees and appears to be progressing quickly, or the curve is discovered at a young age when the spine is still growing and is already over 30 degrees.


Most braces are worn at least 16 hours a day for many months or even a few years — until the spine stops growing.
Several studies conclude that back bracing for scoliosis can keep spinal curves from getting large enough to require surgery.In general, about 1/4 of children / teens with scoliosis may benefit from back bracing., Spinal surgery should be considered the last resort for scoliosis, but in some cases it is necessary to stop the deformity from progressing and causing health problems (from crowded organs) and long-term chronic pain and disability. Scoliosis surgery involves fusing together two or more vertebrae with bone grafts and inserting metal rods or other hard devices to keep the spine straight and well supported.. Scoliosis surgery is used mainly to correct a significant curve or stop it from progressing while a teenager is still growing, and not for adults who have more mild forms of scoliosis. However, spinal fusion is not uncommon for older adults who have scoliosis or hyperkyphosis (hunchback appearance) from osteoporotic fractures of the mid back.


Stainless steel or titanium rods are used to support spine until the bone fusion is complete. Metal rods are attached to the spine with screws, hooks, and/or wires.
Potential complications from spinal surgery include infection, excessive blood loss, allergic reaction to anesthesia, nerve damage / paralysis and chronic pain.

, Most cases of adult scoliosis are idiopathic, meaning there is no known reason why the person developed it. Other potential causes include:Congenital curve — This means you were born with scoliosis. It may have been overlooked when you were a child, but may have worsened over time.
Paralytic curve — If the muscles surrounding your spine begin to fail, the spine may slowly begin to curve out of place, leading to scoliosis. This is often caused by a spinal cord injury and may eventually cause paralysis.
Secondary causes — Scoliosis may occur due to a different spinal condition, such as degeneration, osteoporosis, osteomalacia, or following spinal surgery.

, Unfortunately, there is little that can be done to prevent scoliosis in adults; instead, focus is placed on relieving pain associated with scoliosis.In severe cases, surgery may be necessary, but otherwise you will likely focus on strengthening your spine and managing pain., Physical therapy and water therapy can be helpful, and chiropractic treatment may improve pain.Speak with a licensed physical therapist to develop a program tailored to strengthening your muscles and keeping your back flexible.Water or pool therapy can take some of the stress off your joints, allowing you to focus on strengthening the muscles in your back without the limitations of gravity.A chiropractor can help keep your facet joints supple and help with pain., In order to maintain strong, straight and healthy vertebrae and other bones of the body, you need to regularly eat foods rich in certain minerals and vitamins. More specifically, calcium, magnesium and phosphorus form the mineral matrix of your bones (spine too), and a dietary deficiency in any of these can lead to weak and brittle bones (osteoporosis) that are susceptible to breaking. Once the vertebrae start to fracture and degrade, the spine can list to one side and develop into what's called degenerative adult scoliosis.Vitamin D is also an important nutrient for strong bones because it's needed for calcium absorption in the intestines. Not enough vitamin D leads to ""soft"" bones (called rickets in children or osteomalacia in adults) that are easily deformed or unnaturally curved.


Rich food sources of calcium include: collard greens, kale, spinach, sardines, tofu, dairy products, almonds and sesame seeds.Vitamin D is produced by your skin in response to intense sunshine, although many people try to avoid the sun. Vitamin D isn't found in many foods, but the best sources are: fatty fish (salmon, tuna, mackerel), fish oils, beef liver, hard cheese and egg yolks.

Stop if you feel any pain.Swelling and redness can be signs that you need to take a break or stop for the day.

, After heavy physical activity, it can be a good idea to apply ice to any areas that you notice symptoms of arthritis. Applying ice can help prevent inflammation and stiffness in the areas you have arthritis, reducing the symptoms that it would have otherwise. Always apply ice after heavy physical labor or exercise to help manage your arthritis symptoms and prevent them from worsening. Try applying ice directly to areas that you have arthritis symptoms.
Never apply ice directly to the skin. Always wrap ice up in a cloth before using it on your joints.
Try to ice affected areas for around 20 minutes.

Drink at least eight cups of water each day.,
Eat potassium rich foods.,
Eat complex carbohydrates.,
Take vitamin C supplements or eat foods high in vitamin C. At least one study suggests that taking plenty of vitamin C each day, especially between 1,500 and 2,000mg a day, significantly reduces your risk of gout.Many people suffering from gout add lemon juice to their water to help with this, although it is difficult to reach these high levels of vitamin C intake without taking supplements.,
Eat cherries.,
Consider drinking decaffeinated coffee.",How to Prevent Gout1," Painful episodes of gout occur when a substance called uric acid causes salt crystals to form in your joints. Fluids can help pass uric acid through your body, making them an effective way to reduce the chance of gout attacks.Water is the most effective fluid for this purpose, but you may use 100% fruit juice for part of your daily quota.


Sweetened drinks, such as soda or sweetened fruit juice, can make your gout worse.
The eight cup minimum recommendation refers to U.S. measuring cups. Eight cups is equal to 64 fluid ounces, two quarts, or 1.9 liters (0.5 US gal).;
, Potassium may help uric acid, the cause of gout attacks, pass through your system. Many foods contain high levels of potassium, including lima beans, dried peaches, cantaloupe, cooked spinach, or baked potatoes with skin.If you are not willing to eat at least two servings of these foods each day (or as many as seven for severe gout), try taking potassium supplements instead, or consult a nutritionist or doctor.

, Whole grain pasta, brown bread, vegetables, and fruit are recommended for people at risk of gout. Eat these instead of refined white bread, cakes, and candy, at least in your daily diet.,, Long a folk remedy for treating gout, cherries may actually reduce your risk of gout. Preliminary studies show that cherries appear to reduce the levels of uric acid in your blood, the immediate cause of gout., One study shows that coffee may help reduce uric acid, and therefore reduce the risk of gout attacks.The reason for this is unknown, but caffeine does not appear to be the cause, and may in fact make gout worse, suggesting that decaffeinated coffee may be a better option."

Use a chair that provides support.,
Maintain neutral body position while sitting.,
Support your spine while sleeping.,
Stand with proper posture.",How to Prevent Lower Back Pain1," Especially if you work sitting down, use a chair that provides good lumbar support and allows you to sit with good posture. Sit with your upper body straight upward, at a 90-degree angle with your thighs. Accordingly, your knees and hips should be level and parallel to the floor. Keep your feet slightly in front of your knees and planted squarely on the floor.Make minor adjustments to your position frequently, and get up to walk around for a few minutes or do a brief stretch after every hour of sitting.
If you find yourself leaning forward too much, adjust your chair so that you are leaning slightly backwards, and the angle between your thighs and midsection is slightly greater than 90 degrees.
In a pinch, place a small pillow or rolled-up towel behind the small of your back.
Elevate your feet with a short stool or stack of paper if you’re sitting for a while and you cannot adjust the chair so that your feet reach the floor.;
, Neutral body position allows your joints to be naturally aligned. This reduces stress and strain on your muscles, tendons, and other parts of your skeletal system. Pay attention to the posture of your entire body.Hold you head level, facing forward, and balanced on your neck. You may tilt your head slightly forward, but do not allow it to hang or lean forward. Keep your head and neck in line with your torso.
Keep your arms at your sides, and your shoulders relaxed.
Don’t forget to make small adjustments if you’re sitting for multiple hours in a day. These will naturally occur if you take a moment to stretch your arms and torso.

, Get in the practice of sleeping on your side, with legs, hips, and back aligned. To assist with alignment, place a pillow between your thighs to keep your hips squared with your back. Pull your knees up a bit, so your body is in a partial fetal position. This will help open the joints of the spine and relieve pressure by reducing the spine’s curve.Sleep on a firm surface.
Try to avoid sleeping on your back or stomach, since these positions can place strain on your lower back.
If you must sleep on your back, place a pillow or rolled towel under your knees for additional support.

, Always stand straight up, so that your ears, shoulders, hips and knees are all in line with one another. To help improve your posture while standing, and to help relieve pressure on the joints in your lower back, wear comfortable, low-heeled shoes.Wearing footwear that provides ample support is very important. Shoes with low heels and good arch support are usually the best choice.

Find out everything you can about the procedure.,
Before surgery, you may be asked to donate some of your own blood to be given back to you after the surgery.,
Get your body into the best shape possible.,
Make some adjustments in your house.,
Have someone there to help you, whether it be your parents or even your best friend.,
Prepare for some stiffness.,
Try to get a memory foam topper for your mattress and a memory foam pillow.,
Go prepared to the hospital.,
Prepare arms with chairs.,
Explore pillow options to ensure your comfort.",How to Prepare for Scoliosis Surgery," As stated above, spinal fusion surgery is not an easy thing to go through. You need to prepare yourself mentally as well as physically. Knowing everything you can about the procedure helps tremendously. Ask your doctor as many questions as you can think of, read up about it online, and try to get in contact with someone who actually has undergone the procedure. A great website to get in contact with adolescents with scoliosis is Spine kids. (note: spine kids has closed its doors, but can be found on Facebook) It is such an amazing website! Adults should check out the National Scoliosis Foundation.;
, If so, you'll probably be asked to take some iron tablets. If you do take them, make sure to add fiber to your diet. As embarrassing as it sounds, iron tablets tend to make you constipated.

, Try to eat a healthy diet. Get plenty of exercise and tone up your muscles, because you will be ""out of commission"" for quite some time after the surgery. Toning up your arms is an especially good idea because you will be using them to help propel you out of bed after surgery. You won't just be able to sit up, you'll have to log roll to your side and then use your arms to push you upright. Don't worry, you'll learn this in the hospital.

, Try to get everything in a comfortable reach (i.e. move things from a high cabinet lower, vice versa). In the shower, try to get a loofah with a long plastic handle so you can easily wash your body since you won't be able to bend. If you really need to shave your legs, you can either ask someone to help you or attach a razor to a stick. Just be careful. You may want to have a shower chair, since it will be very hard to stand for long periods of time after surgery and you may get dizzy/lightheaded easily. Just make sure when you're taking a shower that you have someone in the bathroom with you for a few weeks immediately after just in case.

, Even the most independent people will need assistance, because scoliosis surgery is no simple procedure. When you walk around after surgery, especially up and down stairs, have someone there to make sure you don't fall. You will have very poor balance for a while after surgery as your body gets used to its new position.

, You will be very stiff after surgery and will have to get used to doing things a little differently. Depending on the length of your fusion you will most likely not be able to bend normally, only at the waist. Walking around will feel very different due to the stiffness. On a positive note, you will likely have great posture!

, You will not regret spending the extra bucks for them. For a while, you will be very uncomfortable and will need a pillow to sit against, and the memory foam one is very comfortable as it molds to your body. Don't be embarrassed to bring your pillow with you to a restaurant, school, etc. after surgery.

, Bring some very comfortable clothes. Button-down pajama sets are very useful, as it will be hard to lift your arms over your head at first. While you're in the actual hospital, though, you'll probably end up wearing your gown for almost the entire time.


If you're female, make sure to bring some sanitary napkins with you (no tampons unfortunately). The stress of the surgery often causes many females to start their periods. And trust me, you don't want to use the pads the hospital has.
Other things to bring to the hospital may include a robe (you may be cold often after surgery), slippers with a solid grip to walk around in, socks (fluffy spa socks are great), chapstick (your lips will be very dry and you'll appreciate it), toothbrush/toothpaste, deodorant, face wipes, a hairbrush, and anything else you feel is necessary. Before surgery, females will typically be asked to put their hair in two tight braids. This is to prevent knots and just to make it easier. You won't care about how you look right after surgery.

, When you can't bend at the waist it can be hard to get up from a seated position. Get a shower chair with back and arms. The elevated toilet seat needs arms, too.

, Get a couple of small mini travel or baby pillows to put behind your arms when laying down or reclined. This makes your arms more comfortable when your resting or using your computer. You will find it more comfortable when laying down sometimes to have a pillow to hug. Or when lying on your side to put a pillow behind your back and one in front of you. This keeps you balanced & takes the stress off of your back. If it is time to replace your bed, consider getting an adjustable bed as it will make your recovery and the rest of your life more comfy at bedtime.


There are some thin lumbar bed pillows that are absolutely wonderful and provide a lot of comfort for the lumbar. After the surgery due the changes in the lumbar and not being able to bend when laying down, you will have a space between your back and the mattress, The bed lumbar pillow is perfect for sleeping on your back or side.

Avoid sugary foods and ""junk food"".,
Reduce the amount of meat and fish you eat.,
Eliminate certain high-risk meats.,
Reduce the amount of fat in your diet.,
Switch from beer to wine.",How to Prevent Gout2," Fructose, which can be found in corn syrup and other sweeteners, raises uric acid levels significantly.When uric acid builds up, it forms needle-like crystals (monosodium urate), which cause the joint pain and inflammation known as gout.Diets high in sugar, sweeteners, and processed food are currently a major cause of gout.


Try replacing soda and sweetened fruit juice with water and/or juices labeled ""100% fruit juice"".
Look at the ingredients of grocery items you purchase. Avoid foods containing high fructose corn syrup, and keep foods that list sugar or other types of corn syrup to a minimum.

, Meat of all kinds contain purine, which breaks down into the uric acid that causes gout. You do not have to eliminate meat entirely, but eating no more than 4-6 oz (113-170g) daily is recommended.An amount of meat that could sit flat on your palm is roughly 3 ounces, or one serving. Eating two of these servings each day is recommended.Lean meat is safer than fatty meat.

, Certain other foods contain high levels of purine, which can bring on a gout attack. Try to remove these from your diet, or eat them only occasionally and in small amounts:Kidneys, liver, brains, and other organ meat
Anchovies, sardines, and mackerel
Gravy formed from meat

, Fats in your diet, especially saturated fat, can slow your body's processing of uric acid, and bring on more severe gout pain.Fortunately, many of the changes above also happen to reduce the amount of fat in your diet, but look for other ways to reduce your fat intake to healthy levels if necessary. If you normally drink whole-fat milk, try switching to 1% fat or skim milk instead. If you are used to eating fried food, instead try roasting vegetables or baking chicken.

, Alcohol is linked to gout, but can be drunk in moderation with low chance of negative effects. However, beer contains yeast that is high in purine, making it especially likely to worsen your gout. One or two 5-oz. (150 mL) servings of wine each day is a safer way to consume alcohol.Adding wine to your diet does not make gout less likely. It is only recommended as a safer substitute for beer.

Follow this method if you are overweight.,
Do not go on an extreme diet.,
Exercise.,
Ask a doctor or dietitian for advice if you are having trouble reaching a healthy weight.",How to Prevent Gout3," If you are overweight or obese, this is very likely making your gout worse. However, if you are maintaining a healthy weight according to your doctor, do not try to reduce your weight, and read the instructions below before you consider any diet.

, The diet changes recommended in the other sections of this article are often enough to lower your weight slowly but steadily. If you are at risk of gout, reducing your weight too quickly can actually trigger a gout attack, as the stress on your body can overload your kidney's ability to process harmful substances.High-protein diets, starvation diets, and diets that include diuretic supplements are especially harmful for people at risk of gout., Any physical activity can be helpful in reducing weight and the associated risk of gout, including walking a dog or gardening. However, moderate activity such as cycling, brisk walking, tennis, or swimming for at least 2.5 hours each week is recommended for adults., If you are following at least some of the diet changes describe in other sections, and have not noticed any progress toward a healthier weight, consult a medically trained expert for advice. Because gout is affected by so many different substances, dietary advice from other sources is not recommended.

"

Ask your doctor to prescribe medication.,
Ask your doctor about lead poisoning.,
Avoid diuretic medications if possible.",How to Prevent Gout4," If lifestyle changes are not enough to prevent your gout, a doctor may prescribe allopurinol or another medication. Always follow the instructions carefully, as taking too much medication or medication at the wrong time can have the opposite effect, making a gout episode worse.

, Recent evidence suggests that lead poisoning, even in levels too low to cause other problems, may cause or worsen gout.Although more studies are needed to confirm this, it may be a good idea to ask a doctor to test your hair or blood for toxins. This is especially true if you have lived or worked in an old building, use lead-based paint regularly, or work in an industrial setting where lead is used.

, These medications are sometimes used to treat other health issues, or as a dieting supplement. While their effect on gout is controversial, it is possible they worsen the condition.Ask your doctor if any other medications you take are diuretics, and if so, whether a potassium supplement is recommended to counteract this.

Develop a passive stretching routine.,
Stretch your hamstrings.,
Perform a piriformis stretch.,
Hold yourself in cobra pose.",How to Prevent Lower Back Pain2," Stretching can both prevent and relieve back pain, as well reduce the chance of injury. Consult your doctor before undertaking a major stretching routine of any sort. There are a few safe, reliable stretches you should begin doing to increase your flexibility and facilitate movement in the muscles and joints of your lower back.The goal of passive stretching is to gradually relax and lengthen your back. Stop immediately if you feel any pain or tingling anywhere in your body.
Stretching exercises improve flexibility and relaxes your back muscles to decrease strain and tension on your back.
Stretch several times a day, perhaps upon waking and before going to bed.

, Lie on your back and extend both of your legs straight out. Bend one of our legs at the knee, and raise the other leg straight up in the air without allowing it to bend. Loop a towel around the arch of your foot on the extended leg and gently pull towards you as you push into the towel your foot. Make sure you’re feeling the stretch in the back of your thigh, in a muscle called the hamstring.Hold the stretch for 30 seconds before relaxing the leg and allowing it to rest on the ground. Switch to the other leg and repeat.
Do each leg three times, and repeat this stretch 2 or 3 times per day.

, The piriformis is another muscle that can contribute to back pain it if is not kept limber. Stretch it by lying on your back and crossing one leg over the other with the knee bent. Pull the knee toward your chest until you feel a stretch between your butt and hamstring areas.Hold the stretch for 30 seconds before relaxing and switching to the other side.
Do each side three times, and repeat the stretch 2 or 3 times per day.

, Many yoga poses will also beneficially stretch you back. Do the “cobra” by lying on your stomach and placing your hands palms down just beside your upper arms. Push your upper body off the floor and stretch your neck and head outward from your body. Hold the position for 30 seconds before relaxing your back and lowering your upper body to the floor.Do the cobra several times throughout the day to stretch your back out.

"
"
Do strengthening exercises.,
Do leg lifts.,
Hold yourself in bridge pose.,
Practice your “pointer.” The pointer is another strengthening exercise borrowed from the yoga realm.",How to Prevent Lower Back Pain3," Stretches that incorporate a bit more movement can help to develop the strength of your core. This will help prevent lower back pain by stabilizing and otherwise protecting your spine. Further, strengthening your body generally will help keep your hips, knees, and torso in better alignment.Stop doing any exercise immediately if you experience localized pain or tingling of any sort.
While you will certainly feel your muscles working during strengthening exercises, stop if you feel any sudden or sharp discomfort.

, Lie on your stomach and tighten the muscles in one of your legs. Raise the leg one or two inches from the floor and hold it there for a four count. Return the leg to floor and allow the muscles to relax. Raise the other leg in the same manner. Raise each leg 20 times, and repeat the exercise two to three times per day.Once you are easily able to do 20 legs lifts, incorporate more movement by extending your arms straight in front of you as though you are pretending to be a superhero.
Each time you lift one of your legs, simultaneously lift the arm on the opposite side of your body a few inches off of the ground as well.
Instead of pausing, maintain the motions fluidly, as though you are swimming. “Swim” for 60 seconds, rest for 10 seconds, and repeat the swim for as many sets as you can muster.

, Lie on your back. Bring your knees while keeping them together, so you’re your feet at side by side and flat on the floor. Tighten the muscles in your stomach and bottom and raise your hips from the floor until your neck, torso, and thighs make a straight line. Hold this position for 60 seconds, pause for 10 seconds, and repeat the hold two more times.If you are unable to hold the bridge position for a minute, simple hold it for a count of four and lower your hips back to the floor. Repeat the lift 20 times.
Do bridge exercises multiple times throughout the course of the day.

, Kneel on your hands and knees, with your palms directly beneath your shoulders and your knees hip-width apart. Raise one of your arms until it extends straight outward, running parallel to the floor. Contract your abdominal muscles to help you maintain your balance. Keep the palm of your other arm planted firmly on the ground. Raise the leg on the opposite side of your raised arm, holding it parallel to the ground behind you.Hold the position for 30 seconds, relax, and repeat the process with the other opposing limbs.
Start with three reps on each side, progressing as you are able to do so.
Progress the length of time you hold the position as well. Increase by 15-second increments.

Prevent back injuries by lifting carefully.,
Position yourself closely to heavy objects.,
Lift and lower straight up and down.,
Get help lifting dangerous objects.",How to Prevent Lower Back Pain4," Injury is another common reason that people develop lower back issues. Protect your back while lifting items by using the proper methods of lifting that avoid back strain. This is important even when you are young, as minor injuries that do not affect you immediately may make you more susceptible to more serious injuries later on., Approach an object you intend to lift and stand as close as possible to it. Spread your feet apart to provide yourself a wide base of support. Essentially, position yourself so that you're able to bend at your knees and grip the object either between or just in front of your feet. Never position yourself in a way that will require you to bend at your waist or at your back., After safely positioning and gripping and object, tighten and maintain the flex of your stomach muscles as you lift an object. Always raise and lower an object straight up and down, holding it close to your body and using the muscles in your legs. Again, do not bend or twist when lifting, lowering, or carrying a heavy item.When setting something down, do so with a squatting motion, keeping your back straight and using the muscles in your legs to bare the load.

, Get help lifting anything that you are not absolutely certain you can lift safely on your own. If an item is awkwardly shaped, or is heavier than items you commonly lift with ease, have someone else help you lift it. Whenever available, use dollies or other tools and machines to help you move heavy objects."

Do light cardio following periods of inactivity.,
Assess your body mass index (BMI).,
Eat healthy and monitor your caloric intake.,
Quit smoking.,
Treat minor lower back symptoms at home.,
Get treatment for recurring lower back pain.,
Watch for serious symptoms.",How to Prevent Lower Back Pain5," Low-impact exercises aside from stretching and strengthening routines are also helpful ways to improve your health and prevent back pain. After a day that includes lots of sitting, be sure to do a gentle cardio exercise for 30 minutes. The most low-impact options include speed-walking, swimming, and riding a stationary bike. Each of these prominently engage the muscles in your core, and thus also increase the flexibility and strength of your lower back and abdominal muscles.Talk to your doctor about what type of cardio may be the best for you, depending on your age, level of fitness, and any medical conditions.
Swimming is a good option when you have back problems because it will not put much pressure on your back.
Before any more strenuous, higher impact exercise such as running, be sure to do a stretching routine.
Cardio exercises also help you maintain a healthy weight, which reduces strain on your back and prevents low back pain.
Wearing supportive footwear may help to relieve some of the pressure on your back when you exercise or during your routine activities during the day. Get some good sneakers or use some gel or foam inserts in your shoes.

, You can find a BMI calculator online to help you assess whether your current weight is healthy. Once you establish whether or not you need to lose weight to be healthier and to help prevent lower back pain, you’ll have a better idea of whether you need to adjust your dietary choices and eating behavior. Again, daily meal planning tools are freely available online, and can help you determine the number of calories you need to eat to achieve your weight goals., Avoiding excessive weight gain is an important component of preventing lower back pain. One of the best ways to become more aware of what you’re consuming is keeping track of the calories you’re eating relative to the amount of calories you’re burning. Especially if you need to lose weight, you need to burn more calories than you eat. This is why it’s important to both exercise and eat healthy – and making yourself aware of the calories you’re eating will help you make necessary adjustments to your eating and exercise habits.There are many different apps that make it easy to keep track of what you’re eating throughout the day, and even include the calories common foods include.
Find a system of tracking the food you eat that works for you. The act of recording the food you eat, and when, will help you identify potential changes you can make to reduce the number of calories you’re eating.
Make sure that you drink at least eight 8 ounce glasses of water every day to maintain good hydration.

, Quitting will immediately help to prevent back pain. This is because smoking reduces the blood flow and oxygen to your lower spine. In turn, your spinal discs may degenerate more quickly. Smoking also increases the risk of osteoporosis and impedes healing of any minor injuries of strains you may experience. Even smoker’s cough can contribute to lower back pain. , You can adjust your own lifestyle and behavior to diminish any back pain you've begun to experience. There are even some forms of proactive treatment that may allow you to get rid of back pain and adjust your posture before you develop more serious back issues. Consider beginning a daily yoga routine that is focused on stretching your back. Further, get in the practice of icing your back and taking an NSAID pain reliever to see if you can knock out the pain on your own.You should also consider changing your mattress for one that is more firm. This will provide greater support for your spine while you sleep.

, If home treatments and posture adjustments do not diminish the symptoms of lower back pain enough for you to go about your day-to-day activities unhindered, you may need to seek professional treatment. A doctor will be able to provide with you stronger pain relievers, steroidal injections, and a more specific diagnosis regarding the potential cause of your back pain and a corresponding treatment plan.There are also many alternative ways to relieve lower back pain, though there are some symptoms that require immediate medical attention.

, If you develop back pain, see a doctor as soon as possible to talk about specific forms of treatment that will be best for you.

A high fever.
Loss of control of your bowels or bladder.
Loss of feeling in your legs, or the sensation of weakness in the legs.
Problems with your legs.
A history of cancer.

Reduce repetitive motions in your daily life.,
Quit smoking, as it weakens bone health and structure.,
Avoid excess alcohol consumption.",How to Prevent Arthritis1," Cartilage in your joints works as shock absorbers and osteoarthritis leads to the deterioration of that cartilage. Since this material is made up of 70 percent water, you can improve the health of it by always drinking at least 64 oz. (1.9 l) of water per day.;
, Superfruits, which mostly refer to deep-colored berries and other richly colored fruits, contain high amounts of antioxidants (substances that protect your cells from the effects of free radicals). Free radicals are considered harmful compounds which can damage your cells and possibly cause certain diseases. Many studies have suggested that a high-antioxidant diet lowers the risk of heart disease, cancer, and osteoarthritis.

Coffee, tea and soda may contain water, but also act as a diuretic, encouraging your body to expel fluids more quickly, before they have had time to adequately hydrate your body. Do not replace water with these beverages.

, Make sure you have a diet rich in dairy products like milk, cheese and yogurt. If you are lactose intolerant, supplement your diet with non-dairy foods that are rich in calcium, like broccoli, salmon, spinach, black beans, peanuts, almonds, tofu, sardines and sesame seeds.

, Vitamins C and D have been shown to support healthy joints. Vitamin D specifically may prevent onset of rheumatoid arthritis.Unfortunately, people who do not get direct sunlight or live in northern climates may be at risk for vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency. Vitamin D helps calcium to be absorbed into the body and bones. You can also eat foods rich in vitamin D, like salmon, tuna, fortified orange juice or milk, yogurt, eggs and beef.


Ask your doctor before taking any dietary supplements. Overdosing on supplements can put you at risk for other ailments.

, Increased weight on the load-bearing joints like knees, ankles and hips makes you highly susceptible to osteoarthritis.Luckily, losing weight cuts the risk of arthritis.


Studies have shown that obesity also hurts the renewal process cartilage. When damaged cartilage is not replaced quickly enough by new cartilage, it leads to the onset of osteoporosis.

, Not only can exercise reduce your weight, but it keeps your muscles strong and your joints flexible. A sedentary lifestyle leaves you far more susceptible to arthritis as you age.


Try to exercise at least 20 minutes for three days a week if exercise is vigorous, or 30 minutes of moderate exercise for five days a week.Anything else is considered insufficient against protecting against early onset arthritis.
Choose your exercise carefully. Heavy weightlifting and repetitive motions like running can cause undue stress on your joints and increase the likelihood that you will get osteoarthritis.Make sure that you are incorporating low-impact exercise like swimming, biking, elliptical use or Pilates into your routine.
Ensure you have proper footwear when you walk or do other low-impact activities. Whenever possible, choose asphalt or natural ground over concrete.

, These exercises strengthen the muscles around joints.When these muscles are strong, they lift some of the weight burden from the joint. Stretching also improves and maintains range of motion as you get older.

, Repetitive injuries, such as ankle sprains can lead to arthritis in the nearby joints in later years.Make sure you give the joint time to heal properly and train with a physical therapist after serious injuries.

, Work, sports and other activities can often include harmful repetitive motions. These motions can lead to micro trauma in surrounding joint tissue, which can then lead to osteoarthritis.


Pay attention to your biomechanics, such as posture in your daily routine. Improper knee bending, squatting, bending over and kneeling can cause the repetitive stress and micro trauma. The younger you are when you fix your posture, the more healthy your joints will be.
Sitting still for long periods of time is considered similar to a repetitive motion because it causes more stress on your joints and spine. Stand up every 30 minutes, if you work at a desk job.

, Arthritis patients who quit smoking see an improvement in how many joints that hurt, as well as the level of pain they experience., This habit is similar to smoking as it weakens vitamin absorption and bone structure.

Maintain a Healthy Weight: Osteoarthritis is caused in the main by wear and tear on your joints, specifically the weight-bearing ones first.,
Eat a Well-Balanced Diet:  Eating well is complicated; it depends on what school of thought you follow, and whose advice you take.,
Don't Sweat the Small Stuff - and its All Small Stuff:  Stress is a major killer in today's lifestyles.,
Exercise:  Yes, there's that dirty word again.",How to Prevent and Treat Arthritis1," The bigger the load on your joints, the bigger the stress, and the higher the likelihood you will develop osteoarthritis. Maintaining a healthy weight level as indicated by your height and build reduces the stress on your joints. For every extra one pound of weight you carry, you put four pounds of additional stress on your joints, so even a modest ten-pound weight-loss will pay off big for your joints.;
, Following the government's suggestions is not a good idea. When the federal government first began proposing its ideas on proper diet, the country had an eight-percent obesity level. Now, after fifty years of government guidelines, the country has a forty-percent (and climbing) obesity level, and a raging epidemic of diabetes as well. Find a naturopath, an integrative medical practitioner, or a knowledgeable local health food store owner who can advise you. Once you have a plan, your overall health will improve as you follow it, and you can lower your risk for developing arthritis.

, Constant stress leads to adrenaline burn-out, and all the attendant damage it does to your body. Mind-body relaxation techniques can help you cope with all of the stresses you face in your life, and keep your stress level on an even keel. Yoga, visualization techniques, mood-enhancing music and tai chi all help you reduce your stress.

, Exercise prevents arthritis and treats it after you develop it. Seems like a contradiction in terms, but exercising a sore joint will reduce the pain, inflammation, and stiffness. It's a hard thing to do once you have arthritis, but the more you exercise, the more mobility you'll gain. If you can develop a pattern of exercise before you get arthritis, you'll lower your risk of actually contracting the disease - and that's a reward well worth getting.

, Instructions may include what to eat and drink, as well as whether you're allowed to take any medications or supplements prior to surgery.


Your doctor may require that you only consume clear liquids for several days prior to surgery or may restrict your diet in other ways for 12 to 24 hours prior to surgery.

, It's not required in all cases, but you make proper arrangements ahead of time just in case.

, You won't be able to drive, so find a ride home from the hospital. You may also want someone around to help you at home as you recover. Total recovery time should take 6 to 8 weeks.

, The amount of time will depend on how your recovery is progressing. However, you must wait about 6 weeks to do anything other than desk work.

Try flax seed oil.,
Try cod liver oil.,
Try soaking in Epsom salts.,
Try taking glucosamine and/or chondroitin.,
Try herbal remedies to help with inflammation.",How to Prevent Arthritis2," Flax seed oil is a kind superfood that's high in omega-3 fatty acids, which reduces inflammation in addition to other healing properties. Flax seed oil's ability to reduce inflammation may be key in reducing pain and delaying onset of rheumatoid arthritis.

, The thought with cod liver oil is that it can potentially help slow down cartilage degeneration, thereby preventing osteoarthritis. Some studies assert that cod liver oil could potentially reverse the effect of degeneration.Try to take one or two tablespoons of the oil daily to improve your chances of preventing osteoarthritis.

, Epsom salts contain lots of magnesium. Magnesium in humans is responsible for bone growth, among other things. A magnesium deficiency lowers your body's ability to utilize calcium and phosphorus, two essential building blocks in bone growth.


Prepare a salt bath by mixing in 3 cups of Epsom salts into hot water. Stay in the bath for at least 30 minutes.

, Although the medical results are mixed, glucosamine is touted as a way to roll back cartilage degeneration. Glucosamine is a natural compound found in cartilage. It is believed that glucosamine and chondroitin, which is often taken with glucosamine, are particularly effective at preventing osteoarthritis of the knees.Still, there is no scientific consensus about the effectiveness of glucosamine and chondroitin.It could be that the sulfate form of glucosamine is effective and the non-sulfated forms are not., If you are worried about inflammation, and trying to cure the pain associated with it, you might want to consider taking herbs or herbal supplements. The following herbs have a reputation as anti-inflammatories, and may be particularly suited to preventing arthritis:


Ginger
Alfalfa seeds
Cinnamon
Tumeric

Take Oral Pain Relievers.,
Use Topical Analgesics.,
Investigate Acupuncture:  Acupuncture has been around for two thousand years.",How to Prevent and Treat Arthritis2,"  Once you've contracted arthritis, oral joint pain supplements cum relievers are your first line of defense in treating it. Exercise will help you reduce the effects, but the exercise will also because you pain, at least at first. Oral analgesics will help you cope. Allopathic oral analgesics work, but they carry nasty side effects, so it would be in your best interests to find a practitioner who knows natural pain relievers and get them to put you on a regimen.

, Topical analgesics work well at relieving pain and stiffness in sore joints. Allopathic or alternative doesn't really matter here; the allopathic topical analgesics are effective, and carry little or no side effects, so what you choose to use is up to your particular philosophy.

, The practice originated in the East, most likely in China. It spread, however, to include all the Eastern countries - Japan, Korea, Vietnam, and Thailand. The practice is scientifically justified - the needles cause nerve blocks, interrupting the synaptic messaging for the pain receptors. The Eastern philosophy says the needles open blocked channels, allowing energy to flow from the blocked areas to where it needs to be. Whichever philosophy you choose to follow, the treatment works, relieving arthritic pain for several weeks.

Pay attention.,
Take your time.,
Use handrails and stair rails.,
Educate people on the importance of handrails.,
Prevent vulnerable people from accessing stairs.,
Remove clutter.,
Improve visibility of stairs.,
Provide adequate lighting.,
Maintain stair tread.,
Wear footwear when walking down stairs.,
Avoid clothing that drags on the floor.,
Don't wear tight skirts.",How to Not Fall Down Stairs," Going down stairs is done so frequently that many accidents are caused by not paying attention to the stairway environment. Research suggests that people tend to look only at the first three steps of a stairway, rather than at each step.When walking down unfamiliar stairs, be careful to attend to each step.In older stairways, stair depth may vary. This is a significant cause of falling. Be aware of the possibility of variance, and walk carefully.
If you're nearsighted, you'll also want to wear your glasses when you walk down stairs. If your feet are out of focus, your risk for falling down stairs increases.;
, Don't hurry or run down stairs, especially on steep, curved or cramped stairways. If you are in a rush, take a breath before descending stairs.Never take stairs more than one at a time.
Keep your eyes on the stairs, particularly at the base of the stairway. Many falls occur when people assume they've reached the bottom of the stairs, and take a step out into air.

, Stair rails are the railings built around landings, while handrails are designed to be used when walking down stairs. Make sure that all railings are at a consistent height from the stair, 34-38 inches above the stair.If existing handrails are decorative, but not useful, replace them with appropriate handrails.
A handrail should allow for an adult person's hand to wrap around it. The handrail should be free of splinters or rough areas that might injure the hand.
The handrail should allow for free passage from beginning to end, without interruptions.
At the bottom of the handrail, the handrail should extend at least the length of one stair. This will allow for stability upon reaching the end of the stairs.

, Handrails can be effective tools in avoiding falling down stairs, only if they are used. Teach those who use the stairs, whether in your home or workplace, the importance of holding a handrail when walking down stairs.Handrails should be provided on both sides of the stairs. A person walking up and a person walking down stairs should both be able to hold a handrail without interruption.
Never walk down stairs without holding one hand to the handrail.

, Small children and older adults who cannot safely access stairs, such as those with dementia, should be prevented from accessing stairs by using a safety gate. Make sure that the stairs are secure, both at the top and the bottom of the stairway.Attach the safety gate securely to the wall on one side. The other side of the gate will be attached to the stair banister.
Make sure that the latch on the gate is properly closed at all times you need the gate to be effective.
Pressure gates are designed to fit between a door frame. Never use a pressure gate to block a stairway, as it will not be secure.

, Things left on stairways is a common cause for falling down stairs. Make sure stairs are free of items before walking up or down.Nothing should be loose or sticking out of stairs, such as loose boards, nails or other building debris.
Clean up any liquids that have spilled, or anything sticky that might affect passage down the stairs.
Don't place loose rugs at the top or bottom of stairs. These may slip and result in falling down stairs.

, Many falls are caused by improper judging of distance in a stairway. If stairs are more visible, these judgments are easier. You can improve visibility of stairs in your home or workplace by adding definition to each stair.Use lighting or paint to emphasize the outline of each stair. A common strategy in commercial stairways is to paint a bright strip along the end of each stair, or to light it with a string of small lights.
Use matte paint - not glossy - to avoid any glare from lights which may impair ability to gauge depth.
Don't use patterned carpets on stairs, as these may obscure depths.

, The amount of lighting recommended for safe access of stairs is 50 lux, which is about the minimum amount of light that people require to read. Make sure that lighting is well-designed for good visibility of stairs at all times. It should be easy to turn the lights on from either end of your stairway.Stair lighting can be placed on the wall, about 5-6 inches above stairs.
Lights can also be placed within each stair, lighting the stair below, or lit from underneath. Stair lighting is an opportunity to be creative!
If you find yourself at stairs without adequate lighting, use a flashlight.

, Allowing stairs to become worn, smooth, and slippery encourages falls. Reduce risk of falls by installing non-slip surfaces on the stair. These can be rubber, metal, or slip-resistant paint.These can be applied to the full stair, or just the leading edge.
Carpets should be kept in good condition. Keep stairs free of any loose threads, and replace when carpet treads are worn.

, Shoes with good treads will help support your feet as you walk down stairs. Wearing high heels, slippers with soft soles or socks are more likely to allow for slips down stairs.If your ankles are weak, make sure you also include ankle support when walking down stairs. A turned ankle may result in a fall.
Keep your feet turned slightly out for better stability.

, It's easy to step on long, flowing skirts or pants when walking up and down stairs. This will usually result in a fall. For best outcome, avoid wearing clothes of this nature when walking on stairs.If you find yourself wearing these clothes in a situation where walking down stairs can't be avoided, be careful to gather the excess material in one hand as you walk. Hold carefully to the stair rail with your other hand.
Wearing clothes that are overly long prevents you from seeing your feet. Not visually knowing where your feet are on the stairs raises the risk of falling.

, Skirts which don't allow for free movement of the knees and legs can also be a hazard. When skirts are too tight, people can't properly walk from stair to stair.If you must wear tight skirts, walk up and down stairs by putting both feet on each stair, rather than alternating stairs.
Another way to navigate stairs in a very tight skirt is to push the skirt as far up the thigh as you politely can. This allows your knees more leeway, and aids in walking up and down stairs more safely.

Recognize the symptoms of a fracture in your foot.,
Learn the ""RICE"" treatment plan.,
Take some acetaminophen.,
Go see your personal physician.,
Keep the person calm.,
Assess the fracture.,
Stop any bleeding and immobilize the fracture.,
Head to the emergency room.,
Get your foot X-rayed.,
Follow the treatment plan.",How to Treat a Foot Fracture,"


Foot fracture symptoms often start out as a slight discomfort towards the front of the foot, where most of the force and pressure is exerted. Many times, this pain is very slight and the onset is only during long periods of exercise, running or working out; this is called a ""stress fracture"" and is actually a tiny crack in the bone.As soon as you stop your activity, the pain often vanishes. This leads many people to disregard and not even consider a fracture.Other symptoms include swelling, throbbing pain, and discoloration or bruising.;
, This is universal for any kind of bone fracture or stress fracture, and is the best way to treat a fracture at home for the first 72 hours after your injury or until you can seek medical care.Rest. Immediately stop what you are doing and refrain from any activities that cause pain to your foot. No more exercising, running, or whatever it was you were doing when you felt the pain; stop and get off your feet.
Ice. As soon as possible, put ice on the injured area. If your foot is fractured, it will soon start to swell, if it hasn't already. Do not apply heat, which would encourage more blood to rush to the area and make the swelling worse. Ice it down. Using crushed ice in a damp tea towel, ice the area for 20 minutes every two hours.Compression. Wrap the injured area in a bandage fairly snugly to help reduce swelling. Be careful that it's not so tight that it cuts off the circulation; you'll know it's too tight if you experience numbness, tingling, or discoloration.Leave the toes unbandaged if possible to easily check the circulation.
Elevation. Sit down or lie down, but keep the injured foot elevated. The idea is to keep the injured foot above the level of your heart in order to decrease swelling., Your fracture is likely to cause some considerable pain, so treat the pain safely while promoting healing in your bones.


Avoid naproxen sodium and ibuprofen, which some doctors believe have the potential to delay the healing process with bone injuries., As soon as the pain and swelling have subsided, schedule an appointment with your doctor.


She will likely order some X-rays of your foot to confirm your self-diagnosis.
You may need a cast in conjunction with either a walking boot or crutches, depending upon the severity of the fracture.
She may also refer you to a physical or occupational therapist or athletic trainer if needed, particularly if the fracture is severe or if you need help to safely exercise again.

, When a bone is fractured severely due to trauma (like a car crash) or a fall, it is common for the victim to go into a state of shock, which can shut down the body's ability to repair and regulate. It's important that you keep the person as calm as possible until emergency help arrives, or until you can transport them to the hospital.


Talk in a soothing voice and reassure the person that you are there to help and that you will not leave her. Let her know help is on the way, or tell her that you will transport her to the hospital.
Try to keep her as comfortable as possible, in a laying position. Keep her warm, keep crowds back, and give her small sips of water.
Learn to recognize and treat symptoms of shock like sudden shortness of breath, paleness, sweating, dissociation, and dizziness; call 911 if the person does go into shock.

, Most fractures to the foot may be very painful but are not severe. But sometimes a traumatic injury like a car wreck or a very heavy object falling onto the foot can cause a very serious injury.


If a bone is visible, the foot joint is out of place or the foot looks deformed or misshapen, or the person is losing a lot of blood, call 911 immediately.
Even in closed fractures of the foot, if the toes are pale and cold and you are unable to find a pedal pulse (a pulse felt on the top of the foot), call 911.

, Place ABV pads or other clean, padded-type cloth over the wound. Do not attempt to bandage, as this will aggravate the injury. If you have a blanket or a pillow, long bandages or pins, you can make a support splint for the injury.


Take a blanket folded into a 2' by 3' length or a pillow and gently place it in a horizontal alignment under the heel, supporting the foot while you have to move it. Fold the pillow/blanket gently up on either side of the ankle and secure with pins or a bandage wrapped securely.
Then pin or bandage the area at the far end of the structure up around the fracture, keeping pressure gentle but firm. This makes a great, low-tech splint for injuries and allows doctors to see the damage without removing the support.
These pillow splints can be used for closed fractures as well, as they fulfill the requirement of having the joint above the injury site immobilized.

, If you suspect that someone has a broken foot, it's important that he receives medical treatment to assess the severity of the break and devise a treatment plan.


A doctor can ensure that the diagnosis of a break is correct and that the pain in the foot is not caused by another condition.

, At the hospital or doctor's office, your practitioner will conduct a series of examinations and tests, most likely including an X-ray of the bones in the foot.


An X-ray will show whether the bone is fractured severely or if it only has a hairline fracture, or if there is no fracture at all.
The X-ray is the only way to definitely know that the foot is fractured, unless it is so severely broken that the fractured bone can be felt with the hands.

, Depending on the severity and location of the break, your doctor will advise a treatment plan to minimize further injury and promote healing of the bones.


For a very minor break, this might just involve keeping the foot elevated and avoiding bearing weight on it until the bone is healed.
A more severe break may require an air boot or cast.Some very severe breaks may require surgery and/or the placement of metal plates in the foot to repair the break.

Avoid overextending your joints.,
Use braces or orthotics when exercising.,
Pay attention to your posture.,
Wear shoes with proper support.,
Take anti-inflammatory medication.,
Elevate the injured or painful joint.,
Apply heat to the sore joint.,
Seek medical advice.,
Maintain healthy sleep habits.,
Eat a healthy diet.,
Follow an exercise routine.,
Stay hydrated.,
Try occupational or physiotherapy.",How to Overcome Hypermobility Syndrome," When you have hypermobility syndrome, it means you can move your joints past the normal range. Avoid doing this on purpose to show off for friends or as a party trick.


If you often overextend your joints, you may develop arthritis over time. Arthritis is a disorder in the joints that causes severe inflammation and pain. To avoid developing this, make sure you aren’t pushing your joints past their normal range of motion too often, or on purpose.Overextending your joints could cause you to dislocate them. Dislocating your joints is painful and can damage the cartilage between your joints. It is common for people with hypermobility to dislocate or partially dislocate joints. This often due to minor trauma or, less often, some people dislocate their joints by minor self-manipulation. If you dislocate a joint, seek medical attention to reset it.;
, These precautions can help protect your joints when you are going to be using them or causing them stress, like during exercise. If you have a joint that is particularly sensitive or loose, make sure to tape or wrap that joint before stressing it.Many stores sell braces made for specific parts of the body. Your doctor might be able to recommend a specific brace or wrap. Make sure you use the brace or wrap properly to avoid injury.
Even when using a brace or orthotic, you will want to make sure you listen to your body. If you feel pain in your joints while exercising, take a break and give your joints a chance to recover before continuing.

, Avoid putting your body into positions in which it might put undue stress on your joints. For example, try not to sit with your legs crossed. Keep your hips and knees at a 90 degree angle when seated.When walking, keep your shoulders back and head up. Keeping your spine aligned will prevent any undue stress on your hips or shoulders. Bad posture can stress the nerves in your spine and put pressure on discs and muscles.Practice good posture by rolling your shoulders back and pulling your elbows toward your back. This pushes your scapula into your ribs, and pulls your spine into alignment.Make sure your workstation is ergonomically sound, meaning it is set up in a way that will not cause stress on your body.

, Many people with joint hypermobility have a condition called flat foot, which means they lack the proper arch in their foot. This can negatively affect the pressure on your joints, as well as your posture. Wearing shoes with proper support can help correct this.


Choose a shoe that has a rigid arch support. If you can press down on the arch support of the shoe and it collapses in, it will not offer you the support you need. Pick a shoe that press up into the arch of your foot firmly to support it.You can also purchase inserts to wear with shoes you already own. The same principle applies: make sure you choose an orthotic insert that will rigidly support your arch and keep the bones of your feet aligned and supported.

, Many over-the-counter options exist that you can pick up at your local drug store. If you have joint pain from your hypermobility, take the recommended dosage of one of these drugs to help ease the pain.


Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen are great options for relieving joint pain. They work in the body by reducing inflammation.If the recommended over-the-counter dosage doesn’t seem to be working, a doctor might be able to prescribe you a higher dose available through prescription.
Acetaminophen  is another option for pain relief. You might consider taking a dose of this prior to engaging in stressful activities like exercise as a preventative measure., You can treat these types of injuries the same way you might treat a sprain. Use some pillows to prop up your injured or sore joint. This will reduce swelling by limiting blood flow to the area.In addition to elevation, you will want to rest the joint. Avoid putting stress on it for 24 – 48 hours. This will allow the joint time to heal before putting more stress on it.
If your joint hurts for more than 48 hours then you have overdone it and should see a doctor., Try a hot water bottle or heating pad on a low or medium heat setting against the sore joint. Adjust the heat to your comfort level, and leave it on for 15 – 20 minutes at a time. This can soothe pain in the joint.Alternatively, you can use cold therapy to treat a painful joint. Apply a cold compress, ice pack, or bag of frozen vegetables to the injured joint in 10 minute intervals. This can reduce swelling in the area and help relieve pain.Whatever you use, make sure you wrap it in a towel or cloth to protect your skin.

, If you have severe pain, or if home remedies are not helping alleviate the existing pain, see your doctor. A general practitioner can provide further treatment and potentially diagnose any other issues that might be present.Your doctor will likely want to know the nature of the pain: when it started, how long it has lasted, how bad it is, where it is centrally located, if it has gotten worse since it began, and if it has been accompanied by other symptoms such as visible swelling or any redness.
Keep a journal to record symptoms and how you react to different treatments. This way you will know which treatment methods work the best for you.

, Sleeping is how the body restores and heals itself. By getting plenty of good sleep, you will give your body a chance to heal any injuries in your joints, and strengthen them over time.Try to establish a set bedtime and waking time. If you stick to a specific schedule, your body will likely get more and better sleep. Eventually, you will adapt to the schedule and it will happen naturally.Be aware of your sleeping positions, as well. Try to avoid lying down in positions that put any undue stress on your joints. This can cause you to wake up feeling sore or unrested. Make sure your neck is supported when you sleep, and try placing a pillow between your knees to support your hips and back. Avoid lying with all your weight on one arm, and stretch out your muscles thoroughly upon waking., In order to keep your weight under control and keep extra stress off of your joints, it’s important to eat a balanced, healthy diet. Make sure you incorporate plenty of fruits and vegetables, healthy oils, and whole grains into your everyday diet.Plan snacks and meals ahead of time. Keep a calendar on the fridge and plan meals at the start of each week. This way, you will be less tempted to overeat or snack too much between meals. You will also be less likely to eat fast food if you have your meals already planned at home.Take in more omega-3 fats, which can be found in most nuts, and fish like tuna or salmon. They may help keep joints healthy as well as decrease inflammation of the joint. Further, they reduce joint pain and tenderness in people with arthritis.If you don't like fish or aren't getting enough omega-3s from your diet, try fish oil supplements. Some health organizations recommend a daily dose of 250 to 500 mg., Exercise is an important component of any healthy lifestyle, but those who suffer from joint hypermobility will need to make sure they engage in exercise that is low-impact rather than high-impact.


Swimming and biking are low-impact exercises that are both healthy and enjoyable. Find a local health center with a pool to swim regularly, or try to incorporate biking into your daily routine.If you find that certain exercise irritates your joints more than others, stick to the ones that cause the least irritation., Like eating well and exercising, keeping your body hydrated is another important aspect of a healthy lifestyle. Dehydration is the cause of many health issues, and upping your daily water intake can help improve not just your joint health, but your overall health as well.


Most joint supplements (called glycosaminoglycans) need proper hydration to work their best with your body chemistry. If you opt to take joint supplements of any kind, make sure you maintain sufficient hydration to aid in the effectiveness of these supplements., Occupational therapy will help you relearn how to carry out every day activities in a way that will cause less stress to your joints, which can help prevent and treat symptoms over time. A physiotherapist will help you manage pain and educate you on how to manage your condition.When looking for an occupational or physiotherapist, your primary care doctor might be able to give you a referral. Your primary care doctor may also be able to recommend which type of therapy will be best for you and your needs.
Ask your therapist questions when beginning therapy. Make sure you know if you will be seen one-on-one or in a group, whether there are any therapists on staff that specialize in your specific condition, and whether you will be seen by an actual licensed therapist or by a nurse or aide.If you have private health insurance, make sure your therapist is in your network so your therapy will be covered.

Consider cross training.",How to Treat a Broken Femur," There are three phases of surgical treatment – acute, recovery and maintenance. The first priority when it comes to surgery is to rule out any other life threatening injuries and to stabilize the affected area.


Acute Phase – surgical stabilization is necessary at this point as well as the restoration of limb alignment. Traction is administered for initial stabilization to take place. Inter-medullary nailing is the treatment of choice.
Recovery Phase – the goal here is to encourage immediate weight bearing tolerance, improvement of hip and knee range of motion, and strengthening of the affected area. Gait training and crutch use is done in this phase. Low extremity aerobic training such as biking, swimming, and the use of an elliptical trainer is necessary for as long as it is tolerated.
Maintenance Phase - in this phase, weight bearing is permitted once complete healing has been achieved. Activities that can be done here include 30 to 45 minutes of bike riding in a flat surface. Walking for 3 to 5 miles (4.8 to 8.0 km) per week is also encouraged. Running can be done after 3 weeks then gradual return to usual training regimen.

After surgery, physical therapy, discussed below, is needed in order to gradually restore function to the thighs. Usually, range of motion exercises and stretches are done to give strength to the broken femur. Gradual increase in physical activity is also considered.

;
, If you are suffering from closed femoral fracture, the surgeon will wait until you become stable before conducting the surgery. However, for open fracture, an emergency surgery is done immediately to prevent infection.


Surgery for a broken femur can last up to three or four hours.

, Internal fixation is the choice surgery done to treat a broken femur. In this type of surgery, a cut is made to open the fracture, then internal fixator or special metal devices are used to hold the bone in place. Afterwards, a rod or a large nail is placed in the center of the femur to support the bone until it heals. Sometimes a plate is also placed next to the bone which is attached using screws in order to frame the outside of the leg.


Metal plates and screws will reduce the risk of further complications from occurring due to displacement.

, For external fixation, the surgeon will cut an opening to surgically place metal pins and screws into the bone above and below the fracture site. The pins and screws are attached to a bar outside the skin. This bar holds the bones together, when the skin and muscles have been injured, to promote healing.


Pins are generally used when joints are not involved.

, During intramedullary nailing, metal rods are inserted into the marrow canal of the bones through a small incision. They are then screwed to the bone at both ends. This procedure keeps the bone in its correct position during healing.


This surgery provides strong, stable and full-length fixation.

, NSAIDS contain analgesic, anti-inflammatory as well as antipyretic properties. These drugs act upon certain body chemicals to prevent the progress of inflammation during injuries.


Health care practitioners do not encourage intake of this drug for the first 48 hours of injury, to let the body follow its natural course of healing.
The most commonly prescribed drugs to manage pain and swelling includes Celecoxib (Celebrex), Ibuprofen (Advil), and Naproxen (Aleve).

, These medications ensure comfort, and manage pain and swelling. They also contain sedating properties that can ease the stress of dealing with pain.


Acetaminophen (Tylenol) is usually the drug of choice.

, In the case of a broken femur, pain can be severe and NSAIDS and other light pain medications are often insufficient. During consultation, healthcare providers generally address pain and inflammation. Prescription drugs, such as stronger painkillers, can be given to ease the sensation of pain and lessen the degree of inflammation.


Examples of prescription painkillers are codeine and tramadol.
These painkillers are only prescribed if simple painkillers do not reach the desired level of pain reduction.
Stronger types of painkillers must be taken at their proper dosage to avoid addiction and dependence.

, Antibiotics may be necessary to avoid infection. Especially in the case of open femoral fracture and directly after surgery, antibiotics may be used to prevent infection of the site. The physician will first obtain a wound culture by getting a sample of wound discharge and getting it analyzed.


If an infection is found, the physician will prescribe the right antibiotic.

, When showering, make sure to cover your brace or immobilizer with a plastic bag to keep it dry. Also, be careful to not fall or further injure yourself.


If an immobilizer is not present, carefully wash the incision site with soap and. Pat it dry gently afterwards. Remember not to rub the incision site or to put any kind of cream or lotion over it.
Avoid falling by sitting on a stool while showering.
Never soak in a tub or pool unless otherwise advised by the doctor.
Install hand rails in the shower, near the tub or next to the toilet.
Put a slip proof mat on the bathroom floor inside the shower and even in the tub.

, Change the bandage on a daily basis in order to expose the incision site to air and allow it to heal. Make sure that the wound looks healthy, and is not suffering from infection.


Watch out for the presence of redness, excessive drainage and unnecessary opening of the wound.

, Let your primary care physician and your dentist know that there are rods and pins in your leg. This will allow your doctor and dentist to take any possible metal in your system into consideration when they are treating you for other ailments.


Note that antibiotics should be taken before any kind of dental work is done, to reduce the risk of infection.
Antibiotics are a prophylactic therapy done for as long as pins and rods are inside your body.

, The bed where you sleep in should be low enough to allow your feet to touch the floor. This will not only allow you to get in and out of bed without straining your femur, it also helps to prevent falls and other accidents from occurring.

, Make sure that your house and frequented areas are set up to give you easy access and prevent falls. Also, make sure hazards are clear from trafficked areas in order to avoid accidents.


Remove loose cords, wires, and rugs from the areas where you usually walk.
Do not keep small animals because you might accidentally step on them.
Repair uneven flooring.
Provide good lighting.

, Individuals are advised to avoid contact with high temperatures such as hot baths, saunas and heat packs, because these can dilate blood vessels and increase incidents of bleeding. Although heat may feel good at first, its potentially damaging effects need to be avoided.

, Stability of the femur must be maintained to prevent additional damage to the area and its surrounding tissues. Immobilization can be achieved by putting a splint and bandage on the affected area. Extreme activities and the application of too much pressure in the injured area should also be avoided to prevent further damage to the affected area.


Avoid massage and other manipulation of the affected area until healing is complete.

, Cold compress can usually be placed over the injured area to promote constriction of blood vessels that reduces the risk of bleeding and swelling. Compression also aids in stimulating the flow of lymph fluid, which carries important nutrients to the damaged tissues surrounding the injury.


Lymph fluid also removes waste from cells and body tissues which are an important part of the tissue regeneration process. , The injured area should be kept elevated above the heart level. This action aids in proper blood circulation by promoting good venous blood return. Because the action of the veins is to return blood to the heart, elevating the injured area will allow gravity to aid venous blood return.

, Individuals suffering from a broken femur are encouraged to try exercises that may aid in strengthening the femur and restore its normal function. These exercises can be utilized to divert sensations of pain and regulate proper circulation of blood to different parts of the body, including the affected parts around the femur.


You should discuss the suitability of all exercises with your physical therapist before trying them.
Generally, the following exercises must be performed 3 times a day, provided that they do not contribute to increased pain:

, Doing hip and knee bends will increase the flexibility of your quadriceps and hamstrings, helping to restore mobility and function.


Lie on a flat surface with the head elevated 30 to 45 degrees on a pillow.
As far as is possible and comfortable, bend the affected knee towards the chest.
Return to your starting position.
Repeat this 10 to 20 times provided that there is no pain increase.

, This is a low-stress exercise that is good as a starting point for strengthening.


Lie on a flat surface with a towel under the affected leg.
Start by tightening the front thigh muscles (quadriceps) by pushing the knee in a downward motion into the towel. Hold for 5 seconds.
Place the middle and pointer finger on the inner quadriceps in order to feel the tightening of muscles. This will make sure that proper tightening is accomplished.
Repeat tightening the front thigh muscles and holding them for 5 seconds for 10 repetitions.

, Exercise and muscle movement promotes good blood circulation and oxygen distribution to the affected area. This will speed up the repair of the damaged tissue around the femur. This is because oxygen is essential for maintaining cellular integrity, function, and repair when tissues are injured. Most femoral fractures take four to six months to completely heal.
Even with proper treatment, the length of recovery will depend on the severity of the fracture and the presence of other injuries to the body.

, Eat foods that are rich in calcium such as green leafy vegetables and make it a habit to regularly drink milk. Consume vitamin D supplements to help strengthen your bones. This will ensure that you do not re-break your femur.

, Especially if you are training for a big event, wear protective equipment to ensure that you do not break a bone. Also, make sure that you take short breaks in between your training period to help your bones recover from the pressure, strain and exhaustion.

, Do not overtrain because it can cause too much strain on the femur and your other bones as well. Alternate exercises so that your bones have a period to rest. You can alternate running with non-impact activities such as cycling and swimming.

Evaluate the size of the area that needs to be wrapped.,
To make the wrap, use a white cotton sheet torn into an appropriately sized strip for the wound, cheesecloth to contain the poultice within the wrap (as it can be messy without it) and a safety pin to secure it.

",How to Use a Comfrey Poultice1,"  If we are talking about ribs, then the wrap will have to be large enough to go around a part of the body much larger than an arm, leg, wrist, ankle, etc... You should estimate the amount of herb to use by this as well.;

Keep good notes.",How to Prepare for an Orthopedic Rotation2," Pre-op notes should be written for all of The Attending Surgeon's patients in including day op patients. Results of every ordered test should be in the notes.


The Attending Surgeon will want to have a pre-op note written on all of his/her patients (chest x-ray, EKG, laboratory, culture). On outpatient surgery, these notes should be written at least the day before surgery and then put in the chart the day of surgery (the objective of a pre op note is to be sure that we do not operate on a patient who is not in condition for surgery – checking labs after the patient is asleep will not accomplish that goal!) The Attending Surgeon will be especially unsatisfied with notes documenting that laboratory or other tests have been ordered but not documenting their results. If this material is not documented, the PGII responsible will assist only. Contact The Attending Surgeon about any problems IN ADVANCE.;
"
"
There should be a note in the chart documenting that you have spoken to the patient about 1 or 2 common complications (infection, nonunion) and 1 or 2 catastrophic complications (death, NV injury) and the patient still consents.

,
The Attending Surgeon wants the x-rays up in the OR on all patients - even “scopes”.

Check to be sure that no folds of skin have been caught in the tourniquet – There have been full thickness skin losses under a tourniquet.",How to Prepare for an Orthopedic Rotation4," When the area is dirty, wash the skin with chlorhexidine soap on an OR towel, wipe it clean, then prep with Duraprep/Prevail. Duraprep alone is fine for clean elective surgery. Prep external fixators with alcohol before prepping the skin with Duraprep.

The Attending Surgeon feels that an adequate challenge to your motor learning skills is that you fully master the ability to “drive the scope”.",How to Prepare for an Orthopedic Rotation5," With certain of the more easily treated lesions, The Attending Surgeon will hold the arthroscope while you resect the lesion. Attempts to have someone at the PGII level try to both drive the scope and operate on a lesion has resulted in frustration for both you and The Attending Surgeon.

Think of a surgical procedure as being carried out by a team rather than by a specific surgeon.",How to Prepare for an Orthopedic Rotation6," It is very inappropriate to attempt to carry out part of the dissection backhanded rather than simply handing the instruments to the surgeon on the opposite side of the table who can reach that portion of the wound easily. The same is true of any other parts of a procedure for which another member of the team is better positioned.

Mr. Smith is a 30 year-old, obese, insulin dependent, diabetic male who injured his knee three months ago.,
EXPLANATION


This identifies the patient.,
Some presentations can, and should, be very short.

",How to Prepare for an Orthopedic Rotation9," He was felt to have a medial collateral ligament injury and treated with a brace and Ibuprofen 800 mg TID.

,
It gives a brief description of him and his major illnesses, and lets the listener know what our previous thought process has been regarding his condition.
Usually, “Subjective” follows “Identification”. My assessment is that the patient has a tear of the posterior horn of his medial meniscus.

Tear the sheet long and wide enough to wrap around the body twice then fold lengthwise in a trifold manner.,
Keep in mind the purpose of the sheet is to not only contain the poultice that you will spread on the cheesecloth and secure it to the body comfortably, but you want it to contain enough of the poultice to completely cover the affected area.,
Be sure to measure out enough sheet to overlap and pin securely around the affected area on the patient.,
Lay it somewhere flat then measure and cut a piece of cheesecloth long enough and wide enough to be able to spread the poultice on.,
Using dried comfrey, make the poultice.,
Spread the mucilage onto the cheesecloth.,
Place it where the wet poultice will soak through the sheet against the skin then wrap the sheet around the body accordingly and secure it with the safety pin. 

,
Do this three times a day and let the healing begin.

",How to Use a Comfrey Poultice2," This will secure the poultice within the cheesecloth. 

, It is all just common sense here so judge accordingly. 

,  (The important thing is make sure you have enough comfrey, sheet and cheesecloth material left over to change out the wraps as this should be done three times daily).

, Making sure to cut the cheesecloth wide enough to be folded as well, it will then be placed against the wound within the sheet you will wrap with, keeping the poultice in one place when applied to the wound.  Now you are ready to make the poultice.

, It's simple explained last because everything previously mentioned must always be done first.  All it involves is a placing an appropriate amount of comfrey in warm (NOT hot) water and letting it sit until it becomes slimy. 


Now you have the poultice - it will feel somewhat slimy, like mucilage. Slimy to the touch, it needs to be this consistency to release the medicinal qualities that are absorbed by the body. 
Naturally you will need less comfrey for a wrist or ankle than the amount you would use for a ribcage. Again, it's about using common sense here and the reason I am not giving you exact measurements is simple. Who has a measuring cup on a hiking expedition or in an emergency? 
If you're the accident-prone adventuresome type,  consider bringing dried comfrey in a Ziploc, strips of sheeting and cheesecloth, clip a few good size safety pins to your backpack and a small pot or can for warm water on your next excursion. You would probably pack a small pot before you will pack a measuring cup.

, Then fold the cheesecloth over and place it within the sheet.

Take pain medication.,
Follow up with your doctor.",How to Treat a Growth Plate Fracture," You may have pain or discomfort and dismiss it as a minor injury. But a growth plate fracture can be serious and affect the way your bone grows. Identifying the symptoms of a growth plate fracture can ensure that you get proper treatment. It can also help the bone heal properly and prevent stunted bone growth or deformity. A growth plate fracture may include:Pain and tenderness at a joint
Difficulty moving
Difficulty putting weight or pressure on the joint area
Warmth and swelling near a joint or end of a bone
Visible deformity;
, If you suspect a growth plate fracture, seek medical treatment as soon as possible. Let the scheduler know why you are calling so that you can see the doctor within 5-7 days of noticing symptoms of the injury. This can ensure proper treatment and minimize the risk of deformity.Go to an emergency or urgent care medical facility if you cannot see the doctor in a timely manner.
If an injury hasn't improved or healed after two or three days, you may want to visit the doctor so that the injury can be quickly evaluated. This is especially important with children and teenagers.

, A doctor is the only person who can diagnose a growth plate fracture. Your doctor will examine the area and may order tests to figure out the severity of the break as well as the best treatment.Give your doctor has much information as possible about the injury. Let them know when it happened, what symptoms you have, and if anything makes it better or worse., In addition to your exam, your doctor may order imaging tests. X-rays or an MRI can give the doctor a better idea of the fracture. They can also help determine the best treatment for you., Following your exam and an X-ray or MRI, your doctor will let you know if you have a growth plate fracture. The treatment to fix the fracture will depend on its severity. Fractures that are less severe may need a cast or splint. You may require surgery for more serious fractures. Each treatment helps the growth plate and bone heal properly. This can prevent permanent damage or deformity.Your doctor may set the plate and bone in a cast or splint if your break isn’t severe.
You may need surgery if the break is unstable or your bone fragments are displaced. Surgery generally sets the bones in place with screws, wires, or metal plates., Part of treatment for your fracture is taking care of your cast or splint, or surgical site. This allows your fracture to heal properly and may prevent complications. Your cast keeps the fractured area together. It can also minimize pain, swelling, and muscle spasms.Put a piece of heavy plastic, such as a garbage bag, around the cast when you shower or bathe. Wrap a washcloth around the edges to stop or reduce water seepage as well as skin irritations or infections.
Keep any padding intact. Let the doctor know it is bothering you and they may be able to change it.

, Skin under a cast can become easily irritated or infected if not kept clean. Things such as dirt, sand, and powder can creep inside your cast while you work or play. Avoiding them may prevent irritation and/or infection.Avoid itching under your cast with items such as hangers. These can injure your skin. If rough edges on your cast or other things cause itching, speak to your doctor before breaking them off, trimming them, or scratching under your cast.

, Your fracture may be serious and require surgery to fix it. After your surgery, the doctor will give you instructions to follow to care for the area. Most growth plate fractures require at least 6-8 weeks of recovery. During the recovery, it’s important to keep the site clean and check for possible infection. Proper care of the surgical site can help you heal better and minimize the risk of infection and/or irritation.Wash your hands with soap and water any time you touch a surgical site.Use a clean towel to dry your hands., Remove the bandages by loosening any tape. If it gets stuck, wet the tape and try again. Throw away the old dressing and wash your hands again before putting on new bandagesWash the skin around the site with mild soapy water or a saline solution. Clear away any drainage and any dried blood on your skin.
Apply skin cleansers, alcohol, peroxide, iodine, lotion, cream or herbal remedies only if your doctor instructs it. These products can damage wound tissue and slow healing. Fewer products may also help your body heal more naturally.
Observe the site for signs of infection. These include swelling, redness, and foul-smelling drainage., Let yourself and the fractured area rest as often as you need it. Using the area as little as possible promotes proper healing. Rest can also reduce discomfort and pain. After a few days, start slowly increasing activity, but make sure to protect the injury site as you do so.Wiggle your fingers or toes as often as comfortable. This can help you avoid stiffness., Ice can reduce swelling and pain. It can also promote healing. Apply an ice or cool pack to the fracture for 20 minutes at a time. Use it as often as necessary to relieve your discomfort.Wrap the ice pack in a towel. This can protect your skin from the cold and keep moisture out. Remove the pack if your skin gets too cold or numb., Just like ice, compression can minimize swelling and pain. Apply a compressive elastic bandage to your fracture area if your doctor allows it. Keep the area lightly compressed until the swelling is gone or your doctor instructs you to remove it.Recognize that compression can minimize the risk of losing mobility.

, Elevation is another way to reduce swelling and preserve mobility. If your fracture is on your arm or leg, prop it up above your heart with a pillow or other soft object. Do this any time you have swelling or discomfort. Elevate the area for as long as you can.Use a piece of furniture with some pillows to elevate your leg. Consider lying on your bed with the fractured area propped up on pillows for even better elevation and relaxation.

, Along with rest, avoid moving the fractured area around too much. This can ensure that you heal properly.Wait at least eight weeks to do your usual activities or until your doctor approves getting back to your regular lifestyle., You may be in mild to severe pain with a growth plate fracture. Taking a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication (NSAID) can reduce not only your pain, but also related swelling. Consider NSAID pain relief such as ibuprofen or naproxen sodium to relieve any pain.Talk to your doctor if you are in severe pain. They may suggest a prescription pain reliever until you begin to feel better.
Follow your doctor’s instructions if you are taking any over the counter or prescription pain medication.

, Growth plate fractures can take weeks to heal. Even after they have healed, you should carefully monitor the injury site. Your doctor may recommend certain exercises to increase motion or strength in the area. You may also have to visit your doctor for follow-up examinations for up to a year after the initial injury. This will help your doctor understand that normal growth is occurring after the injury."

Call 911 immediately if the break requires emergency care.,
Take precautions to prevent shock.,
Apply ice to control the swelling.,
Always follow up with a physician.",How to Tell if a Fall Broke Bones Without an X Ray," If you're assisting yourself or someone else, figure out what happened directly before the pain. If you're helping someone, ask what happened right before the incident. Most broken bones require a force strong enough to crack or fully break the bone. Figuring out the cause of the injury can help you assess whether it's likely or not likely that a bone was broken.A force strong enough to cause a bone to break can occur while tripping and falling, during a motor vehicle accident or as a result from a direct blow to the area, such as during a sporting event.
Broken bones can also be the result of violence (such as abuse) or repetitive stress, such as running.;
, Knowing what caused the injury can not only help you assess whether it resulted in broken bone but also whether you need to get assistance. You may need to contact emergency services (911), the police in the case of a car accident or child services in the case of child abuse.


If the injury does not appear to be a broken bone (it may, for instance, be a sprain, which occurs when ligaments are overextended or even torn), but the individual nevertheless expresses that he is in significant pain, you should call emergency services (911) or offer to escort him to a nearby clinic or hospital if his injury and/or pain is not urgent (e.g., the injury is not bleeding profusely, he can still talk and form complete sentences, etc.)
If the person is unconscious or cannot communicate with you, or if the person is communicating but incoherent, you should call emergency services as this may be an indication of a head injury. See Part Two below.

, Recall if you're the injured party or ask the injured person what was felt or experienced at the time of the fall. People who suffer from a broken bone will often describe hearing or “feeling” a snap in the area. Thus, if the person mentions that she heard a snap, this is usually a good indication that something has been broken.The person may also describe a grating feeling or sound (like pieces of bone rubbing up against one another) when the area is moved, even if the individual doesn't immediately experience pain. This is called crepitus., When a bone breaks, the body responds immediately with the feeling of pain. Both the break itself and any injuries to the body tissue near the site of the break (such as the muscles, ligaments, nerves, blood vessels, cartilage, and tendons), can cause pain. There are three levels of pain to be on the lookout for:



Acute pain — This is a heightened and intense feeling of pain that usually occurs right after the bone has broken. If you or another person expresses extreme pain, this could be a sign of a broken bone.

Sub-acute pain —This type of pain occurs in the first few weeks after a break, particularly as the fracture heals. This pain primarily occurs because of the stiffness and muscle weakness that are effects of the lack of movement required to heal the broken bone (e.g., in a cast or sling).

Chronic pain — This is a feeling of pain that continues even after the bone and its tissues have healed and can occur several weeks or months after the initial break
Note that it's possible to experience some or all of these types of pain. Some people feel acute and sub-acute pain but not chronic pain. Other people may experience a fracture without any or minimal pain, like the baby toe or the spine.

, There are a number of signs that may indicate the presence of a broken bone, including:Deformity in the area and movement in an unnatural direction
Hematoma, internal bleeding, or severe bruising
Difficulty moving the area
The area looks shorter, twisted or bent
Loss of strength in the area
Loss of normal function of the area
Shock
Severe swelling
Numbness or tingling in the area or below the area of the suspected break

, In the case of a small fracture, there may be no visible deformity to the area and only minimal swelling that might not be noticeable to your eye. So you will have to do a more detailed assessment to see if there is a broken bone.Often broken bones will cause people to modify their behavior. For example, people will often avoid putting weight or pressure on that area. This is one indication that something is not right, even if you can't see any broken bone with the naked eye.
Consider the following three examples: a broken bone in the ankle or leg will often create enough pain that a person will not want bear weight on that leg; a broken bone in the arm or hand will create enough pain that a person will want to protect the area and not use the arm; pain from broken ribs will keep people from taking deep breaths.

, Broken bones can often be identified by point tenderness, meaning that the area of the bone is extremely painful in one specific spot when that region on the body is pressed, as opposed to pain over a generalized area. In other words, the feeling of pain spikes whenever pressure comes close to the broken bone. There is a higher likelihood that the bone has been broken when point tenderness is present.Generalized pain with palpation (gentle pressure or prodding) over an area larger than three fingers width is more likely to be from ligament, tendon or other tissue damage from the injury.
Note that immediate bruising and large amount of swelling more likely indicates tissue damage and not a broken bone.

, Keep the following factors in mind if you are faced with determining whether a child under the age of 12 has broken a bone. Overall, it's usually best to take your child to the doctor to receive a formal diagnosis if you suspect a broken bone, as a broken bone can affect the growth of the child's bones. This way your child can also receive immediate and appropriate treatment.Younger children cannot usually identify pinpoint pain or point tenderness well. They have a more generalized neurological response to pain than adults.
It is difficult for children to rate how much pain they are feeling.
The pain of a fracture for children is also much different because of their bones' flexibility. Children's bones are more likely to bend or partially snap than break.
You know your child best; if their behavior suggests that they are in more pain than you expect from the injury then seek medical attention for the injury.

, Only move someone if there is imminent danger when a bone is broken during a serious fall or from a car accident. Do not try to realign the bones or move the injured person if he is unable to move on his own. This will avoid further injury to the area.Do not move anyone with a pelvic or hip fracture; pelvic fractures can cause massive internal bleeding into the pelvic cavity. Instead, call emergency services right away and wait for medical support. However, if a person with this kind of injury absolutely must be transported without emergency medical attention, then place a roll or pillow between the person's legs and secure the legs together. Roll the person onto a board for stabilization by rolling them as one piece. Keep the shoulders, hips and feet lined up and roll them all together while someone slides a board under her hips. The board must reach from the middle of the back to the knees.Do not move a person with a potential broken back, neck or head. Immobilize her in the position in which you find her and call for emergency help immediately. Do not try to straighten her back or neck. Tell emergency personnel you suspect a broken head, back or neck and why. Moving the person could cause severe long-term damage, including paralysis.

, Care for all wounds before dealing with a broken bone.If a bone is protruding from the skin, do not touch it or try to place it inside the body. The color of bone is usually gray or light beige, not the white bone you see on Halloween and medical skeletons.


If there is severe bleeding, always take care of the bleeding before dealing with the broken bone.

, Only provide care to the broken bone if emergency medical treatment is not expected immediately. If emergency personnel are expected immediately or you are en route to a hospital, splinting the area can do more harm than good. However, if treatment in a medical facility is not immediately available, you can help to stabilize the bone and relieve the pain using these guidelines.


Splint a broken arm or leg to give it support. Do not try to realign the bone.To make a splint you can use material you have on hand or can find nearby. Look for rigid material to make the splint, such as a board, stick, rolled up newspaper, and so on. If the body part is small enough (like a small toe or finger) it can be taped to the toe or finger next to it to provide stability and splinting.Pad the splint with clothing, towels, blankets, pillows or anything else that is soft at hand.
Extend the padded splint to beyond the joint above and below the break. For instance, if the lower leg is broken, the splint should go above the knee and lower than the ankle.Similarly, breaks on joints should be splinted to both of the bones adjacent to the joint.
Secure the splint to the area. You can use a belt, rope, shoelaces, anything that is handy that will keep the splint in place. Be careful when you apply the splint not to cause further injury to the body. Pad the splint well so it doesn’t add pressure to the injured area but only immobilizes it., This helps support the arm and avoid fatiguing the muscles. Use a piece of cloth that is approximately 40 inches square cut from a pillowcase, bedsheets or any other larger material. Fold it into a triangular piece. Place one end of the sling under the injured arm and over the shoulder while taking the other end over the other shoulder and cradling the arm. Tie the ends behind the neck., If you notice any of the following, emergency medical treatment is required. If you cannot call yourself, then send another person to call 911.The suspected broken bone is part of another major trauma or injury.
The person is unresponsive. In other words, if the person is not moving or talking. If the person is not breathing, you should administer CPR.
The person is breathing heavily.
The limb or the joint appears to be deformed or bent at an odd angle.
The area where the bone is broken is numb or bluish at the tip.
The suspected broken bone is located in the pelvis, hip, neck, head or back.
There is heavy bleeding.

, Broken bones experienced during a significant accident can trigger shock.Until emergency personnel arrive or until you make it to a medical center, lay the person down flat, feet elevated above the level of his heart and his head lower than his chest if possible. If a break is suspected in a leg, do not elevate that leg. Cover the person with a coat or blanket.Remember, do not move anyone at all if you suspect that the person's head, back or neck is broken.
Make the person comfortable and keep him warm. Pad the affected area with blankets, pillows or clothing to pad the area. Talk to the person to help distract from the pain., Open the clothing around a potential broken bone and apply ice to help control the swelling. This will assist the doctor in setting the bone and help to control pain. Do not apply directly to the skin but wrap the ice pack or bag of ice in a towel or other material.You could also use something from your freeze that you have on hand, such as a bag of frozen vegetables or fruit.

, You should make an appointment with your doctor or visit a medical clinic to get an X-ray if you notice symptoms later on that did not appear at the time of injury. Do this if you or the affected person experience pain in the injured area without noticeable improvement over several days or if you or the affected individual did not initially experience point tenderness over the injured area in the first few hours but develop it in the next day or two. Sometimes tissue swelling can inhibit the perception of pain and point tenderness.


Though this article is intended to help you determine if you have broken a bone with an X-ray, it is strongly advised you visit a doctor as soon as possible if you have any suspicion that you broke something in a fall or other accident. If you walk around with a broken limb or other body part either knowingly or unknowingly for too long, it could lead to long term injury in the area.

Visit your doctor every 4-6 months.,
Wear a brace.,
Have surgery.,
Have chiropractic treatments.Seeing a chiropractor can help if you have pain due to your scoliosis, and may be able to help improve the curve of your spine.,
Try serial casting for infantile scoliosis.",How to Reduce Scoliosis Curvature1," In order to treat your scoliosis, it’s important to understand where your spine is curving and in which direction. See your doctor to have a physical exam done, and get an x-ray of your spine. Continue to visit your doctor every 4-6 months for repeat x-rays to monitor for change. Ask for a copy of the x-ray to bring home with you, or at least have your doctor write down the exact location of your spine’s curve – for instance, “right-sided curve in T4 through T7.”Scoliosis curvature can be either S-shaped or C-shaped. C-shapes are single curves in the spine, whereas the S-shape is basically a C shape but the lower spine curved in the other direction to compensate, causing a double curve.;
, Your doctor can give you a back brace to wear to help realign the curve of your spine. Braces are most helpful if your bones are still growing, so they’re usually not used anymore once you get your period, have stopped growing taller, or have to shave your face every day (boys).Braces are tight-fitting and some are nearly invisible underneath your clothes, so people probably won't even notice that you're wearing one. They don't have to limit your activity or significantly change what you do every day, so they're a great choice to use temporarily.



Full torso (Milwaukee) braces are good for high curves. They have to be worn at all times other than during bathing – for at least 23 hours a day.Thoracolumbar-Sacral Orthoses (TLSO) are less visible, and can be effective for mid- to lower-back curves. They work better the more you wear them.Nighttime braces are newer on the market and some doctors question how well they work, especially since 10% of people who use them still end up needing surgery. However, they may be useful for small curves.They must be worn at least 8 hours a night, and they put much more corrective force on your body than full-time braces., Consider having surgery if your scoliosis is severe or your doctor thinks it is going to keep getting worse. Surgery may seem scary, but these doctors do surgeries like these often to help young people treat their scoliosis. The most common surgery is spinal fusion, where two parts of your spine – the vertebrae – are connected together to prevent further changes.Many factors determine whether surgery is right for you, so talk to your doctor about your scoliosis and treatment options.Another surgery is to put a metal rod in your back to help keep it straight. The rod is adjusted to get longer as your grow taller, usually every 6 months. This can be helpful if your scoliosis is getting worse quickly.Dealing with the problem now can significantly help for when you're older.

, It’s unclear whether long-term conditions like scoliosis can be improved with chiropractic.Some evidence suggests that regular chiropractic treatments are especially helpful for adults with scoliosis.Talk to your doctor about whether seeing a chiropractor may help, and get a referral if possible.

, Scoliosis in infants and young children can be treated with serial casting, casting the baby’s body in progressively larger casts as they grow.This helps the spine to grow straighter. Casts usually need to be changed every 2-4 months for children aged 2-4 years, respectively.

Work with a professional on Physiotherapeutic Specific Exercises (PSEs).,
Do At-Home Exercises.,
Do side planks every day.,
Start doing yoga.,
Participate in other exercises.",How to Reduce Scoliosis Curvature2," The Society on Scoliosis Orthopaedic and Rehabilitation Treatment has designed a set of PSEs, exercises specific to scoliosis that should be performed with a physiotherapist. Talk to your doctor about referral to a treatment specialist. Attend physiotherapy at least 2-4 times per week for best results.Working with a professional is recommended so that you can learn the best exercises specific to your exact spinal curve.

, Exercises have been designed to improve posture, reduce pain, and increase flexibility for those with scoliosis – though these have not been scientifically proven to improve the curve of your spine. However, curve-specific exercises may help improve the shape of your spine by retraining your brain to know what is “correct” posture. Be sure you’re aware of what your spinal curvature is, and try these curve-specific exercises:One sided (C-shaped) thoracic curve: Sit up tall with your spine as straight as possible. Reach in an upward diagonal direction, slightly forward from midline. Hold the posture for as long as you can.

Right-thoracic, left-lumbar S-shaped curve: Lie on your back on a flat surface. Place your right hand on your right lateral chest, basically over the sides of your right ribs. Place your left hand on the left side of your pelvis. Leave your hands where they are and do not flex your spine, and try to bring your hands closer together by squeezing your abdominal muscles. Try to have your upper body shift to the left and your lower body shift to the right, just using your abs.

For left-thoracic, right-lumbar curve, switch the hand positions.



, The side plank exercise has been shown to improve spinal curvature for some people. Start out by doing this exercise every day for 10-20 seconds for the first week. Then hold the pose for as long as you can on a daily basis. Only do this exercise on the weaker, convex side of your spine.Turn onto your weaker side with your legs out straight and stacked one on top of the other, and feet and hips on the ground. Put your elbow right underneath your shoulder to prop up your body. Align your head with your spine to make a straight line between your head and your feet. Hold this position.

, Yoga practice can help to stretch the tight muscles around your spine to improve pain, and strengthen your back muscles.Do Downward Dog and hold it for as long as you can, which can be an especially effective posture for scoliosis.Try to do a little bit of yoga stretches on a daily basis.

, People with scoliosis, or those who have been treated for it in the past, can still participate in many types of physical activity including sports and regular gym exercises. Find an exercise routine that works for you and stick to it. It is good for your overall health, and scoliosis should not prevent you from participating.If you are particularly worried about a certain type of exercise, or if you experience pain or other complications after exercise, contact your doctor.

Create a bone-friendly diet for your child.,
Supplement your child’s diet with vitamins if necessary.,
See that your child spends some time in the sun.,
Provide your child with the appropriate equipment for their physical activities.,
Teach your child safe practices to avoid injury.,
Monitor your child at the playground.,
Make a habit of eating bone-friendly food.,
Take supplements to maintain healthy, strong bones.,
Avoid introducing substances to your body which prevent it from absorbing calcium.,
Exercise to strengthen your bones.,
Prevent falls by wearing proper footwear.,
Create a fall-free environment.",How to Prevent Breaking Bones," Bones grow fastest early in life and in puberty. The bones increase in density until they reach peak bone mass. The denser your child’s bones are at peak bone mass, the greater their reserves to protect against osteoporosis later in life.Serve your child at least five portions of fruits and vegetables per day. (Don’t exceed more than one 150ml glass of fruit juice.)Maintain a daily diet that includes carbohydrates. Potatoes, pasta, rice and wholegrain bread are examples.Include protein in your child’s diet. Meat, fish, nuts, beans, eggs and seeds work well.Offer your child plenty of dairy products such as milk and cheese.;
, Calcium makes our bones and teeth hard. Ninety-nine percent of the calcium in our bodies is found in teeth and bone. Vitamin D helps us to absorb calcium.Insure that your child is getting the recommended intake of calcium. The recommended daily requirement is 1,000 (mg/daily) four to eight year olds. 1,300 (mg/daily) nine to 13 year olds.Your child should focus on getting his required calcium intake past childhood and into young adulthood, as peak bone mass is not generally reached until age 30.

, The required amount of vitamin D is 600 (IU/daily). Sunlight is our main natural source of vitamin D.Short, regular periods of exposure to the sun (without sunscreen) are enough to get most people the vitamin D they need.
Children with lighter skin should get 10 – 15 minutes of sunlight per day.Children with darker skin need to spend a little longer in the sun to get the same amount of vitamin D.Never let your child's skin get red or start to burn.
Babies under six months should not be exposed to direct sunlight., Among the most common injuries to children are those involving bikes and skateboards. Most occur from not using proper gear.Protect your child from skateboarding, bike riding, scooter riding and in-line skating injuries with knee and elbow pads and wrist guards (and, of course, helmets).Elbow pads can prevent 82% of elbow injuries, and knee pads can prevent 32% of knee injuries.Choose the proper bike size for your child. A child should be able to straddle the bike with both feet on the ground. If the bike is too large, your child won’t be able to comfortably use the brakes.Buy durable in-line skates with proper ankle supports., From bike riding to jumping on a trampoline, place your child in position to participate safely in physical activities. Whatever the activity, ensure that your child begins slowly and is in control while learning safety rules.


Encourage your child to master the proper technique of skateboarding before trying tricks. Practice on level ground. About a third of skateboard injuries happen in the first few weeks of skateboarding.Encourage your child to crouch down whenever they think they might take a skateboard spill so that there will be a shorter distance to fall.Only allow one person per skateboard. This will help prevent more injuries, as having more than one person on a skateboard is dangerous. If all people are not at the same level of balance, the skateboard can flip and serious injury can occur to all persons riding the same skateboard.Begin bike riding on soft surfaces. A closely cut lawn works and will cushion a fall.
Beware of trampolines. Experts suggest that trampolines should never be used as play equipmentMake a rule that no more than one child can be on a trampoline. Many broken bones are due to children colliding while jumping. Not all injuries are as serious, but can still affect them physically for a period of time. Do not take this risk.Teach your child to ice skate by using a milk crate as a ""crutch"" for the child. The child holds onto the milk crate and pushes it across the ice while skating.

, Each year around 200,000 children are injured in playgrounds in America. Don't assume that because the playground is designed for children, it's safe. Always supervise your child to prevent her from doing anything too dangerous.Stand beneath your child if your child is playing on the monkey bars or slide. Falls from monkey bars and slides are one of the main causes of fractured arms in playgrounds. Always be ready to catch them.Be careful if you are sliding down a slide with your toddler. If the child's foot gets stuck, your weight pressing on the child from behind can cause a broken shin bone., Food which contains calcium or vitamin D should be introduced to your diet regularly. Eat foods rich in calcium to aid in strengthening bones. The recommended daily calcium intake for women 51 – 70 is 1200mg. For men 51 – 70 it is 1000mg. For men and women 71 and older it is 1200mg.There are several good sources of calcium that you can add to your diet. Consume plenty of dairy products. Greek yogurt and milk are good sources of calcium.Include sweet potatoes, white potatoes (including the skin), yogurt and bananas in your diet. They are rich in potassium. Studies suggest that potassium might neutralize the acids that remove calcium from the body.Eat lots of leafy vegetables. Dark leafy greens including chard, arugula, collards, spinach and kale are high in calcium.

, Studies suggest that most Americans do not meet the lower end of their calcium requirements.Care for osteoporosis includes intake of calcium and vitamin D. Continued use of them is recommended for optimal fracture prevention.The recommended daily allowance of calcium for adults is about 1,000 (mg/daily). The allowance varies according to age.Vitamin D is important because it helps your body to absorb calcium by allowing it to enter your bloodstream. The recommended allowance of Vitamin D is about 600 (IU/daily).Vitamin K reduces fracture rates. It also increases bone mineral density in osteoporotic people., There are certain things which work against your body absorbing calcium--they function directly opposite to vitamins, like D, which help your body to absorb calcium.


Do not go over the recommended daily sodium intake! Sodium affects calcium requirements because it increases the amount of calcium we excrete in urine.Consume less caffeine. Studies have shown that drinking more than two cups per day accelerates bone loss for people who are not getting enough calcium.Monitor alcohol consumption. Like caffeine, it's not necessary to eliminate it from your diet. But excessive consumption of alcohol prevents vitamin D from helping your body to absorb calcium.Refrain from smoking. Another reason to quit! Studies have shown that smoking can prevent the body from absorbing calcium thereby decreasing bone mass., Regular exercise is a key to bone health. Bone is living tissue and, like muscle, it weakens if not exercised. High-impact or low-impact weight-bearing exercises are effective ways to exercise.Bones become stronger when called upon to bear weight.


High-impact weight-bearing exercises are: dancing, high-impact aerobics, hiking, jogging/running, jumping rope and stair climbing.Low-impact weight-bearing exercises include: the elliptical machine, low-impact aerobics, stair-climbing machines, and walking on a treadmill or outside.Resistance exercises are also effective in improving muscle mass and strengthening bone. An example of a resistance exercise is weight training (free weights or weight machines).Staying physically active has the added benefit of helping with your coordination and keeping your reflexes sharp which will lower your risk of falling. If you're fit, you're less likely to lose your balance., Choose the right shoes to reduce your chances of breaking a bone. Falls are the most common cause of broken bones among the elderly.Wear comfortable shoes with rubber soles. Avoid sneakers with deep treads. Women: refrain from wearing high heels when you can.Select winter boots with rubber soles for added traction., Broken bones are often caused by in-home falls. A shoe or toy might be out of place, a stairway unlit, a room too dark. Your home should be as safe as possible to decrease your chances of having an accident leading to a broken bone.


Use nightlights so that you'll be able to move safely through the house.Keep the house free of items which present a hazard. Shoes can be placed against a wall or in a closet rather than in the middle of the floor. Electric wire and telephone cord can be tucked behind furniture or stapled to baseboards.Use a handrail when climbing the stairs. Install a handrail if you don't have one.When entering a room, be aware of steps and thresholds.Carpets and area rugs should be tacked or fixed to the floor to avoid slipping.Place florescent tape at the top and bottom of your stairs. Be sure your stairs are well lit.Make your bathroom safe. Use a rubber mat in the shower or tub. Install a grab rail for the tub or shower.Taller ""comfort height"" toilets also make it easier for the elderly to get up and down, reducing falls.
Use wall switches for lamps if you don't have an overhead light, so that you don't have to cross a room in the dark to get to your lamp.Keep a flashlight beside your bed."

Stay healthy mentally.,
Know the basic cycle of recovery.",How to Recover from a Broken Heel," First of all, those who are younger usually have shorter healing time, and better outcomes long term regardless of surgery or not. However there are other key players that make a big influence in recovery.;
, Eating a diet high in Vitamin D and calcium is extremely important for bone repair. Fish and dairy are two very good sources. Taking vitamin supplements like vitamin C is important for tissue and bone repair and can also help. You can also get this vitamin from eating lots of fruits and vegetables, too.

, When you are able, doing range of motion exercises are important to reduce pain. When the doctor tells you that it's okay, you should take off the boot to do exercises at least once or twice a day, which is typically after a few weeks of the injury. These don't have to be too intense; you're just working on regaining the use of that part of your body.

, This is very important to your recovery, whether it's at a therapist's office or at home. If your therapist gave you a resistance band, there are many exercises, such as wrapping the band near the ball of your foot, and pointing and flexing your foot as much as possible. That is just one of the many exercises that are important for recovery. Also, it is important to see a physical therapist to ensure you are doing exercises correctly to decrease the chance for injury.

, Many people are unable to return to work, or a normal life for 2-3 months. Most are stuck in the house everyday and experience severe cabin fever. This is an excellent time to focus on yourself! What are some things you always wanted to do, but never had the time to do? You could pick up a new hobby such as knitting, write poems, do jigsaw puzzles with your loved ones, beat a few video games. You might experience yourself going crazy at times, because you are severely limited at what you can do. In order to ease yourself, you might as well try to discover new fulfilling activities.

, For example, at about 8-12 weeks, you are able to walk, but with much pain and stiffness. This is where physical therapy becomes extremely helpful. However physical therapy might be painful and any pain should be discussed with the therapist. Full recovery usually takes about a year. Talk to your physician about what course of recovery to expect with the severity of your injury.


It may be hard to return to work that requires you to be on your feet all day. It would be helpful to get a doctor's note to give to your employer so they are required to give you light work.

Manage your pain.,
Begin to move around the day after your surgery.,
Use a cane, walker, or crutches.,
Arrange for help around your home.",How to Recover From a Hip Fracture1," Your doctor should discuss pain relief options with you. A common treatment includes non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), but your doctor may prescribe opioids or local anesthesia instead.

If your doctor prescribes opioids, use them with care because they can be addictive.
Your pain should improve in three days, so talk to your doctor if it doesn’t.You can also use ice packs to help with your pain. Apply the ice packs for ten minutes at a time.;
, While you’ll be in pain and will likely want to stay in bed, it’s important that you stand up and try to walk the day after you have hip surgery, unless your doctor instructs you otherwise. In most cases, members of your care team will come to help you with your initial recovery walks.Make sure that you have help from someone or have access to a walker.
Regular movement also prevents blood clots, pneumonia and bedsores from occurring, all of which are common complications after hip surgery.

, Walking after your hip fracture will be difficult, so use support. Your doctor or physical therapist can recommend the best option for meeting your needs. Recovery can take up to a year, so don’t push yourself too far too fast.Learning to walk again may take up to three months.
The majority of people who have a hip fracture regain most of their mobility after recovery., If you’re planning to return home soon after surgery, arrange to have a nurse, friend, or family member help you around your home until you are able to regain more of your mobility. At first, you will struggle with cooking, cleaning, and caring for yourself.


You may need to spend time in a rehabilitation facility right after surgery. While you may be unhappy about moving to a care facility, it will help you recover.You will likely be in the hospital for 2-7 days."

Familiarize yourself with strapping options.,
Buy bandages for your elbow.,
Get your skin ready for taping or bandaging.,
Protect your skin before taping or bandaging.,
Cut the tape for application.,
Ask for help.,
Raise your arm for taping or bandaging.,
Continue to place the tape along your arm.,
Wrap the tape or bandage around your forearm.,
Secure the bandage.,
Check the tightness of the bandage wrapping.,
Give your elbow and arm a rest.,
Apply ice to your elbow and arm.,
Take pain medication.,
See your doctor.",How to Strap an Elbow," There are different materials that you can buy to strap and support your elbow. Either trainer’s tape or kinesiology tape or tubular bandages can help limit your range of motion that is causing you discomfort, reduce stress on the injured tissue, and may allow more blood to flow to the injured area.Trainer’s and kinesiology tape are often best for muscle injuries. The tape expands when you move, making the treatment comfortable and practical if you have an active lifestyle or continue to exercise.If you have sensitive skin, consider trying quick release medical tape, which combines the strength of trainer’s and kinesiology tapes with less chance of irritating the skin during wear or removal.Tubular medical bandages are wrapped around the affected area and then affixed with tape or a small fastener. This might also be a good option if you have sensitive skin.
Tubular bandages are an especially good option for wrapping joints or even to cover tape.You can purchase trainer’s and kinesiology tape and bandages at many pharmacies, medical supply stores, and sports stores. Some larger retailers may also carry it.
Consider trying to strap your elbow with duct tape, which is as supportive as trainer’s or kinesiology tape.Some professionals may recommend using black tape, as it can adhere better to sweaty skin.;
, Purchase bandages to wrap, strap, and support your elbow. Bandages will support your elbow and they may also help to reduce any swelling you have.You can use most types of medical wrap bandages at pharmacies, medical supply stores, and even some sports stores.
Make sure to buy a bandage that is long enough to wrap your elbow enough to support and immobilize it.
You will need to purchase medical tape or pins to keep the bandage in place.

, Prepare your arm skin for taping or bandaging by washing and shaving it, if necessary. This can not only help remove dirt and debris, make the tape stick more effectively, but also may prevent any discomfort when you remove the tape or bandage.Wash away any oils, sweat or dirt that may be on your skin with a gentle cleanser and warm water. This can minimize the risk that the tape or bandage doesn’t adhere properly to your arm.Any type of mild soap can effectively clean your arm. Make sure to rinse or wipe off all of the soap.
If you have chosen not to use an underwrap (see next step) or have a lot of hair on your arm, you may want to shave your arm.Shave with care to prevent cutting your skin and causing injury., If you prefer not to place the tape or bandage against your skin, place an underwrap between the tape and your skin. If you use an underwrap, be aware that it is not as effective as using tape only.You do not have to use an underwrap or skin adhesives with tape or bandages.Spray the skin adhesive and or apply the underwrap to the areas of your arm you plan to wrap.You can buy underwrap and skin adhesive at most pharmacies, medical supply stores and some sports stores.

, You may need to cut the tape before you wrap your elbow depending on whether you bought strips or a round of tape. Pre-cutting the tape can help ensure you use the right amount and prevent you from wasting any tape.Cut pieces of your tape to approximately the length of your forearm. You may also want some smaller pieces.Rounding the edges of the tape can make it easier to apply.If your tape has backing, remove it before application.

, You may find it difficult to wrap or tape your elbow with one arm. Consider asking a friend or family member to assist you taping and bandaging. This can help ensure proper application., Hold up the arm you want to tape or bandage to one side. Keep your elbow straight and flex your wrist so your fingertips are pointing downwards.








If you cannot hold up your arm, consider propping it up on a chair or the sofa to help you.
Without stretching the tape, apply one piece down the length of your arm to just below your elbow.Use the same principle with a bandage. Start at the wrist and bring the bandage up to just under the elbow.

, You’ll need to wrap two more pieces of tape to strap your elbow. This will help ensure optimal support and stabilization.








Make sure the tape is taut, but don’t wrap it tightly, which could cut off your circulation.If your skin gets irritated or throbs, you may have wrapped the tape or bandage so tightly that it cut off your circulation. Remove it immediately and reapply in a looser fashion., Bring the tape or bandage around the front of your forearm in diagonal fashion in a downward motion.This can help provide extra support to your elbow and forearm areas.








Add one final piece of tape around the top of your wrist.Wrap the rest of the bandage around your arm. Overlap each layer slightly. The bandage should snugly and comfortably cover your elbow and forearm area.If you find that you need more support or still have pain, consider adding additional pieces of tape or even re-bandaging your arm more tightly.

, Once you have finished wrapping your elbow, secure the bandage so it doesn’t fall off. You can do this by attaching the end to the a safety pin, clip, or a piece of medical tape.

, Briefly walk around before starting any activity. If the tape or bandage is too tight, take it off and reapply or rewrap your elbow so that it is supportive, yet comfortable.









Check to make sure that the circulation is normal. Checking your pulse can help you figure out if the bandage is too tight. If your pulse is between 60 and 100, your circulation is fine and the bandage is not too tight. Finger swelling or a sensation of tightness could indicate that the dressing is too tight and needs to be loosened.
You can also use the fingernail method. Press down on one of your fingernails and see how long it takes for the pink color to return to the nail. If it takes longer than four seconds, your blood circulation may be constricted, which could mean that the bandage is too tight.

, Take some time rest or switch to lighter activities. Immobility, rest, and undertaking lower-impact activities may help heal your elbow and minimize pain.Avoid high-impact sports such as running or tennis. Instead, try lower-impact options such as biking or walking.You may also want to allow your arms to rest completely for a few days or weeks.Start using the affected area more after you’ve rested. This can help minimize stiffness. If it causes too much pain, discontinue movement and see your doctor or get more rest., Place an ice pack or cold compress on your elbow and arm. This may reduce swelling and alleviate pain.Make sure there is a barrier between the ice and your skin — either the bandages or a towel to protect your skin from damage.


You can use an ice pack as often as necessary for 20 minutes at a time up to five times a day.
You can freeze a styrofoam cup full of water to gently massage your elbow and arm with ice.If it is too cold or your skin gets numb, remove the pack., Consider taking pain relievers for discomfort or severe pain. These medications can help relieve pain and may also reduce swelling.Take over-the-counter pain relievers such as ibuprofen or naproxen sodium.Ibuprofen and naproxen sodium also have anti-inflammatory properties that can help decrease swelling., If taping, bandaging, and other treatments don’t relieve your elbow issues, consult your doctor. She may be able to figure out if you have a serious injury as well as help formulate an effective treatment plan.You can see your regular doctor or visit an orthopedist, who specializes in treating disorders such as shin splints or tennis elbow.Your doctor will likely examine your arm and elbow to feel or look for signs of injury. She will also likely ask for a health history, such as what type of activities you do and what measures you’ve taken to reduce pain and promote healing.Your doctor may order additional tests such as an MRI or an X-ray to see your arm and elbow in greater detail. This can help her make a definitive diagnosis.

Get a hot or cold pack.Hot packs and cold packs are small bags filled with a special gel-like substance that can be frozen or heated, then applied to the skin at the point where it hurts for pain relief.,
Ask your boss for a workplace accommodation.A workplace accommodation is any kind of adjustment to your workspace or responsibilities that will help you manage your chronic back pain.,
Use transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS).,
Stay active.Engaging in physical activity that gently stretches and strengthens your back is a good way to reduce your back pain.,
Visit a massage therapist.Massage therapy can help relieve pain in your back.",How to Manage Chronic Arthritic Back Pain2," Wrap the hot or cold pack in a paper towel or washcloth and place it on your back where you’re experiencing pain.


Whether you use a hot or cold pack depends on how your body responds to each type. Some people find one works better than the other. Others find both work equally well.
Alternately, you could use a hot-water bottle or heat blanket to provide warmth and pain relief on your back. Hot bath or a washcloth soaked in warm water may also help. If you do not have a cold pack, wrap ice in a washcloth to make a cold compress.
Apply cold packs for no more than 15-20 minutes. Longer than that and you risk damaging your skin., An accommodation might be as simple as providing you a different chair with better padding to sit on at your desk. You might also request a transfer to a less physically rigorous job at the same company. Be prepared to provide verification from your doctor if management requests such.


If things are really bad for you, you could request a reduction in your work hours.
If your back pain is so serious that you feel you cannot work at all, you might be able to file a disability claim. Usually, only the most serious cases can receive disability pensions through Social Security. If you believe your case is severe enough to warrant a disability claim, contact a lawyer to help walk you through the filing process., TENS is a technique in which electricity is sent to your nerves in order to block the pain signals to your brain. A TENS device is about the size of a tape cassette, and has two or more electrodes coming out of it. When you feel pain, apply the electrodes to the skin of the affected area, or as directed by your doctor. Once turned on, the device sends a low-level electrical impulse to your brain, reducing or eliminating the pain signal.


Ask your doctor what the best power settings for the device is., Dance, yoga, and other whole-body activities might help reduce your back pain.


Don’t strain yourself. Sports and strenuous physical activity -- especially anything that involves bending or lifting -- can exacerbate your back pain. Consider using an activity tracker to monitor your steps so that you don't over-extend yourself.While physical activity is important, try to avoid contact sports like hockey, rugby, and football.
Instead, go for a run or ride your bike to meet your daily activity requirements.
Losing weight (even if you are only modestly overweight) can help reduce your pain. A large belly pulls the spine into an unnatural position and causes hunching.

, By gently massaging your back in sensitive and painful areas, the massage therapist can reduce your pain. Many forms of massage therapy are acceptable for back pain relief, including:


Swedish massage
Neuromuscular massage
Deep tissue massage
Myofascial massage

Keep your energy levels up.Chronic arthritic back pain often leads to feelings of fatigue.,
Deal with your anxiety.,
Adopt a positive attitude.Depression is often a result of chronic arthritic pain.",How to Manage Chronic Arthritic Back Pain3," There are several things you can do to combat fatigue.


Get enough sleep. Most people need six to eight hours of sleep each night. You may even consider a sleep-monitoring application to help you determine if your treatments are working.Take short naps of no more than 30 minutes. If you feel too tired during the day, take a quick nap. However, naps longer than 30 minutes can actually sap your energy and leave you feeling more fatigued.
Engage in physical activity. Moving around is a great way to boost your energy levels. Don’t do anything that could negatively impact your back. Stick to biking, walking, and running. Steer clear of contact sports like hockey and football. You may also consider strength exercises using weighted wristbands or resistance bands.Avoid sugary foods. Sweet snacks, candy, and soda cause your blood sugar levels to spike. While this will give you a short-term energy boost, it will leave you feeling exhausted after an hour or so.

, Anxiety – persistent and overwhelming feelings of stress or fear – is often a byproduct of chronic arthritic pain.Anxiety might manifest as social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, or separation anxiety disorder.


Don’t use recreational drugs and alcohol. These can both increase anxious feelings.
Avoid caffeinated beverages. Caffeine can make you feel more anxious. Stay away from coffee and soda.Eat a healthy diet. A diet based primarily on whole grains, vegetables, and fruits, with a small amount of lean protein might help you reduce your risk for anxiety.
Consider adding daily meditation to your routine, as it has shown some promise in both pain control and anxiety control., Even though it’s hard to feel hopeful about your situation, being positive will help relieve some of the burden. Staying positive will increase your resilience to chronic back pain and help you forge ahead when things get tough.Start a gratitude journal. Each day before you go to bed, write down five things you’re thankful for, and continue writing things down that have made you happy throughout the day. They could be things that don’t have a direct connection to you, but made you happy anyway.
Use positive self-talk.Positive self-talk involves recognizing negative thoughts and pushing them aside. For instance, when you notice yourself thinking, “My situation is hopeless,” or “I will never live without pain,” use a more hopeful thought to push the negative one away. For instance, you might counter a negative thought about your chronic pain with a thought like, “Someday, I will live without this pain.”Surround yourself with supportive people. Getting support from your family and friends can help you feel happier and more positive. Avoid negative people who minimize your pain and hurt your feelings.
Encourage yourself. Think about how your pain has gotten better over time, and look forward to a better tomorrow.

Monitor unusual sounds and feelings in your back.,
Check your back for an abnormal appearance.A hunched-over neck or a crooked spine could mean you have arthritis in your back.,
Recognize a long-term problem.The “chronic” part of chronic arthritic back pain means that the problem has been ongoing (and possibly getting worse) over time.",How to Manage Chronic Arthritic Back Pain4," The most obvious feeling is pain radiating from your back, even when you don’t move it. Additionally, when you stretch or bend your back, you might hear a grinding or crunching sound. This is common in the neck, especially. You might also feel a pinch or tingling feeling along your spine caused by the spinal cord irritating the nerves in your back., Swelling might be visible along your spine or certain back muscles.

, If you feel that you’re dealing with back pain every day or nearly every day for any extended period of time, consult a physician.Don’t ignore chronic pain. Take proactive steps to deal with it sooner rather than later. It will likely not go away on its own.

Try to only use chairs with arms.
Don’t sit for longer than 30-45 minutes at a time., You should sleep either on your back or on your healthy side with a pillow between your legs. Avoid laying on your repaired hip or on your stomach., Since you will have difficulty bending and twisting, try a dressing stick to help you put on your clothes and a long shoehorn to assist with your shoes.

, Modify your bathroom with grab bars, an elevated bath seat and a handle shower so that you can easily bathe yourself. Safety mats in and around the tub to prevent slipping are also a good idea.

, Since recovering from a hip fracture can be difficult, you may find yourself struggling with the process, feeling depressed, or dealing with anxiety. These emotions are normal during recovery, so don’t feel embarrassed or like you have to bottle up your feelings. See a counselor to talk to about your feelings and create a plan to help you with the mental side of your recovery.


If you can’t talk to a counselor, speak with a close friend, loved one, or religious advisor. What’s most important is that you realize that things will get better and you have people on your side as you recover.

Take bisphosphonates.,
Include a calcium supplement in your diet.,
Add vitamin D. Adults aged 50 and older should get a daily requirement of 600 international units (IU) or 40 micrograms (mcg) of vitamin D to support healthy bones.,
Get light exercise.,
Avoid smoking and drinking.,
Remove hazards from your home.,
Update your eyewear.",How to Recover From a Hip Fracture4," Since 20% of people who have a hip fracture will have another one in two years, your doctor will likely tell you about bisphosphonates, which help strengthen your bone density. You can take bisphosphonates orally or intravenously, depending on the recommendations of your doctor.Talk to your doctor about taking bisphosphonates.
Bisphosphonates can cause acid reflux and other side effects.
Bisphosphonates aren’t recommended for people who have kidney problems.

, Calcium helps maintain strong healthy bones. Adults aged 50 and older should consume 1,200 milligrams of calcium each day. You can find calcium supplements in a vitamin or chew. Ask your doctor before you start taking anything new., You can get vitamin D in either a multivitamin or on its own. Talk to your doctor before taking any supplements., You need to strengthen your hips, so go for walks or do low-impact cardio activities to strengthen your body. In addition to helping you maintain your bones, exercise will also help you improve your balance so that you’re less likely to fall again., Both tobacco and alcohol reduce bone density, making it easier for your bones to fracture. If you drink, you’ll also be compromising your balance, which could lead to more falls., Go through your home and check for throw rugs, furniture, and structural issues that can cause you to fall. You don’t want items in your home that can trip you, fall over, or collapse under you. Don’t try to remove the items yourself if you aren’t up to it; instead, have a friend or family member help you make your home safe., If your vision is fuzzy, then you’re more likely to trip or misjudge your next step. Get your eyes examined and keep your glasses or contacts up-to-date."

Realign the bone with closed reduction.,
Have a surgeon realign the bone with open reduction.,
Cast or splint the bone for best alignment.",How to Realign a Fractured Bone," In an emergency situation, with no trained medical personnel around, it's important to be able to identify a fractured bone. Fractures typically occur with significant trauma (hard fall or car accident) and the person almost always feels severe pain — they may also report hearing or feeling a cracking sensation. Fractures to the head, spine or pelvis are difficult to ascertain without x-rays, and are injuries that require a person not be moved, realigned, or transported. However, long bones such as the arms, legs, fingers and toes will look crooked, misshapen, deformed or obviously out of place.Once you've identified a suspected fracture, it's best to call for an ambulance and get professional medical help instead of attempting to realign any bones yourself — you may actually cause greater injury despite your good intentions.


Other common signs and symptoms of a broken bone include: limited mobility, numbness or tingling, severe swelling and bruising, nausea.
Trying to move a person with a fractured spine or skull is very risky without proper training and should be avoided.
Attempting to align broken bones improperly can lead to further damage to blood vessels and nerves, leading to more bleeding and potential paralysis.;
, The first thing you should do when dealing with a person with an obviously broken bone is calm her down, because if she starts to really panic and go into shock, then her body processes start to shut down.As such, reassure the person, calm her down, explain she is injured but that she will be okay, and then let her know help is on the way (or they are already in good hands). This advice applies to medical personnel and any untrained person at the site of an accident.


Have the person lie down with her head propped up and/or supported in the most comfortable manner possible. Make sure the person doesn't move her fractured bone to any significant extent.
Do not allow a person with a spinal, head, neck, or pelvic injury to get up, and especially don't let her walk.
To help prevent shock, cover the person in a blanket or jacket to keep her warm.

, Apply something cold, preferably ice, to the bone fracture as soon as you can. Cold therapy has a multitude of benefits including numbing the pain, reducing the inflammation and slowing down bleeding via vasoconstriction (narrowing or tightening of localized arteries).Alternatives to ice include frozen gel packs and bags of veggies from the freezer, but make sure to wrap anything cold in a thin towel before you apply it to skin in order to avoid ice burn or frostbite.


Apply the cold therapy for at least 15 minutes or until the area is completely numb before attempting to reset or realign the fractured bone.
While the cold therapy is being applied, make sure the broken limb is very carefully elevated in order to combat inflammation and slow down any blood loss. However, broken legs should never be elevated. Do not risk harming the broken limb in order to elevate it.
To further combat swelling and blood loss, compress the cold therapy against the injury with a bandage, elastic support or even a belt. However, don't tie the compression bandage too tight or leave it on for more than 15 minutes because complete restriction of blood flow could cause more damage to the injured area.

, Before realigning a fractured bone, you need to consider pain control, otherwise the patient may lose consciousness or go further into shock. Within hospital settings, patients with fractured bones are usually given strong prescription (opioid-based) medication before any sort of realignment procedure. However, in an emergency setting, cold therapy and over-the-counter drugs are likely all that can be hoped for. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) is a pain killer most appropriate if there is significant bleeding associated with the fracture because it doesn't ""thin"" the blood.Non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) such as aspirin and ibuprofen are effective for pain and inflammation control, but they also inhibit blood clotting, so they aren't a good idea for injuries involving significant bleeding. Even if there is no bleeding, an NSAID should not be given until at least 30 minutes after the injury, which allows damaged tissues time to begin to repair themselves.
Furthermore, aspirin and ibuprofen should not be given to young children, regardless whether there's much bleeding associated with the fracture or not.

, Due to the advance of communication technology and widespread availability and usage of cellular (mobile) phones, emergency situations that occur in isolated locations needn't always unfold without trained medical people present. Nowadays, with vast cellphone network coverage, your first thought in an emergency situation should be to call for help (such as 9-1-1) before attempting to offer first-aid or medical attention, such as aligning a fractured bone.Although an emergency call can be made quickly (within minutes), if you are located in an isolated spot, help may not arrive for up to an hour or more. It may be necessary to do some basic first aid to move the person to safety.
If you really don't think you can realign a broken bone by yourself, then focus more on CPR (clearing the airways and making sure the person can breathe) and controlling the bleeding, if any.

, Realigning a fractured bone is necessary because it reduces pain, supports healing, can reduce internal bleeding, prevents further complications, and restores normal function and use of the injured bone.If the fractured bone is considered relatively stable and does not obviously require surgery, then closed reduction can be performed. Closed reduction involves stabilizing above and below the fracture site and gently applying traction to the most distal piece (furthest from the heart) in the general direction that it's facing.While maintaining traction (pulling pressure), gently move the most distal piece back towards its anatomical position such that the fractured bone looks straight. Closed reduction realigns bones without breaking through the skin.


Traction can be applied with your own hands and upper body strength, or with the help of weights and pulleys if in a clinical setting.
Without medical training, only fingers and toes should be attempted to be realigned with traction if it's not possible to get medical help right away. Other bones / areas present too much risk of further injury for the untrained.
Stop realigning the bone if there is considerable resistance or a significant increase in pain.
Muscle relaxant medication may help the realigning procedure, especially if the surrounding muscles have gone into spasm.

, The open reduction method involves surgically cutting into the skin and other soft tissues to access the fracture site and put the bone fragments back together. Open reduction is done only by an orthopedic surgeon and only if closed reduction with traction is unsuccessful or not possible.As such, open reduction is typically used for the most serious types of fractures when the bones are in multiple fragments (called a complicated comminuted fracture), which often occurs when bones are badly crushed. The orthopedic surgeon has a choice of two types of open reduction surgery: internal fixation or external fixation.


Internal fixation uses special metal screws, rods and/or plates to attach the bone fragments together and hold everything in place until the injury heals.With this approach, the hardware often remains in place under the skin even after the fracture heals.
External fixation holds the bone in place as it heals with a supportive external frame (on the outside of the skin) made of rods that are drilled into the bone pieces with metal screws.The frame is then removed once the bone is healed and strong enough to support itself. This technique is used for complex fractures that cannot be repaired using open reduction or surgical internal fixation.
Any type of bone repair surgery requires a regional or general anesthetic for pain control.

, After a successful closed reduction procedure involving traction, a plaster (or fiberglass) cast or metal splint is typically used to keep the fractured bone in place.Casting or splinting a stabilized fracture is usually the most effective way of attaining a well-aligned bone. Casts and splints also provide protection from further trauma and prevent careless movement via immobilization. Casting and splinting is not often done with open reduction methods, but may sometimes be used in conjunction with metal screws and plates, or after the supportive frame is removed with internal fixation.


Casts and splints are often left on for several weeks, depending on the severity of the fracture.
Splinting can be done in an emergency situation outside of a hospital environment using a variety of materials including pieces of wood, metal, plastic or stiff cardboard.
When splinting a fracture site, try to allow movement in the adjacent joints (unless the fracture involves the joint) and don't secure the material too tight — allow appropriate blood circulation.

Taking a minute to assess the situation before you take any treatment measures can help prevent further injury.


You likely have a broken arm if you hear a snap or cracking sound.Other signs of a break are severe pain that may increase if you move it, swelling, bruising, deformity of the arm, or trouble turning it palm up to palm down.Call emergency services or get to the hospital as soon as possible if you notice the following:The person is unresponsive, isn't breathing or isn't moving; there is heavy bleeding; even gentle pressure or movement causes pain; the extremity of the injured arm, such as a finger, is numb or bluish at the tip; you suspect a bone is broken in the neck, head or back; if the bone breaks the surface of the skin; or if the arm is deformed.
If you are unable to reach emergency services, review the following wikiHow article: How to Provide First Aid for a Broken Bone.;
, If the break has caused bleeding, it’s important to stop any bleeding as soon as possible. Apply light pressure to the area using a bandage, clean cloth, or a clean article or clothing.Make sure to call emergency services or get to the hospital if any bleeding is present., If a bone is sticking out or is deformed, do not realign it under any circumstances. Get to a doctor and stabilize the arm, both of which may help prevent further injury and discomfort.Trying to realign the bone can cause further injury and pain and will likely lead to an infection., It is very important to make sure excessive movement doesn't further damage the broken bone. Place a splint above and below the break to help stabilize it until you can get medical treatment.You can use a variety of items to make a splint including rolled up newspaper or towels. Either tape or wrap a sling around your arm to hold the splints in place.Padding on the splints may help relieve discomfort., Place an ice pack on the break after wrapping it in a towel or cloth. This can help manage the pain and swelling until you can get to the doctor.Don’t apply the ice or pack directly to the skin, which can cause frostbite.Wrapping it in some kind of cloth or towel can help prevent frostbite.Leave the ice for 20 minutes at time until you can get to a hospital or doctor.

, Depending on the severity of your break, you may require a cast, splint, or brace to stabilize the affected area. Your doctor or local hospital can decide on the best treatment for your break.Your doctor will likely ask you a series of questions while examining the broken arm including about your symptoms, their severity, and anything that makes your pain worse.Your doctor or the hospital may order X-rays or an MRI to further help determine the best treatment., If you have a break that is a displaced fracture, your doctor may need to manipulate the bone back into place. Although this can be painful, your doctor can take steps to help you get through the procedure.Your doctor may give you a muscle relaxant or a sedative while he sets your bone.Your doctor may apply a cast, a brace, splint, or sling to wear while your arm heals., When you have daily activities to tackle, it’s important to remember the RICE (rest, ice, compression, elevation) principle. Employing RICE can help you more easily and comfortably navigate your day., Give your arm a chance to rest throughout the day. Immobility can help your arm heal properly and may also prevent pain or discomfort., Apply an ice pack on your arm. This can help reduce swelling and relieve pain.Use ice as often as necessary for 20 minutes at a time.Wrap the ice pack in a towel to protect your cast from moisture.
If it is too cold or your skin gets numb, remove the pack. , Wrap or compressive elastic bandage to your arm. This can help reduce swelling and may help relieve pain.Swelling may result in loss of mobility and compression can help prevent this.
Use compression until the affected area is no longer swelling or your doctor suggests it.
You can get compressive wraps and bandages at any pharmacy or medical supply store, as well many large department retailers.

, Raise your arm above the level of your heart. This minimizes swelling and may also help preserve mobility.If you cannot lift your arm, prop it up with pillows or on a piece of furniture.

, While it may be easy to stay out of swimming pools or hot tubs, it is a little more difficult to avoid showering or bathing while your arm heals. When you shower or bathe (try a sponge bath) it is important to keep moisture away from any cast or brace you may have. This can help ensure that you heal properly and don’t develop any skin infections or irritations.


You can wrap your cast in heavy plastic, such as a garbage bag or even plastic wrap. Make sure that the entire cast is wrapped and secure.
You may want to put a small towel in your cast to help prevent water from leaking down the inside. Not only will this ensure the integrity of the cast, but can also help prevent skin irritations or infections.
In the event that your cast gets wet, dry it with a hair dryer. This may help ensure the integrity of the cast. If the cast gets soaked, call your doctor and ask her how to proceed.

, Putting on clothing with a broken arm can present a special challenge. Choose sensible clothing to wear each day that will be easy to put on and take off and won’t cause you any discomfort.


Wear loose clothing with large arm holes. It may also be easier to wear short sleeved shirts or tank tops.
If it is cold, you can wrap a sweater around the shoulder of the broken arm. Keeping your arm inside the sweater may help it stay warm.
If you want to wear gloves but can’t slip them on, try putting a sock around your hand.

, If you’ve broken your dominant arm, use your other arm as much as possible. This might take some getting used to, but it can help you stay more independent.


You can learn how to brush your teeth, hair, or use kitchen utensils with your non-dominant hand.

, It may be very challenging to do some activities by yourself with a broken arm. Consider asking a friend or family member to give you aid while you’re arm is immobile.


You can ask a friend to take notes for you in class or type papers. You might also want to ask your teacher if you can tape class.
You’ll find that strangers may also be more likely to offer assistance to you while you have a broken arm. From helping you with groceries to holding doors open for you, take the opportunity to rest your arm in these instances.
Stay away from challenging activities. Certain activities, such as driving, may be more difficult with a broken arm. Ask your friends or family members for rides or take public transportation.

, Keeping your arm as still as possible can help the healing process. Whether you are wearing a cast or simply a sling, try to avoid excessive movement or hitting your arm on objects.This is especially critical if you have a break and your doctor is waiting to put a cast on once the swelling has subsided.You may want to wait a few weeks to return to your usual activities or until your doctor gives you approval., You may have some—or a lot—of pain with your break. Taking medication to relieve it may help you relax and could also help you keep from moving it too much.You can take either over-the-counter pain relievers such as aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen sodium, or acetaminophen. Ibuprofen and naproxen sodium may also help to reduce swelling.Children and teenagers under 18 should not take aspirin unless approved by a doctor.You should also avoid aspirin and other medications that can thin your blood if the bone broke the skin or there is associated bleeding.
If your pain is severe enough, your doctor may prescribe a pain reliever with a narcotic for a few days., In many cases, rehabilitation therapy may begin relatively soon after your initial treatment.You may start with simple motions to minimize stiffness and gradually work up to physical therapy once your cast, brace, or sling is removed.Only undertake rehabilitation with the permission and under the direction of your doctor.Early rehabilitation may include simple movements to promote blood flow and stave off stiffness.Physical therapy can help restore muscle strength, joint motion, and flexibility once any casting or bracing is removed or if you have healed from your surgery., If you have a compound fracture or a fracture that breaks the bone, you may require surgery. This can help ensure that your arm heals properly and minimize your risk for subsequent breaks.During surgery, an orthopedic surgeon may insert fixation devices that stabilize your bones. Screws, nails, plates, and wires are all types of fixation devices.These help maintain the position of your bones during the healing process.
During this procedure, you’ll go under local anesthesia while your doctor inserts and applies the fixation.Recovery is often dependent on the severity of the break and how well you take care of it.
After surgery, you may require physical therapy to restore muscle strength, flexibility, and joint movement.

, Eating a healthy diet that includes foods high in calcium and vitamin D can help strengthen your bones. This may also provide your body with the necessary nutrients to rebuild your arm bones and prevent future breaks.Calcium and Vitamin D can work together to help your bones get stronger.Good sources of calcium include milk, spinach, soybeans, kale, cheese, and yogurt.You can take calcium supplements if diet alone cannot provide for your calcium needs, though you should aim to get as much as you can from whole foods.
Good sources of vitamin D include salmon, tuna, beef liver, and egg yolks.As with calcium, you can take Vitamin D supplements to help augment your food choices.
Consider eating foods fortified with calcium or Vitamin D. Many fruit juices, such as grape or orange, may contain calcium or Vitamin D. Some milk products are fortified with Vitamin D., Though most people think about their muscles when they work out, your bones actually respond to exercise, too.People who exercise achieve higher bone-density than those who do not,and exercise also helps with balance and coordination, which can help prevent falls and accidents.Try weight training, walking, hiking, jogging, climbing stairs, tennis, and dancing to strengthen and maintain your bones.Make sure you check with your doctor before beginning an exercise program, especially if you have osteoporosis."

You can also use some of the excess clothing to help stop the bleeding if you don’t have a lot of other materials to work with. If you don’t have scissors, you can use a knife, but make sure the blade is pointed away from both you and the victim., Before dealing with the fracture, you need to stop the bleeding, especially if it is profuse. Use a cloth and apply pressure to the wound. If you soak the cloth, apply more cloth on top of it. Don’t remove the cloth from the wound. To help slow the bleeding, raise the leg above the heart.Make sure that you always wear gloves to prevent the spread of bloodborne pathogens. Wash or sanitize your hands first, and then put on gloves. Know that, if you choose to treat a bleeding person without gloves, you may expose yourself and that other person to one another's bloodborne diseases., Make sure to wrap the ice in a cloth (a towel or some cotton clothing will do) before applying to the break. Ice will reduce the swelling. It will also help to relieve some of the pain. If you have an ice pack, that works best with the least mess.You can also use a bag of frozen food, such as peas.

, At this point, you should only clean the wound if the wound is heavily contaminated, superficial, or hospital care is delayed. While cleaning the wound is important to reduce the risk of infection, it is also important to stop the bleeding, which can be fatal a lot more quickly than an infection., This is extremely important. Only a doctor should do this, as you could potentially sever an artery or cause nerve damage. Instead, simply try to immobilize the area rather than trying to manipulate it., You should pad the leg first with foam padding, a pillow, a blanket, or a piece of corrugated cardboard. Then, some solid, structured material should be used along the sides of the leg so it will not move. Hard cardboard or a a tent pole work well for this. The splint should extend from above the knee of the injured leg to just below the heel. This will offer maximum stability for the broken leg.If you do not have a first-aid splint on hand, you can use any rigid objects such as sticks to make the splint., Use cloth or wrapping tape to secure the splint. You can also use duct tape. Tie the splint above and below the injury, making sure to include the joint above and below in the splinting. This will help to stabilize the splint. Be careful not to wrap it too tight as this can cut off circulation., If there isn’t, this likely means the splint is wrapped too tightly. Loosen the splint and check again. Circulation is incredibly important to maintain the health of the leg during splinting., Avoiding points that are especially painful can help with this. Listen to the person you're splinting, as they will have a good idea of whether the splint is comfortable, and will let you know. If the splint is uncomfortable, unwrap it and reposition splint and perhaps wrap less tightly., This is necessary to avoid causing any more damage or increasing pain. An increase of pain or damage can cause the patient to go into shock. So, make sure you keep the leg steady and still., If it is swollen, turning pale, or becomes cool to the touch, there may be compromised vascular supply. The key thing is reestablishing vascular flow, which is best done at a hospital. For severe shock, you need medical attention, and there aren't a lot of things you can do in the wilderness. In any case, make sure the patient stays hydrated with water until help arrives, or until you can get them to the ER., This will possibly help the blood flow to the heart.While there are no studies that show the effects of leg elevation for shock, it might help.However, you should not elevate the legs if the injured person also has a head or abdominal injury.Also, you should not elevate an injured extremity because it will be painful and can worsen the injury.

, Acetaminophen will usually work (assuming the injured person does not have an allergy or some other contraindication against the medicine). Some studies suggest avoiding NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen or Advil) after a break, as they are thought to slow down the healing process of fractures and may also increase bleeding."

",How to Naturally Rebuild Strong Bones From Osteoporosis," A healthy diet promotes strong bones and can help speed the recovery of fractures resulting from osteoporosis. Consume adequate amounts of calcium with vitamin D since your body can not make calcium, and vitamin D is needed to aid in the absorption of calcium.


Look for no fat or low fat dairy items which can include soy or cow's milk, cheese and yogurt. Include vegetables that are dark green and leafy such as spinach, broccoli or bok choy in your daily diet. Munch on some almonds as a snack. Integrate fortified foods like cereal, bread and orange juice into your breakfast to start the day.;
, Regular resistance or weight training can help build and maintain bone density. It can also help improve balance and coordination, decreasing the risk of fractures from osteoporosis.


Run or jog to naturally rebuild strong bones from osteoporosis. Play tennis, do aerobics, use resistance bands or lift weights to help slow the progression of osteoporosis. Try yoga or tai chi, which uses your own body weight to hold multiple poses. Walk, hike, climb stairs, dance or jump rope to use your body against gravity, which is considered resistance training.
Exercise for 1 hour 3 times per week to gain the benefits of improving bone density. If 1 hour is too much, participate in physical activity for a half hour 5 times per week.

, Aging decreases the body's ability to properly absorb calcium from the food you eat, so supplements help balance your nutritional needs. Calcium and vitamin D supplements are often prescribed as part of osteoporosis treatment.


Read the label on the supplement bottle carefully and follow the directions given. You can find calcium or vitamin D sold separately or together in one pill.
Factor your daily requirements of each nutrient to know how much to take. The daily requirement for calcium in the average adult is between 1,000 and 1,300 mg per day and for vitamin D is 600 IU (15 mcg) per day.

Consider getting an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) done.",How to Identify a Fracture," An open fracture is one where the bone breaks clear through the skin. Also known as compound fractures, this type of fracture carries the threat of contamination and infection.Look closely at the area around the impact or suspected breakage. If you see bone protruding from the skin, or if there is any visible bone, you have an open fracture.;
, Closed fractures, as the name implies, occur when the bone breaks but does not break through the skin.Closed fractures may be stable, transverse, oblique, or comminuted.


A stable fracture is one in which the broken bone is aligned properly and just barely out of place. These are also referred to as non-displaced fractures.An oblique fracture is one in which the breakage occurs on an angle relative to the alignment of the bone.
A comminuted fracture (also known as a segmented fracture) is one in which the bone breaks into three or more piece.A transverse fracture is one in which the breakage occurs in a more or less straight line perpendicular to the alignment of the bone.

, There are two kinds of fractures which meet this criteria and they can be difficult to differentiate.Impaction fractures (also known as buckled or impacted fractures) typically occur at the end of long bones when a bone fragment is forced into another piece of bone. Compression fractures are similar, but are usually found in vertebrae when spongy bone collapses upon itself.


Compression fractures heal naturally over time, though they should be monitored. Impaction fractures will require surgery.

, Incomplete fractures do not result in two separate pieces of bone, but may still show typical symptoms of fracture. There are several variants of incomplete fractures:Greenstick fractures are incomplete transverse fractures, reported mostly in children since immature bones don’t totally break under pressure into two parts.Hairline fractures (also known as fissure fractures or stress fractures) may be difficult to identify with X-rays as they appear as very fine lines. They might be visible only several weeks after being incurred.
Depression fractures are those which have been pressed in from without. Where multiple fissure lines intersect, the whole section of bone might be depressed.
Incomplete fractures share almost the same symptoms as complete fractures. If the limb is swollen, bruised, or twisted, it may be fractured. The limb might be deformed or out-of-shape, dangling at a bent or awkward angle. If the pain is so excruciating that the limb cannot be used comfortably or support weight, it is likely fractured.

, There are many other classifications of fractures based on the specific location or manner of the injury.Knowing the fracture types can help you better understand, avoid, and treat fractures.


Spiral fractures result when excessive torsion or twisting force is applied to a limb, fracturing the bone.
Longitudinal fractures occur when the bone breaks along a vertical axis in a parallel path through the bone.
Avulsion fractures are those which occur when a bone fragment from the main bone at a site of a ligament attachment to a joint breaks. This may happen in motor accidents while trying to help the casualties by pulling them from their arms or legs, affecting their shoulders or knees., If you heard a snap from your limb during a fall or sudden impact, it's likely your bone is fractured. Depending on the force, severity, and angle, the bone may crack (fracture) in two clean pieces or many. This sound you hear is actually the sound of the bone or group of bones that received the sudden impact and damage.


The grating or snapping sound caused by the bone when fractured is known in technical literature as ""crepitation.""

, Numbness or coldness may set in if the area below the fracture is not receiving enough blood. As muscles cope to hold the bone in place, you may experience muscle spasms as well.

, This then leads to an accumulation of fluids, bringing about swelling that causes pain when touched.


This blood in the tissues is visible as bruising. Bruises will start purple/blue, then turn green and yellow as the blood is reabsorbed. You may find bruises some distance from the actual site of the the fracture as the blood from the broken vessels move through your body.
External bleeding will only occur if the fracture is open, and the broken bone is exposed or protruding from the skin.

, For instance, perhaps the wrist is bent at an odd angle. Perhaps the arm or leg has an unnatural-looking bend where there is no joint. In the case of a closed fracture, the bone's structure has changed inside the limb. In the case of an open fracture, the bone is projecting outward at the site of injury.

, In cases of massive blood loss (including internal bleeding), blood pressure may drop precipitously, leading to shock. Individuals suffering from shock might grow pale and become warm or flushed, but later, excessive dilation of blood vessels might cause people to have cold, clammy skin. They may grow silent, confused, sick, and/or feel light-headed. Their breathing might be rapid initially, but slow down to dangerous levels if blood loss is severe.


It is normal for an individual to undergo shock as the injury takes its toll. Some people, however, feel few symptoms of shock and do not perceive they have suffered a bone fracture. If you experience a violent impact and evince even one symptom of shock, seek medical help immediately.

, If the broken bone is located next to a joint, you'll likely have trouble moving the limb as normal. This is a sign the bone is fractured. Movement of the limb may be impossible without experiencing pain, or you may not be able to put weight on the affected body part.

, During an examination, your doctor will ask questions as to how the injury happened. This information will aid him identify potential sites of damage.


If you’ve experienced previous fractures or bone breakage, inform your doctor.
Your doctor should check for other signs of fracture such as pulse, skin discoloration, temperature, hemorrhage, swelling, or wounds. All of this will help him quickly assess your condition and best course of treatment.

, This is the first course of action in the event a bone fracture is suspected or detected.X-rays can detect fractures and assist doctors in analyzing the extent of your injury.


Before starting, you will be asked to remove any jewelry or metal parts on your person, according to the area that will be examined. You may have to stand, sit or lie down, and will be asked during the process to remain still or even hold your breath.

, If an X-ray cannot detect a fracture, a bone scan might be used as an alternative. Bone scans are imaging tests not unlike a CT scan or MRI. A few hours before you have the bone scan done, you’ll be injected with a small amount of radioactive material. Doctors can trace the course of the radioactive material through your body in order to identify where bone material is being repaired., CT scans are perfect for examining internal injuries or other physical trauma. Doctors perform these when they know they’re dealing with complex, multi-fragment bone breakage. By combining multiple X-ray images into a single image with computer processing, doctors can obtain more three-dimensional view of the fracture with a CT scan., An MRI is a test which employs radio pulses, a magnetic field, and computers to obtain detailed images of the body. In the case of a fracture, the MRI can offer more information about the extent of damage. It is useful for differentiating between bone damage and damage to the cartilage and ligaments."

Paint something fun on it.,
Draw on it in permanent marker.,
Have people sign it.,
Use decorative tape.",How to Have Fun With a Broken Leg1," Use some paint to turn your cast into something pretty. Just pick something you enjoy. Many people turn their casts into limbs of their favorite superheroes, but you can also be inspired by a favorite snack or beverage, a sports team, your city, or just a pretty scene.If you're not talented enough to do it yourself, ask an artistic friend to make you a paint-by-numbers with a permanent marker, then you can fill it in with paint.
It's probably best to use a more permanent paint such as acrylic. If you use spray paint, be sure to protect your skin with a shield of some kind, such as plastic bags.;
, Instead of paint, try drawing patterns on your cast in permanent marker.If you're not much of an artist, start with a black marker, and draw random intersecting lines. Fill in the gaps you made with some of your favorite colors.

, Of course, one of the classic ways to make your cast more fun is to have other people sign it. If you want to do something more unique, have other people draw on it instead of signing it. Each person can add something to the overall picture.

, From washi tape to decorative duct tape, tape comes in a wide variety of colors and patterns these days. If you're not the artistic type, you can wrap your cast in patterns of tape to help make it more colorful and fun."

Go to the emergency room or an urgent care facility if you suspect you have dislocated your kneecap.,
Do not try to bring a dislocated knee or kneecap back to the original position.,
Have your knee evaluated for other injuries.",How to Heal from a Knee Dislocation1," It is important that your injury be assessed by a physician before it worsens. Injuries that are caught and treated early are likely to heal faster and may need fewer medical interventions.;
, You should never try to “pop” you knee back into place or otherwise adjust it on your own. Only a qualified healthcare professional should do that, and it should only be done in the event of an actual dislocation; you likely do not know for sure whether the injury is, in fact, a dislocation.

, The knee is the joint most prone to injuries in the entire human body. It contains numerous connective tissues and bones that must work in synchrony to function correctly.The doctor’s exam will consist of a visual inspection of the knee, palpation and manipulation, looking for swelling and incorrect positioning or movement of the joint.The doctor will likely obtain an x-ray before you leave to make sure you have not broken or fractured anything. Approximately 10% of kneecap dislocations are associated with a kneecap fracture."

Start up.,
Get it in first gear.,
Shift up.,
Shift down.,
Finishing Up.,
Congratulations, you made it!",How to Drive a Stick Shift With a Broken Left Foot1,"


Lean your crutch up against the side of the car, right behind the driver's side door.
Unlock the door while maintaining your balance, and carefully slide into the driver's seat. To avoid further injury, it is advised to slide in with your backside first. If you are using a second crutch, place it on the passenger seat or behind the driver’s seat. Do not shut the driver's side door.;
,


Insert the key into the ignition, and turn it forward slightly so that the car turns on, but the engine does not start.
Wind down the driver's side window and reach back for the crutch that you left outside earlier. As you bring the crutch into the car, make sure that the top (the padded under-arm part) is near the upper part of your body.
When you close the driver's side door, make sure the top of the crutch goes through the open window; it should stick out the window a little bit.

,


Buckle your seat belt and using your left hand, place the end of the crutch on the clutch pedal (the one on the far left).
Push the clutch all the way in and apply the brake with your right foot while making sure the car is in neutral with your right hand. If it is, then turn the ignition all the way and wait for the engine to start.
Once the car turns over, take the crutch off the clutch pedal and remove the emergency brake.

,


With your left hand, use the crutch to push in the clutch again, and with your right hand, shift the car into first gear.
Grab the steering wheel with your right hand at the 2 o'clock position.
Take your right foot off of the brake and use it to push in the accelerator, revving the engine to around 2,000 RPMs.
Slowly release the clutch (using the crutch) until you feel the car start to pull forward.
Push the gas in further and release the clutch completely (it's a push/pull relationship between the two pedals).

,


Shifting from first to second is similar to the step above.
Keeping your eyes on the road, start out with your left hand on the crutch handle and your right hand on the steering wheel.
When it is safe to shift, move your right hand to the shifter and bring your left thigh up to stabilize the steering wheel.
With the crutch, push the clutch in and pull the shifter down (into the second gear position) with your right hand. Remember to not give the car gas until after you have released the clutch (push/pull).
Now you are in second gear. Repeat step 5 to shift into higher gears.

, There may come a point during your drive that you would like to downshift to a lower gear. This may be because you are heading down a steep slope or feel that you want to accelerate at a greater rate.


Place the crutch on the clutch, take your right foot off of the gas, and move your right hand to the shifter.
In a quick, smooth motion push in the clutch with the crutch and then move the shifter into the desired lower gear. Remember, it is always best to downshift into the next smallest gear (e.g. if you are in 5th gear, downshift to 4th).
Once you are in the desired gear, release the clutch and slowly push on the accelerator with your right foot.
Lastly, bring your right hand up onto the steering wheel.

,


Once you arrive at your destination, park the car, push the clutch in with the crutch, shift the transmission into neutral, and apply the emergency brake.
Open the driver’s side door and lean your crutch(es) outside of the car against the top of the door frame.
Roll up your window and turn off the car. Shift the transmission into first gear (or reverse) to keep it from rolling. Carefully bring yourself out of the car with the help of your crutch(es) and close the door behind you.

, Good luck with that foot!

Prepare yourself for a reduction.,
Be aware that some dislocations may require surgery.",How to Heal from a Knee Dislocation2," If your doctor agrees that you have a kneecap dislocation, she will likely perform a procedure called a “reduction,” which will slide your kneecap back into place.The doctor will likely give you pain medication before manipulating your knee to minimize the discomfort. Generally she will follow this procedure with an x-ray to make sure everything is in the correct place.
Again, it’s important to not try this at home as it is difficult to figure out which injuries need surgery or specialized treatments, and further damage can occur if this is not done correctly.

, If you have a rare type of dislocation or additional injuries, your doctor may need to consult an orthopedic surgeon (a specialist surgeon who treats bony injuries) to determine whether surgical intervention is necessary."

Rest your leg as directed.,
Take over-the-counter pain relievers.,
Wear your knee brace.,
Make follow-up appointments a priority.It can be easy to skip or reschedule follow-up appointments with your doctor once you are no longer in pain.,
Use caution for several weeks after the injury.,
Attend physical therapy if necessary.If your doctor refers you to a physical therapist once your knee has started to heal, be sure that you go to your therapy appointments and do any at-home exercises that the physical therapist gives you.,
Consult a sports medicine physician if you are an athlete.,
Take a Glucosamine supplement.,
Wear supportive shoes.",How to Heal from a Knee Dislocation3," You should always follow your doctor’s instructions, but some general guidelines for resting your knee and reducing swelling follow:Elevate your knee
Apply an ice pack or cold compress for 10 – 15 minutes
Repeat four times per day for a few days after the injury

, If your doctor says it is okay, take Motrin (ibuprofen) to reduce your pain and swelling.Follow the dosing prescribed by your doctor or pharmacist.


You can also take Tylenol (acetaminophen), but this will only treat the pain and not address swelling.
Talk to your doctor if you feel that you need to continue using these medications for longer than a week.

, After your kneecap is back in place you will likely be placed in a knee brace to prevent the kneecap from becoming dislocated again.The connective tissues in your knee may take weeks to heal enough to provide stability to your kneecap.


In the meantime, it is important that you wear the brace as it will provide stability to the joint.

, However, these appointments are necessary so that your doctor can ensure that the knee is healing properly and that there are no secondary injuries that were missed at your original appointment.


Expect your first follow-up appointment to be just a few days after the initial injury.

, You should try to avoid putting too much stress or pressure on your knee for a few weeks after the injury. You should allow the joint to be mobile while still giving it time to heal. Discuss with your doctor when to resume work and other activities.

,


Even when your knee starts to feel better, you have to strengthen it the proper way to avoid re-injury and ensure a full range of motion. This can also help you avoid complications down the road.

, Athletes who have suffered from a kneecap injury should consult a qualified board-certified sports medicine physician to get specific recommendations about returning to training.


Most of the time, a kneecap injury will require four to six weeks of healing before you can return to playing., Studies are somewhat inconclusive about this supplement, but there is some evidence that it can help improve knee movement after an injury., While you are healing and possibly in the weeks after you have been cleared for normal activity, you should wear good quality shoes. This can help you have a regular gait while walking or running and avoid putting too much pressure on your knees.

Have your doctor diagnose the type of break.,
See an orthopedic surgeon.,
Ask about non-surgical options.,
Consider surgical treatments.,
Immobilize the thumb.,
See a physical therapist.",How to Diagnose a Broken Thumb," It is normal to experience severe pain right after you break your thumb. The pain happens because your bones have nerves surrounding them. When a bone breaks, it can irritate or compress the surrounding nerves, which causes pain. If you don’t experience severe pain right after the injury, there is a chance that your thumb is not broken.You will also experience severe pain if something touches your thumb or when you try to bend it.
Generally, the closer the pain is to the joint where your thumb meets the rest of your hand (closest to the webbing between your thumb and forefinger), the more cause for concern and potential complication for the injury.;
, You should look to see if your thumb looks normal. Is it bent at an odd angle or twisted in some strange way? You should also check to see if there is any bone protruding out of the skin. If you notice any of these characteristics, it is very likely that you have broken your thumb.Your thumb will also most likely have bruises on it, which is a sign that the capillaries in the tissue of the thumb have broken open., If you have broken your thumb, moving it will cause you serious and severe pain. Your ligaments connecting your bones will also most likely be unable to function properly, which can also make it difficult to move your thumb.In particular, check to see if you can move your thumb backwards. If you can move it backwards without pain, you probably have a sprain rather than a broken bone.

, Aside from causing pain, compressed nerves can also make your thumb go numb. Your thumb might also begin to feel cold. This is because a fractured bone or a lot of swelling can block the blood vessels that carry blood into your thumb and surrounding tissue.Your thumb might also turn blue if it is receiving very little or no blood.

, When you break a bone, the area around it will swell up due to inflammation. Your thumb will begin to swell five to ten minutes after the injury has occurred. After the thumb swells, it may begin to stiffen.The swelling in your thumb might also affect the closest fingers to your thumb.

, If you think you have broken a thumb, you should go to the emergency room so that a professional can set it. If you wait too long, the swelling caused by the broken bone can actually make it too difficult to realign the bones, which means that your thumb could be permanently bent.In addition, broken thumbs in children can permanently affect their growth by damaging their growth plates.
Even if you suspect the injury might be a sprain (torn ligament) rather than a bone fracture, you should still see a doctor for an accurate diagnosis. Additionally, some serious sprains can still require a hand surgeon to repair. You should ultimately leave the final diagnosis and treatment decisions to a medical professional., In addition to asking questions regarding the symptoms from Part One, the doctor will also physically examine your thumb. He may test your strength and movement in the thumb by comparing it to that of your uninjured thumb. Another test includes touching the tip of your thumb to your index finger before applying pressure to the thumb to check your weakness., The doctor will likely order x-rays of your thumb from a variety of angles. This will not only confirm that diagnosis, but it will also show the doctor exactly how many fractures your thumb has sustained, which will assist in determining the best treatment option. The angles for the x-rays include:Lateral: The lateral view is an x-ray with the hand resting on its side, so that the thumb is up.
Oblique: The oblique view is an x-ray with the hand tilted, resting on its side, so that the thumb is up.
AP: The AP view is an x-ray of your hand in a flattened position, from above.

, A CT scan can also be referred to as a computerized axial tomography (CAT) scan. A CT scan uses x-rays and a computer to create images of what the inside of your body parts (in this case, your thumb) look like. This way, your doctor can get a better idea of what the break is like and the best way to go about fixing it.Tell your doctor if you are pregnant because CT scans might cause harm to the fetus.

, Once your doctor has run the relevant tests, she will diagnose the specific type of fracture you have sustained. This will determine the complexity of the treatment options available.Extra-articular fractures are those that take place away from a joint along the length of one of the two bones in the thumb. While painful and requiring six weeks to heal, these fractures do not typically require surgical intervention.Intra-articular fractures take place along the joint, often requiring surgical intervention to help the patient retain as much movement in the joint after recovery as possible.Of the intra-articular thumb fractures, the two most common are a Bennetts fracture and a Rolando’s fracture. In both, the thumb fractures (and likely dislocates) along the carpometacarpal joint (the thumb joint closest to the hand).The major difference between the two is that a Rolando’s fracture involves three or more bone fragments that require realignment, and while a Bennetts fracture may occasionally forego surgery, a Rolando’s fracture almost always necessitates surgical treatment., An orthopedist will look at your x-rays and other tests to help determine the best treatment option. He will take into account the type of fracture (intra- or extra-articular), as well as the complexity (Bennett's versus Rolando’s fractures)., In relatively straightforward cases (such as an extra-articular fracture) the doctor may be able to replace the fracture fragments manually without surgery.She will provide anesthesia before attempting to realign the fragments.


This method (also referred to as a closed reduction) typically consists of the doctor pulling and tugging along the break to realign it while using a fluoroscopy (continuous, realtime x-raying) to see when the fragments are realigned.Note that some Rolando’s fractures, especially those where the bones are shattered into too many pieces to screw or pin together, may also be treated in this method with the surgeon molding the fragments to the best of his ability (known as an open reduction)., For intra-articular fractures (such as Bennett's and Rolando’s fractures), your orthopedist will usually suggest surgery. The specific type of surgery will depend on the complexity of the fracture(s). Typical options include:Using fluoroscopy to place wires through the skin to realign the fragments, known as external fixation. This option typically pertains to Bennett's fractures where the fragments have remained very close together.
Having a surgeon open the hand to place small screws or pins into the bones in order to keep them properly aligned. This is known as internal fixation.
Potential complications from surgical options include nerve or ligament injuries, stiffness, and increased risk of arthritis., Whether your particular case calls for a surgical or non-surgical option, the doctor will place your thumb in a spica cast to immobilize it and keep all of the fragments perfectly in place during the recovery period.


Expect to wear the cast anywhere from two to six weeks, with closer to six being the norm.Your doctor may also schedule follow-up appointments during this time.

, Depending on the length of time you spend in the cast and your mobility upon the removal of the cast, your doctor may recommend that you see a physical or occupational therapist. A therapist will be able to provide a number of flex and grip exercises to rebuild strength due to atrophied muscle during the immobilization period."

Learn the ABC's.,
Start a preliminary assessment once the patient is stabilized and breathing on his own.

,
Ensure that the femur is actually fractured from your assessment.,
Immobilize the patient and the fracture.,
Apply traction and maintain traction through the entire process.",How to Make a Preliminary Splint for a Fractured Femur," It takes something significant to break a femur bone in an otherwise healthy individual. That something would be of such force that the trauma alone is likely to have caused serious injury to the patient in other areas. It would not be uncommon for the patient to be unconscious, either from lateral injuries or from passing out in sheer pain.


Airway. The patient must have an open airway or all else is a moot point. If you have to breathe for the patient, it won't do any good if the air is not getting to the lungs. Use the head tilt, chin thrust method to make sure the airway is open to the lungs.
Breathing. Ensure that the victim is breathing, if not on her own, then you must breathe for her. She needs oxygen to survive. Even if she has a pulse, she will not for long if she is not breathing.
Circulation. Check for a pulse for about 10 seconds. Feel the carotid artery with two fingers while you are listening to breathing sounds from his mouth and watching his chest for rising and falling movements. If no pulse is found, start cardio pulmonary resuscitation immediately.;
,, You will feel crepitus, which is a definitive sign that there is a fracture; besides the fact that your patient will be in some of the worst pain imaginable.

, Though in pain, the patient must be kept still to prevent the pieces of bone from rubbing against each other or severing that artery.

, This is going to require an additional rescuer.


One person must grab the patient's heel, straighten out the leg and pull. It does not sound pleasant; however, the victim will feel instant relief when the bones are no longer rubbing, scraping or knocking against each other.
Find sticks, lumber, pipe; any kind of rigid material will do. It has to be long enough to reach from the groin area to well below the knee. Take belts, rope or anything you can find to tie the stick to the leg.
While maintaining traction, place the stick just under the groin or crotch and under the back of the knee. Take the belts and secure the leg to the stick above and below the site of the break. You might need more ties above and below to ensure that the leg is immobilized completely. Check pulse at the knee frequently to ensure proper circulation. Make sure the victim can feel sensation in the feet as well.

The broken leg could be really obvious, such as an exposed, open fracture. In this case, you’ll need to keep the wound clean. If it is a closed fracture, your dog may be limping but there may not be any blood or obvious wound. Whatever type of break, you’ll need to apply first aid and get your dog to the veterinary hospital right away!Since injured dogs can be fearful and aggressive, you’ll need to be careful. To avoid getting bitten, don’t put your hands or face close to the injured dog, especially if it is already agitated.If you need to move the dog away from the place where the accident occurred, you can use a towel sling to support some of their weight.
If the injury occurred on a road, you should move the dog to a place of safety and then perform emergency first aid.;
, If you can see an exposed wound where the leg is broken, you’ll need to clean the wound. Put on some plastic gloves. Rinse the wound with water or a saline solution. Then, flush the wound with a non-astringent antiseptic., Wrap a clean bandage around the wound several times. You want to wrap it snug but without applying too much pressure. Wrap it around a bunch of times, including above and below the exposed wound.Secure the bandage with first aid tape.If you don’t have a clean bandage or gauze, you could use a clean towel.
You should check to make sure your dog’s dressing is not too tight. It is important to make sure the dressing is comfortable and not impeding circulation to your dog’s limb.

, You should prevent the fracture from getting any worse by applying a simple leg-splint.Use a medical splint or, if you don’t have one, a ruler or a spatula will do the trick! The splint should cover the entire area of the fracture. It may go all the way up to where the leg meets the abdomen. Tie the splint to the leg with a bandage and secure it with medical tape at the top and the bottom., Your dog will have a hard time walking to the carrier or the car, so you should assist them. Wrap a towel or a blanket around their abdomen. Hold some of their weight with the towel while they walk to the carrier or the car.An easy way to do this is to pass a large bath towel under your dog’s belly. Hold the end up over his back, like a sling, to support his weight.

, Because your dog could move around on the journey to the veterinary hospital, you should restrain them. Lay them down with their injured leg up in the carrier.Use the carrier to transport them to the hospital by car or taxi.Since injured dogs can become aggressive, you may want to put a muzzle on your dog before taking them to the veterinarian., You’ll need to get your dog to the veterinary hospital as soon as possible. Drive them or, if you don’t have a car, get a taxi. On the way, try to keep your dog warm and comfortable.If your dog was involved in a vehicular accident, it is especially important to get them to the hospital quickly because they could have internal injuries in addition to the broken leg.
Keep your dog warm on the way to the hospital.You could ask a friend to comfort your dog in the back seat while you drive.
You’ll need professional veterinary treatment. So don’t use ointments on the open fracture, or perform other self-treatments on the dog.
Don’t try to re-set the bone yourself., When you get to the hospital, the veterinary team will take appropriate emergency action. Depending on the severity of the injury, your veterinarian may focus on stabilizing vital organs. Once vital signs look stable, your veterinarian will attend to the fractured leg., Your veterinarian will diagnose the type of broken leg. They will tell you what type of fracture it is, such as a complete or an incomplete fracture, transverse (straight) or oblique (diagonal) break. And they should be able to tell you some of the treatment options, which may be surgical or non-surgical.If it is a closed fracture, they may put your dog’s leg in a cast or a splint.
A metal fixation device may be attached to your dog’s leg.

, If your dog’s leg is severely broken in multiple places, your veterinarian may suggest amputation. Although this treatment option may sound scary, it could be the most viable option if the injury is very severe. Remember that your dog has four legs and, if necessary, should be able to live a healthy life with three legs.X rays will be taken to determine the extent of damage.The amputation surgery may take several hours.

, When discussing treatment options, you should ask your veterinarian about any differences in cost. Depending on the severity of the break, you could end up paying between $1200 and $3000 in veterinary fees. Typically, non-surgical treatment with a cast or a splint will be cheaper than surgical options, although there may be more follow up visits with non-surgical options.The average cost for treating a broken leg is $2000.
See if your veterinarian offers a payment plan.

, You’ll need to keep your dog in a crate or on a leash for the recovery period. If you let them run around the backyard or the park, they could easily get the splint or cast wet and dirty. Do everything you can to keep it clean and dry., It is important that your dog does not lick his wound. A dog's mouth is full of bacteria and licking will likely infect the wound. There are various ways to stop this behaviour. The ""cone of shame"" or Elizabethan collar is one way.


There are various neck braces that prevent the dog from turning around to lick its wound.
If your dog is not a chewer, a light dressing or an old sweatshirt can provide a barrier between his tongue and the wound.

, If your dog has received surgery for a broken leg, you’ll need to restrict their movement to two five-minute walks a day. Although it is not absolutely necessary, you might want to keep your dog in a crate during this time, so you don’t have to worry about it.Crates are widely available from pet retailers and sold for the purpose of housebreaking puppies.
You don't want a crate that is overly roomy. The general rule is to use a crate that the dog can sit upright in without banging its head.
After four weeks, you can do ten-minute walks.
Keep your dog away from stairs and slippery surfaces.
If you let the dog out of its crate, it may run around and injure itself again!

, If your dog is pawing at you or biting, it could be an indication that they are in pain. There have been advances in the treatment of pain in dogs, so you should ask your veterinarian about painkillers. Your veterinarian may prescribe a pain medication, which could be a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAIDs), an opioid or a corticosteroid drug. You should ask your veterinarian which medication works best and when it will make your dog’s pain go away. You should also ask about side effects of specific drugs.If NSAIDs do not work, your veterinarian may prescribe opioids.

, Your veterinarian should examine your dog’s recovery after six weeks. They will do X rays to make sure the fracture is properly healing. They will also give you new recommendations for home care, such as longer, fifteen-minute walks.They may recommend hydrotherapy.

, Choose bedding that keeps pressure evenly spread under your dog’s weight, such as orthopedic memory foam beds. There are also some beds that have a wicking effect, which means that if he accidentally goes to the bathroom in the crate, the moisture will be drawn away from its skin.If the weather is cold, cover the crate with blankets at night.
You may also want to give your dog a blanket.

, To relax your dog during recovery, you could give them a massage. Caress your dog’s ears for five minutes. Pet your dog’s back to make them feel better.By massaging your dog, you can improve blood circulation to a place where they have been injured.You could try Tellington Touch, which is an animal bodywork technique developed by Linda Tellington-Jones. You can ask your dog trainer for information on upcoming Tellington Touch workshops.

, Since your dog will be spending lots of time indoors or in a crate during the recovery period, you’ll want to keep them stimulated with toys and loving attention. Give them a new rawhide toy or bone to chew on in their crate."

Identify which toe is injured.,
Decide which toes to tape.,
Loosely tape the toes together.,
Change the tape after bathing.,
Look for signs of necrosis.,
Don't tape a severely fractured toe.,
Protect your toe from further damage.",How to Buddy Tape an Injured Toe," Toes are very susceptible to injury and even breaking when exposed to blunt trauma, such as stubbing them against furniture or kicking sports equipment around. In most cases, it's obvious which toe is injured, but sometimes you need to examine your toes closely to better understand the injury. Signs of mild-to-moderate injuries include redness, swelling, inflammation, localized pain, bruising, reduced motion, and maybe some degree of crookedness if the toe is dislocated or broken. The smallest toe (5th) and the great toe (1st) are injured and broken more often than the other toes.Buddy taping can be used on most toe injuries, even stress or hairline fractures, although more serious fractures typically need casting or surgery.Small hairline fractures, bone chips, contusions (bruises), and joint sprains are not considered serious problems, but severely crushed toes (mangled and bleeding) or displaced compound fractures (bleeding with bone sticking out of the skin) require immediate medical intervention, especially if the big toe is involved.;
, Once you've established which toe is injured, you need to decide which toe to tape it to. In general, try to tape toes together that are close in length and thickness — if your second toe is injured, it's easier to tape it to your third toe than your big (first) toe due to the similarity in size. Furthermore, your big toe is needed for ""toeing off"" every time you take a step, so it's not a good choice for buddy taping. In addition, make sure the ""buddy"" toe is uninjured, because taping two injured toes together may make things worse. In such situations, casting or wearing a compression boot may be a better idea.


If your fourth toe is injured, tape it to the third toe instead of the fifth because they are more equal in size and length.
Don't buddy tape an injured toe if you have diabetes or peripheral arterial disease because any reduction in blood circulation from taping it too tight significantly increases the risk of necrosis (tissue death)., Once you've decided on which two toes to tape together, grab some medical or surgical tape and loosely tape your injured toe to the uninjured one, perhaps using a figure-eight pattern for the most stability. Be careful not to tape too tightly, otherwise you'll create additional swelling and may even cut off blood circulation to the injured toe.Consider placing some cotton gauze between the toes to prevent skin abrasion and/or blisters. Your risk of bacterial infection significantly increases with blistering and abrasions.


Don't use so much tape that you can't fit your foot into your shoes. Furthermore, too much tape promotes overheating and perspiration.
Materials used for binding toes include medical / surgical paper tape, self-adherent wrap, electricians tape, small Velcro wraps and rubber bandages.To provide a little more support, which is certainly beneficial for dislocated toes, you can use a wooden or metal splint along with the tape. For toes, popsicle sticks work well, just make sure there are no sharp edges or splinters that can dig into the skin.

, If your toe is initially buddy taped by your doctor or another healthcare professional, then they likely used water resistant tape so that it's safe to take a shower or bath at least once. However, as a general guideline, be prepared to re-tape your toes after every washing so that you can check for any signs of skin irritation or infection.Abrasions, blisters and calluses increase the likelihood of a skin infection, so clean and dry your toes thoroughly before re-taping them. Consider cleaning your toes with alcohol wipes to disinfect them.


Signs of a skin infection include local swelling, redness, throbbing pain, and discharge of pus.
Your injured toe, depending on the severity of the injury, may need to be buddy-taped for up to four weeks to properly heal, so you'll likely become very experienced at re-taping it.
If your injured toe hurts more after re-taping it, then remove the tape and start over, but make sure the tape or wrap is a little looser.

, As noted above, necrosis is a type of tissue death due to lack of blood supply and oxygen. An injured toe, particularly a dislocation or fracture, may already involve damaged blood vessels, so you have to be extra careful when buddy taping not to cut off circulation to the toes. If you accidentally do, then the toes will likely start to throb with achy pain and turn dark red, then dark blue.Most tissue can survive without oxygen for a couple hours (at most), but it's imperative to carefully observe your toes within a 1/2 hour or so of taping to make sure they are getting enough blood.


People with diabetes have much less feeling in their toes and feet, and tend to have poor circulation, which is why they should avoid buddy taping toe injuries.
If necrosis does occur in the toes, then amputation surgery is needed to remove them so infection doesn't spread to the rest of the foot or leg.
If you experienced an open compound fracture, your doctor may recommend a precautionary two-week course of oral antibiotics to deter a bacterial infection.

, Although most injuries respond well to taping, some are beyond its scope. When toes are crushed and completely shattered (referred to as a comminuted fracture) or fractured such that the bones radically misalign and stick out through the skin (called an open compound fracture), then no amount of taping is helpful. Instead, you need to get to an emergency department immediately for medical attention and likely a surgical procedure.


Common symptoms of a broken toe include: intense sharp pain, swelling, stiffness, and usually immediate bruising due to internal bleeding. Walking is difficult, and running or jumping is nearly impossible without excruciating pain.
Broken toes can be related to conditions that weaken bone, such as bone cancer, bone infections, osteoporosis or chronic diabetes., Once your toe is injured, it's even more susceptible to other damage and problems. As such, wear comfortable and protective shoes while taping your toes (anywhere from two to 6 weeks). Choose close-toed, comfortable fitting shoes that have plenty of room in the toe cap to accommodate the tape/gauze and any associated swelling. Hard-soled, supportive, and sturdy shoes are likely the most protective, so avoid flip-flops and soft slip-on types. Completely avoid high-heel shoes for at least a few months post-injury because they severely crowd the toes and restrict blood flow.Supportive open-toed sandals can be used if the swelling in your toe is excessive, but remember that they don't offer any protection, so wear them with caution.
If you work in construction, or as a fireman, policeman or landscaper, consider wearing steel-toed boots for added protection until your toe completely heals.

Wipe the outside of the cast with a damp cloth.,
Use mild detergent to clean your cast.,
Keep the cast from getting dirty.",How to Clean a Cast1," If you happen to get your fiberglass cast dirty, try wiping off the dirt, food, or other mark with a damp cloth.Make sure the cloth is only damp and not too wet. It should not leave any pools of wetness behind on your cast.

No matter if you have a plaster or fiberglass cast, you should never get your cast wet or submerge it into water, even if you get it dirty. Though fiberglass casts are waterproof, the soft lining inside is not, so you want to keep them dry.If you have a fiberglass cast and a waterproof liner, you may be able to get the cast wet.;
, If either type of cast gets dirty on the outside and a damp cloth isn’t enough, try using mild dish detergent. Put a small amount of dish detergent on a damp cloth. Gently and carefully wipe away the dirt.Use a dry cloth to wipe away the soap and dry the cast.

, The most important thing to do while you or someone else has a cast is to keep it clean. This means keeping it away from dirt and sand if possible. You should also try to limit how much you sweat in it, because sweat and grime can cause it to get dirty.Be careful when you eat. Try not to drop food onto or into the cast. If you need to, cover the cast while you eat. This may be important if a child has an arm cast.

Protect the cast when you bathe or shower.,
Dry your plaster cast with a hairdryer on cool.,
Let a fiberglass cast dry naturally.",How to Clean a Cast2," When you take a bath or shower, put plastic around the cast and don’t put that part of your body into the water. You can use plastic bags or trash bags secured with waterproof tape to help keep your arm dry.When you are taking a bath, you must not get your cast wet even if you have a fiberglass cast. Don’t try to wash the cast in the shower.
It may be easier to give children a sponge bath to ensure that their cast stays dry.If your fiberglass cast has a waterproof liner, you might be able to take a shower. Ask your doctor before you try.

, If you happen to get your plaster cast wet, or you sweat inside your cast, you need to dry it inside and out. To do this, use a hairdryer set to the cool setting. This will provide air that will dry any moisture inside and outside of the cast.Don’t use the hairdryer set on the warm or hot setting. This can burn the skin and cause problems. It can also cause more sweating and moisture in the cast.

, Your fiberglass cast with a waterproof liner can get wet, either in the shower or swimming pool.After you get out of the water, it will take around an hour for the inside of the cast to dry. Be patient and let the cast dry naturally.Don't use a hairdryer to try to dry the fiberglass cast faster. Don't stick a towel in or around the fiberglass cast.

Use care with body casts when going to the bathroom.,
Avoid using deodorizers.,
Determine the type of cast you have.,
Know when to see the doctor.",How to Clean a Cast3," Body casts can be difficult to deal with and keep clean, especially when going to the bathroom. You want to make sure that if you or your child has a body cast, you do not get urine on the cast.Find a way to prevent splashing urine onto the cast, such as toilet paper in the bedpan.
Make sure no urine rolls along the skin into the cast. Wipe away the urine immediately.

, You may want to use something to help with the smell of the cast or to help keep it clean. However, don’t do this. This can lead to more grime and problems, especially inside the cast. Keep those types of things away from the cast.For example, don’t place lotions, powder, or deodorants on, inside, or near the cast.

, Though taking care of a fiberglass or plaster cast is similar, there are important distinctions between the two. Make sure you know what kind of cast you have and the type of liner you have so you can care for your cast properly.Fiberglass casts can hold up better if they happen to get wet. However, you should not submerge them in water, go swimming with them, or take a shower with them if you have a normal liner. The liner can get wet and irritate or cause sores on your skin inside the cast.
Some fiberglass casts come with waterproof liners. If you have a waterproof liner, you may be able to submerge it in water, but only with your doctor's approval. For example, you may be able to go swimming or take a bath with it.
Plaster casts cannot get wet. Water can damage the cast and cause problems. It may even possibly cause the cast to dissolve and fall apart. You should take care to always keep your plaster cast dry.

, If you get the cast completely wet somehow, you may need to see a doctor. Sometimes, a wet cast will completely dry, but often, a wet cast won’t dry completely, and it will cause sore spots on your skin inside the cast.You should call the doctor if you notice:

Pain and tightness in the injured limb
Numbness or tingling in the injured hand or foot
Burning or stinging under the cast
Injured fingers or toes of injured limb becoming cold or blue
Inability to move fingers or toes of injured limb
Swelling below the cast
Red or raw skin around the cast
Fever of 101F (38C) or higherIf the cast gotten wet but has not dried after 24 hours, call the doctor.Most casts will start to smell a little after you wear them for awhile. However, any foul or extremely bad odors are an indication of a problem. You should go see a doctor if the smell is bad because this might mean you have an infection.

Talk to your doctor about medications.,
Take mineral and vitamin supplements.,
Get a referral to an exercise physiologist.",How to Diagnose Low Bone Density in Kids," Nobody expects you to be able to diagnose low bone density in your child (that's what doctors are for), but there are some telltale signs and symptoms that may indicate a problem.A history of frequent broken bones is a common giveaway, although sometimes stress or hairline fractures are not obvious to detect without x-rays.


Indications that your child may have a stress fracture(s) include: deep achy pain that lasts for more than a week, bones that a very tender to touch, local swelling or puffiness and local redness and/or bruising.
Risk factors for low bone density include a variety of diseases and conditions (see below) and taking certain medications, such as corticosteroids, anti-convulsants (for seizures) and immunosuppressive drugs.;
, Low bone density in kids isn't usually suspected by parents until a history of broken bones, especially without significant trauma, is seen in their children.As such, if your child has a history of a few different bone fractures (or more) despite not being especially ""rough and tumble"" in sports or other activities, then talk to your doctor about getting tested for low bone density.


The diagnosis of osteoporosis in kids is a little different than for adults. Children need to have a history of bone fractures and low bone mineral density to be diagnosed with osteoporosis.Before any testing, your doctor will review your child's medical history, medications and likely ask about your family medical history, as some causes of low bone density are genetic and inherited.

, Most cases of low bone density in kids are discovered when they're taken to a doctor because of a bone fracture, typically in their legs, arms or spine. So chances are pretty good that when your kid gets his broken arm or leg x-rayed, the doctor will notice that the bones look a little brittle or porous on the film; however, regular x-rays of fractures are not highly reliable to understand the quality or density of the bones.An x-ray is just a starting point to gather information that may lead to a diagnosis of low bone density. Other testing is needed to confirm the diagnosis.
Healthy bones should look mostly white on x-ray, especially their outer borders called cortical bone. With osteoporosis, the bones look grainier and darker on film because they contain fewer minerals, such as calcium, phosphorus and magnesium.
Mild thinning of bone tissue without evidence of any fractures in kids is usually termed osteopenia instead of osteoporosis.

, If the history of fractures and x-rays look suggestive of low bone density, your doctor will order blood and urine tests for your child to try and confirm (or rule out) the diagnosis. These tests are ordered to primarily look at calcium, alkaline phosphatase, vitamin D and thyroid/parathyroid hormone levels, which are indicative of the common causes of low bone density in both children and adults.Calcium absorption is important because it's the primary mineral in bone. High levels in the blood might mean your child isn't utilizing it properly. Low levels might mean she's not getting enough dietary calcium or is losing it too quickly.
Vitamin D acts a lot like a hormone and is needed for the absorption of calcium in the intestines. Vitamin D is made in the skin in response to certain strong frequencies of sunshine.
Thyroid and parathyroid gland hormones are important for regulating bone growth and remodeling. Issues (diseases or injury) to these glands can trigger reduced bone mineral density in kids and adults.

, If laboratory blood and urine tests are also suggestive of low bone density or osteoporosis, then a DXA scan is ordered to take a closer look at the mineral density in various bones. For a DXA scan, the radiologist uses two x-ray beams of differing energy to image a site, then the special image is compared to an ""ideal standard"" based on the kid's age and gender.The kid is then assigned a Bone Mass Density (BMD) value relative to children of the same age with healthy normal bones.


For kids, the sites most often imaged are the spine and pelvis, which are thought to yield the most useful and reliable information regarding bone density.
Obtaining BMD values from comparing DXA scans is not regarded as completely reliable because children's bones are naturally less dense than adults and display more variability.
In general, DXA scans and BMD values can significantly underestimate low bone mineral density in kids. In other words, they can be told they're ""normal"" when they're not.

, A pQCT scan tends to be more helpful than a DXA scan because it distinguishes between the inner spongy bone (termed intramedullary) and and the harder, outer cortical bone, which is much denser.These pQCT scans are also quick and usually taken at the wrist or tibia (shin bone). They're considered to be better to diagnose low bone density, although they're not as commonly done as DXA scans.


Ideally, you can get both a DXA and pQCT scan done if there is some confusion as to whether your child has abnormally low bone mineral density or not.
At this time, most pQCT scans are done for research purposes, so it may be difficult getting one for your child in your area. Ask your doctor.

, Some causes of low bone density in children are preventable, but many causes are not. For example, being born premature increases the likelihood of a kid later developing weaker more fragile bones, as does cerebral palsy, Crohn's disease, osteogenesis imperfecta, malabsorption syndromes, metabolic conditions (homocystinuria and lysosomal disease), liver and kidney diseases, type 1 diabetes, some types of cancer and hyperparathyroidism.The key is to research any condition and disease your child has and understand all the possible side effects, such as low bone density, so you can anticipate future problems.
Sometimes hairline or stress bone fractures are not always obvious; however, be suspicious if your kid complains of deep achy pain that lasts for more than a few days, especially if there is no obvious surface injury.

, Although in many cases low bone mineral density in kids is not preventable, there is a growing number of cases directly related to a sedentary lifestyle, particularly among urban kids in big cities.Compared to previous generations, modern kids are far less physically active, which negatively impacts their bones and muscles.


Set limits on how much time your child can spend in front of a computer and television while at home.
Encourage your child to play physically active games with his friends, as well as cycling, swimming and yard work.
Indoor activity is fine, but playing outside is better because the sunshine triggers vitamin D production within his skin — at least during summer months.
If your child needs bed rest to recover from some disease or condition, their risk of osteoporosis is significantly increased, so always encourage some movement with the doctor's permission.

, Poor or inadequate nutrition is another growing cause of low bone mineral density in American kids and adults.Dietary deficiency in calcium and vitamin D are the two most important nutrients linked to low bone density, but not enough magnesium and boron are also factors. Discourage eating at fast food restaurants and serve less prepackaged food with lots of preservatives. Instead, cook more homemade meals from fresh ingredients.


Rich dietary sources of calcium include dairy products (milk, cheese, yogurt), fish (salmon, sardines), most green leafy veggies (spinach, kale, collard greens, broccoli), beans, peas and most nuts and seeds.
Rich dietary sources of vitamin D are harder to come by, but include: fish oils, fatty fish (herring, salmon, trout), egg yolks, beef liver, some hard cheeses and fortified orange juice and soy milk.
Try to limit the amount of soda your child drinks. There appears to be a connection between drinking cola and low bone density — possibly because drinking more cola means the person is probably drinking less milk and other beverages that promote bone health., Research indicates that tobacco use is a risk factor for for low bone density.If your teen is using tobacco — smoking cigarettes or using it in other forms, such as chewing tobacco — encourage him to quit.


Don't use punishment or ultimatums, as these rarely work. Instead, try talking to him about why he started using tobacco, and explain how much you want him to quit.Your teen probably knows about the obvious risks of tobacco use — cancer, heart attack, stroke. Try calling his attention to other negative side effects of tobacco use, such as having bad breath, yellowed teeth and fingers, developing wrinkles, having less energy, not to mention how expensive the habit has become.Offer to help your teen quit in any way you can. Have him write down all the reasons to quit and write down his intention to quit. Help him set a date to quit. Support him through cravings — have gum, straws, or toothpicks available for him to occupy his mouth when a craving strikes.Secondhand smoke may also increase risk of low bone mass. If you or another member of your household smokes, make sure you do not expose your child to secondhand smoke. Go outside or, better yet, set the example and quit smoking., Although the first line of treatment is dealing with any underlying conditions that are causing the lower bone density, then making sure the nutrition is adequate, there are medications for osteoporosis called bisphosphonate drugs.Common bisphosphonates include zoledronic acid, pamidronate, risedronate and alendronate — they work by slowing down cells (osteoclasts) that break down bone.


Bisphosphonates essentially slow down bone loss and allow the bone building cells (called osteoblasts) to work more effectively.
Bisphosphonates are usually more appropriate for adults because the side effects can be problematic and can include nausea, abdominal pain, difficulty swallowing and esophageal ulcers., Another form of treatment for low bone density that's likely much safer for kids is supplementation with minerals and vitamins, particularly calcium and vitamin D.Supplementation is a good alternative if you're finding it difficult to get the amount of nutrients your child needs through eating food in order to combat osteoporosis.


Keep in mind the recommended amount of daily calcium is 800 mg between the ages of four to eight years, but it increases to 1,300 mg from the ages of nine to 18 years.Between dietary and supplemental sources, you should always keep the daily dosage of calcium under 2,500 mg to prevent constipation and stomach cramps.
Vitamin D can be gotten from summer sunshine, but liquid D3 drops are the best for supplementation. Aim for at least 400 IU of vitamin D3 per day, although up to 1,000 IU is safe for children.
Using high SPF sunscreens reduces your body's ability to make Vitamin D, but is important to prevent skin cancer. Talk to your child's doctor about how to get a safe amount of sun.

, If you're finding it difficult to get your kid off the computer, out of the house and exercising in order to strengthen their muscles and bones, then get a referral from your doctor to an exercise physiologist or physiotherapist.The physical therapist can evaluate your child and recommend weight bearing exercises, such as vigorous walking, jumping rope, doing the stair climber and lifting light weights.


Weight bearing exercises are important for osteoporosis because when muscles contract and pull on bone via tendons, it stimulates bone growth and makes them stronger.
Swimming and cycling are great cardiovascular exercises for your child, but not as effective for combating juvenile osteoporosis because they're not as weight bearing.
Learning about exercising and stretching in a professional setting may promote a more active lifestyle in your child that lasts a lifetime.

Check for stiffness and pain in the shoulder.,
Notice if you cannot rotate your arm outward.,
Check if the pain goes away after several years.,
Notice if you cannot drive, dress, or sleep comfortably.",How to Diagnose a Frozen Shoulder1," The first stage of frozen shoulder is the “freezing” phase. In this phase, you will experience stiffness and pain in your shoulder that builds up over time, usually 2-9 months. Movement of your shoulder will be limited or very difficult without pain.You may also notice your shoulder hurts more at night and when you lie down on the side with the frozen shoulder.;
, The second stage is the “frozen,” or stiff phase. It usually lasts 4-12 months. The pain in shoulder will ease but you will still feel stiffness and limited movement. You cannot rotate your arm outward and you may notice the muscles around your shoulder appear weak or skinny due to underuse., The final stage is the “thawing” phrase, where your shoulder starts to thaw out and the symptoms go away temporarily. This can take one to three years. The pain and stiffness in your shoulder will go away and your shoulder will go back to normal. That is, until the “freezing” phase starts up again., Throughout the first two phrases of frozen shoulder, you will find it hard to do daily tasks like driving, dressing, or sleeping. You may develop sleep issues and have to ask others to drive or dress you due to your frozen shoulder.You may also find it difficult to do basic things like scratch your back and pick up items from the floor with your affected arm.

Know the terms for applying splints properly.,
Think about how to immobilize the joints near the injury site.,
Note that there are different splinting techniques.,
Find a splint.",How to Splint a Fractured Hand1," When describing the application of a splint or cast, it is necessary to understand the basic terms regarding the proper orientation and position to splint your injury. Two terms are particularly important:Flexion — A bending movement that decreases the angle between a segment and its proximal segment. For the purposes of making a splint for the hand, think about this as the movement applied to clenching a fist. Making a fist uses flexion of the muscles in your fingers.

Extension — A straightening movement that increases the angle between body parts. You can think of this as the opposite of flexion, or making a fist with your hand. Extension will be moving your joints away from each other, or opening your from a closed fist.;
, Splints should be applied with the idea of splinting the joint above and all the joints below the injury site, to keep free movement of the injury to a minimum and restrict movement of the surrounding tissues

, The type of splint depends on the injury. What follows in the next two methods are general guidelines. However, there are specific injuries that require slightly different splinting techniques, including:



Extensor tendon injuries — For this type of injury, the purpose of the splint will be to prevent any flexing of the hand and fingers. Place the split along the palm-side of the hand (volar side). The wrist should only have about 20 degrees of extension and the Metacarpophalangeal (MCP) about 10-15 degrees flexion (not straight).Thumb injuries — For injuries solely to the thumb, a thumb spica splint can be used and will allow the uninjured fingers to function normally. The interphalangeal joint of the thumb should be splinted in a straight position. The thumb spica splint will immobilize the wrist and thumb, adhering to the policy of splinting above and below the injured joint.Single finger injury — For injuries only to one finger, you can purchase aluminum splints with foam padding, which can be shaped to the right position. Alternatively, you can also use a tongue depressor cut to the appropriate size as a splint.Little finger (or ""pinky"") injuries — When the only injury occurs to the smallest finger of your hand, an ulnar gutter splint can be used and will allow range of motion to the other uninjured fingers, possibly allowing for continued day-to-day use of the hand. The splint will be applied to the outer edge of the little finger running alongside the ulnar bone (the opposite side of the thumb). Often the little finger will be attached to the ring finger in the splint to provide greater support and the wrist is immobilized (since the splint extends down the wrist)., It should be a hard, straight object that is at least as long as the distance from the middle of the forearm to the tips of the fingers. Ideally, use an object that will form to the shape of the arm, wrist and hand. Rolled up newspaper provides adequate support to make an impromptu hand splint.


Many first-aid kits have splinting material that is firm enough to hold a fractured hand in place, but with a handle that the injured person can grasp with their fingers.

If a weight-bearing bone is hurt, like in the leg or pelvis, then don't put any pressure on it. Instead, get assistance from someone nearby and get a ride to the hospital, or call for an ambulance to come pick you up.


Common signs and symptoms of a broken bone include: intense pain, a visibly deformed or misshapen bone or joint, nausea, limited mobility, numbness or tingling, swelling and bruising.X-rays, bone scans, MRI, and CT scan are tools that doctors use to help diagnose broken bones and their severity — small stress fractures may not show up on x-ray until the related swelling abates (up to a week or so). X-rays are most commonly used for the diagnosis of traumatic fractures.
If your broken bone is considered complicated — there's multiple fragments, the skin is penetrated by the bone and/or the pieces are grossly misaligned — then surgery will likely be necessary.;
, Before a broken bone can be casted, sometimes it must be put back together and straightened to its original shape. In many cases, the doctor will use a simple technique called ""reduction"", which involves pulling on the ends of the bone (creating traction) and manually fitting the pieces together.With more complicated fractures, surgery is required and often involves the use of metal rods, pins or other devices for structural support.


Cast immobilization with a plaster or fiberglass cast is the most common treatment for a broken bone.Most broken bones heal quicker when properly repositioned, compressed and immobilized. Usually the doctor will initially put on a splint, which is like a partial cast typically made of fiberglass. A full cast will usually be put on in 3-7 days after most of the swelling is improved.
Casts are made of a soft padding and a hard covering (such as plaster of Paris or more commonly, fiberglass). They usually need to stay on for between 4-12 weeks, depending on which bone is broken and how badly.Alternatively, a functional cast (such as a plastic boot) or a supportive brace may be used instead of a hard cast — it depends on the type of fracture and its location.

, Over-the-counter non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen, naproxen or aspirin can be short-term solutions to help you deal with pain or inflammation related to your broken bone.Keep in mind that these medications can be hard on your stomach, kidneys and liver, so it's best not to use them for more than 2 weeks at a stretch.


Kids under the age of 18 should never take aspirin, as it’s associated with Reye’s syndrome.
Alternatively, you can try over-the-counter pain killers such as acetaminophen (Tylenol), but don't take them concurrently with NSAIDS without talking to your doctor.
Your doctor may give you a prescription for more powerful medications while at the hospital if your pain is severe.

, Once you're discharged, you'll be told to elevate your broken bone and ice the area, even with the cast or splint on, in order to help decrease swelling and inflammation.Depending on your job and which bone is broken, you'll likely have to take some time off to recuperate. You might also need crutches or a cane for support.


Total bed rest is not a good idea for most stabilized fractures because some movement (even in surrounding joints) is needed to stimulate blood flow and healing.
Ice should be applied for 15-20 minutes every 2-3 hours for a couple of days, then reduce the frequency as the pain and swelling subside — never apply ice directly to your skin, wrap it in a thin towel first.

, In addition to some light movements in the joints surrounding your broken bone, putting some weight on it after a week or so can be beneficial — especially for weight-bearing bones of the legs and pelvis. Make sure your doctor lets you know when to begin weight bearing. Lack of activity and complete immobilization, in proportion with the time spent healing, will induce loss of bone mineral, which is counterproductive for a broken bone trying to regain its strength.Some movement and weight bearing seems to attract more minerals to the bones, which makes them stronger and less apt to break in the future.


There are three stages to bone healing: reactive stage (a blood clot forms between the two ends of the fracture), repair stage (specialized cells begin to form a callus, which spans the fracture), and remodeling phase (bone is created and the injury is slowly resculpted into its original shape).Broken bones take several weeks to several months to heal, depending on the severity and your overall health. However, the pain usually disappears before the fracture is stable enough to cope with the demands of normal activity.

, Don't get your plaster or fiberglass cast wet, as it will weaken and no longer properly support your broken bone.If need be, use a plastic bag to cover the cast when you bathe or shower. If you're wearing a plastic compression boot (commonly recommended for stress fractures of the foot), make sure you keep it pressurized properly.


If your cast makes your skin itch, don't poke anything underneath it, as a sore could form and then develop into an infection. See your doctor if your cast becomes wet, cracked, or has a bad odor or drainage around it.
Exercise the joints that aren't covered by the cast (elbow, knee, fingers, toes) to promote better circulation. Blood caries oxygen and nutrients to tissues.

, Your bones, like any other tissue in your body, need all the appropriate nutrients in order to heal properly. Eating a balanced diet rich in minerals and vitamins is proven to help heal broken bones Focus on eating fresh produce, whole grains, leans meats and drinking plenty of purified water and milk.


Minerals such as calcium and magnesium are important for bone strength. Rich food sources include: dairy products, tofu, beans, broccoli, nuts and seeds, sardines, salmon.
Avoid consuming things that may hamper your healing, such as alcohol, soda pop, fast food and food with lots of refined sugar.

, Although it's best to obtain essential nutrients from a well-balanced diet, supplementing with key bone-healing minerals and vitamins will ensure you meet your higher requirements without increasing your caloric intake. More calories combined with less activity usually leads to weight gain, which is not a healthy outcome after your bone heals.


Calcium, phosphorus and magnesium are the primary minerals found in bones — so find a supplement that contains all three. For example, adults need between 1,000 - 1,200 mg of calcium daily (depending on age and gender), but you may need a little more due to your broken bone — consult with your doctor or nutritionist.Important trace minerals to consider include: zinc, iron, boron, copper and silicon.
Important vitamins to consider include: vitamins D and K. Vitamin D is crucial for mineral absorption in the gut — your skin produces it for free in response to strong summer sunshine.Vitamin K binds calcium to bones and stimulates collagen formation, which aids healing.

, Once your cast is removed, you may notice that the muscles surrounding your broken bone look shriveled and weak. If that's the case, then you need to consider some form of rehabilitation. A physical therapist can show you specific and tailored stretches, mobilizations and strengthening exercises for your injured area.Physiotherapy is usually required 2-3x per week for 4-8 weeks to positively impact an area that's experienced a broken bone. Often the physical therapist can give you exercises to do at home, and you may not need to return many times.


If need be, a physical therapist can stimulate, contract and strengthen your weak muscles with electrotherapy, such as electronic muscle stimulation.
Even after your cast or brace is removed, you may need to limit your activities until the bone is solid enough for normal activity.

, Chiropractors and osteopaths are musculoskeletal specialists who focus on establishing normal motion and function within joints, bones and muscles.Manual joint manipulation, also called an adjustment, can be used to unjam or reposition joints that are misaligned or stiff due to the trauma that caused your broken bone. Healthy joints allow bones to move and heal properly.


You can often hear a ""popping"" sound with an adjustment, which is not at all related to the sounds related to a broken bone.
Although a single adjustment can sometimes completely restore a joint to full mobility, more than likely it will take 3-5 treatments to notice significant results.

, Acupuncture involves sticking thin needles into specific energy points within the skin / muscle in efforts to reduce pain and inflammation (helpful for the acute phase of a broken bone) and to potentially stimulate healing.Acupuncture is not commonly recommended for healing broken bones, and should only be considered as a secondary option, but anecdotal reports suggest it can stimulate healing for many different types of musculoskeletal injuries. It's worth a try if your budget allows for it.


Based on the principles of traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture reduces pain and inflammation by releasing a variety of substances including endorphins and serotonin.
It's also claimed that acupuncture stimulates the flow of energy, referred to as chi, which may be the key to stimulating healing.
Acupuncture is practiced by a variety of health professionals including some physicians, chiropractors, naturopaths, physical therapists and massage therapists — whoever you choose should be certified by NCCAOM.

Remember that healing takes time.",How to Cope With a Broken Wrist," A broken wrist requires medical attention so it can heal properly. If you aren’t experiencing a lot of pain, you can wait until you’re able to see your regular physician.If you have any of the following symptoms, you should seek emergency medical attention:Significant pain or swelling
Numbness in the wrist, hand, or fingers
A deformed appearance of the wrist, looking crooked or bent
An open fracture (where the broken bone has pierced through the skin)
Pale fingers;
, Most broken wrists are treated first with a splint, which is a rigid piece of plastic, fiberglass or metal attached to the wrist with bandages or a brace.This is usually used for a week, until the swelling reduces.After the initial swelling has gone down, a plaster or fiberglass cast is usually placed after a few days or a week.You may need a second cast after 2-3 weeks, if the swelling goes down further and the first cast becomes too loose., Most broken wrists heal within 6-8 weeks with proper treatment. This means you will probably have a cast for most of that time.Your doctor will usually conduct regular x-rays through this period to make sure your wrist is healing correctly.

, After your cast comes off, you may be referred to a physical therapist. Physical therapy can help you regain the strength and motion that you lost after your injury.If you don’t need formal physical therapy, your doctor will probably give you exercises to do at home. Make sure you follow your doctor’s recommendations to help your wrist return to its full functioning.

, Elevating your wrist above the level of your heart will help reduce swelling and pain. It’s important to elevate your wrist for at least the first 48-72 hours after having a cast put on. Your doctor may recommend that you elevate it longer.You may also need to keep the wrist elevated while you sleep or during the day. Try propping it up on a few pillows.

, Icing your wrist can help reduce swelling and ease your pain. Make sure to keep your cast dry while applying ice.Put ice in a zip-top plastic bag. Make sure the bag is sealed properly to avoid leaks. Wrap the bag in a towel to make sure condensation doesn’t get into your cast.
You can also use a bag of frozen vegetables as an ice pack. Look for veggies that are small and even in size, such as corn or peas. (And obviously, don’t eat them after you’ve used the bag as an ice-pack.)Hold the ice on your wrist for 15-20 minutes every 2-3 hours. Apply ice for the first 2-3 days, or as long as your doctor recommends.You may also find it helpful to use a commercial gel-based ice pack. These are reusable, freezable ice packs that won’t melt and leak water onto a cast. You can find them at medical supply stores and most pharmacies., Most wrist pain can be treated with a non-prescription pain reliever.You should talk with your doctor about what type of painkiller is appropriate for you. Some can interfere with medical conditions or other medications you’re taking. Your doctor may recommend a combination of ibuprofen and acetaminophen/paracetamol to fight pain and reduce swelling. These are more effective together than either one is alone.Ibuprofen is an NSAID (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug). These help reduce fever and swelling by inhibiting your body’s production of prostaglandins. Other NSAIDs include naproxen sodium and aspirin, although aspirin has a more prolonged anti-clotting effect than other NSAIDs.Your doctor may not recommend aspirin if you have a bleeding disorder, asthma, anemia, or other medical condition. Aspirin can cause negative interactions with several medical conditions and medications.When administering pain relievers to a child, be sure to use a children’s formula and follow the dosage for the child’s age and weight.Aspirin is not recommended for children under age 18.
There is a risk of liver damage when taking acetaminophen, so use only as much as recommended by your doctor.Do not take an OTC painkiller for more than 10 days (5 days in children) unless directed by your doctor. If your pain persists after 10 days, see your doctor., It’s important to exercise any joints that aren’t under the cast, such as your elbow and fingers, to keep circulation flowing.This will help speed your healing process and increase mobility.If you experience pain when moving your elbow or fingers, contact your doctor.

, You may find that your skin gets itchy under the cast, and you’ll probably want to scratch it. Don’t! This can cause harm to your skin or the cast. Don’t poke or stick anything into the cast.Try raising your cast or blowing on it with a hairdryer on the “low” or “cool” setting instead.Don’t put powders into the cast, either. Anti-itch powders can cause irritation when they’re trapped under the cast., Your cast may rub or irritate your skin where its edges meet your skin. You can apply moleskin, which is a soft fabric with an adhesive backing, directly to the skin where the cast is rubbing. You can purchase moleskin at drug stores and pharmacies.Apply moleskin to clean, dry skin. Replace it when it gets dirty or loses its stickiness.
If the edges of your cast become rough, you can use a nail file to smooth out the rough edges. Don’t peel, cut, or break off pieces of your cast.

, In most cases, your wrist will heal in a few weeks with proper care. You should call your doctor if you experience any of the following:Numbness or tingling in your hand or fingers
Cold, pale or blue fingers
Increased pain or swelling of the area after the cast has been put on
Raw or irritated skin around the edges of the cast
Cracks or soft spots in the cast
Wet, loose, or tight casts
Casts that smell bad or itching that won’t go away

, Because many casts are made of plaster, they are easily damaged by water. Getting the cast wet can also encourage mold or mildew growth inside the cast. Wet casts may also cause sores to form on your skin under the cast. Do not get the cast wet.Tape a heavy-duty plastic bag (such as a garbage bag) over your cast when you bathe or shower. Hold your cast outside the shower or bathtub so you reduce the likelihood of getting it wet.
Wrap a washcloth or small towel around the top of your cast to keep water from leaking in under the cast.
You may be able to purchase water-resistant cast shields from your doctor’s office or a medical supply store.

, If your cast does get wet, pat it dry with a bath towel. Then, use a hair dryer on the “low” or “cool” setting for 15-30 minutes.If the cast is still wet or soft after you’ve tried to dry it, call your doctor. You may need a new cast.

, If your fingers get cold while you’re in your cast, you may be having circulation problems. (Or it could just be cold in your house.) Elevate your wrist and wear a sock on your hand to keep your fingers cozy.Wiggling your fingers can help restore circulation.

, Putting on clothes with fasteners such as buttons or zippers may be difficult while you’re in a cast. Wearing fitted clothing or clothes with tight sleeves isn’t usually a good idea, as these may not fit over a cast.


Choose loose, stretchy clothing. Elastic-waisted pants or skirts mean you don’t have to fumble with fasteners.
Shirts with short sleeves or sleeveless shirts are a good idea.
Use your good arm to put the shirt sleeve over the cast and pull gently. Try to minimize how much you use the arm in the cast.
Use a shawl or blanket to stay warm instead of a jacket, which could be harder to get into. A thick poncho or cape can be an easier choice rather than an outdoor coat.
Don’t be embarrassed to ask for help when you need it.

, If you’re a student and you’ve broken the wrist of your dominant hand, you may need to ask for a note-taker or other accommodations while your wrist heals. Speak with your teacher or your university’s disability resources center.


If you can learn to write with your non-dominant hand, this will help, but this can be difficult and takes a long time.
If you’ve broken the wrist of your non-dominant hand, use a heavy object like a book or paperweight to hold paper in place while you’re writing. Use your injured arm as little as possible.

, When you can, use your non-injured arm to do daily tasks such as brushing your teeth and eating. This will help reduce inflammation in your injured wrist.


Don’t lift or carry things with your injured wrist. This could cause re-injury and prolong the healing process.

, This is particularly important if you have broken the wrist of your dominant hand. It is unsafe to drive in a cast and your doctor will likely tell you not to drive.Although it is not illegal to drive with a wrist cast, use sound judgement when deciding whether to drive or not.Other machinery – particularly machinery that requires two hands to operate – should be avoided.

, You will notice dryness and perhaps some swelling after the cast is removed.


Your skin may also look dry or flaky. Your muscles may look smaller than when you put the cast on, which is normal.Soak your arm/wrist in warm water for 5-10 minutes. Gently dry the skin with a towel.Use a moisturizing cream on the wrist and arm to soften the skin.
To reduce swelling, take ibuprofen or aspirin as recommended by your doctor.

, It can take some time before you’re able to return to your full routine. In particular, you may need to wait 1-2 months to resume light exercise, such as swimming or cardio. Vigorous activities such as sports may require waiting 3-6 months.Take care to prevent further injuries to your wrist. Braces can help prevent future wrist injuries.

, Just because your cast is off does not mean you are completely healed. It may take six months or longer to heal if the break was severe.You may continue to have aches or stiffness for months or years after the initial break.Your healing process is also affected by your age and overall health. Children and teens tend to heal faster than adults. Older adults and people with osteoporosis or osteoarthritis may not experience healing as fast or as fully."

Share your medical history with your doctor.,
Let the doctor examine the shoulder.,
Have an MRI done on the shoulder.,
Allow the doctor to do an X-ray on the shoulder.",How to Diagnose a Frozen Shoulder2," At your appointment, your doctor will ask you about your medical history to determine if you have had a medical condition that makes you susceptible to frozen shoulder. People who have had a stroke or a mastectomy are at a higher risk for this condition., Because frozen shoulder takes a long time to develop and go through each phase, it can be difficult to diagnosis on your own. Let your doctor perform a physical exam of your shoulder to confirm your condition. They will move it carefully in all directions to check for pain.They will also check to see if the movement of your shoulder is limited. They may try to rotate or lift your arm to better examine your shoulder.

, A Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is done on your shoulder to look for problems in the soft tissues of your shoulder. It will tell the doctor if there are any problems like a torn rotator cuff in your shoulder, which can cause frozen shoulder.An MRI is painless and can often be done at the doctor’s office during your appointment.

, X-rays can also help your doctor look for issues or damage to the bones in your shoulder that could be causing the frozen shoulder. Your doctor can also check for other issues like arthritis.An X-ray does not cause any pain and can be performed at the doctor’s office.

Take anti-inflammatory painkillers.,
Get a steroid injection.,
Work with a physiotherapist.",How to Diagnose a Frozen Shoulder3," Your doctor will likely recommend that you take anti-inflammatory painkillers like ibuprofen, diclofenac, and naproxen. These medications can ease pain and reduce swelling in your shoulder.Follow the dosage instructions on the label and never take more than recommended.

, Your doctor can also administer a steroid injection into or near your shoulder joint. This will help to reduce pain and swelling temporarily. Your symptoms will return over time but you may like the initial relief of the steroid injection., Your doctor may also recommend a physiotherapist that you can work with to help regain movement in your shoulder and to reduce pain. The physiotherapist will show you shoulder exercises you can do at home and in your sessions with them.The exercises will prevent the shoulder for stiffening up and allow for a wide range of movement.

Prepare the hand for splinting.,
Make or cut the splint as needed.,
Position and contour the splint.,
Wrap the fractured area.,
Do not remove the splint.",How to Splint a Fractured Hand2," Put small pieces of cotton or gauze between each finger at the base of the hand to help absorb sweat.

, Measure out a length for the splint that can adequately immobilize the hand and fingers. The length of the splint should be approximately the length from the middle of your forearm to the fingertips.Curve the splint so that it follows the curve of the injured limb and provides a cupping support to the wrist/arm/elbow.


Pad the splint and your hand with cotton padding.

, Splints are meant to allow an injury to safely recover while positioned in a safe and natural resting position. The splint should be applied with the hand and wrist in a neutral position. A neutral position is generally the relaxed and natural position of the resting hand where your fingers are naturally slightly curled without any active flexing or use of the muscles.Take a rolled up crepe bandage segment, rolled gauze or a small cloth and set it between the resting fingers and the bottom of the splint to support the fingers in the resting position
In general, the wrist is usually at a position of 20 degrees extension, and the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints are positioned in 70 degrees of flexion. The MCP joints are the joints at the base of your fingers that attach to your palm. The interphalangeal joints are the joints between your fingertips and and the MCP joints and should be roughly straight.
For finger injuries, be sure to allow the fingers to flex naturally. There should not be anything rigid that keeps the fingers from passively flexing or bending at rest.

, Use gauze, a clean cloth or belt. Wind it securely around the splint and wrist area to keep the splint in place. Secure the splint without wrapping too tightly.Work from above the injury site to the injury site. If possible, wrap up to the injury, then put a different colored bandage over the injury. This allows the doctor to remove only the bandage over the injury to assess it, leaving the splint in place for support.
A splint is not a cast, and should allow for more mobility. If the splint is wrapped too tightly, there will be no flexing (bending of your hand and fingers downward towards the natural resting position) and too much constant pressure may be applied to the injury.
Ensure that the splint is only wrapped tightly enough to make the splint secure in its position. Check the fingertips for circulation by gently squeezing over the fingernail. If the color returns to the fingernail in good time, circulation is good. Otherwise, rewrap the bandage and retest the capillary refill in this manner.

, Only remove it at your doctor's recommendation and under his supervision."
"
Place a splint under the injured hand.,
Wrap the splint.,
Cover the splint with plaster of Paris strips.,
Immobilize the splint.",How to Splint a Fractured Hand3," Make sure the injured hand rests comfortably and straight with fingers bent slightly around the end of the splint, as detailed above.


Place cotton pieces or gauze between each finger.

, Use four layers of cotton gauze or padding, starting around the hand and winding up the arm at least half-way to the elbow. Padding is important because it helps protect the hand and forearm from the heat of the plaster and keeps the cast splint from rubbing uncomfortably against the skin.


As described in the previous section, do not wrap the splint to tightly against the injury. The splint should be held in place just enough to be secure and to provide adequate support.Check the capillary refill of the fingers before you commit to the plaster of Paris.

, Use roughly 12 layers of plaster of Paris that are the right width for the extremity. Cut the strips if necessary. Dip them in warm water and squeeze out the excess water. The plaster must be damp but not sopping wet. Wrap the strips around the gauze padding until the entire padded area is covered.Make sure the water is only lukewarm. Plaster of Paris will warm up as it sets, and you'll risk burning the patient's skin if the strips are dipped in hot water to start.
You can also use fiberglass for the outer layer, which dries more quickly than plaster but is more expensive. Fiberglass is applied in the same way as the plaster of Paris strips. However, only a doctor should apply fiberglass to a cast, as a doctor should assess the injury and make sure it is set properly.

, Maintain the desired position of the splint and hand for several minutes to allow the cast splint to harden and adequately dry.


Plaster can take more than a half hour to set, whereas fiberglass dries in 15 to 30 minutes.

"

Apply ice to the injury.,
Elevate the hand.,
Take pain medication.,
Consult your physician.",How to Splint a Fractured Hand4," Wrap ice in a towel or cold compress cloth and place it on the top of the hand. Use a loosely wrapped bandage or cloth to hold the ice in place to prevent the fractured hand from swelling. Never apply ice directly to the skin, as it can cause frostbite.Apply an ice pack or cold compress for 10 to 20 minutes at a time. Just make sure the ice doesn't get the splint or cast wet.
Applying ice to the injury will help decrease swelling of the hand and can improve healing time.

, Keeping the injured hand elevated above the level of your heart can help to reduce swelling and increase drainage of fluid in your hand. Elevation of the hand is the most effective way to promote healing, and keeping your hand elevated during the first week of your injury is extremely important.If you develop numbness or pressure in the cast, go to the doctor and have it checked for compartment syndrome.
When walking, it is important to keep the hand elevated and not naturally dangling along the side of the body, as is normally done.
Arm slings may be prescribed by your doctor, but they usually keep your hand below the level of your heart, and they can increase the likelihood of shoulder stiffness. An arm sling can also cause additional problems and is not a necessity when caring for a fracture.Use an elevation sling for support rather than the traditional sling. This keeps the wrist and hand above the level of the heart and close to the body for protection

, If you are feeling considerable pain, you can take ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), aspirin or acetaminophen (Tylenol).All of these are available over-the-counter. Be sure to follow the dosage recommendations on the bottle.

, After the first week, your doctor will be able to assess and better guide the ongoing treatment. You should also call your doctor immediately if you experience any of the following:Increased pain
Numbness, tingling, burning or stinging in the injured area
Pressure against the inside of the cast that turns to throbbing, tingling or pain
Circulation problems (look for discolored, pale, blue, gray or cold fingers and nails)
Bleeding, pus, or bad odors coming from the splint or cast

Go to the doctor.,
Talk to your doctor about changing your medicine.,
Take medication to raise your blood pressure.,
Treat underlying conditions.",How to Treat Low Blood Pressure1," There are many underlying causes for low blood pressure. Treatments vary and are determined by the underlying condition. Your doctor will perform a physical exam. They will also need a complete medical history and a detailed description of your symptoms.A full blood count should be done by the doctor. This should include cholesterol, B12, and hemoglobin.
Try and have a few blood pressure readings to show your doctor. Take your blood pressure yourself or at any pharmacy. Take your blood pressure while sitting, lying down, and standing to see if there are differences depending on your position.;
, You should tell your doctor about all of the medicines you take. Many medications cause low blood pressure, and combinations of certain medicines can also cause low blood pressure. Ask your doctor if they think your medication is causing the low blood pressure. The doctor may decide to change your medication or adjust your dosage., Depending on the reason for the low blood pressure, your doctor may be able to prescribe medication that can raise your blood pressure. Fludrocortisone, midodrine, and erythropoietin are commonly prescribed for hypotension.This is usually prescribed to treat orthostatic hypotension, which is a condition where you get low blood pressure from standing up after sitting or lying down. This is a treatable condition but requires the documentation of repeated blood pressure readings to confirm.

, Low blood pressure is often caused by underlying conditions. If your doctor has diagnosed a cause for the low blood pressure, they need to treat the underlying condition. Sometimes, treating the underlying conditions can treat the blood pressure problems.Underlying conditions include heart conditions, anemia, diabetes, very low cholesterol, and obesity, neurological conditions like Parkinson’s, and thyroid disorders.People who diet too heavily, those who have removed all starches from their diet, and those who suffer from anorexia nervosa are prone to hypotension.
Hypotension can also be a subtle sign of some bleeding. This could include heavy periods, stomach cancers, bleeding peptic ulcers, and more.

Legumes, seeds, and nuts have great nutrients in them and should be added to your diet. They have plenty of omega-3 fatty acids, fiber, and phytochemicals as well as protein. Eat up to 6 servings per week as opposed to per day. This is because these foods have a high calorie content and should always be consumed in moderation.


Try including walnuts, peas, great northern beans, almonds, sunflower seeds, flax seeds, lentils, and black beans into recipes and meals to get the vital nutrients they have on them.;
, The first choice for reducing blood pressure is always lifestyle changes. One major cause of hypertension is too much sodium in your diet. Decreasing you dietary salt intake every day can decrease blood pressure by several points. Doctors typically recommend that those with hypertension limit their sodium intake to less than 1500 to 2000 mg per day. You can track this by checking out the sodium on food labels, which is listed in milligrams (mg) on every nutrition label.


Pay attention to serving sizes. It may seem like it have a low about of sodium, but if there are more than one serving in each container and you eat it all, you may consume more sodium than you think. Many processed foods, including most canned soups, contain high levels of sodium. Be careful of processed foods when considering how much salt your body is getting. Even processed foods that don't taste salty may have significantly more salt than is healthy.Don't add table salt to food. Ask your doctor if a salt-substitute can be used. These often contain potassium chloride.

, When you need to reduce blood pressure, you should eat whole grains. Instead of choosing refined grains such as white bread, rice, and pasta, choose to each whole grains instead. Doctor's recommend six to eight servings of grains per day. Try to eat oatmeal, brown rice, and quinoa.


When you buy grains, look for packages that say whole wheat, whole grain, and multigrain. These have better ingredients and are better for your heart. , When you are trying to treat your hypertension, you need to keep away from high fat meat. Instead, eat lean protein. Don't eat more than 6 servings of lean meat or protein a week. Try meats such as poultry breast and fish. Eat other types of hearty protein as well, such as soy or eggs.


When you do eat meat, trim away any fat or skin from the meat before cooking. Do not fry it. Instead, grill, broil, roast, boil, or poach your meats.
Choose more fish for your diet. Fish such as salmon contain heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids, which help ease hypertension instead of contributing to it., Vegetables and fruit are integral to any heart healthy diet. The natural vitamins and minerals help combat weight gain, boost your immunity, and keep your blood pressure down. Try to eat at least four to five servings of vegetables and fruits per day. Squash, tomatoes, broccoli, spinach, artichokes, and carrots are good examples of vegetables that are high in fiber, potassium, and magnesium. Use fruits such as pineapples, mangos, bananas, blueberries, pomegranates, and strawberries both as a natural treat and a substitute for refined, sugary sweets that you crave.


Try leaving on the edible peels of vegetables and fruits for extra fiber and nutrients., Refined sugars found in sugary sweets work against the healthy portions of your diet. They can make you gain weight and mess with your blood pressure. Cut down to no more than five servings of sweets per week


If you have to eat sweets, consume sweets that are lower in sugar and fat. Avoid fried sweets and those with too much saturated fats as well., Beverages with caffeine and alcohol should not be consumed with you suffer from hypertension. Caffeine causes an increase in heart rate and blood pressure, especially in high doses. Try to have less than 400 mg per day of caffeine. Drink no more than one serving of alcohol if you are a woman and no more than two servings of alcohol a day if you are a man.


A small, eight ounce coffee contains 100 to 150mg of caffeine and a small, eight ounce tea has 40 to 120mg. Watch out for larger portion that are popular at coffee chains. These can pack a ton of caffeine in one cup. , Exercise of all kinds can help treat your hypertension. Start working out for at least 30 minutes a day with aerobic exercise such as walking, jogging, or swimming. Try to add strength training into your routine twice a week as well. Check with your doctor about your exercise regimen if you have medical problems or are very overweight.


You should shoot for at least five days of exercise a week, or three if you do more intense, 25 minute long exercises such as HIIT cardio.
Even if you have to start small, try to at least walk for exercise everyday. You can build up to more elaborate exercise routines and activities.Find a buddy with whom to exercise. Whether it's a neighbor you treat as a walking buddy or your best friend whom you coerce into swimming laps with you, it's easier to consistently exercise when the exercise itself is a social activity.
Try different exercises. As soon as you get bored with your routine, you're likely to quit. So the secret is never getting bored in the first place. Constantly think about what you could be doing to mix up your routine.

, Stress, anxiety, and depression can increase hypertension. Learn to manage and cope with stress to improve your emotional and physical health. Take time out of every day to do a relaxing, fun activity. This can be playing a game with family and friends, reading a book, watching your favorite TV show, going for a hike in your favorite location, or walking your dog.


If your stress comes from your crazy schedule, learn to say no to activities that aren't a necessity. Give yourself time to rest each day and learn to manage your time better.
If you feel like your anxiety and depression are not linked with hypertension or it is a major part of your life, speak to your healthcare professional., Smoking is one of the most common and avoidable contributing factors to cardiovascular death. It is bad for your overall health, especially that of your lungs and heart. The added chemicals in cigarettes cause increases in heart rate and vessel constriction, which transiently increased blood pressure. The effects of smoking can also last for years, even if you quit. Cigarette smoking also causes your arteries to stiffen over time, which doesn't go away right after you quit. Ask your doctor about ways to quit smoking, such as shots, medications, patches, pills, and group or individual therapy.

, Often, your doctor will prescribe medication along side your lifestyle changes to get your blood pressure down. Thiazide diuretics such as chlorthalidone, hydrochlorothiazide reduce the fluid volume in your heart and help relax the vessels. This lowers the pressure put on them, which lowers your blood pressure.


These medications are taken once a day. The side effects include low sodium and potassium, which can lead to dizziness, vomiting, fatigue, muscle weakness, and irregular heart beat.They may also make you urinate more often.

, Calcium channel blockers, such as amlodipine, nicardipine, nifedipine, verapamil, and diltiazem, are potent vasodilators. This means they work by relaxing the muscles in the walls of the vessels. This, in turn, helps the blood flow easier, which lowers your blood pressure.


Take these medications one to three a day as directed. The side effects can include swelling in the lower extremities and decreased heart rate., Angiotensin II inhibitors include two classes of medications, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs). ACE inhibitors include medications such as captopril, enalapril, and lisinopril. ARBs include medication such as irbesartan, losartan, and valsartan. These medications inhibit Angiotensin II, a hormone that causes narrowing of the blood vessels and increased fluid retention in the heart.


These medications are taken in similar ways. Take them one to three times daily. The major side effects include hypotension, which can cause dizziness and fainting. Other common side effects include elevated potassium, muscle weakness, irregular heart beat, and cough.These are often prescribed for younger patients., There are two additional medications that you can take for hypertension when other methods and lifestyle changes do not work for you. Beta blockers include medications such as carvedilol, esmolol, labetalol, metoprolol, nadolol, propranolol, and timolol. Alpha blockers include medications such as doxazosin and prazosin.. These medications work by blocking signals from nerves and hormones in the body that cause your blood vessels to narrow.


These medications are taken in similar ways. Take them one to three times a day, as prescribed. Some side effects of these medications include cough, shortness of breath, hypoglycemia, high potassium, depression, fatigue, sexual dysfunction, headache, nausea, weakness, and weight gain., Although not scientifically verified, there are several herbal remedies which are thought to help hypertension. However, don't substitute these unverified herbal remedies for proven scientific advice. Instead, supplement your diet with them if approved by your healthcare provider.


Holly leaf extract is a Chinese herbal remedy that helps blood vessels. Drink it as a tea enhance circulation and blood flow to the heart.Fish oil, which are omega-3 fatty acids, may help with fat metabolism and lower blood pressure.Other herbal remedies such as garlic, hibiscus, coconut water, ginger, cardamom, and hawthorn berry extract all fight high blood pressure and may mimic properties in medicine that is used for blood pressure., Very generally speaking, the health problems from hypertension are the result of two major steps, the narrowing and stiffening of the vessels, which leads to decreased blood flow to different organs and body parts. This causes the heart to work harder to pump blood, which can damage the heart over time. When pressure in vessels is high, there are increased stresses applied to the vessel wall by the blood flowing through it. As a result of this, the muscle in the wall thickens and the lining of the vessel becomes injured, which allows fatty plaques to develop.


Both of these events cause narrowing and stiffness, which results in decreased blood flow. When a body part has decreased blood flow, it does not receive the oxygen and nutrients it needs, and the tissue can get injured and even die. This difficulty in getting the blood to certain areas of the body can be measured with your blood pressure.Other common complications of hypertension include heart failure, kidney problems, and eye problems.

, You need to take your blood pressure to see if it is high. To know if it is, you need to understand how to read blood pressure numbers. Blood pressure consists of two measurements, the systolic blood pressure (SBP), which is the blood pressure while your heart is beating. This number goes above the diastolic blood pressure (DBP), which is the blood pressure while your heart is resting between beats. Normal SBP is below 120, and normal DBP is below 80. This means for most people that you would want your blood pressure lower than 120/80.


A blood pressures of 120 to 139 / 80 to 89 is considered prehypertension. Stage 1 Hypertension is 140 to 159 / 90 to 99 and Stage 2 Hypertension is 160 or higher / 100 or higher., Blood pressure varies regularly throughout the day. It is lower when you sleep and rest, and rises if you are excited, nervous, or active. For this reason, diagnosis of abnormal blood pressure is made only when elevated blood pressure is seen during at least three doctor’s visits, spaced over a period of weeks to months.


You may have isolated systolic or diastolic hypertension. Whichever number puts you into the highest stage is the diagnosis you will be give. For example, if your blood pressure is 162/79, you have Stage 2 Hypertension.
Anyone actively taking prescribed medication for high blood pressure is defined as having hypertension, regardless of their blood pressure measurements.Your doctor may recommend checking your blood pressure outside of his office, such as at the drug store, health department, or by using a blood pressure cuff at home.

, There are two categories of hypertension, primary or essential, hypertension and secondary hypertension. Primary hypertension develops gradually over many years. The cause of primary hypertension is generally multi-factorial and it is strongly associated with several independent risk factors. These include increased age, due to the stiffening and narrowing of the arteries over time that happens as you get older.


Weight gain and obesity is a major risk factor. In early disease, it is the result of increased cardiac output as your body has to work harder against increased weight. Overtime, fat and sugar metabolism is disrupted, which leads to increased blood pressure. Diabetes and dyslipidemia are also diseases of dysregulation of sugar and fat metabolism, respectively, similarly leading to increased risk of developing hypertension.
Primary hypertension is significantly more common in those people who have parents with hypertension. Studies have shown that possibly up to 30 percent of blood pressure variation is due to genetics.
Other risk factors of primary hypertension include stress, depression, race, high sodium intake, excessive alcohol consumption, and physical inactivity., Secondary hypertension does not occur over time as a result of lifestyle choices. Instead, it occurs in response to an underlying medical condition. These include kidney problems, because your kidneys are in charge of regulating the composition of fluid in the blood and secreting excess water. Both acute and chronic kidney disease can cause dysfunction, leading to excess fluid retention, increased blood volumes, and the development of hypertension.


Adrenal gland tumors can secrete hormones that affect heart rate, contraction of blood vessels, and kidney function, possibly leading to an increase blood pressure.
Other conditions that lead to secondary hypertension are thyroid problems, obstructive sleep apnea, certain medications, illegal drug use,
In some rare cases, children are born with congenital defects and malformation of the large blood vessels. As a result, blood flow is disrupted and hypertension can develop., There are certain situations when you need to seek emergency medical help for your hypertension. The dangers of prolonged high blood pressure can lead to cardiovascular disease, kidney injury, and damage to eyes and peripheral nerves. This damage can lead to serious health problems and death through heart attack and stroke. even if you make every effort to control hypertension using lifestyle changes, natural remedies, and medical help, you may not be out of the water. Know the signs for heart attack and stroke so that you can seek medical attention immediately.


The symptoms of a heart attack include pain or a heavy feeling in your chest, pain in your arm (especially on your left side), stomach, back, or jaw, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, sweating, lightheadedness, dizziness, and fatigue.Stroke symptoms include sudden feelings of numbness or tingling, weakness or paralysis in your face or extremities, vision changes, trouble speaking, confusion, trouble understanding others, and severe headache.Signs of malignant hypertension include blurred vision, anxiety, confusion, decreased alertness, decreased ability to concentrate, fatigue, restlessness, sleepiness, stupor, lethargy, chest pain, cough, headache, nausea or vomiting, numbness of the arms, legs, face, or other areas, reduced urine output, seizure, shortness of breath, and weakness of the arms, legs, face, or other areas."

Keep the skin near the surgical site clean.",How to Deal with a Growth Plate Fracture," A child with a fracture will have pain that persists, and tenderness over the site of the injury. They will not want to move the injured part, and will cry out if someone tries to move it. There may be swelling and sometimes there will be a deformity, such as an abnormal crookedness to a bone, or a bony bump or lump that normally isn’t there. The child may avoid putting weight or pressure on the injury.;
, In most cases you cannot tell if a fracture includes a growth plate fracture by merely looking at it. One can be suspicious if the injury is located where growth plates lie. For long bones, such as in the arms and legs, the growth plates are near the ends of the bones. he tibia, for example, is the larger bone that runs from the knee to the ankle. The growth plates of the tibia are near those joints, and not in the middle section of the shin.

If your child is experience signs of a fracture in the area where a growth plate may be located, this will need to be confirmed with an x-ray.

, Keeping the injured part raised can help the pain. Have your child place an ice pack on the fractured area as often as needed throughout the day. This can reduce the pain and swelling until the child can be seen at a medical facility.Wrap the ice pack in a towel before placing it on the skin to minimize the risk of frostbite.
Let the ice sit for 20 minutes as tolerated every couple of hours. Do this until you get medical treatment.

, If your child has signs or symptoms of a fracture, describe what happened and what you have noticed about the site of injury and how the child is behaving. It is best to be seen at the doctor’s office as soon as possible, in a day or two at the latest. Waiting too long, say, more than a week, can allow a fracture to begin to heal. If the growth plate was fractured, too, that may cause deformity later on.


Take your child to an emergency medical facility if you cannot get into your doctor quickly, or if the pain is severe.

, The only definitive way to diagnose a growth plate fracture is with an X-ray or other imaging procedure. Your doctor or local hospital can assess the severity of the break and suggest the best treatment.The medical professional may order X-rays or an MRI to better assess the fracture and determine the best treatment., Once the doctor knows that the child has a fracture — and that it includes or extends into a growth plate — they can determine how best to treat it. Some fractures need splinting and some need casting. In some cases a doctor will need to reduce the fracture, which means manipulating the broken bones back into place (under local or general anesthesia).The most severe breaks may need surgery to move broken segments back into their proper locations and keep them there, perhaps with pins, screws or plates attached to the surface of the bone.
Properly treated growth plate fractures usually turn out well.

, Your doctor will give you instructions about what care your child needs after the fracture has been diagnosed and treated. Your doctor may advise certain restrictions on activities, and may recommend medications for pain. Ice applications or elevation of the injured part may be recommended, but it depends on the exact type of fracture. If your child has a cast or splint, be sure to get instructions on how to care for the type of cast or splint used.

, A fracture can present challenges in doing daily activities. In fact, they may even prevent healing or cause additional swelling and pain. Make sure your child knows not to push themselves and that they can rely on family members and friends to help whenever they need it. This can relieve any discomfort and minimize the risk of further injuring themselves.


For example, they can ask a friend to take notes or type written work.

, If you are unable to get your child to a doctor, and cannot get an X-ray done, it will be hard or impossible to know whether or not a growth plate is fractured. One can make a splint at home, which will keep the injured part from moving too much. This may help the pain and, as the injury heals, any fracture will probably heal eventually – in the correct position or not.


For a fully grown adult, who does not have any active growth plates, this might not be too serious; however, an undiagnosed or incorrectly treated growth plate fracture can be very bad for children, especially young ones, because the bone may become deformed over the following months and years.

, It can take several weeks to recover from a growth plate fracture. This is especially true if they have a cast or surgery. Giving your child at least a few weeks — and in some cases even longer — to heal can ensure that the injury doesn’t cause problems in the future. This may require follow up visits with the doctor for a year or longer., Part of allowing the fracture to heal is taking care of any casts or surgical sites. Casts hold the fractured area together and reduce pain, swelling, and muscle spasms. It’s important to protect them to help promote proper healing. This includes inspecting your child's cast, keeping it dry, and leaving in padding.Wrap your child's cast in heavy plastic when they shower or bathe. Consider putting a washcloth around the edges of the cast to prevent water from seeping inside. This can also prevent skin irritations or infections.
Make sure your child steers clear of dirt, sand, and powder so that it doesn’t get into their cast. These can cause irritations and infections.
Leave any padding intact. Call your doctor if it is bothering your child.
Do not allow your child to itch under their cast with items such as coat hangers, which can break their skin. If rough edges are causing the itching, don’t break or trim them off without talking to your doctor.

, Your doctor or surgeon will provide specific site care instructions to follow. Depending on how severe your fracture and surgery were, your child will need at least six to eight weeks to recover. During this time, it’s important to treat the surgical site gently. This includes keeping it clean and watching for signs of infection. Nursing the site can promote healing and prevent infection and irritation.Wash your hands with soap and water before touching the surgical site.Dry your hands with a clean towel., This may be once a day or more often. Loosen any tape and gently remove the bandages. If it gets stuck, wet it and try again. Put the old dressing in sealed trash and set it aside. Wash your hands again before putting on new dressings.

, Use mild soapy water or a saline solution to clean the skin around the surgical wound. Try to flush away all drainage and any dried blood that has built up around the skin. Use a syringe, or irrigator, to wash out the wound if the doctor recommends it.


Avoid putting skin cleansers, alcohol, peroxide, iodine, lotion, cream or herbal remedies on the surgical site unless your doctor instructs you to do so. These can damage wound tissue and slow healing.
Watch for signs of infection including swelling, redness, and foul-smelling drainage.Let your doctor know if your child's skin seems to be irritated or possibly infected.

Increase the amount of fresh produce in your diet.,
Switch to organic foods as much as possible.,
Keep junk and processed food to a minimum.,
Cut back on the fat in your diet.,
Avoid sugar and sugary foods.,
Limit red meats and meats in general.,
Include legumes in your diet.,
Eat plenty of fish.,
Reduce your salt intake.,
Go nuts about nuts and go bananas for bananas.,
Control your portion sizes.",How to Treat Atrial Fibrillation Naturally1," Eat more fruits and vegetables. Fruits and veggies contain high levels of antioxidants which may protect against heart disease in general.Choose brightly colored fruits and vegetables for the highest level of antioxidants. These include berries (blueberries, raspberries), apples, plums, oranges and citrus fruit (vitamin C is an excellent antioxidant), leafy green vegetables, squash, and bell peppers.


Fresh produce is best, but frozen vegetables and fruits can also be used if that's what available or if the fruit or vegetable is not in season.
A good rule of thumb is to make sure that half of your plate is fruits and vegetables.
Avoid eating vegetables in any sort of creamy sauces that may add fats to your diet. You should also avoid fruits that have sugar or are accompanied by a heavy syrup (with added sugars).
Note that reduced amounts of fresh fruit and vegetables have been associated with heart disease.The United States Department of Agriculture recommends that adult women should eat about 2.5 cups of vegetables per day and adult men should eat 3 cups per day.;
, Produce and foods labelled ""organic"" contain no pesticides or other chemicals like hormones and antibiotics that may be related to an increased risk of heart disease.


If you can't afford to buy all organic foods, stick to the foods that you consume heavily and those that are more likely to be sprayed by pesticides, such as fruits and vegetables, like lettuce greens, spinach, strawberries and other berries, and so on.

, Oily food, saturated fatty food, junk food, fast food, processed food, and food with MSG are all examples of known trigger factors for atrial fibrillation. If you are used to consuming any of these in large quantities on a daily basis, then stopping all of them at once is the best option. If you want to determine the one culprit, you may try stopping any one, one at a time and observe the effects.Limit the amount of processed and prepackaged food you because the additives and preservatives in such foods not only lack vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients, but can also cause adverse health reactions.
Stick to complex carbohydrates. If you avoid processed foods, you have essentially included only complex carbohydrates, since the processing of food breaks down the carbohydrates into the simple carbohydrates. High amounts of simple carbohydrates increase the risk of diabetes and heart disease.A good rule of thumb is that if the food is too white (e.g., white bread, white rice, white pasta, etc.), it has been processed. Instead, eat whole grain breads, brown rice and whole grain pasta.It may take some extra practice and planning, but the closer you can get to cooking from scratch, using whole foods that have NOT been processed (and therefore retain most of the vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients) the healthier you (and your heart!) will be.

, The American Heart Association recommends that you cut back all trans fats and limit saturated fats to less than 7% of your total daily calories. The best way to reduce saturated fats in your daily life is to avoid cooking with butter, margarine and shortening. Use olive oil or canola oil instead.Make a concerted effort to avoid fat by, for example, trimming the fats off any meats and getting rid of skins on poultry, for example. Substitute low-fat alternatives, such as salsa or yogurt for a baked potato instead of fatty butter.

, Avoid sugar and sugar substitutes including aspartame (Equal, NutraSweet), acesulfame potassium (Sunett, Sweet One), high fructose corn syrup (HFCS is believed to increase obesity and the risk of diabetes and heart disease), neotame, saccharin (Sweet’n Low) and sucralose (Splenda).


Limit the sugar that you add to things, including your coffee in the morning or on top of your cereal at breakfast.Avoid sodas and fruit juices, which are loaded with sugar (even the diet ones, which use a chemical substitute instead of sugar).
If you still need some sweetness, try using the herb stevia (Truvia) to give some extra sweetness but with no additional calories.

, Opt instead for poultry, fish, low-fat dairy products, and eggs to get your protein fix. If you do eat red meat, make sure the beef is lean (preferably grass fed as this meat has the natural ratio of omega-3 and omega-6 fats), and the poultry is skinless.It's best to buy organic, locally sourced meat whenever you can. You want to choose meat (red meat but also poultry) that is raised without hormones or antibiotics.

, Legumes include foods like lentils, peas, and beans and contain many of the vitamins (eg. B vitamins) and minerals (Magnesium, Calcium) needed to help maintain healthy heart function. Legumes are excellent sources of protein that are also low-fat.Many of these foods, such as black beans, chickpeas, soy beans, are also complete proteins, meaning that they provide all of the nine essential amino acids required for human dietary needs.

, Fish is another excellent source of protein that is also low-fat. Cold water fish, such as salmon, herring, and mackerel, contain high levels of omega-3 fatty acids that have been proven to be healthy for the heart by lowering blood fats called triglycerides. Try to incorporate fresh cold water fish into your 2-3 times a week.You can also find alternative sources of omega-3 fatty acids in flaxseed, walnuts, soybeans, and canola oil.
Be aware that higher omega-3 fat intake is associated with a decreased risk of heart disease., Controlling how much salt you are consuming on a daily level can help some people control their blood pressure.Recommended salt intakes vary, but you should aim for between 1500mg - 2300 mg of sodium per day.


Be sure to read all food labels carefully. The Food and Drug Administration requires food producers to note how much salt is in a product and what percentage that makes of your daily recommended intake of sodium.
Avoiding processed foods like canned soups and other prepared meals can help you reduce your salt intake. Instead, make more of your own food at home and from fresh ingredients!

, Eat a small handful of almonds (10 to 12 per day), but stay away from peanuts and cashew nuts, especially the salted variety. Almonds, due to their high content of vitamin E, have a relaxing effect on the muscle fibres of the heart.Bananas – due to their high potassium content – are known to lower blood pressure. Their serotonin content acts as a mood elevator, mimicking the natural serotonin in our bodies, thus making the body less responsive to stress that could worsen the fibrillation. Eat a banana a day., Food and drinks, in any form, natural or junk – if consumed beyond the required quantity at one go – is also bad news for your heart. Overeating diverts the blood circulation from the heart to the stomach and that causes the heart to feel inadequacy in being able to transport the electrical impulses. In other words, arrhythmia will rear its ugly head.


Being more aware of your portion sizes may also help you lose weight, which can reduce your risk of heart disease.To start, try using smaller bowls or plates to help limit your portions while also tricking your mind. A full plate always looks more appetizing.Track how much your eating by becoming aware of serving sizes. A serving size is a the amount of food (measured in cups, ounces, or pieces) you should be eating according to FDA guidelines. For example, one serving of pasta is 1/2 cup, or about the size of a hockey puck, while a single serving of meat ranges from two to three ounces and is roughly the size and thickness of a deck of cards. It will take time to learn appropriate portions so you may want to start training your mind by using a scale and/or other measuring instruments.Note that restaurants typically give much larger portions of food than we should actually be consuming during a given meal.

Add more B vitamins to your diet.,
Eat small, low carb meals.",How to Treat Low Blood Pressure2," Drinking fluids can help keep you hydrated so that your blood will pump through your body and help keep your blood pressure up. Water is always a good way to stay hydrated. You can also drink sports drinks that contain sodium and potassium.Avoid drinking alcohol because it will dehydrate you.

, Salt can help keep your blood pressure elevated by helping with the retention of fluids. Talk to your doctor about adding salt to your diet. Never add salt to your diet if you have hypotension without a doctor’s recommendation., Anemia, which can be caused by a lack of red blood cells, can lead to low blood pressure. Low B12, especially in elderly and very thin people, can cause hypotension. Certain B vitamins can help you produce red blood cells and increase your blood pressure. Consider increasing your intake of foods full of vitamin B12 and folate.B12 can be found in meats, such as beef liver, grass-fed beef, sardines, tuna, salmon, shellfish, and lamb. You can also find it in dairy products, like cottage cheese, eggs, and raw milk.B12 can also be given in monthly shots or taken in supplement form. However, the uptake time of B12 found in supplements is very slow.
Folate can be found in beans and lentils. Green vegetables also have folate. Try spinach and other dark leafy greens, asparagus, lettuce, and broccoli. You can also find folate in avocados and cauliflower., Eating smaller meals more frequently through the day can help reduce dizziness and keep your blood pressure level. Make your meals low in carbohydrates. Don’t try to do too much after the meals. Rest and take it easy so your blood pressure doesn’t drop."

Sit down when you feel faint.,
Move around slowly.,
Keep the blood circulating in your legs.,
Increase the amount of time you are upright.,
Stay cool.,
Exercise regularly.",How to Treat Low Blood Pressure3," Low blood pressure commonly causes fainting, lightheadedness, and dizziness. Knowing when you may faint can help you deal with the symptoms before you faint. When you start to feel light-headed, sit down and place your head between your knees.You can also lie down when you feel faint.

, Standing up too fast can cause your blood pressure to drop, which can lead to dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting. If you know you have low blood pressure, you should make sure to always stand up slowly.When you are lying, sitting, or standing for too long, your blood pressure can drop. Move very slowly when you are transitioning from any of these positions.
Make sure to stand up slowly when you first wake up in the morning. You can sit on the end of the bed and rotate your ankles and move your feet. Do the same with your wrists and hands before you stand up.

, The blood circulating through the legs helps keep your blood pressure at a normal level. Your doctor may recommend that you use compression socks or stockings. These items apply pressure to your lower legs, which helps blood circulate through your body.You should also avoid crossing your legs when you are sitting down. This can cut off the circulation in your legs, which can lower your blood pressure.

, If you have a medical condition that keeps you lying for long periods of time, your blood pressure may drop when you sit up or stand. Try to slowly increase the amount of time that you sit upright and stand to get used to it., Being too hot can make your blood pressure drop. Stay cool and out of the heat. Place fans around your room and keep the thermostat at a cool temperature. Avoid direct sunlight if possible.Don’t take hot baths or showers. The hot water can cause your blood pressure to drop. Instead, take lukewarm baths.

, Staying physical and exercising helps your circulation by getting your blood to flow and strengthening your heart. Cardio workouts help exercise your heart. Yoga poses and routines help improve your circulation.Make sure to talk to your doctor before starting a new exercise plan if you have blood pressure problems.

Be moderate with caffeine consumption.,
Limit alcohol consumption.,
Quit smoking.,
Reduce your stress.,
Do moderate exercise.,
Do yoga.,
Do breathing exercises.",How to Treat Atrial Fibrillation Naturally2," Coffee, chocolate, caffeinated tea, energy drinks, cola drinks, teas and anything else with caffeine should be limited Although for a long time, researchers believed that coffee was a trigger for AFib and recommended avoiding all caffeinated beverages and foods, more recent research has challenged the link between caffeine and AFib.Researchers who tracked 30,000 women found no difference in AFib risk between women who drank lots of caffeine and women who drank the least amounts of caffeine.Caffeine can, however, increase your blood pressure and heart rate, which could trigger AFib. Try to be more conscious of how much caffeine you drink. Stick to one to two cups (as in small mugs, or four ounce cups of coffee) per day and be aware that most commercial retailers, such as Starbucks, sell their coffee in large portion sizes; even a ""short"" Starbucks coffee is already eight ounces.What you should also do is cut back on any sugar that accompanies caffeinated foods and beverages.

, Alcohol, in any form, should be reduced, but does not have to be completely avoided. Just be cautious about how much you are drinking and only drink in moderation. Women should limit themselves to one drink per day and men to a maximum of two drinks per day. Note that one drink is considered one beer (12 oz), one glass of wine (5 oz) or one mixed drink containing 1.5 oz of liquor.Don't drink every day. Try to have two to three days a week where you don't consume any alcohol.Heavy drinking increases your risk of AFib. Some research suggests that for every drink you have on top of the recommendation, your risk increases by 8%. In addition, heavy drinking can cause problems if you already have AFib and increases your risk of having an AFib episode. Large amounts of alcohol can also increase the likelihood of bleeding among those taking blood-thinning medications., If you smoke and have been diagnosed with AFib, then you should quit immediately. Smoking causes the heart to beat faster and lowers the amount of oxygen in the blood, which in turn causes additional damage to the heart and increases the likelihood of an AFib episode.Quitting smoking, although it isn't easy, is worthwhile because it will benefit your overall health.

, There is some evidence suggesting that both immediate and more long-term stress can bring on episodes of AFib.It is thus important that you take steps to counter and avoid stress.



Meditation, breathing exercises, yoga, are all stress management techniques that can help you combat the stress effectively. Whatever works for you, do it.
Make time to relax for at least an hour each day, especially in the morning and in the evening before bed. Everyone needs time to recharge their batteries. This may mean reading a book, playing a game, or just spending time with family., Moderate exercise is usually fine for most people because it helps reduce your risk of heart disease as well as regulate your biological rhythms and help you sleep better and maintain a healthy weight. However, you need to discuss your specific situation with your cardiologist before engaging in any exercise if you have AFib. Your doctor will likely recommend that you avoid strenuous exercise to avoid a high heart rate (which can cause an AFib episode) and give you a goal heart rate during exercise and and a time limit on how long to maintain it.If you experience an episode of AFib during exercise, stop and notify your physician for advice.
Strenuous or vigorous exercise that raises your heart rate significantly should be avoided.
If you're concerned about exercising, Stretch regularly instead. Do stretching exercises and warm up exercises that one would normally do before a rigorous workout – minus the actual workout. This can be done for 5 to 7 minutes once a day. It'll warm up your muscles and get your blood flowing without the stress on your heart.

, This is one of the most powerful tools that will work at the level of both the mind and body. Avoid strenuous yoga such as power yoga or aerobic yoga. Basic yogic breathing techniques and simple asanas, or postures, can be performed with ease.Yoga will also help you meditate and de-stress yourself.


Avoid postures like shirshasana (standing on your head) that brings the blood flow of the body to the brain rather than the heart. Asanas such as ‘downward dog’ are known to be useful for Atrial Fibrillation.

, Every day, twice a day, sit or lie down comfortably with your legs propped up (to bring blood flow to your heart). Inhale deeply for a count of four and watch or feel your belly inflate and rise. Then, exhale through your nose or mouth for the same count of four. Make the inhalations match the exhalations in length and imagine a consistent wave of breath and oxygen moving through your body. Try doing this even for 5 minutes a day. This can help calm and slow the heart beat if you're experiencing palpitations or a rapid heart beat.If your mind wanders while you breathe, try focusing on counting your inhalations and exhalations.

Talk to your doctor.,
Take fish oil supplements.,
Try magnesium, potassium, and calcium supplements.,
Take supplemental Coenzyme Q10 if on statin drugs.,
Get vitamin D. Vitamin D is best obtained from a free source, such as sunlight.,
Consider a taurine supplement.",How to Treat Atrial Fibrillation Naturally3," Only consider supplements after you have consulted with your primary care physician. Some supplements may cause adverse reactions in your specific case, so consult a health professional before undertaking a trip into the realm of vitamins and minerals.


Note that there are some supplements that may benefit individuals with heart disease, though not specifically for AFib.
Be aware that the best way to get vitamins, nutrients, and minerals is through food. Supplements should only be considered as a secondary measure.

, If you are not consuming fish directly, you can try taking fish oil capsules or cod liver oil capsules that contain heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids. This essentially helps to reduce your risk of of blood clots and thereby worsening of atrial fibrillation.You should take 2,000-8,000 milligrams in liquid or tablet form in separate doses daily. Consult your physician as to the appropriate dosage for you specifically.

, These three minerals can reduce your risk for irregular hearth rhythms.Magnesium and potassium are both essential minerals in the muscle contraction process of the heart as well as normal functioning of the heart. Magnesium can be taken as a single dose of 400 milligrams per day to begin with and then its effects should be observed as magnesium can cause diarrhea. The dose should not exceed 900 mgs per day. Consider taking a B-vitamin complex with the magnesium as vitamin B6 is needed for optimal absorption of magnesium into your cells.Potassium supplements that contain 4.7 grams of potassium are a good choice to take every day.Calcium is important for strong bones and teeth and may lower blood pressure and the risk of strokes.You should take calcium in individual doses of no more than 500 mg during the day to a maximum of 1,000 to 1,200 milligrams. Drink at least 6 cups of water with each dose to avoid constipation., Coenzyme Q10 or CoQ10 as it is popularly known is known to be naturally occurring and highly concentrated in the heart muscle. It helps fulfill the energy need of the cardiac muscle which has a high energy requirement.However, if you're taking statin drugs to reduce cholesterol, this can decrease cellular levels of CoQ10. As a result, many physicians now recommend patients taking statins to take supplemental CoQ10, although research is still being done to confirm a link between supplemental CoQ10 and reduced adverse effects of statins. Talk to your physician about whether this is an option for you.The dosage of CoQ10 can range from 22 to 400 milligrams per day, but the most common dose is 200 milligrams per day., Spend 10-15 minutes in the sun three times a week (without any sunscreen) and you should be getting sufficient vitamin D. Vitamin D is important for heart health, bones, and teeth and also helps build a strong immune system.Vitamin D is a vitamin stored in your fat tissue, so it is possible to get too much. Get your levels tested; levels of 50 nmol/L or above (20 ng/mL or above) are sufficient. However, if your vitamin D levels are less than 30 nmol/L (12 ng/mL), then these are too low and you should consider a vitamin D supplement. Start with a vitamin D supplement with 1000 IU per day. Consult your doctor about the appropriate dosage.

, Taurine is one of the free amino acids found in the heart and, along with magnesium and potassium, is considered the ""essential trio"" for treating nutritional deficiencies connected with AFib. Taurine is the most abundant and important amino acid in the heart because it helps to regulate the enzymes in the heart that help the contractility of the cardiac muscles.Take 3,000 milligrams in separate dosages with food each day.Note that certain food additives can reduce naturally-occurring taurine in the body, including monosodium glutamate (MSG) and aspartame, the artificial sweetener in many diet sodas and snacks."

Understand the complications.,
Diagnose an enlarged heart.",How to Treat an Enlarged Heart1," There are many diseases that can cause an enlarged heart. These include heart valve or heart muscle disease, arrhythmia, weakening of the heart muscle, fluid around your heart, high blood pressure, and pulmonary hypertension. You can also develop an enlarged heart after thyroid disease or chronic anemia. It can also be due to a build up of excess iron or abnormal proteins in your heart.


Other situations have been associated with an enlarged heart. An enlarged heart can be caused by pregnancy, obesity, nutritional deficiencies, stressful life situations, certain infections, the ingestion of certain toxins such as drugs and alcohol, and taking some medications.;
, There are certain individuals who are at risk for an enlarged heart. If you have high blood pressure, blocked arteries, congenital heart disease, valvular disease, or have had a heart attack. You are also at risk if your family has a history of enlarged hearts, since they tend to run in families.


Your blood pressure must be above 140/90 for it to be considered high enough to be a risk factor for an enlarged heart., Although it is not a disease, there are symptoms that some people with an enlarged heart suffer. An irregular heart beat, shortness of breath, dizziness, and coughing are some of the symptoms of an enlarged heart. Your symptoms may also vary, depending on the underlying cause of your enlarged heart.


You should see your doctor immediately if you have chest pain, shortness of breath, or fainting spells., There are multiple complications that can arise from an enlarged heart. You can be more susceptible to blood clots and cardiac arrest. You may also have persistent heart murmurers, which are due to friction during the flow of blood and disrupt the rhythm of your heart. If it is left untreated, an enlarged heart can also lead to sudden death.


If you have an enlarged left ventricle, which is considered a severe case of an enlarged heart, you are at risk for heart failure., There are multiple ways that your doctor can diagnose your enlarged heart. The first step is typically an x-ray, where your doctor will look at the size of your heart. He may also perform an echocardiogram or an electrocardiogram if the x-ray is not conclusive. He may also perform a heart stress test, a CT scan, or an MRI.


He will then run tests to figure out the underlying cause of your enlarged heart, which will help him come up with the best way to treat it."

Understand the risk factors for angina.,
Know how angina is diagnosed.",How to Treat Angina," Smoking is one of the major risk factors for angina. This is because smoking can damage and tighten blood vessels, resulting in high blood pressure. When the blood flow is blocked because of these narrowed vessels, it can lead to chest pain and even death. Therefore, giving up smoking is the first step towards treating angina.


Giving up smoking can be very difficult, and it may not be possible for long-term smokers to go cold turkey. Therefore, you should try gradually weaning yourself off cigarettes, and experiment with quitting aids like nicotine patches and nicotine gum.
For more information on how to quit smoking, see this article.;
, Feeling stressed out or upset can trigger chest pain. Therefore, it is important to minimize your overall stress levels and to avoid situations that risk triggering your angina.


If you work in a high-stress job, consider delegating some of your responsibilities, cutting back your hours or even taking some time off.
You can also reduce stress levels using relaxation techniques and exercises, such as meditation, deep breathing and yoga. Consider signing up for classes in your local area.

, Chest pain may be caused by over-exerting yourself physically. As a result, you'll need to become more of aware of your body and learn to recognize the warning signs of oncoming chest pain during exercise pr physical activity.


If you feel chest pain coming on, stop what you are doing immediately and take some time to rest. Sit down, catch your breath and wait for the warning signs to pass.
This doesn't mean that you should cut out exercise completely - in fact, exercise is an important part of keeping your heart healthy. You just need to learn to recognize your limits.

, Following a healthy diet is one of the most important things you can do to treat angina and keep your heart healthy. This means eating a diet that is rich in fruit and vegetables, high in fiber and low in cholesterol.


Eating whole grain foods is important, as whole grains are high in fiber (which lowers cholesterol) and help you to feel fuller for longer, which prevent the chest discomfort brought on by overeating.
In terms of protein, you should opt for low cholesterol animal products, like lean meat and skinless turkey or chicken.For more information on eating a heart-healthy diet, see this article.

, If you are currently overweight, it's a good idea to try to lose a few pounds. Losing weight will reduce the workload on your heart and also help to lower blood pressure.


Lose weight by eating a healthy diet (as recommended in the step above) and cutting out processed foods, high-calorie foods and foods high in trans fats. You should also limit your alcohol intake, as alcohol is high in exercise.
Try to incorporate 30 minutes of mild to moderate exercise into your daily routine. Activities like brisk walking, swimming, cycling, dancing and gardening will all help you to lose weight and keep your heart healthy.

, Nitrates are the medicines most commonly used to treat angina, as they help to relax and widen the blood vessels. This allows more blood to flow to the heart, while reducing the heart's workload.


Nitrates can be administered in two main forms: by taking nitroglycerine tablets orally, or by wearing a nitroglycerine transdermal patch on your skin.

, One of the most important aspects of angina treatment is lowering cholesterol levels. High cholesterol is one of the major contributing factors to heart disease. There are several types of medications that may be prescribed to lower cholesterol, such as:


Statins (atorvastatin or simvastatin)
Bile acid sequestrants (cholestyramine or colesevelam)
Nicotinic acid (niacin)
Ezetimibe

, This herbal treatment is said to increase blood flow and is much less toxic than the pharmaceuticals currently in use.


The standard dose is 500 milligrams per day, but it's important to speak to your physician before trying this remedy, to ensure that it won't react with your other medications.
Taking an amino acid supplement called L-carnitine can also help to improve metabolism in the heart muscle. The recommended dosage is 1,000 milligrams, twice a day

, Oxygen treatments are usually administered at the onset of an angina attack, to increase the oxygen supply to the heart and reduce pain. The oxygen is provided through a nasal prong. The doctor will monitor the patient's heart rate and respiration rhythm to ensure that the treatment is working.

, If lifestyle changes and medicine cannot control angina, a patient might need surgery to treat the underlying heart disease. The most common medical procedures used to treat angina are:


Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty. This procedure is indicated for patients with one or two vessel diseases and normal LV function.
Coronary Artery Bypass Graft. This procedure is indicated for patients with significant left main coronary artery disease, two or three vessel diseases and LV dysfunction or diabetes mellitus.

, During an angina attack, the patient suffers pain that is normally experienced in the chest behind the sternum but can also be felt in the neck, jaw, throat, back, left shoulder, abdomen, left wrist and left arm.


The pain can be described as knife-like or stabbing and is often accompanied by sweating and breathlessness. However, angina may also be experienced as sensations of pressure, heaviness, squeezing, burning, or choking.An angina attack should usually only last for about one or two minutes. However, if the chest pain persists for more than ten minutes and is not relieved by rest, it is possible that you are experiencing a heart attack. If this happens, you should seek medical assistance,

, There are several common risk factors which may indicate that a person is more prone to angina. These include:


High blood pressure
Being overweight
High cholesterol
Not getting enough exercise

, Diagnostic tests used to detect angina include the following:



Graded exercise stress testing: This is the most widely used test for the evaluation of patients presenting with chest pain. It can be performed alone or in conjunction with an echocardiography or a myocardial perfusion scintigraphy.Coronary artery calcium scoring by fast CT: The primary fast CT methods for this application are electron-beam CT and Multidetector CT.

Participate in a stress test.",How to Treat a Leaking Heart Valve," For example:



Aortic valve leak: In the case of an aortic valve leak, the severe leak can also be treated with blood pressure medicines known as vasodilators. Medications used for congestive failure - such as diuretics - are also very useful.

Mitral valve leak: This type of leak usually causes no problems. However, people who are suffering from a serious mitral valve leak (which sometimes leads to congestive cardiac failure) may need surgery.

Tricuspid valve leak: This type of leak can cause more serious problems. The leak occurs as a result of high blood pressure in the pulmonary artery, leading to congestive cardiac failure. In this type of valve leak, most medications are not useful but diuretics and water pills can be used to treat swelling. However, the best method of treatment is surgery where the leaking valve is replaced with a healthy one.

Pulmonary valve leak: This type of valve leak is usually treated by targeting the cause of the problem. For example, medications may be prescribed in order to lower blood pressure.;
, The main objective of these medications are to control the elevation of blood pressure as well as to prevent blood clot formation that can worsen the condition, and to increase the pumping action of the heart.

, This medication functions by helping the heart to compress harder, so that more blood is pumped around the body.


It works directly on the heart muscles, slowing down the heart rate and increasing the contraction force of the heart muscles. This makes each heartbeat more effective in pumping blood around different areas of the body.
The recommended maintenance dose of digoxin ranges from 125 to 500 mcg (0.0125 to 0.5 mg) once daily.

, These medications prevent blood clots from forming in your heart (which can cause heart attack or stroke) by interrupting the process of clot formation. They target the clotting factors which are crucial to the blood-clotting process. The most common anticoagulants are:


Enoxaparin (Lovenox). This works by inactivating thrombin, a substance which holds the platelets together to clot the blood. The recommended daily dose for adults is 40 mg injected subcutaneously (injected into fatty areas of the body such as the arm and the abdomen).
Warfarin (Coumadin). This works by blocking the body’s production of vitamin K, which is necessary for the blood clotting process. The dosage and administration of warfarin depends on the patient’s INR (International Normalized Ratio, a test for blood clotting) response to the drug.

, An elevated cholesterol level can worsen heart valve problems as high levels of cholesterol can contribute to narrowing of the heart valves. Statins are used to lower blood cholesterol levels.


Statins work by blocking the action of a chemical in your liver that is necessary for the production of cholesterol. High levels of cholesterol in the blood can narrow the blood vessels and cause blood clots.
Examples of statins are simvastatin, atorvastatin, fluvastatin, mevastatin and rosuvastatin. Statins come in varied doses that range from 5 milligrams to as much as 80 milligrams.

, These medicines work by blocking the action of a hormone that is responsible for constricting or narrowing the blood vessels.


As a result, the blood vessels may dilate or relax and open up. In this case, the blood can easily flow through the vessels, which in turn reduces blood pressure.
The most commonly prescribed ARB is losartan. The recommended daily oral dosage is 25 to 100 mg in 1 to 2 divided doses.

, Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitors. These medications work by inhibiting the conversion of Angiotensin I to Angiotensin II, which is a potent vasoconstrictor (responsible for constricting or narrowing of blood vessels).


As a result, the blood vessels may dilate or relax and open up. Then the blood can easily flow through the vessels, which in turn reduces blood pressure.
The most prescribed ACE inhibitor is captopril. The recommended daily dosage is 25 to 150 mg orally, 2 to 3 times per day, one hour before meals.

, These medications work to lower the heart rate by blocking the hormone epinephrine (also known as adrenaline) which is responsible for increasing the heartbeat.


As a result, the blood vessels may dilate or relax and open up. In this case, the blood can easily flow through the vessels, which in turn reduces blood pressure.
The most prescribed beta-blocker is metoprolol. The recommended dosage is 100 to 450 mg/day orally.

, These medications cause the kidneys to remove more sodium and water from the body. This helps to relax the blood vessel walls and lowers blood pressure.


Examples are potassium-sparing diuretics, thiazide, quinazoline and loop diuretics. The most commonly prescribed are thiazide diuretics such Chlorothiazide.
The recommended daily oral dose is 500 – 1000 mg given in 1 to 2 divided doses.

, These drugs keep blood pressure low and ensure proper blood flow through the heart. This is very important for the proper functioning of heart valves.


These medications also stabilize the muscle tissue and regulate the heart rate. They include Flecainide, Sotalol and Dofetilide.

, These medications decrease pressure on the heart and ensure that the blood flows in a forward direction. Nitrates are the important vasodilators used in the treatment of heart problems. They include hydralazine with isosorbide dinitrate, isosorbide mononitrate, Isotrate, Isonate and Isordil.


Isonate can improve the heart's condition. It is also used to relieve chest pain. This drug relaxes the blood vessels to improve blood flow. It is taken by placing one tablet under the tongue and allowing it to dissolve.
Isordil also belongs to the group of nitrates that are used to treat heart problems. It is used orally.
Isotrate is also used to relieve chest pain caused by heart disease. It should be taken just before exercise, once or twice daily by mouth. The first dose should be taken after waking and the second dose 6 to 7 hours later.

, Any surgical intervention or catheterization procedures to treat leaking heart valves will depend on the specific type of heart problem.

, Heart surgeons repair heart valves by separating the fused valve flaps, reshaping or removing tissue for better closure of the valves or by adding tissue to patch tears or holes or to increase the support at the valve’s base.

, If the heart valves cannot be repaired, the faulty valve is replaced with a man-made valve or biological valve made from pigs or cows.

, During a valvuloplasty procedure, a thin tube is inserted through a blood vessel to reach the heart. A balloon is then inflated in order to widen the constricted valve so that blood flow can increase.

, It is essential to quit smoking if you suffer from a leaking heart valve. This is because the nicotine present in tobacco can cause narrowing of the arteries in the heart. It can also cause problems with the flow of blood. Quitting smoking helps to reduce or even eliminate these issues.

, A low-fat diet helps to reduce cholesterol levels and keep the heart strong. It also decreases the risk of diabetes and helps to reduce blood pressure. In fact, a low-fat diet is recommended for anyone suffering from any kind of heart issue.

, Regular exercise keeps the heart healthy and reduces the risk of diabetes, high cholesterol, blood pressure and other health problems. Recommended exercises include regular walking, swimming and cycling. These exercises do the following:


Lower blood pressure
Improve cardiovascular disease
Increase bone strength
Improve blood circulation
Reduce body fat

, Take care of your teeth and gums to reduce the risk of infection. Gingivitis is an infection caused by poor oral hygiene, which causes the gums to become swollen and inflamed.


The bacteria within teeth can cause chronic inflammation of gum line. Though it may seem surprising, this chronic inflammation can cause serious heart disease. This is because oral bacteria enters into blood stream and attaches itself to fatty plaques lining the blood vessels in the heart.
In this way, the built-up bacteria obstructs blood flow, causing heart problems such as leaking heart valves. In fact, people with gum disorders have double the risk of developing heart problems than those without. That’s why it's important to brush your teeth twice a day and to floss regularly.

, Since leaking heart valves can be inherited, your doctor will ask you questions about the occurrence of the disease in your family.


If your parents or siblings have a leaking heart valve, then you are more susceptible to acquiring the condition.
Also, the doctor will ask you if you were born with any conditions that affect the heart’s structure.

, This test uses sound waves to generate images of the heart. It assesses the four chambers of the heart to diagnose and monitor a leaking heart valve.


During the procedure, the patient will lie on an examination table. The technician will then apply a lubricant or a Vaseline-like gel to the chest of the patient. A transducer or a device that resembles a computer mouse will be placed on the chest and will be moved back and forth.
The transducer sends sound waves to the chest and these waves will eventually bounce and be interpreted by a computer. This creates a two-dimensional image of the heart.

, An electrocardiogram is a procedure used to record the electrical activity of the heart.


Electrodes are attached to the skin of the patient which transmit impulses through waves into a monitor, which in turn is printed on a special paper.
This helps physicians to recognize heart rhythm problems as well as any damage to the heart.

, Generally, physicians order a blood work-up to measure levels of various substances in the body that may be suggestive of a heart problem. A blood work-up can also be used also to eliminate other conditions that may possibly be causing the existing symptoms.

, During this procedure, a thin catheter is inserted into the groin and inserted through the blood vessels of the heart.


The amount of pressure within the heart chambers is measured to determine the level of force of the heart when pumping blood.
Images of the heart arteries can also be collected during this procedure to check for any obstruction or blockage.

, During a cardiac CT (Cardiac Computerized Tomography) scan, patients lie flat on a table inside a doughnut-shaped machine called a gantry. An X-ray tube installed within the machine then rotates around the patient’s body and gathers images of the chest and the heart.


In a cardiac MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging), patients are positioned flat on a table inside a long tube-like machine that utilizes magnetic field and radio waves to generate impulses that produces images of the heart.
Through these images, the doctor can assess whether the patient has a leaking heart valve or not.

, A stress test is performed to record the functioning of the heart during physical activities. Patients are asked to walk on a treadmill or ride a stationary bike while a specialized device measures the blood pressure, breathing and heart rhythm.

Recognize some of the less common symptoms of heart attack.,
Call emergency services immediately.,
Put the person in a seated position, with knees raised.,

Initiate CPR if the person stops breathing.",How to Treat a Heart Attack," Some heart attacks are sudden and intense and provide no warning signs or tell-tale symptoms.However, in most cases, there are at least subtle clues that usually get rationalized or marginalized. Early warning signs of heart disease include high blood pressure, sensation of chronic heartburn, reduced cardiovascular fitness and a vague feeling of malaise or being unwell. These symptoms may start many days or weeks before the heart muscle gets damaged enough to become dysfunctional.



Symptoms in women are particularly hard to recognize and are ignored or missed even more often.
Major risk factors for heart disease, heart attack and stroke include: high blood cholesterol levels, hypertension, diabetes, obesity, cigarette smoking and advancing age (65 years and older).A heart attack doesn't always lead to cardiac arrest (complete heart stoppage), but cardiac arrest is always indicative of heart attack.;
, Most heart attacks do not occur suddenly or ""out of the blue."" Instead, they typically start slowly with mild chest pain or discomfort that builds over many hours or even days. The chest pain (often described as intense pressure, squeezing or achiness) is located in the center of the chest and can be constant or intermittent.Other common common symptoms of heart attack include: shortness of breath, cold sweats (with pale or ashen skin), dizziness or lightheadedness, moderate-to-severe fatigue, nausea, abdominal pain and a sensation of severe indigestion.Not all people who experience heart attacks have the same symptoms or the same severity of symptoms — there's lots of variability.
Some people also report feeling a sense of ""doom"" or ""impending death"" that is unique to the heart attack experience.
Most people experiencing a heart attack (even a mild one) will collapse to the ground, or at least fall against something for support. Other common causes of chest pain don't typically lead to sudden collapse.

, In addition to the tell-tale symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath and cold sweats, there are some less common symptoms characteristic of myocardial infarction that you should be familiar with in order to better gauge the probability of heart failure. These symptoms include pain or discomfort in other areas of the body, such as the left arm (or sometimes both), mid-back (thoracic spine), front of the neck and/or lower jaw.Women are more likely than men to experience less common symptoms of heart attack, particularly mid-back pain, jaw pain and nausea/vomiting.
Other diseases and conditions can mimic some of the symptoms of heart attack, but the more signs and symptoms you experience, the greater the likelihood your heart is the cause.

, Act immediately and call 9-1-1 or other emergency services in your area if you suspect someone is having a heart attack. Even if they don't display all or even the majority of the signs and symptoms, calling for medical help is the most important action you can take for someone in severe distress.Emergency medical services (EMS) can begin treatment as soon as they arrive and are trained to revive someone whose heart has completely stopped.


If you can't call 9-1-1 for some reason, ask a bystander to call and give you updates as to the estimated arrival of emergency services.
Patients with chest pain and suspected heart attack who arrive by ambulance usually receive faster attention and treatment at hospitals.

, Most medical authorities recommend sitting a suspected heart attack sufferer down in the ""W position"" — semi-recumbent (sitting up at about 75 degrees to the ground) with knees bent.The person's back should be supported, perhaps with some pillows if at home or against a tree if outside. Once the person is in the W position, then loosen any loose clothing around his neck and chest (such as his necktie, scarf or top buttons of his shirt) and try to keep him still and calm. You may not know what's causing his discomfort, but you can reassure him that medical help is on its way and that you'll stay with him at least until that point.


The person should not be allowed to walk around.
Keeping a person calm while having a heart attack is certainly a challenge, but avoid being too chatty and asking lots of irrelevant personal questions. The effort required to answer your questions may be too taxing to the person.
While waiting for emergency help, keep the patient warm by covering him with a blanket or jacket.

, People with a history of heart problems and angina (chest and arm pain from heart disease) are often prescribed nitroglycerine, which is a powerful vasodilator that causes large blood vessels to relax (dilate) so more oxygenated blood can reach the heart.Nitroglycerine also reduces the painful symptoms of heart attack. People often carry their nitroglycerin with them, so ask if that's the case and then assist the person in taking it while waiting for emergency personnel to arrive. Nitroglycerin is available as little pills or a pump spray, both of which are administered under the tongue (sublingually). The spray (Nitrolingual) reportedly is faster acting because it's absorbed quicker than the pills.


If unsure of the dosage, administer one nitroglycerine pill or two pumps of the spray under the tongue.
After administration of nitroglycerine, the person may become dizzy, lightheaded or faint soon after, so make sure she is secured, sitting down, and not in danger of falling and hitting her head.

, If you or the heart attack sufferer has any aspirin, then administer it if there's no indication of allergy. Ask the person if he has an allergy and look for any medical bracelets on his wrists if he has trouble talking. Provided he is not younger than 18 years old, give him a 300 mg aspirin tablet to chew slowly.Aspirin is a type of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that can reduce heart damage by ""thinning"" the blood, which means preventing it from clotting. Aspirin also reduces associated inflammation and helps reduce the pain of heart attack.


Chewing the aspirin allows the body to absorb it faster.
Aspirin can be taken concurrently with nitroglycerine.
A dose of 300 mg is either one adult tablet or two to four baby aspirins.
Once at the hospital, stronger vasodilating, ""clot-busting,"" anti-platelet and/or pain relieving (morphine-based) drugs are given to people experiencing heart attacks., Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) involves chest compressions in order to help push some blood through the arteries (especially to the brain) combined with rescue breathing (mouth to mouth), which provides some oxygen to the lungs.Keep in mind that CPR has its limitations and doesn't usually trigger a heart to start beating again, but it can provide some precious oxygen to the brain and buy some time before emergency services arrive with their electrical defibrillators. Regardless, take a CPR class and at least learn the basics.


When someone starts CPR before emergency support arrives, people have a better chance of surviving a heart attack or stroke.
People not trained in CPR should only do chest compressions and avoid rescue breathing. If the person doesn't know how to effectively deliver rescue breathing, she will simply be wasting time and energy by improperly administering breaths that are not effective.
Keep in mind that time is very important when an unconscious person stops breathing. Permanent brain damage begins after four to six minutes without getting oxygen, and death can occur as soon as four to six minutes after enough tissue is destroyed."
"
Change the way you eat.,
Work out.,
Reduce bad habits.,
See your doctor often.",How to Treat an Enlarged Heart2," One of the main ways you can reduce the effects of an enlarged heart and help combat the underlying causes of the condition is through diet. You should eat foods low in saturated fats, sodium, and cholesterol. You should incorporate more fruits, vegetables, lean meats, and healthy proteins into your diet.


You should also drink 6-8 8 ounce glasses of water a day.Try eating more fish, green leafy vegetables, fruit, and beans to help lower your cholesterol and sodium levels and reduce your blood pressure.
You can also ask your doctor for a diet plan that is best suited for your particular situation.

, Put more physical activity into your daily routine. Depending on what underlying condition you have, your doctor may recommend different kinds of exercise. He may suggest light aerobic and mild cardiovascular exercise such as walking or swimming if your heart is too weak to take too much stress.


He may also suggest your do more intense cardio and strength training such as bike riding or running as you get stronger or if you need to lose a decent amount of weight.
Always consult your doctor before undertaking any physical activity, especially with a heart condition.
Combining eating right with exercise will help you lose weight, which is very beneficial for many of the underlying causes of an enlarged heart., There are certain bad habits you should avoid or quit all together when you are diagnosed with an enlarged heart. You should quit smoking immediately because it adds strain to your heart and blood vessels. You should also avoid drinking excessive amounts of alcohol and caffeine because they make your heart beat in an irregular rhythm and put a strain on the muscle.


You should also try to get at least 8 hours of sleep a night in order to help regulate your heart beat and replenish your body every day., As you go through your recovery, you need to see your doctor often. This way, he can keep a close watch on the state of your heart and let you know if your condition is better or worse.


Your physician will also be able to tell if you are responding to treatments or if you need to seek more advanced options for treatment."
"
Discuss medical device options with your doctor.,
Consider heart valve surgery.,
Ask about other surgeries.",How to Treat an Enlarged Heart3," If an enlarged heart causes severe heart failure or significant arrhythmia your doctor may suggest you get an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). The ICD is a matchbox-sized device that helps the heart maintain its normal rhythms through electrical shocks.


Your doctor may also suggest a pacemaker to help coordinate the contractions of your heart., If an impaired valve caused an enlarged heart, then your doctor may suggest replacement surgery as an option. During this procedure, the surgeon removes the narrowed or damaged valve and replaces it with another one.


These valves can be a tissue valve from a deceased human donor, a cow, or a pig. You may also receive an artificial value as well.
Surgery may also be necessary to repair or replace a leaky valve, also known as valve regurgitation. This condition, which also contributes to an enlarged heart, causes blood to leak out through the valve backwards., If your enlarged heart is due to diseased arteries you may need to have coronary stents or coronary artery bypass graft surgery to fix your heart. If you have experienced heart failure due to your enlarged heart, your doctor may suggest you have surgery to implant a left ventricular assist device (LVAD). This device will help your weak heart pump properly.


The LVAD can be a long term treatment for heart failure or as a life saving measure while you wait for a heart transplant.
Heart transplants are considered the last resort for an enlarged heart and are only considered when all other options have been ruled out. It is not easy to get a heart transplant and the waiting process can take years."
"
Take angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors.,
Treat heart tissue scarring with diuretics.,
Use beta-blockers.,
Ask your doctor about other medication.",How to Treat an Enlarged Heart4," When you are diagnosed with a condition that causes an enlarged heart, your doctor may prescribe you ACE inhibitors. If a weak muscle in your heart contributed to your condition, ACE inhibitors are used to help restore your heart's normal pumping functions. The medication can lower blood pressure as well.


Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) are prescribed as an alternative medication for patients who have trouble tolerating ACE inhibitors., If you have an enlarged heart, especially if it due to cardiomyopathy, your doctor may prescribe diuretics. These medications help lower the levels of water and sodium in the body and help decrease the thickness of your heart muscles.


This medication may lower blood pressure., If a major symptom of your enlarged heart is high blood pressure, your doctor may prescribe beta-blockers. This will depend on your overall condition. This medication helps to improve blood pressure and lessens abnormal heart rhythms in addition to lowering your heart rate.


Other medications such as digoxin also help to improve the heart's pumping mechanism. This can help you avoid hospitalization due to heart failure., Depending on the cause of your enlarged heart, your doctor may also prescribe other medications to help with your condition. If he is worried that you may be at risk for blood clots, your doctor may prescribe you anticoagulants. These medications reduce the risk of blood clots that can lead to strokes or heart attacks.


He may also prescribe anti-arrhythmics, which are medications designed to help keep your heart at a normal rhythm."

Cut back on fat.,
Reduce your meat intake.,
Eat more fiber.,
Give fruits pride of place.,
Moderate your alcohol intake.,
Exercise regularly.,
Do not push yourself too hard.,
Burn excess calories.",How to Treat Familial Hypercholesterolemia1," If you have FH, the total fat in your diet should be cut back to no more than 30% of your daily caloric intake. For instance, if you consume 1,800 calories per day, you should get no more than 600 calories from fat.Reduce or eliminate fatty foods like meat, milk, cheese, egg yolk, and oils (especially coconut oil and palm oil).
Swap full-fat foods for low-fat options.Replace butter, for instance, with cooking oil spray, a bit of margarine, or canola oil.
Eliminate trans fat from your diet. Foods containing trans fats include most cakes, pies, cookies, biscuits, breakfast sandwiches, margarine, microwave popcorn, crackers, fried fast foods, and doughnuts.;
, Meat — especially pork, lamb, and beef — are high in fat. Eliminate meat altogether or go for leaner cuts like the eye of round and pork tenderloin. If you see fat on your meat — a white, squishy substance that often clings to the meat’s surface — trim it off before eating.Reduce your portion sizes to cut down on meat. 3 ounces — about the size of a deck of cards — is more than adequate. Instead of meat, try eating beans, carrots, potatoes, and other vegetables.
To get started on leaving meat behind, try a “meatless Monday.” On Mondays, avoid eating meat altogether. Once you’ve successfully left meat aside one day per week, increase your meatless days to twice weekly. For instance, you might leave meat out of your meals on Monday and Wednesday. After that, expand to a third day. Continue in this way until you’ve completely eliminated meat from your diet.

, Fiber can reduce your risk of heart disease, a common side effect of FH. Foods high in fiber include nuts, seeds, legumes, whole grains, veggies, and fruits. For instance, you might swap a snack like potato chips for one like crisp apple slices or carrot sticks.Fruits with high fiber levels include blackberries, grapefruits, apples, bananas, pears, and oranges.
Legumes with high fiber levels include peas, lentils, edamame, black beans, and kidney beans.
Grains with high fiber levels include hulled barley, oats, quinoa, bulgur, and whole wheat breads and pasta.

, Research shows that if health foods are close at hand, you are more likely to consume them. Put fruits that do not require refrigeration in a central location on your kitchen counter. For instance, oranges, bananas, melons, papayas, and persimmons could be arranged attractively in a wooden bowl and placed on your counter., Drinking too much alcohol could boost your triglyceride level. Since you’re already at increased risk of high triglyceride levels due to your FH, you should take pains to limit pushing your levels over the edge with excess alcohol consumption.Excess alcohol consumption is also linked to weight gain and obesity, both of which you should protect yourself against if you have FH.
Moderate daily alcohol intake for men is no more than two drinks per day. Moderate intake for women is no more than one drink per day.Remember, these are not daily recommendations. Alcohol consumption is not recommended. If you don’t drink alcohol now, don’t start.

, Regular exercise — especially with the goal of losing weight — is crucial for fighting FH. Doctors recommend at least 2.5 hours of exercise per week.There are many varieties of exercise that could help you, including running, swimming, weight-lifting, and walking.If you have not exercised in a while or if you are overweight, start small and work your way up to a more intense exercise. For instance, walk for about 10 minutes per day at a brisk pace. After a week or so, increase your walk to 15 minutes at the same pace. After another week, add another five minutes to your workout. Continue in this way until you’re pressing yourself and feel tired when you’re done.

, Everyone has a different physical limit. If you exercise at a rate or frequency beyond what you are physically capable of doing, you could injure yourself. Listen to your body to identify what your limit is. If you find you’re unable to lift a certain weight, do not try to lift even more. If you’re panting or gasping for air at the end of a workout, you might be pushing yourself too hard and risking injury., To lose weight through exercising, you need to burn more calories than you consume daily. If you’re consuming 1,800 calories each day but expending only 1,500 calories each day, you will not lose weight. If you’re burning 2,000 calories each day but consuming only 1,800 calories, you will lose weight.Use a fitness tracker like FitBit or an app like MyFitnessPal to monitor how many calories you’re taking in against how many calories you’re expending each day.

Explore medical monitoring options.,
Prepare for surgery if the aneurysm is at least 2 inches (approximately 5 cm).,
Consider endovascular stenting as another option.,=== Treatment for Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm ===

,
Monitor the abdominal aneurysm if it is small and nonthreatening.,
Plan for open repair surgery if the abdominal aneurysm is larger than 2 inches (or approximately 5 cm) and it causes complications, such as bleeding in the body.,
Consider endovascular stent grafting to repair an abdominal aortic aneurysm.",How to Treat an Aneurysm,"


Besides bulging in a specific area of the body, symptoms may include back or abdominal pain, severe headaches, vision changes, nausea, clammy skin, rapid heart rate and speech impairment.;
, The doctor diagnoses the condition based on results from an X-ray, a CT scan or an ultrasound.

, This option applies if the aneurysm is less than 1 inch (3 mm) or if surgery would be risky.

,, Your doctor can help you determine the correct dose for the medication.

, For more serious cases, your doctor may recommend surgical clipping and endovascular coiling may treat a brain aneurysm.


In endovascular coiling, the surgeon inserts a catheter into an artery to disrupt the aneurysm. In surgical clipping, the doctor inserts a metal clip onto the problem area to stop blood flow to the aneurysm.

,, If the aneurysm is small and not ruptured, then the doctor may prescribe beta blockers to lower blood pressure and statins to lower cholesterol.

, In surgery, the doctor will replace the aorta with a fabric graft.

, For this, the doctor uses a small plastic tube to hold open the artery to prevent the aneurysm from becoming worse.

,, The doctor may check the aneurysm every year through an ultrasound to monitor progression.

,


In open repair surgery, the doctor will cut into the abdomen and replace a damaged abdominal vessel with a graft.

, The doctor performs this procedure by inserting a graft without cutting into the abdomen.

Let your doctor know all vitamins, supplements, and medications you are currently on when you are taking any blood thinner.,
Take coumarin-based medications.,
Recognize warfarin side effects.,
Consider alternatives to warfarin that require avoiding bleeding or hemorrhaging accidents.",How to Thin Blood1," Seemingly harmless over the counter medications, supplements and vitamins can affect the blood thinners such as warfarin/coumadin as well as other drugs.
, If you have suffered from any condition or ailment that requires a blood thinner, your doctor will likely prescribe you an anticoagulant, which are medications that target clotting factors. Your doctor may prescribe you a coumarin-based medication, such as coumadin or warfarin. These work to reduce the formation of vitamin K dependent clotting factors in the blood. It is generally taken by mouth once a day, at the same time every day, with or without food.


General side effects include gas, abdominal pain, and some hair loss., If you are on warfarin therapy, you need to be monitored very closely because warfarin is known to cause internal bleeding. You will need weekly blood tests and your dosages will be adjusted based on your results.


Keep your diet consistent when taking warfarin because increased levels of vitamin K can affect your warfarin therapy, make the drug less effective and not able to prevent clots.-- Warfarin also has many drug interactions so tell you doctor every kind of medication or supplement you take.
When on warfarin, avoid eating large or varying amounts of green vegetables, vitamin K rich foods such as broccoli, cauliflower, brussel sprouts, cabbage, kale, spinach, green beans, green tea, liver, and some cheeses. Talk to your healthcare professional about keeping your diet consistent in amount and steadiness with warfarin., Your doctor may prescribe you such oral anticoagulants that are gaining popularity. The advantage with these is that you do not need weekly monitoring and vitamin K intake does not affect their effectiveness. But also vitamin K nor any other product can stop bleeding with the new kinds of blood thinners. If bleeding does occur, unlike warfarin, there is no simple way to reverse bleeding or hemorrhaging. Cauterizing for sealing injuries, and icing for several days that contracts the blood vessels of the injury.


Your doctor may prescribe Pradaxa, which is usually taken by mouth, with or without food, twice a day. Major side effects of Pradaxa include gastrointestinal symptoms such as upset stomach and nausea. Other serious side effects may include hemorrhage, or allergic reaction.Or, you may be prescribed Xarelto. Depending on your particular circumstance, you may be instructed to take this once or twice a day by mouth with food. Side effects of Xarelto include allergic reaction to the medication, bleeding or throwing up blood, dizziness, burning, numbness, tingling, muscle weakness, confusion, and headache.Your doctor may instead prescribe Eliquis, which is usually taken twice a day by mouth, with or without food. Caution should be taken if you notice an allergic reaction, signs of bleeding, dizziness, confusion, headache, joint pain or swelling, chest pain, or wheezing.Another kind of medication is Plavix (clopidogrel) an anti-platelet prescription. It makes blood less sticky and lowers the amount of the ""sticky"" coagulant platelets (which dangerously would stick together to cause clotting and can also cause blockages in blood vessels). There are some common side effects of Plavix: head pain, muscle and joint pain. You may experience some less frequent side effects of Plavix including danger of bleeding, hemorrhage, nosebleeds, etc."

Purchase a stethoscope if you do not already have one.,
You will also need something to keep track of time with in seconds.,
To take your pulse, you will be listening to your heart through your chest.,
Place the earpieces in your ears.,
The piece that goes on your chest is called the chestpiece.,
To position the chestpiece on your chest, find the imaginary line between your nipples.,
Get your timepiece ready to watch; we are now ready to count your heart beat for a given time period.,
Look at the second hand on your watch/clock, and when the second hand hits one of the 5 minute markers start counting the beats through your scope.,
If you counted for an entire minute you are all set and have your pulse, but in most cases we now need to do a little math because pulse values are expressed in beats per minute (BPM).,
All done.",How to Take Your Own Pulse With a Stethoscope," You do not need an expensive one as you are only counting and do not need to listen to quality. Spending a max of 20-30 dollars for the double-tubed ""Sprague"" type will do just fine.;
, A WATCH WITH A SECOND HAND IS MUCH EASIER TO USE THAN A DIGITAL WATCH because you do not have to count the seconds, you can just look at where the second hand should end up on your watch at the end of the time that you want.

, Depending on the quality of your stethoscope you can usually listen through about two T-shirt layers of clothing (just for the beats, not quality). Take any extra heavy clothing off if you cannot hear your heart clearly.

, Note that the earpieces of the stethoscope are usually angled and in order to hear correctly and have them be comfortable you need to place the tips in facing FORWARD, in the direction that you are looking. If they are not comfortable, you may gently bend them forward or backwards to get a good fit.

, Many stethoscopes have chest pieces with two sides that can be rotated around the tubing to better hear high frequency and low frequency lung sounds,a diaphragm and a bell. When one is in use the other cannot be used. With the earpieces in your ears, GENTLY rub the diaphragm side (the one with the flat plastic piece) of the stethoscope and listen for a sound. If you do not hear a sound, turn the chest piece over (you should hear it click into position) and try again. This should resolve any issues.

, You want to put the chestpiece diaphragm side down on that line slightly to your left of center. Experiment to find where you can hear your heart best. If you are having trouble and still cannot find it it may be helpful to lie down while doing this.

, When we listen to the heart, remember that it has TWO beats, which represent the succession of valves in your heart contracting to pump blood (lub-dub lub-dub). HOWEVER ONLY ONE OF THOSE BEATS IS COUNTED IN YOUR PULSE. The first beat is usually stronger and I recommend listening only to that beat and tuning the first one out.

, In a clinical setting we typically count the pulse for 30 SECONDS as this is the minimum that is considered accurate. As mentioned earlier, you do not need to note each time the second hand moves, keeping track of that is too much work! Instead, look at where the second hand WILL end up at the end of 30 seconds. For example, if you start counting at the ""2"" mark, the hand will have passed 30 seconds at the ""8"" marker, or if you start at 12, 30 sec. will be at 6. Stop counting beats when the second hand reaches the marker and 30 seconds have elapsed. If you would like to be even more accurate (because the pulse is not always completely regular), you may count beats for 1 minute.

, You counted the beats for 30 seconds, but as there are 60 seconds per minute you must multiply that by 2 to get beats per 60 seconds. For example, if I counted my pulse at 36 beats over 30 seconds, my pulse would be 72 because 36beats/30seconds = 72beats/60seconds. If, for some reason, you counted beats for only 15 seconds (as we sometimes do in moving ambulances because taking pulses is a PAIN in there), you would need to multiply by 4 as 15 x 4 = 60 = bpm.

, Pulse does fluctuate relatively regularly, but if you think your pulse was unusually high or low (e.g. 15-20 bpm off your normal), you should definitely repeat this process to make sure you were accurate, and repeat successively until your measurements are relatively similar. And that's all there is to it.

Assess your day-to-day function.Aortic regurgitation tends to be a condition that starts out gradually and progresses with time (it may also, however, come on more suddenly in response to a particular and more ""sudden"" problem with your aortic valve, such as an infection).,
Opt for ""watchful waiting.,
Receive periodic evaluations to assess your aortic valve function.,
Consider potential causes.,
Ask your doctor about medications.,
Opt for a ""vasodilator"" medication.,
Take antibiotics if there is worry your aortic valve may be infected.If there is a chance that your valve may be infected, you will be given antibiotic therapy immediately.,
Make lifestyle changes to prevent worsening of your condition.In addition to receiving medical treatments for your aortic regurgitation, your doctor will likely suggest lifestyle modifications to improve your overall heart health.,
Ask your doctor about the indications for surgical treatment.What determines when ""watchful waiting"" and medical treatment is not enough?,
Opt for valve replacement surgery.Valve replacement surgery is the most effective and lasting form of treatment for aortic regurgitation.,
Be put under general anesthesia.For surgery to replace your aortic valve, the first step will be to receive general anesthesia, which will put you ""to sleep"" for the duration of the operation.,
Receive the surgery.The surgery generally takes 3 to 6 hours.,
Take an anticoagulant medication following surgery, if needed.Depending upon the type of aortic valve surgery you received, you may need to be on anticoagulant medications (to prevent blood clots) following surgery, or even for life.",How to Treat Aortic Regurgitation," Either way, the most important thing for your doctor to assess is: how is the damage to your aortic valve affecting your overall heart function, and your ability to manage in day-to-day life? Things that your doctor will ask you about, to help characterize the severity of your aortic regurgitation, include:


How is your energy level?
How is your ability to tolerate exercise?
Do you find you are getting short of breath easily?
Are you experiencing chest pain?
Have you been feeling faint or lightheaded?;
,""If your aortic regurgitation is not causing you significant problems at the moment, your doctor may advise one of two things. He or she may advise a period of ""watchful waiting,"" with no immediate treatment (but continual check-ups to evaluate the state of your aortic valve). Or, he or she may begin you on a trial of medical therapy (medications that can help to reduce symptoms and/or to slow the progression of the disease).


If your aortic regurgitation is severe, however, and causing damage to your heart and/or significantly compromising your quality of life, you will most likely be advised to proceed with surgery as soon as possible.

, The best way to directly assess your aortic valve, and the flow of blood out of your heart (as well as the backflow of blood back into your heart) is by receiving periodic Doppler echocardiograms.An echocardiogram is a type of ultrasound that directly looks at your heart.


The Doppler component allows blood flow to be visualized, which gives your doctor a better idea of how well your aortic valve is functioning.The Doppler echocardiogram can also provide valuable information about the state of health (or disease) of your heart.
It can show things like ""left ventricular hypertrophy"" (damage to the left ventricle of your heart caused by the backflow of blood), among other things.

, There are some conditions that may cause damage to your heart valves and this can lead to developing aortic valve regurgitation. These conditions include:Congenital heart valve disease.
Endocarditis.
Rheumatic fever.
Any disease that can enlarge the aortic valve, such as Marfan syndrome.
A traumatic injury to the chest or to one of your heart valves.

, Minimizing undue stress and strain on your heart by taking medications as needed is an important part of treatment. Some options to discuss with your doctor include:


A statin medication (such as Lipitor, or Atorvastatin) if you have elevated cholesterol levels (this is a risk factor for worsening heart disease).
A blood sugar medication (such as Metformin, or Insulin) if your sugars are in the pre-diabetic or diabetic range, as this is also a risk factor for worsening heart disease.
Blood pressure medications to lower your blood pressure if it is elevated; this is another cardiovascular risk factor.

, A vasodilator widens your blood vessels, reduces blood pressure, and reduces the stress from the backflow of blood on your heart. As such, it can help in the long-term management of chronic aortic regurgitation. An example of a vasodilator is Nifedipine (Procardia)., If the infection is confirmed (or suspected strongly enough), you will likely need to proceed with surgery without waiting any longer.

, Helpful changes may include:


Eating a lower salt diet (which can help with lowering blood pressure)
Eating a balanced diet low in fat (your doctor can provide you with further guidance around a ""heart-healthy diet"")
Exercising, as tolerated (depending upon the severity of your condition)
Quitting smoking

, When are you a candidate for surgery to treat your aortic regurgitation? The following are all things that your doctor will consider when he or she advises you about the possibility of surgery:


If aortic regurgitation is causing significant symptomatic problems - such as chest pain, shortness of breath, fainting, or even the symptoms of heart failure - your doctor will advise that you proceed with surgery.
When aortic regurgitation is causing significant enough backflow of blood to compromise your heart function (and to potentially cause permanent damage to other areas of your heart), you will definitely be advised to proceed with surgery.
Finally, if you have an infection on your heart valve (called ""endocarditis""), you will need surgical treatment.

, There are different ""new valves"" that you can opt for. These include:


A mechanical heart valve, typically made of carbon or titanium.
A biological heart valve, made of human or animal tissue (such as from a pig).
Make sure that you discuss the different valve options with your surgeon. There are pros and cons to each type., You will not feel any pain, and you will not even be aware that the surgery is taking place.


You will also be put on a ""cardiopulmonary bypass machine"" for the duration of the surgery.
This occurs after the anesthetic has kicked in, so you will not be aware of it.
A cardiopulmonary bypass machine is basically a ""heart-lung machine"" that performs the functions that your heart and lungs normally do, for the duration of time that you are on the operating table.

, Most often, you will receive open heart surgery where an incision is made in your breastbone, the replacement of the valve is performed, and you are then sewn back up. You will need to stay in hospital for a few nights following the procedure to ensure a proper recovery.

, Your doctor will be able to guide you about the duration you will need to take them for.


An example of an anticoagulant (anti-clotting) medication is Warfarin (Coumadin).

Start by asking the patient to take off their shirt.,
Feel the first rib by finding the clavicle.,
Count the ribs as your work your way down.,
Draw an imaginary line that runs from the middle of the clavicle on the left side through the nipple.,
Decide between using regular touch or a stethoscope.,
Prepare your stethoscope.,
Place the stethoscope on the spot where you found the apical pulse.,
Count how many lub-dub sets you hear in one minute.,
Find the person’s heart rate.",How to Take an Apical Pulse1," To take the apical pulse, you will need to access the bare chest.
, Feel for the clavicle. The clavicle is also called the collarbone. It can be felt at the top of the rib cage. Directly below the clavicle, you should feel the first rib. The space between two ribs is called the intercostal space.Feel for the first intercostal space—the space between the first and second ribs.

, From the first intercostal space, move your fingers down to the fifth intercostal space by counting the ribs. The fifth intercostal space should be located between the fifth and sixth ribs.

, This is called the midclavicular line. The apical pulse can be felt and heard at the intersection of the fifth intercostal space and the midclavicular line., The apical pulse can be taken by touch or by using a stethoscope. It can be very difficult to feel an apical pulse, especially in women where breast tissue may lie over the pulse. A stethoscope may be easier for this purpose.

, Take your stethoscope from your neck and direct the earpiece outward towards the person. Put the earpiece on your ears and hold the diaphragm (the part of the stethoscope that you place over the person’s heartbeat).


Rub the diaphragm a bit to warm it up and tap it to make sure that you can hear the noises through the diaphragm.

, Tell the person to breathe normally through his or her nose because doing so will decrease the sound of the breath and make hearing the heart easier. You should hear two sounds: lub-dub. This is considered one beat.

, This is the pulse rate, or heart rate. Think about how you might describe the pulse. Is it loud? Forceful? Is the rhythm regular, or does it seem random?

, Be ready with a watch that has a second hand so you can count the pulse rate. Count how many “lub-dubs” you hear in a minute (60 seconds). The normal pulse rate for adults is 60 – 100 beats per minute. It differs with children.With newborns to three years old, the normal heart rate is 80-140.
For four to nine year olds, 75-120 is a normal heart rate.
For 10 to 15 years old, 50-90 beats per minute is the normal pulse rate.

Lower your cholesterol with medication.,
Try other medications.,
Get apheresis.,
Get a liver transplant.",How to Treat Familial Hypercholesterolemia2," Lifestyle changes are typically not enough to overcome your FH. Your doctor will be able to help you lower cholesterol levels by prescribing medications like statins. Statins are a class of drug that can lower cholesterol levels in the blood.Statins commonly prescribed for FH include atorvastatin or rosuvastatin., Aside from statins, there are several other medications that might help your FH. For instance, your doctor might prescribe:Bile acid sequestrant resins. Bile acid sequestrant resins prevent cholesterol absorption into the blood. They cause the liver to use cholesterol to produce more bile acid, thus reducing overall cholesterol levels. Cholestyramine is a common bile acid sequestrant resin.Ezetimibe is a drug given to assist in weight loss and reduce cholesterol levels.Nicotinic acid (niacin), is a concentrated form of B3, a vitamin that can reduce your lipids (fats), including cholesterol.Gemfibrozil, likewise, can lower lipid levels.Fenofibrate is a drug of the fibrate class which can not only lower LDL, but raise HDL cholesterol levels. It might be used alone or in conjunction with statins., In a more rare form of FH — known as homozygous FH (HoFH) — the genes that caused FH come from not one, but both parents. This is an aggressive form of FH and leads o the narrowing and blocking of blood vessels even before birth. Left untreated, LDL levels are four times the normal level and heart attack or sudden death are likely to occur during your teenage years. You may need apheresis, a special process whereby blood or plasma is removed from the body, then filtered to remove LDL cholesterol. Your blood plasma is then returned.If you have HoFH then you need to be under the care of a lipid specialist.
Apheresis — if necessary — may be used in combination with other therapies to control LDL levels in your blood. The process will then be required every two weeks for the rest of your life.You’ll have to visit a hospital or special lipoprotein apheresis center to get apheresis. There is usually no pain or discomfort during the procedure. The whole process takes about one-and-a-half to three hours., In rare situations of HoFH, you may need a liver or partial-liver transplant. The liver makes most of your body’s cholesterol. If you have FH, a faulty liver might mean you’re unable to recycle or regulate your body’s natural cholesterol levels. In such a situation, then a liver transplant may be considered.A liver transplant is a serious operation in which all or part of your liver is removed and you are given a whole or partial healthy new liver.

Recognize the symptoms of FH.,
See a doctor.,
Share information about your family history.,
Get a blood test.,
Get a genetic test.",How to Treat Familial Hypercholesterolemia3," FH has several symptoms, all of which are a result of high LDL levels. These symptoms include angina — the pain in the back, chest, jaw, neck, or arm that results when arteries become narrow due to high cholesterol — and heart attacks, especially at a young age.There are also a number of physical changes you might experience, including xanthomata — cholesterol deposits on the tendons of the backs of your hands or your ankles. These deposits may be as large as a marble and appear orange or yellow in color. They might appear in clusters or as individual specimens.You may also develop a corneal arcus (a white ring around your eye) or grow cholesterol deposits in your eyelids (Xanthelasmas).

, Only a trained medical doctor can accurately diagnose FH. Your doctor might suspect FH based on the symptoms you’ve exhibited, or based on information they know regarding your medical history. In any case, see a doctor if you suspect you have FH.If you suspect you have FH for any reason, see a doctor to get a diagnosis. If diagnosed with FH, you should be treated by a lipid specialist., Using information about a family history of FH or heart attacks could tip your doctor off to the fact that you might have FH. Answer all your doctor’s questions clearly and honestly. If you are unsure about your family’s medical history, tell your doctor, “I am not sure. I will try to find out and get back to you.”High LDL levels in one or both parents are another warning sign that you could have FH.
If you have FH, odds are that at least two others in your family also have FH., Blood tests can determine the cholesterol levels in your body. Since FH causes high levels of LDL cholesterol, if your doctor detects high LDL levels in your blood, you could have FH.Additionally, a blood test can reveal overall high levels of cholesterol and triglyceride levels.Triglycerides are the most common type of body fat. Overall cholesterol — a score that measures your LDL (“bad”) cholesterol against your HDL (“good”) cholesterol — can help doctors learn more about your health.
If you have high LDL as well as high triglyceride levels, or high LDL as well as overall high levels of cholesterol, you’re at greater risk of heart disease.
When getting a blood test, a phlebotomist (someone specially trained to draw blood) or nurse will draw a few vials of blood from your vein. Alternately, you might be able to get a much easier finger prick sample, which can then be analyzed on a desktop analysis setup.In either case, you’ll have to fast for 12 hours prior to having your blood drawn.

, Getting your genes examined is a relatively (75%) accurate way to know whether you have FH, though it is not always affordable or possible.When your doctor sequences your genes, they will find a mutation on chromosome 19, the one that carries information for the LDL receptor protein and clears LDL from the bloodstream.Check the laws in your local area. Some local laws require that genetic test results go to your insurance company or employer. This information could negatively impact your odds of getting a job or insurance. Talk to your doctor before getting a genetic test to find out how the data will be used and who will have access to it.Privacy laws in the U.S. prohibit the sharing of personal medical information, however.

Take baby aspirin carefully.,
Incorporate more exercise.,
Change your diet.,
Drink more water.",How to Thin Blood2," If you have had a heart attack or stroke, or have certain risk factors, your doctor may recommend a daily, 81mg tablet of aspirin. Aspirin thins your blood by preventing blood cells from sticking together, thus decreasing the risk of clots.Be aware, though, that aspirin introduces additional bleeding risks such as a hemorrhagic stroke and GI bleeding.


If you have had stomach ulcers, GI bleeding, or are allergic to aspirin, let your doctor know. If you are taking regularly scheduled NSAIDS such as ibuprofen, you may also increase your chances of bleeding. Let your doctor know before starting an aspirin regimen.
Aspirin may interact with other medications such as heparin, ibuprofen, Plavix, corticosteroids, and antidepressants as well as herbal supplements such as ginkgo, kava, and cat’s claw., Exercise is very important in reducing your risk of heart attack and stroke. Although you cannot undo what damage has been done, you can prevent further complications if you include exercise along with your medication.It is recommended that you exercise 150 minutes a week, which is generally broken up into 30 minutes a day of moderate aerobic activity such as brisk walking.Try to avoid exercise that might cause serious injury, complications, or internal bleeding. Ask your doctor what activities are best given your personal history and the medication you are taking.

, Changing your diet can help to prevent further heart problems. Changing your diet can also enhance the effects of your medication to keep your blood thinner and healthier.


Control your portion sizes by using smaller plates and keeping track of how much food you eat at each meal.
Eat more fruits and vegetables, which are full of vitamins, nutrients, and antioxidants.
Try eating whole grains instead of white flour.
Include good fats, such as nuts and oily fish like tuna or salmon.
Include lean protein in your diet, such as egg whites, low-fat dairy, and skinless white meat chicken.
Eat foods that are low in saturated fat. The foods you eat should have less than 7% of their total calories from saturated fat. You should also avoid trans fats, which should be less than 1% of the foods total calories.
Avoid oily, salty, or greasy food, fast food, and frozen, prepackaged food. Even frozen meals that claim to be healthy contain a lot of salt. Also avoid pies, frozen waffles, and muffins., Water is a great natural blood thinner. Dehydration makes your blood thicker, which causes clumps that turn to clots. Drink more water each day to help thin your blood and keep yourself healthier overall.


Some doctors suggest drinking around 64 ounces of water every day. Other doctors use the formula that, for every pound you weigh, you need to drink half an ounce of water. For example, if you weight 140 pounds, you should drink 70 ounces of water a day.
Don't over-hydrate yourself. Make sure you have plenty of water, but if you feel too full, do not force yourself to drink more water.

Talk to your doctor.,
Do not attempt to self-treat.,
Look for signs of bleeding.",How to Thin Blood3," Conditions such as blood clots, pulmonary embolisms, heart attacks, atrial fibrillation, and strokes are life threatening and serious. If they are not treated properly, you are at risk for recurrence. These conditions require regular check ups and care from a doctor. Under your doctor's care, you may be prescribed a medication to help with thinning your blood as well as a special diet.


Although certain foods may help thicken or thin your blood, do not attempt to use foods or diet to thin your blood.

, If you are at high risk or have had heart issues or stroke, do not attempt to thin your blood by yourself. Diet and other home remedies alone will not prevent clots or heart attacks. Diet and exercise will only help prevent heart disease early on. Once you have heart disease or have had an episode where your blood needs to be thinned, diet and exercise will not be enough to prevent a stroke or heart attack.


Always follow your doctor's advice on diet and medication.

, If you are currently on an anticoagulant, call your doctor or get medical help right away if you develop any signs or symptoms of significant amount of bleeding. These can also be symptoms of internal bleeding, hemorrhage, or other hidden bleeding.


Seek medical attention immediately if you experience unusual bleeding. These instances include nosebleeds that happen repeatedly, unusual bleeding from your gums, and menstrual or vaginal bleeding that is heavier than normal.
If you get injured or experience bleeding that is severe and uncontrollable, get emergency care right away.
You should seek immediate medical help if you show signs of internal bleeding, such as red, pink, or brown urine; bright red, red streaked, or black, tar-like stools; coughing up blood or blood clots; vomiting blood or your vomit looks granular like “coffee grounds; headaches; or feeling dizzy, faint or weak."

Understand that interpreting heartbeats can be challenging.,
Determine if the heartbeat you hear is slow.,
Consider if the pulse you hear is very fast.,
Consider the likelihood that the heartbeat is displaced.,
Notice if the pulse is irregular.",How to Take an Apical Pulse2," Interpreting a pulse, especially an apical pulse, is an art. However, there are many things that one can learn from an apical pulse. These are outlined in the following steps.

, If the pulse rate is very slow, it could be a normal adaptation for somebody who is in good shape. Some medicines also make the heart beat slower; this is especially true for elderly patients.One classic example of this is the class of drugs called beta-blockers (like metoprolol). These are commonly used to treat high blood pressure, and can slow down the heart rate.

, If the pulse rate is very fast, it could be normal for someone exercising. Children also have much higher pulse rates than adults do. It could also be a sign of:


High blood pressure, heart disease, or infection.

, The apical pulse may be displaced (meaning it is to the left or the right of where it should be). Obese individuals or pregnant women may have their apical pulse shifted to the left, as the heart gets displaced with extra contents in the abdomen.Heavy smokers with lung disease may have the apical pulse displaced to the right. This is because with lung disease, the diaphragm is pulled down to get as much air as possible to the lungs, and in this process the heart gets pulled down and to the right.

, The pulse may be irregular. This is commonly seen in older people. The heart sets in own rhythm, and over time the cells that control the rhythm may become tired or damaged. As a result, the pulse may become irregular."
"
Know what a pulse is.,
Understand that pulses can also be analyzed by their shape.,
Know where pulses are found.",How to Take an Apical Pulse3," A pulse is a palpable and/or audible heartbeat. Pulses are most commonly assessed as pulse rate, which is a measurement of how fast an individual’s heart is beating, measured in beats per minute. A normal pulse rate is between 60 and 100 beats per minute. Pulse rates faster or slower than this may indicate a problem or disease. They also may be normal for some individuals.


For instance, highly trained athletes frequently have very low pulse rates, while someone exercising may have a heart rate higher than 100. In both of these cases, the heart rates are respectively lower or higher than one might expect in most situations, but do not represent a problem.

, In addition to the pulse rate, pulses can also be analyzed by assessing the shape of a pulse: is it a smooth beat, or does it seem weak? Is the pulse bounding, meaning that it feels sharper than usual? Weak pulses may indicate that someone has low blood volume in their vessels, making the pulse harder to feel. Bounding pulses might indicate stiffer arteries, as the blood vessels will not be as able to accommodate the increase in blood with the heart’s pumping.

, There are many places on the body where one can feel a pulse. Some of these include:


The carotid pulse: Located in the neck on either side of the trachea, the stiff tube in the front of the neck. The carotid arteries are paired, and carry blood to the head and neck.
The brachial pulse: Located inside the elbow.
The radial pulse: Felt on the wrist at the base of the thumb on the palmar surface of the hand.
The femoral pulse: Felt in the groin, in the fold between the leg and the torso.
The popliteal pulse: Behind the knee.
The posterior tibial pulse: Located at the ankle on the inner side of the leg, just behind the medial malleolus (the bump at the base of the lower leg).
The pedal pulse: On the top of the foot, in the center. This pulse is often difficult to feel.

Practice deep breathing.,
Perform the valsalva maneuver.,
Do the carotid (ka-rah-ted) maneuver.,
Splash yourself with cold water.,
Take medication.",How to Slow Your Heart Rate Down1," Although it may seem difficult, lowering your breathing speed will help to lower your heart rate. Take a breath for 5-8 seconds, hold it for 3-5 seconds, and then exhale slowly for a count of 5-8 seconds. Focus on exhaling completely to reduce your heart rate.





;
, This triggers the vagal nerve which is responsible for controlling your heart rate. To do the valsalva maneuver, after taking a deep breath, strain the muscles in your abdomen the same way you would to give a bowel movement. Hold the pressure for five seconds, and then let go. You may have to do this multiple times to get the desired effect.








, The carotid artery runs down your throat next to the vagal nerve. Give the artery a gentle massage with your fingertips to help stimulate the neighboring nerve into slowing your heart rate down.








, Pour ice water onto your face to stimulate the dive reflex, responsible for slowing down your metabolism. Keep adding ice water to your face until you notice a drop in your heart rate.







, If you experience an incredibly high heart rate frequently over time, you can get a prescription for heart rate lowering medications from your doctor. Set up a meeting with your MD to decide whether medication is the right path for you.

Change your diet.,
Eat a heart-healthy breakfast.,
Consume a lunch that promotes good heart health.,
Eat a sensible, heart-healthy dinner.,
Make your snacks sensible.,
Consume alcohol and chocolate in moderation.",How to Reverse Heart Disease1," Altering your eating habits is a crucial step to improving your heart health. This will also help manage your weight which also affects your heart condition.Change your meals to include more fruit, vegetables, whole grain, fish, and lean meat.
Avoid processed foods that contain high salt and preservatives.;
, A good breakfast that may help with reversing heart disease would include grains and fruit.Try 1 cup (250 ml) of cooked oatmeal topped with a tablespoon (14.7 ml) of chopped walnuts and a teaspoon (5 ml) of cinnamon. Add a banana and a cup (250 ml) skim milk.
Another way to go could be a cup (250 ml) of plain low-fat yogurt topped with three-quarters of a cup (187.5 ml) of blueberries. Drink three-quarters of a cup (187.5 ml) of orange juice.

, A heart-healthy lunch will have a good portion of vegetables along with grains, fruit, and perhaps some low-fat dairy products.A sample lunch might include a cup (250 ml) of low-fat plain yogurt with a teaspoon (5 ml) of ground flax-seed, a half cup (125 ml) of peach halves canned in juice, five Melba toast crackers, a cup (250 ml) of raw broccoli and cauliflower, and two tablespoons (29.4 ml) of low-fat cream cheese (plain or vegetable flavor) as a spread for crackers — or you can use vegetable dip. Drink sparkling water.
Another idea for lunch is a whole-wheat pita filled with a cup (250 ml) of shredded romaine lettuce, a half cup (125 ml) of sliced tomato, a quarter cup (62.5 ml) of sliced cucumbers, two tablespoons (29.4 ml) of crumbled feta cheese, and a tablespoon (14.7 ml) reduced-fat ranch dressing. Add a kiwi and drink a cup (250 ml) of skim milk.

, Your major protein portion can be with this meal, but you still want a balance of grains, fruits, and vegetables.A potential dinner for reversing heart disease might include a 4-ounce (113 g) grilled turkey burger (whole grain bun), a half cup (125 ml) of green beans with a tablespoon (14.7 ml) of toasted almonds, two cups (473 ml) of mixed salad greens with two tablespoons (29.4 ml) of low-fat salad dressing, and one tablespoon (14.7 ml) of sunflower seeds. Add one cup (250 ml) of skim milk and one orange.
Another idea for dinner is a chicken stir-fry including eggplant, basil, a cup (250 ml) of brown rice with a tablespoon (14.7 ml) of chopped dried apricots, and a cup (250 ml) of steamed broccoli. Drink four ounces (113.6 ml) of red wine or concord grape juice.
A little bit of alcohol is okay, but keep it limited.

, You don't want to ruin your heart-healthy diet by snacking on the wrong items.Try a snack such as a cup (250 ml) of skim milk and nine animal crackers.
Another snack idea might be three graham cracker squares and a cup (250 ml) of fat-free frozen yogurt.
Keep healthy snacks such as a fruit so you don't over-eat during meals.

, These two products can help — and hurt — your heart disease condition. If you consume them then you need to do so in moderation.Alcohol sometimes can benefit your heart if you can limit your drinks to one or two per day. Additional drinks will increase your risk of a heart attack, stroke, and raise your blood pressure.
Chocolate has been shown to lower the risk of heart disease in some consumers by nearly 40 percent, and reduced the risk of stroke by 30 percent; however, you should only consume dark chocolates for this purpose. Select small portions of dark chocolates with high cacao content — at least 70 percent.

Choose a measurement location.,
Check the size of the cuff.,
Attach the cuff.,
Inflate the cuff, then take a reading.",How to Take a Dog's Blood Pressure1," There are a couple of options for where to measure a dog's blood pressure. No location is necessarily better than any other; it's largely a matter of what the dog will allow and what is easiest for you to stabilize.The cuff of an automatic device is usually administered around one of the dog's limbs or around the base of the tail.
If using a limb, it's best to measure on the dog's right side at either the forearm (antebrachium) of the front limb or the outside of the hind leg.;
, Before you perform the test, you'll need to make sure the blood pressure cuff fits your dog correctly. A cuff that is too large often produces falsely low blood pressure readings, while a cuff that's too small will yield a falsely high reading.The ideal size for a blood pressure cuff is approximately 40 percent of the dog's appendage circumference.
When you lay the cuff flat against the leg or tail, the edges should be between 25% and 50% of the appendage's circumference.

, Once you've determined that the cuff is the correct size for your dog, you can attach the cuff and proceed in taking a measurement. The cuff should be snug and secure without being too tight. It should be just snug enough that you cannot insert a finger between the cuff and the dog's appendage., Once the cuff is in place, the rest of the test is very similar to that of a human blood pressure measurement. You'll simply activate the automatic device, allow the cuff to inflate, then take the reading that the device gives you. The cuff presses against the dog's artery while inflated, and the pressure inside the cuff gets above the dog's systolic pressure. As the cuff deflates, the machine measures both systolic and diastolic blood pressure.Hold the cuff (attached to the dog's appendage) at chest level on the dog, which should be approximately the height of the dog's heart.The normal systolic blood pressure range is between 110 and 160 mm of mercury (Hg). Normal diastolic blood pressure lies between 60 and 90 mm Hg.A dog has high blood pressure if its systolic blood pressure is consistently above 180 mm Hg.

Check with your doctor to what extent it's okay to exercise vigorously.,
Get plenty of good sleep.,
Empty your bladder regularly.,
Take a fish oil capsule.,
Change your diet.",How to Slow Your Heart Rate Down2," Intense exercise is not the first step, but work up to more vigorous exercise. Short bursts of energetic effort, such as running short dashes, inter-spaced with relaxing to not lose your breath, called interval training, improves your heart's efficiency by about 10 percent more than the usual aerobic exercise done at a steady pace.









Build up until you're performing at your maximum, safe heart rate for the last interval, then you can cool down. Change up your routine periodically -- pace, machine, incline plane, stairs, weights, dance, water, route, hills -- to make your heart pump blood more effectively with fewer beats.

For runners: If you run on a treadmill, use the interval setting. If you run outdoors or on an indoor track, then warm up for 5 minutes. Then run fast for 1 minute and jog slowly for 1 minute. Repeat the interval 6 or 8 times before cooling down for 5 minutes.

For swimmers: Swim ten 50-yard freestyles, resting for 15 seconds between each pair of swims. As you swim, swim aerobically, raising your heart rate but not raising it too much, not swimming too hard so that you become really out of breath.On the bike: Warm up for 90 seconds. Then, pedal at a moderate energy burst for 30 seconds. Slow back down to a cardio rate for 90 seconds before performing another energy burst for 30 seconds. Each 30-second energy burst should be more intense than the last., Wear earplugs, if you need to reduce the noise levels in your room. Sleep disturbances from noise can increase your heart rate as much as 13 bpm.








, People who hold their urine until their bladder is really full will increase their heart rates by as much as 9 bpm. A really full bladder increases sympathetic nervous system activity, which constricts blood vessels and forces your heart to beat faster.








, Even better, take calamari oil which is much richer in DHA, a most important type of omega-3. Dr Oz recommends taking ""daily fish oil or some other source of omega-3 with at least 600mg of DHA"" A single daily fish oil capsule may reduce your heart rate by as much as 6 bpm within as little as 2 weeks. Researchers think that fish oil helps the heart to respond better to your vagus nerve, which regulates your heart rate.







, Eat heart-healthy foods which help your body to regulate its heart rate. Try eating more salmon, sardines or mackerel, whole grains, green leafy vegetables, nuts, and foods high in potassium like bananas and avocados.







"
"
Lie down and relax.,
Concentrate on pleasing mental imagery.,
Learn to meditate.,
Breathe slowly.,
Get a massage.",How to Slow Your Heart Rate Down3," Lie down on a comfortable surface such as your bed or your couch. If there is no comfortable surface to lie upon, then try sitting in a relaxed position.









Make sure that the room is quiet and comfortable. If your view from your window is chaotic, then close your curtains or your blinds.
Relax your muscles. Stay in this position and allow your heart rate to slow at its own pace.

, Calm your mind and body by using guided visualization and imagining places that make you happy. For instance, you can think about a beautiful mural, a scene from nature, or a daydream that you would find relaxing.









Find a print or a photo of something that makes you feel relaxed. You can sit on your bed in a meditative posture and gaze at the picture to try to calm your mind and body.
Write in a journal about a place you love to visit or a place in which you feel very at peace. Then, close your journal and picture the place in your mind, allowing the calm to wash over you.

, Place your internal focus on the beating of your heart. Try to use the power of your concentration to slow down your heart rate.








, Try some of these techniques to use breathing to calm your heart rate:










Abdominal breathing: While you're sitting down, place your hand over your stomach just below your ribcage. Inhale through your nose, allowing your belly to move your hand out while your chest stays still. Then, exhale through pursed lips as though you were whistling, using your hand to push the air out of your belly. Repeat as often as needed.Alternate nostril breathing: Start inhaling through your left nostril, pushing your right nostril closed with your thumb, over a count of 4. Close both nostrils and hold your breath for 16 counts. Exhale out of the right nostril for 8 counts, and then inhale through the right nostril for 4 counts. Hold your breath for another 16 seconds, and exhale through your left nostril for 8 counts. Yoga practitioners believe this brings both sides of your brain into balance and calms your mind and body., Getting a regular massage or reflexology treatment may lower your heart rate by as much as 8 bpm. Pay to have a professional massage, or have a loved one perform a massage on you.

Lose weight.,
Work out daily.,
Lower your cholesterol.,
Control your blood sugar.,
Reduce your stress.,
Use good hygiene techniques.",How to Reverse Heart Disease2," Losing weight through healthy eating and exercise may help reverse heart disease. Losing weight can improve your blood pressure, lower cholesterol, reduce risk of diabetes, and even reverse some heart conditions such as atrial fibrillation.By following recommendations for a healthy diet and incorporating exercise into your daily life you can prevent and possibly reverse heart disease — sometimes even without the use of medication., You don't want to put a strain on your heart and body either, but you want to get your heart pumping as part of a daily routine.Before beginning any exercise program, consult your doctor to make sure it is appropriate.



Quit smoking as well. You need to do this not only for your heart's health but to improve your ability to workout.
Set aside at least 30 minutes to 1 hour of time for working out at least five days a week.
Use most of the workout days for cardiovascular exercises like running, brisk walking, biking, and/or swimming.
Include strength training workouts on two to three days of the week. You only need to do about 20 minutes of strength training to benefit, so you can do these in addition to cardio or on days when you skip cardio.
If you have a busy schedule then find ways to get a workout in, even if you have to break it up. For example, do a 15 minute run in the morning, and then another 15 minutes in the evening.

, You will need to ask your doctor to test your cholesterol levels.If you're already at least 20 years old, then you should consider asking your doctor for a cholesterol test to establish a baseline.
Your doctor will determine what schedule is best for you given your condition, and family history, but get tested at least every five years.
Warning signs in the test, a family history of cholesterol, and/or a family history of heart problems may mean you need to get tested earlier and more often.
Most of the diet changes mentioned in this article also help lower your cholesterol. This would be a diet low in saturated fat, high in fiber, and low in refined carbohydrates.
Exercise, as mentioned in an earlier step, also helps lower cholesterol.
Your doctor may also recommend taking fish oil supplements.

, This is more for those who are diagnosed with diabetes, but the strategies for dealing with the condition are often related to preventing heart disease. Controlling your blood sugar may help prevent or reverse heart disease.Most of the meal options to help with reversing heart disease should help with blood sugar management.
Additionally, your doctor may prescribe a number of forms of insulin in different doses with varying delivery methods, from inhaled to injected. Oral medications, such as tablets and capsules, may be prescribed instead of, or in addition to, insulin. Consult with your doctor closely to monitor drug usage in conjunction with your other conditions.

, It might help to identify some sources of stress if you need help eliminating them.Let anyone at school, work, and home know you have a heart condition and see about getting a reduced workload.
Look into relaxation programs at your local gym, spa, or recreation center. Deep breathing, massages, and muscle relaxation techniques could all be beneficial.
Tackle any bouts of depression with therapy. You might consult with your doctor about recommended psychologists that deal with patients in your physical and mental condition.

, With your heart already in a vulnerable condition you don't want to add to your body's woes by risking infection.Avoid people with infections such as colds, the flu, unidentified rashes, and the like.
Keep up to date with your vaccinations.
Maintain a good washing routine by washing your face, washing hands, showering, bathing, brushing your teeth, and flossing.

Take heart medicine.,
Take angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors.,
Take drugs to correct abnormal heart rhythms.,
Ingest drugs for stroke conditions.,
Control your blood pressure.,
Take medicines that break up blockages in the heart.,
Get heart surgery.,
Recover from heart surgery.",How to Reverse Heart Disease3," If lifestyle changes are not enough to reverse your heart disease, then your doctor may prescribe medication. The prescription will vary greatly with your specific condition.Always take your medicine exactly as your doctor instructs.
The list of medication types that deal with heart disease is extensive. The drugs typically deal with the blood or blood vessels in some way, but a few others handle the disease from other angles such as displacing excess fluid or controlling the heart rhythm.

, These drugs widen (dilate) blood vessels to improve blood flow with the heart and lower blood pressure.


Angiotensin II receptor blockers work to the same effect as ACE inhibitors but do so by reducing certain chemicals in the body. These drugs also reduce some fluid and salt build-up in the body. They may be prescribed if the patient cannot tolerate the cough that is sometimes caused by taking ACE inhibitors.

, These medicines will affect arrhythmia conditions.


These are also called anti-arrhythmia drugs.

, These include blood thinners and aspirin.


Antiplatelet drugs prevent blood clots from forming — a frequent cause of strokes. Since the 1970s, aspirin has been used to prevent and manage heart disease as well as strokes. Warfarin (Coumadin) is an anticoagulant. It helps prevent blood clots from forming like other blood thinners.

, There are several drugs that regulate blood pressure to prevent heart disease or reverse it.


Beta-blockers are drugs that treat high blood pressure (hypertension) and congestive heart failure.
Calcium channel blockers relax blood vessels to increase blood and oxygen flow to the heart without increasing stress on the heart muscle.
Diuretics (water pills) remove water and salt through urination. This eases the heart's ability to pump blood and regulates blood pressure.

, These drugs help with blood flow and coronary artery disease.


Thrombolytic therapy is usually given by hospitals through the veins (intravenous/IV) to break up blood clots. Sometimes they are called ""clot busters.""
Digoxin can help a damaged heart to regain some efficiency with pumping blood.
Nitrates (vasodilators) are used to treat angina (coronary artery disease or chest pain) caused by blockages of blood vessels in the heart.

, If your doctor determines that your lifestyle changes combined with medication are not enough to reverse your heart disease condition, then surgery may be the next step. There are a number of procedures available for heart disease cases, and recovery after heart surgery can take six to eight weeks of closely monitored care after discharge from the health care facility.You may get a stent. Stents are small metal mesh tubes that can expand once in place in the artery. There are several types of angioplasty you could get instead, and stents are among them. In all cases a thin plastic tube is surgically inserted into the problem artery with a catheter. Next, the artery is expanded and the blockage removed.
Similar to a stent is an ablation. Ablation involves inserting a tube or directly cutting into your heart's blood vessels and intentionally scarring the tissue to get the heart to restart its beat to correct irregular rhythms.
Receive coronary artery bypass surgery. The surgeon will take a blood vessel from another part of the body and graft it onto the heart to give the blood another path to flow. This is one of the most common surgeries to correct heart disease.
Ask your doctor about procedures for heart arrhythmias. Most of these procedures involve electrical stimulation of the heart muscle to correct the rhythm.

Pacemakers are small devices that send electrical impulses to the heart to control the heart's rhythm.
Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD) directly monitor and stimulate your heart rate.
Other electronic device correctives include enhanced external counter-pulsation (EECP) to cause blood vessels to develop branches, and create a natural bypass around problem arteries that angina (chest pain). It works by attaching blood pressure cuffs to both legs to compress blood vessels there until the branch vessels form then releasing the cuffs quickly.
A left ventricular assist device (LVAD or VAD) is a partial mechanical heart inside the chest and helps pump oxygenated blood throughout the body. But it is not a full replacement for the heart.


Receive heart transplant surgery. This is the replacement of one's diseased heart with the healthy heart from a deceased donor.

, If you have heart surgery, then you will need to take great care in your efforts after discharge from the hospital or care center. Recovery can last six to eight weeks.Pay close attention to any instructions, lists, and medication given to you by your doctor and the hospital/care facility.
You may have some pain or discomfort around the surgical incision area. This is normal and you should be given a prescription for pain before leaving for home.
If you have any pain in the legs, especially for bypass surgery (usually leg veins are used for the graphs), try walking more for daily activities to lessen discomfort.
Driving may be unsafe immediately after surgery. You might have to wait the six to eight week period if this was a major operation — though it could be shorter if the operation was not as invasive. Riding in vehicles is fine.
You want to gradually resume your normal activities, but do not strain yourself. Resume household chores, but avoid remaining standing for more than 15 minutes at a time. Do not lift objects heavier than 10 pounds. Also don't push or pull heavy objects. Stair climbing should be okay unless your doctor says otherwise. Ask your doctor or assigned therapist for instructions on exercise.
A poor appetite is to be expected after surgery, but you should resume your heart-healthy eating habits unless otherwise instructed by your doctor.
Keep in frequent contact with family and friends to avoid stress and depression.

Choose a spot to take the measurement.,
Trim the fur over the necessary sites.,
Attach the cuff and connect it to the device.,
Apply acoustic gel to the Doppler probe.,
Inflate the cuff and take a reading.",How to Take a Dog's Blood Pressure2," Much like the automated device test, the doppler method requires you to choose a location to place the cuff. You can measure a dog's blood pressure on either its right front forearm, the outside of its right hind leg, or the base of the tail., Whichever site you choose to take a measurement, you'll need to trim some of your dog's fur to get a more accurate reading. You shouldn't have to shave the fur, but you will need to carefully trim it down as short as you can safely get it without accidentally cutting your dog.If you're using the right front forearm, trim the fur over the palmar metacarpal artery (just above the joint that hinges and leads to the paw, or the equivalent of an elbow).
If you're using the right hind leg, trim the fur over the plantar metacarpals (the outside of the equivalent to a shin).
For both the front and hind legs, you'll need to trim the fur under the paw (which is where the Doppler will be applied). You can use either paw, but the fur must be trimmed down between the pads of the paw.If using the base of the tail, trim the fur over the underside of the tail.

, Once you've trimmed the fur, you're ready to attach the cuff to your dog's appendage. The cuff should be attached snugly and in place around the chosen appendage. It should not be too tight, but it should be snug enough that you cannot slide a finger under the cuff.Connect the cuff to the sphygmomanometer to the cuff. Its base reading should show a pressure of 0 mm Hg.

, You will need to use acoustic gel with a Doppler probe. Acoustic gel is essentially the same gel used by doctors to perform an ultrasound.The acoustic gel should be applied to the concave side of the Doppler probe, as this is the surface that will be placed against the skin.
Once the gel has been applied, press the probe firmly against the skin above the chosen artery.

, With the cuff and Doppler probe in place, you're ready to take a reading. The Doppler probe works by inflating the cuff until blood flow is restricted in your dog's artery, then measuring the pressure at which blood flow is audible again.The limb should be held approximately level with the dog's heart. This should be roughly at chest level if the dog is lying on its side.
Inflate the cuff to about 20 mm Hg higher than the anticipated systolic blood pressure. You should not hear any whooshing sounds (arterial pulsations) at this pressure.
Let the cuff slowly deflate and mark down the pressure at which you can hear the whooshing sounds again. This figure is the systolic arterial blood pressure.

Learn about common underlying conditions.,
Help your dog lose weight.,
Schedule follow-up visits with your vet.",How to Take a Dog's Blood Pressure3," There are a number of conditions that could cause hypertension in dogs.Some, like obesity, can be treated with dietary and lifestyle changes. Others may require medication or even surgery to treat. Some common conditions that can cause high blood pressure include:


chronic renal disease
glomerular disease
endocrine disease
Cushing's disease
diabetes mellitus
acromegaly
adrenal tumor
polycythemia
obesity

, Your dog's nutrition doesn't directly cause any health conditions that would lead to high blood pressure. However, a diet high in fat may cause your dog to become obese, which is a common cause of hypertension.Check the nutritional label on your dog's food and any treats you commonly give your pet.
Look for foods that are low in fat. You may want to consider restricting your dog's sodium intake as well.
Give your dog plenty of exercise. Take your dog for at least one 30 minute walk each day, but be sure to bring plenty of water for your pet.
Consider measuring and restricting how much food you give your dog with each meal. You can find charts that will help you determine your dog's ideal caloric intake by searching online.

, If your dog has been diagnosed with high blood pressure, you'll need to schedule regular checkups with your veterinarian. Your vet will need to monitor your dog's progress over time and may recommend further dietary changes or medication.Dogs with high blood pressure should have their blood pressure checked by a vet every few months.
Your vet may recommend one or more medications, either to dilate the blood vessels (to lower your pet's blood pressure) or to treat the underlying condition causing hypertension.Which medication your vet recommends will depend on how high your pet's blood pressure is and what underlying condition(s) your dog has.

Aerobics, swimming, and team sports are some other activities that will improve heart health. If you already have heart disease, get help from your doctor in establishing an exercise routine.

, Secondhand smoke contributes to heart disease.

, While the link between stress and heart disease is controversial, stress can lead to other bad habits--like smoking, poor dietary choices, and excess alcohol consumption--even if it doesn't cause heart disease on its own. Look for healthy ways to deal with stress, like meditation and calming exercise. Make time to relax and enjoy hobbies.

, Moderate alcohol intake, 2 drinks for men and 1 drink for women each day, is acceptable, but heavier consumption can lead to heart disease and high blood pressure. A glass of red wine would be the best option.

Recognize signs of common forms of cardiovascular disease.",How to Reduce Job Related Heart Disease Risks," Every job causes some amount of stress, and stress isn’t necessarily a bad thing. A little stress can give you extra focus and drive, but too much can cause a range of physical and emotional problems. If work stress is affecting your performance or health, your first step should be to identify its causes.Consider the following common causes, for instance: low salaries; excessive workloads; limited opportunities for growth or advancement; lack of challenging work; lack of support; lack of control; conflicting demands; unclear expectations; fear of job loss; increased overtime requirements; poor relations with a fellow worker or workers.
Try keeping a “stress journal” for a week or two. Jot down a note every time you experience a stressful episode, so you can track what exactly is causing you the most stress and how you respond.
You can also relieve stress through ""belly breaths,"" or abdominal breathing. The ""fight or flight"" response you have to stress can raise blood pressure and increase your risk for heart disease. To do ""belly breaths,"" lie down and bend your knees. Breathe in deeply and let the air expand your stomach fully. Breathe out slowly through your mouth or nose. Repeat.;
, Some sources of job stress cannot be avoided — trying to save lives as a surgeon, or making sales when you rely on commissions, for instance. To better manage your unavoidable work stress, you need to clear away the stressors you can avoid.First and foremost, you need to learn to let go of things over which you have no control. If you can’t do anything to stop possible downsizing or transfer a really annoying and distracting coworker, what good does it do to become severely stressed about them?
Use your ""stress journal"" to help identify all your stressors and place them in ""unavoidable"" and ""avoidable"" categories. If they're in the latter group, work on strategies to get rid of them.
Bring peace and serenity into your life by accepting the things you cannot change and changing the things you can. If you practice acceptance at the workplace, you can realize that some things are out of your control and not worth stressing about.
Practice mindfulness to bring peace into your life. Accept the things that you cannot change and change the things that you can. If you practice acceptance at the workplace, you will realize certain things are out of your control and then you will avoid stressing over them., Not being able to find what you need when you need it causes undue stress. So too does trying to complete a dozen tasks at once. Take a little time at the start of each workday (or at the end of the previous workday) to organize your work area and plot out what you should and will accomplish that day.Tidy up your workspace so you can find what you need and focus better, and break up your giant “to do” list into more manageable pieces, with priority placed on tasks that need done sooner rather than later.
Set challenging but realistic goals for yourself. Don’t expect perfection, or more than is humanly possible. Learn to say “no” or “not now” when necessary. When you are busy and do not have time to do something, do not be afraid to speak up. It’s okay!

, Accept that you are a human being, not a machine, and that “powering through” a stressful work experience is not the best or healthiest option. Taking even small breaks after every ninety minutes or so of intense work activity can pay stress-relieving dividends. Brief reprieves to meditate, take a walk, or engage in other relaxing / distracting activities can make you calmer and more focused.Try not to “bring your work home with you” when possible. Make at least part of your time at home an extended break from work stress. Also, use your vacation days, and have an actual vacation from work. Leave your job and its stress behind for a week.
Share chats and laughs with supportive, positive co-workers who understand the stress you feel. Steer clear of nay-sayers and the perpetually stressed-out.

, From deep breathing to journaling to jogging, there are numerous effective ways to relieve stress available to you. How to Relieve Stress is a good place to start when looking for some of these strategies.


Most good stress reduction methods boil down to some simple concepts. Take, for instance, the “Five Rs” of stress reduction:Reorganize — Make lifestyle changes to avoid and relieve stress.
Rethink — Shift your focus away from your stressors.
Reduce — De-clutter your mind and your surroundings.
Relax — Use meditation, mindfulness, yoga, and other relaxation techniques.
Release — Learn to let go of things that you can’t control.



, People are often tempted to cope with stress by turning to unhealthy habits like using tobacco products or drinking too much. Such habits provide only a temporary reprieve from your stress, however, and also create a host of significant risks for your cardiovascular system.If you smoke, quit. While usually easier said than done, this is perhaps the biggest lifestyle change you can make to improve heart health. Smoking causes your heart to work harder and less efficiently, among the long list of other negative health consequences.
Start your stop smoking plan with START: Set a quit date; Tell your friends and family that you're planning to quit; Anticipate hardship and struggle in your battle to quit; Remove tobacco products from car, home, and work; and Talk to your doctor about getting help.Cut back on excessive alcohol consumption. While small to moderate alcohol consumption (1-2 drinks per day) seems to have heart benefits, going beyond this amount adds no further benefit and will (in excess) begin to increase cardiovascular risks.

, Office jobs and other sedentary work activities often contribute to weight gain, which puts added stress on the cardiovascular system. In particular, excess fat deposits in the abdominal area often correlate with increased risks for diabetes, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol (all of which are gateways to heart disease).No matter the nature of the job you have, choosing a healthy diet and finding time for regular exercise are essential to shedding excess pounds and improving cardiovascular health.
Even just sitting at a desk for long stretches can contribute to weight gain and heart disease risks. Take regular breaks and walk around a bit, or work standing up at a higher desk meant for that purpose.
Only eat between 1800 and 2000 calories every day. Eat more protein, and limit simple sugars and saturated fats. Try to fill half of your plate with vegetables, and follow a heart healthy diet. Get 150 minutes of moderate intensity exercise every week., Like any other muscle, your heart becomes stronger and healthier when exercised regularly and properly. Even if your job keeps you chained to a desk all day, simply finding a few windows of opportunity for some quick exercises can help reduce cardiovascular risks. Also, the act of exercising is an excellent way to reduce stress.For the greatest cardiovascular benefits, try to get 30 minutes of moderate intensity exercise per day. “Moderate” usually means that you are somewhat out of breath and sweating. A brisk walk on your lunch break fits the bill; so does biking to and from work, mowing the lawn when you get home, or taking a dance class with some co-workers in the evening.
Exercising in a single half-hour block or in three ten minute sessions per day provides the same benefits. So, taking a brief, brisk walk during a work break can help you clear your head, reduce stress, and strengthen your heart all at once.
If you are just beginning an exercise regimen after living a sedentary lifestyle, or have underlying cardiovascular or other health conditions, consult your doctor before beginning an exercise program.

, While saturated fats and excess sodium constrict and clog up blood vessels, a diet that emphasizes vegetables, fruits, lean proteins, whole grains, and healthy fats can help keep your blood flowing smoothly, thereby reducing the strain on your heart.Aim to eat 5-10 servings of vegetables and fruits per day. The fiber content in fruits and veggies (also found in whole grains such as oatmeal) helps to clear out the buildup of plaque in blood vessels.
Lean proteins, such as fish, lowfat yogurt, and beans provide ample nutrients without high saturated fat content. Omega-3 fatty acids in oily fish like salmon and tuna can also help to lubricate the blood vessels.
Pack your lunch for work, instead of relying on takeout, vending machines, or nothing at all. It is easier to make healthy food choices the night before or in the morning than after half of a hectic day in the office.
Visit this wikiHow article for more tips on healthy eating.

, Sleep and stress can cause a vicious cycle. Stress can make it harder to sleep, and a lack of sleep can increase stress levels, and so on and so forth. The first step toward breaking this cycle is to set aside enough time each night for a full night's sleep that lets you awaken rested and recharged.


Getting more sleep is good for your heart as well. Most adults need 7-9 hours of sleep per night in order to properly rest, refresh, and recharge. Getting adequate sleep reduces stress levels and blood pressure, and benefits cardiovascular function., Small changes, especially when combined, can make a big difference in regards to your cardiovascular health. For instance, the simple act of taking care of your teeth can benefit your heart. Studies indicate that disease-causing bacteria in the mouth can enter the bloodstream and contribute to hardening of the arteries. Daily cleaning and regular dental checkups can help prevent this.Even more importantly, make sure you have regular health screenings with your doctor. Work with him or her to establish your overall health and cardiovascular disease risks. If you are prescribed medications to lower cholesterol (such as statins) or blood pressure (like beta blockers), or to thin your blood (such as aspirin), take them as directed and follow up with your physician regularly., Any job can be stressful and thereby increase your heart disease risk. Jobs that are very mentally / emotionally / physically demanding but provide limited freedom to make decisions (that is, you aren’t in charge) seem most likely to increase heart disease risk. Consider this along with other risk factors you may have due to genetics or lifestyle.Common fixed risk factors for heart disease include family history, male gender, and increased age; manageable risk factors include high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes; and preventable risk factors include smoking, obesity, poor diet, and physical inactivity., Especially if you have several risk factors for heart disease — for example, a parent who had a heart attack at a young age, high blood pressure, and a stressful job — talk to your doctor about making a more detailed assessment and plan for addressing your risks.


You can use a relatively simple formula to numerically calculate your heart disease risk, but don’t use this “score” as a substitute for medical advice from a physician. Use it as motivation to make changes and seek treatment options.

, No matter your overall risk for heart disease, but especially if you are in an elevated category, you should know the signs to watch out for. If you are having a heart attack or stroke, for instance, immediate medical intervention is essential.Heart attack signs can include chest or upper body pain or discomfort; shortness of breath; light-headedness; nausea; dizziness; or cold sweats.
Signs of stroke can include weakness or paralysis on one side of the body, slurred speech, or a drooping face on one side.
Other forms of cardiovascular disease can cause fainting, irregular heartbeat, leg swelling, unexplained fevers or rashes, and a host of other symptoms. Your best defense is to know your risk level and how to act if you suspect you are experiencing symptoms.

Eat less sodium.,
Energize your body for healing with whole-grains.,
Concentrate on fruits and vegetables.,
Reduce your fat intake.,
Limit the amount of sugar you eat.",How to Reduce High Blood Pressure After Surgery1," Sodium is in salt, so by reducing your salt consumption, you will reduce your sodium intake. Eating salty foods is an acquired taste. Some people who are accustomed to flavoring their food with lots of salt may consume up to 3,500 mg of sodium (in salt) per day. If you have high blood pressure and need to lower it after surgery, your doctor will probably recommend strongly cutting back on salt. This may mean eating 2,300 mg or less of sodium per day. Try the following:Scrutinize the snacks you eat. Instead of snacking on salted foods like chips, pretzels, or nuts, try substituting an apple, banana, carrot or green pepper.
Look for canned foods that are not preserved with salt or have low-sodium written on the packaging.
Drastically reduce the amount of salt you add to recipes when cooking, or stop adding salt entirely. Instead, season with other spices as appropriate such as cinnamon, paprika, parsley and oregano, for example. Take the salt shaker off the table to remind yourself not to add any later.;
, Whole grains contain more nutrients, more fiber, and are more filling than processed white flour. You should get the bulk of your calories from whole-grains and other complex carbohydrates. Aim for six to eight servings per day. A serving is a half a cup of cooked rice or a piece of bread. Up your intake of whole-grains by:Eating oatmeal or grits for breakfast. Top it off with some fresh fruit or raisins to add some sweetness.
Checking on the packaging of breads to see if they are whole-grain.
Purchasing whole-grain pasta and flour instead of white.

, The recommended daily amount of fruits and veggies is four to five servings of each per day. A half a cup is a serving size. Fruits and vegetables contain minerals that are helpful for controlling blood pressure, such as potassium and magnesium. You can increase the amount of fruit and veggies you eat by:Starting your meal with a salad. By eating a salad at the start, you can take the edge off your hunger when you are the most hungry. Don’t wait until the end to eat your salad — then you will already be full and you will be unlikely to eat as much of it. Keep your salads interesting by adding different fruits and vegetables to them. Use salted nuts, cheese, and salad dressings sparingly because they are usually high in salt. Use oil and vinegar instead for dressing that is naturally low in sodium.
Keep prepared fruits and veggies on hand for a quick snack. Bring carrot sticks, green pepper slices, or an apple with you to work or school.

, A high-fat diet can contribute to clogging your arteries and increasing your blood pressure. However, there are many tasty ways to lower the amount of fat you eat, while still getting the nutrients you need to heal after surgery.


Dairy products like milk and cheese provide calcium and vitamin D, but they often contain a high amount of fat and salt. Choose low-fat milk, yogurt, and cheeses. Cheeses should also be low-salt.Eat lean poultry and fish instead of red meats. If your meat has fat around the edges, trim it off. Eat no more than six ounces of meat per day. You can also make meats healthier by baking, grilling, or roasting instead of frying them.Cut down on the amount of extra fats you consume. This includes butter and mayonnaise on a sandwich, cooking with heavy cream, or solid shortenings, such as butter or Crisco. A tablespoon is a serving. Aim for three servings or less per day., Eating processed sugars make you more likely to over eat because they don’t provide the nutrients necessary to make you feel full. Try to eat no more than five sweets per week.Artificial sweeteners like Splenda, NutraSweet, and Equal, can help satisfy a craving, but try to learn to substitute sweet snacks with healthier alternatives like fruits and vegetables.

Quit smoking.,
Don’t drink alcohol.,
Manage stress effectively.,
Exercise, if your doctor says it is ok.",How to Reduce High Blood Pressure After Surgery2," Smoking and / or chewing tobacco can cause your arteries to become harder and narrower, making your blood pressure rise. If you live with a smoker, ask them to smoke outside so you won’t be exposed to the secondhand smoke. This is particularly important during the time that you are recovering from surgery. If you, yourself, need help quitting, you can try:Talking to your doctor to develop a treatment plan that will work for you.
Getting social support from hotlines, support groups, or an addictions counselor.Trying medications or nicotine replacement therapies.

, If you recently had surgery, you may be on medications to manage any health conditions and help you heal. Alcohol can interact with many medications.In addition, if your doctor has advised you to lose weight, alcoholic drinks are high in calories and will make it difficult to get your weight down
If you need help quitting drinking, talk to your doctor about getting medical treatment and support. Your doctor may be able to suggest treatments, support groups, and counseling services to help you.

, Recovering from surgery is stressful, both physically and emotionally. Some widely used relaxation techniques that can be used even when you may have limited physical mobility include:Meditation

Music or art therapy

Deep breathing
Visualizing calming images

Progressively tensing and relaxing each muscle group in your body

, Exercise is an excellent way to reduce stress and lose weight. However, if you are recovering from surgery, it is important that you do not do more than your body can handle.Walking daily is safe exercise after many types of surgery, so check with your doctor if it is appropriate after your surgery, and when you can start this.
Consult your doctor and a physical therapist to create an exercise program that will be safe for you. Be sure to attend all follow-up appointments with both your doctor and physical therapist so they can verify that the exercise is continuing to be beneficial for you.

Call your doctor if you think you are developing high blood pressure.,
Control your blood pressure with medications if your doctor feels it is needed.,
Talk to your doctor about other medications you are on.",How to Reduce High Blood Pressure After Surgery3," Most people with high blood pressure don’t know they have it, because there are often no symptoms. However, symptoms can include:Shortness of breath
Headaches
Nosebleeds
Blurred vision or seeing double

, Your doctor may feel that it is important for you to take medication while you recover from surgery. Because these can interact with other medications it is important that you discuss all medications with your doctor. This includes over-the-counter medications, supplements, and herbal remedies. Your doctor may prescribe:ACE inhibitors. These medications work by causing your blood vessels to relax. These in particular can interact with a lot of medications, so make sure you are communicating with your doctor about everything you are taking.
Calcium channel blockers. These medications widen your arteries and may lower your heart rate. Be aware that you cannot drink grapefruit juice while taking these medications.
Diuretics. These medications cause you to urinate more frequently and lower your salt levels.
Beta-blockers. These medications make your heart beat more slowly and softer.

, If you are concerned that other medications you are on or will need to take after surgery might make your blood pressure worse, talk to your doctor. Your doctor needs a complete picture of everything you are taking in order to prescribe the best medications for you. Don’t stop taking medications without discussing it with your doctor first. Medications that can increase blood pressure include:Over-the-counter pain medications. This includes nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (Ibuprofen and others). Consult your doctor before using these medications to deal with pain during your recovery.
Certain birth control pills
Various decongestants and cold medications, especially those containing pseudoephedrine

Watch for shortness of breath.One of the cardinal signs of left ventricular heart failure is shortness of breath, which often becomes worse over time.,
Notice if your shortness of breath increases when you are lying down.In left ventricular heart failure, many people experience increased breathlessness when they lie down.,
Tell your doctor if you develop a cough.Another one of the hallmark signs of left ventricular heart failure is a cough.,
Observe for ""palpitations.,
Consider your energy level.Left ventricular heart failure is typically accompanied by fatigue and overall weakness.,
Look out for weight gain due to fluid retention.When left ventricular heart failure progresses, it may begin to affect the right side of your heart as well, leading to concurrent right-sided heart failure.,
Be aware of the progression of your condition.Heart failure tends to be a condition that gets worse, progressively, with time.,
Receive a physical exam.After asking you about your symptoms, the next step is for your doctor to perform a physical exam.,
Get a blood test.Another step when your doctor evaluates for heart failure will be to get a blood test.,
Ask your doctor for a chest x-ray.A chest x-ray can look for signs of heart failure including fluid in the lungs and an enlarged heart.,
Opt for an ECG (electrocardiogram).An ECG is a tracing of the electrical activity of your heart.,
Receive further testing as needed.If the diagnosis of heart failure remains uncertain after all of these initial tests, your doctor may order further investigations.,
Quit smoking.One of the ways to reduce your risk of all types of heart disease, including left ventricular heart failure, is to quit smoking (if you currently smoke).,
Monitor your weight.Being overweight is one of the major risk factors for various types of heart disease, including left ventricular heart failure.,
Reduce your cardiovascular risk factors.There are many conditions which play a role in overall heart health.,
Talk to your doctor about treatment options.",How to Spot Left Ventricular Heart Failure Signs," The shortness of breath is caused by less effective blood flow throughout the body (which results in less effective oxygen delivery to the tissues), as well as the pressure on the lungs as a result of the congestion in the heart (which can lead to fluid in the lungs - called pulmonary edema - and overall more difficulty breathing).


In left ventricular heart failure, shortness of breath typically becomes worse with exertion (and improves with rest).
Over time, you may notice that your ability to tolerate exercise decreases, and that you become short of breath faster. This may be a sign of worsening heart failure.;
, This symptom is called ""orthopnea."" People often sleep in a semi-upright position, either with several pillows under their head or in a chair, to ease the sensation of shortness of breath during the night.


Another common symptom of left ventricular heart failure is called ""paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea"" (PND).
PND is when you get a sudden attack of shortness of breath in the middle of the night, that somewhat resembles an asthma attack. These episodes are generally short-lived, but they can be disruptive to sleep and they often go hand-in-hand with the diagnosis of heart failure.

, You may cough up fluid, or even blood-tinged mucus.


The cough is caused by fluid in the lungs due to the pressure exerted on the lungs from the force of congestion in the heart.
Your cough will likely get worse with time. It will not resolve on its own, and it may be exacerbated with exercise.

,""Palpitations are unusually fast heartbeats, or skipped heartbeats, leading to the sensation of being aware of your heart ""doing funny things"" or ""fluttering"" in your chest. Palpitations often accompany heart failure, and it is important to tell your doctor if you are experiencing them.

, Again, this is due to less effective flow of blood throughout your body, and thus less efficient delivery of oxygen. It may also be due to breathing challenges from pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs).


You may notice your exercise tolerance decreases, followed by a decrease in your energy levels for doing day-to-day tasks around the house.
You may find it challenging to walk up stairs, and you may feel tired, weak, and short of breath doing activities (such as walking up stairs) that you previously found easy.

, Right-sided heart failure presents with fluid retention (swelling of the ankles and legs), which in turn leads to weight gain. It is very important to tell your doctor if you are experiencing this.

, It is not a condition that improves, or gets better on its own.


At some point, you may go into something called ""decompensated heart failure.""
Decompensated heart failure is when your symptoms suddenly get worse, because your heart is no longer able to ""compensate"" through adaptive changes.
If you experience a sudden worsening of your symptoms, it is key to go to the Emergency Room immediately for prompt medical evaluation and treatment.

, Signs of heart failure that he or she will look for include:


High blood pressure - this is a risk factor for heart failure.
Abnormal heart sounds when your doctor listens to your heart with a stethoscope (doctors are trained how to pick up the signs of heart failure this way).
A high ""JVP"" (jugular venous pressure), which is basically when your doctor observes fluid build-up in the veins of your neck, which often goes hand-in-hand with heart failure and similar conditions.
Fluid build up in your legs.
Crackles in your lungs when your doctor listens with a stethoscope, which may indicate fluid in the lungs (from pulmonary edema).

, There is a specific test called ""BNP,"" which, if elevated, has a strong correlation to heart failure.


A blood test can also be used to rule out other conditions that may present similarly to heart failure.

, A chest x-ray can also help to rule out other conditions that may present similar.

, It can detect things such as heart attacks, which may be the underlying reason that caused you to go into heart failure. An ECG can also be used to rule out other conditions that may present similarly to heart failure such as an arrhythmia.

, These may include:


An echocardiogram, which can identify whether the problem is systolic or diastolic.A stress test
A CT or MRI
A coronary angiogram
A biopsy of your heart

, If you are interested in quitting smoking, your doctor can support you by offering medications and/or nicotine replacement strategies to help reduce your cigarette cravings.

, If you are overweight, some strategies you can try for prevention of heart disease include:


Increasing your aerobic exercise - speak to your doctor about an exercise plan that is safe for you.
Eating a ""heart-healthy diet"" that is low in salt and fats, and rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
Consuming less calories daily - in addition to your choice of foods, your quantity of food intake is also important. Ask your doctor how many calories someone with your body type should be consuming daily, and use this as a guideline to monitor (and possibly reduce) your daily caloric intake.

, Identifying if you have any of these, and treating them as needed, can help to prevent left ventricular heart failure. Conditions that may increase your risk of heart disease include:


Diabetes (high blood sugar levels) - this can be treated with medications such as Metformin or Insulin.
High blood pressure - this can be treated with medications to reduce blood pressure, such as Ramipril or Hydrochlorothiazide.
High cholesterol - this can be decreased through dietary strategies, as well as exercise. It can also be reduced by taking medication such as Atorvastatin.

, Treatment options will vary based on your situation, so it is best to meet with your doctor and discuss your options. Some common treatment options for heart failure include:open heart surgery to unblock and artery and improve blood flow
percutaneous interventions to widen a valve or unblock an artery
implanting a pacemaker to regulate your heartbeat

Focus on produce.,
Opt for whole grains.,
Eat good fats.,
Go for lean proteins.,
Be conscious of your salt intake.",How to Support Heart Health1," Vegetables and fruits have many properties that can help fight cardiovascular disease. If you center them in your diet, you will eat fewer items that work against heart health. Try planning meals that feature vegetables as the main attraction, such as curries, stir-fry, salads, and vegetable soups.Keep fruits and vegetables around to snack on. Put a bowl of fruit out in your kitchen so it catches your eye.
While frozen vegetables and even canned fruit can be perfectly healthy, watch out for added sugar or salt. Eat fresh produce when you can get it.;
, Whole grains help you regulate your blood pressure, making them healthier for your heart than white-flour carbohydrates. Opt for bread and bread products made with whole-wheat flour, high-fiber crackers and cereal, and whole grains like brown rice, barley, farro, buckwheat, or quinoa.Try oatmeal for breakfast, and air-popped popcorn (without butter) for a whole-grain snack.
Avoid white flour items and items with a lot of added sugar, like muffins or waffles.

, Opt for monounsaturated fats instead of solid fats. Olive oil, canola oil, and vegetable and nut oils are good options. Eat foods with polyunsaturated fats, such as fish, avocados, seeds, and nuts.Cold-water fish contain omega-3 fatty acids, which can benefit your heart health by lowering your triglycerides. Eat salmon, mackerel, and herring.
Flaxseeds and walnuts are also a great source of omega-3 fatty acids.
Avoid saturated fats and trans fats by limiting the number of solid fats in your diet. Skip butter, animal fat, margarine, and shortening.
If you're a fan of margarine, get a version that is trans-fat free or cholesterol-lowering.
Limit the amount of gravy, cream sauce, and nondairy creamer you consume.

, Legumes, such as beans, peas, and lentils, are great sources of protein and contain no cholesterol and very little fat. They can serve as excellent substitutes for meat protein, but they're also delicious with rice and vegetables.Eat lower fat dairy items, like skim milk. If you like creamy things, try yogurt instead of sour cream or butter.
Pick lean cuts of meat and skinless chicken.
Eggs are also a great source of lean protein.

, It can be hard to tell how much salt you're eating, as salt is generally hidden in your food. Avoid processed foods as much as you can, and always check the labels of canned or frozen foods to see how much salt is added. Eat fresh food when you can.Flavor food with herbs and spices instead of relying on salt.
When buying prepared meals, check the label. Opt for reduced-salt or low-sodium when you can.

Control your portions.,
Plan your meals.,
Indulge on occasion.",How to Support Heart Health2," Even if you're eating healthy foods, you can damage your heart health by eating too much (or too little!). To eat proper portions, pay attention to your hunger. Start yourself off with small servings, and only return for seconds if you don't feel sated.Consider the size of your plates. The bigger the plate, the more likely you are to over-serve yourself. Purchase small plates and bowls to encourage small serving sizes.
Serve yourself the low-calorie healthy foods first. Fill half your plate with salad and vegetables before you go for the heavier items.

, You are more likely to make healthy choices if you plan your meals ahead of time. On the weekends, or whenever you have time off work, make menus and plan your week out in advance. Make a grocery list of everything you'll need before you shop, and beware of impulse purchases.Try cooking ahead for yourself so you don't have to stop and cook every meal. Make food so that there will be leftovers, and keep track of when you made them so things don't go bad.
Balance your weekly diet so that you don't eat too much of the same thing all at once. Try making two to three main dishes at a time so that you can alternate.

, Stressing out about your food choices will not support your heart's health. As long as it's not a daily habit, it's okay to eat the occasional handful of chips or slice of birthday cake.However, once it is a habit, try to control and alter it as soon as possible. For instance, you may choose not to keep chips in the house if you're always reaching for them.
If you eliminate one unhealthy snack, try to replace it with something healthier that you like — for instance, if you get rid of chips, try keeping some nuts or cut-up vegetables around for snacking.

Start small.,
Exercise daily and weekly.,
Include aerobic activity.",How to Support Heart Health3," You don't have to splurge on a gym membership and train for a triathlon to support your heart health. Any change towards more activity is helpful. Even adding as few as 10 minutes of energetic activity a day can make a difference.Add activity into your daily routine. Walk the dog, walk to the grocery store and cook at home, bike to work, or take the stairs instead of the elevator if you can.
Start some active hobbies, like gardening.
Try the 7-minute workout for a short, vigorous burst of action. A brief but hardy workout may be just as beneficial as a longer session., Get 150 – 300 minutes of moderate exercise or 75 – 150 minutes of vigorous exercise a week.Get both moderate and vigorous exercise to create a sustainable weekly routine.


Try to get least half an hour of moderate activity (such as yoga or briskly walking) most days of the week. Work up to longer jaunts of vigorous exercise.
Experiment with a few different kinds of vigorous exercise you think you might like, such as running, hiking, cycling, or swimming.
Establish a daily and a weekly routine. Keep track in your calendar!

, To lower your cholesterol and blood pressure, work up to getting about 40 minutes of aerobic activity three to four times a week. Aerobic exercise is also called endurance exercise—it's exercise that speeds up your breathing and your heart rate.Try moderate aerobic activity like brisk walking.
Go for more vigorous activity, such as dancing, swimming, biking, jogging or running.
Get some daily aerobic activity by climbing the stairs.
Have some fun by playing team sports like basketball, soccer, or tennis.

Sleep.,
Quit smoking tobacco.,
Keep an eye on your weight.",How to Support Heart Health4," Get a full night's sleep to support your heart's health. If you are an adult, you need around seven to nine hours of sleep a night. Try to support your sleep by going to bed and waking up around the same time each day.One way to measure the quality of your sleep is how you feel on waking. If you wake up feeling refreshed, you're probably getting enough sleep.
If you're struggling to wake up when your alarm goes off, you might need more sleep or higher quality sleep.
Talk to your doctor if you can't seem to get rested. You might have a medical condition that is disturbing your sleep.

, Tobacco damages your heart and blood vessels at an alarming rate. If you smoke, quit. If you don't, don't start., Carrying excess weight, especially in your upper body, can be hard on your heart. Being overweight can also lead you into contracting diseases that are hard on your heart, such as high blood pressure and high cholesterol.Calculate your BMI. While BMI isn't a perfect indicator, and fails to account for muscle mass, it can help you gage your rough ideal weight.
Use waist measurement. Another rough way to see if you are overweight is to measure straight around your waist. Men are usually overweight if their waist is wider than 40 inches (101.6 centimeters, or cm), while women are considered overweight if their waist is wider than 35 inches (88.9 cm).
Talk to your doctor about the ideal weight for you. Your doctor will calculate in your medical history and information about your genes and lifestyle.

Alert your care team immediately if you show signs of a blood clot.,
Take all medications as directed.,
Move around as much as you’re permitted.,
Drink plenty of fluids.,
Wear compression stockings and devices.",How to Reduce Blood Clot Risk During Hospitalization1," Signs of a deep vein thrombosis (DVT, or a blood clot in your arms or legs) include pain not caused by an injury, swelling, and red or discolored skin. Signs of a clot that’s migrated to the lungs (a pulmonary embolism) include difficulty breathing, chest pains, coughing or coughing up blood, and irregular heartbeat.Familiarize yourself with the signs and symptoms of a blood clot before your hospital stay. Continue to stay alert for 90 days after hospitalization.;
, Your doctor may have prescribed a blood thinner, especially if you have a higher risk of developing a clot. Otherwise, whatever procedure you’ve undergone may require medication. Either way, be sure to take all medications that you’ve been prescribed according to your care team’s instructions., Follow your care team’s instructions regarding your mobility. They may tell you to walk around your room or help you walk up and down the hallways.Frequent movement is the number way to prevent blood clots while hospitalized and once discharged.
If you’re not able to get out of bed, be sure to stretch your legs or move your feet according to their instructions. Your nurse will help you change positions or tell you how to move in ways that won’t aggravate your surgical site.

, Your nurse and other care team members will offer you fluids or ice chips when it becomes safe to ingest liquids. Try not to resist their instructions and drink as much as you’re directed. Staying hydrated will help your blood flow, especially when you’re immobile after a surgical procedure., Your care team will likely give you compression stockings or leg wraps to wear to promote your circulation. If you are high-risk, they might also apply a device that inflates and deflates around your calf muscles (a sequential compression device). This massaging action will help maintain your leg circulation.Be sure to ask your care team about if you need to wear compression stockings or wraps after your hospital stay and, if so, for how long.

Lose weight if needed or maintain a healthy weight.,
Exercise moderately 30 to 60 minutes each day on most days of the week.,
Eat a healthy diet low in cholesterol, saturated fat and salt.,
Quit smoking if applicable, or don't start.,
Ask your doctor about supplements that reduce your risk of coronary artery disease.,
Limit consumption of alcohol to 2 drinks per day for men and 1 drink per day for women.,
Make efforts to lower your stress to reduce your risk of coronary artery disease.",How to Reduce the Risk of Coronary Artery Disease,"


Evaluate your body mass index (BMI) to determine your healthy weight. Multiply your height in inches by your height in inches. Call that answer your total height. Now, divide your weight by your total height. Your answer should then be multiplied by 703 to get your BMI. For example, an individual who is 5-foot-6 (66 inches) and 160 pounds would have a BMI of 25.8.
You are at a higher risk of developing heart disease if your BMI is more than 25. Even a 10-pound weight loss can reduce risk of heart disease by lowering blood pressure.;
, Not only does exercise lower blood pressure, but it can also help in weight loss.


You don't have to complete all 30 to 60 minutes at a time. You'll get the same benefit if you break up your exercise into several 10- or 15-minute routines.

, Saturated fat and cholesterol clog your arteries, and salt increases blood pressure. All three elevate your risk for coronary artery disease.


Talk to a nutritionist or your doctor to learn what foods you can enjoy and what foods to avoid. Oatmeal, fatty fish such as salmon, and almonds are examples of food that lower cholesterol. Foods to avoid or include only in moderation include most meat, ice cream and other baked sweets, and chips.

,


Cigarettes contain nicotine which raises blood pressure. Nicotine also prompts the body to release adrenaline, making blood vessels and your heart work harder.

,


A daily aspirin can prevent heart attacks and strokes, and reduce the risk of developing heart disease. Discuss the benefits versus the risks with your physician, because aspirin may cause bleeding when taken long term.
Vitamin E lowers the risk of heart attack. Omega 3-fatty acids are helpful in reducing cholesterol which can build up as plaque in arteries.

,


Long term alcohol consumption causes the heart to weaken and stretch, making it more susceptible to damage. Alcohol use also raises blood pressure and increases your risk of stroke and obesity.

,


Stress can cause spikes in your blood pressure, and can also lead to destructive lifestyle habits such as smoking and alcohol. Exercise, rest and meditation are healthier ways to deal with stress.

Lose excess weight before a hospital stay.,
Quit smoking.,
Assess your risk of blood clots.",How to Reduce Blood Clot Risk During Hospitalization2," Maintain a balanced diet and cut down on fatty foods and sugar. Without putting your health at risk, get as much exercise as possible or as recommended by your doctor. Go for light forms of exercise, like a half hour long walk per day.Exercising will help you lose weight, reducing the pressure on the veins in your legs and pelvis. This decrease in pressure can reduce blood pooling, which makes it less likely you will experience a blood clot.

, Smoking is bad for your overall health and puts you at a greater risk of developing a blood clot. Try to quit smoking before your hospital stay and discuss a smoking cessation plan with your doctor.You won’t be able to smoke in the hospital anyway, so cutting back or quitting beforehand will help reduce nicotine cravings during your stay.

, Prior to your hospital stay, develop a prevention play by talking to your doctors about your family and personal history with blood clots. Discuss your lifestyle and health with them, including how active you are, whether you’re on birth control or other medications, your age, whether you smoke, and whether you have chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes.An inactive lifestyle, many medications, heart and lung conditions, being over age 55, and smoking can all increase the risk of developing a blood clot.
Ask your care team about your risks and options before hospitalization. Ask, “Am I at a greater risk for developing a blood clot or bleeding problems? Do I need blood thinners or other anticoagulants? Which medications are best for my particular needs?”"
"
Follow all of your care team’s post-operative instructions.,
Stay mobile or get help moving around.,
Consume less vitamin K if you’re on a blood thinner.,
Continue to monitor yourself for 90 days.",How to Reduce Blood Clot Risk During Hospitalization3," Before you leave the hospital, ask your nurses and doctor to go over post-operative instructions with you. Ask them about how to to take your medications and how mobile you should be when you return home.Ask, “Will I be taking any anticoagulants, or blood thinners? What time of the day should I take them, and should I take them with or without food? What are some mobility exercises I can do that won’t cause pain, damage my stitches, or otherwise compromise my surgical site?”

, Walk around your house, stretch your legs, and do any exercises as you’ve been instructed. If you’re confined to a wheelchair or otherwise unable to move around on your own, ask your caregiver or a friend or relative to help you stay mobile.If you have a home health worker or other physical therapist, they will guide you with mobility exercises and any manual manipulations you’ll need.
If you have a friend or relative with you at the hospital, have them talk to your care team about helping you stay mobile. Say, “Please talk to the doctors about how you can stretch my arms and legs and help me move around when I go home. Let’s have them show you how to help me without upsetting my stitches.”

, If you’re on an anticoagulant medication (especially Lovenox and Coumadin), you’ll need to ingest less vitamin K so your medicine works properly. Cut foods like spinach, kale, and other deep green leafy vegetables from your diet. In addition, ask your care team about and other applicable dietary changes you should make., The risk of developing a blood clot remains for 90 days following hospitalization. Continue to be aware of the signs of symptoms of a blood clot throughout this duration.In addition, continue to self-monitor for any complications related to your specific procedure, including an infected or compromised surgical site. Go over your specific risks with your doctor prior to leaving the hospital.
If you’re on blood thinners, avoid any activities that could result in cuts or bruising, as your body will be less able to stop excessive bleeding.

Talk to a doctor.,
Start out easy.Exercise is key to strengthening the heart and preventing another heart attack.,
Gradually increase your exercise regimen.,
Rest if you need to.If you feel tired or experience any unusual heart activity, you should slow or end your physical activity.,
Focus on aerobic exercises.Aerobic exercises strengthen the heart and improve circulation.",How to Return to Normal Activity After a Heart Attack1," Before you get back to exercising or strenuous work, you should consult with your physician. Your doctor will consider your condition and provide you with direction as to what sorts of physical activity are best for you.Your doctor will work together with a medical team consisting of specialists, including:


Pharmacists
Nurses
Physiotherapists
Physician assistants
Physical therapists
Dietitians;
, But immediately after a heart attack, your body is vulnerable and weak. If you’re doing a lot of intense physical activity, you run the risk of hurting your heart. For that reason, start out with simple, everyday things like walking to the store and walking up stairs. Light exercise like yoga or playing catch is also an acceptable option.


If you have a dog, take them for a walk.
Invite a friend or family member to play catch with you at a public park.
Whatever form of exercise you enjoy, do something physical every day. For instance, take a walk for 10 minutes each day.
Set aside time each day to work out. Try to make it at the same time each day. This will help you form a habit of working out.Avoid exercises or actions like heavy lifting, moving your arms above your head for long periods, or doing any kind of prolonged and repetitive work with your arms like raking, mowing the lawn, or vacuuming.

, As you begin to strengthen your heart, you can incorporate more intense exercises into your workout. Go for a light jog, bike ride, kayak or canoe ride, or mountain climb.


Since you started out easy, continue walking each day, but add two minutes each day for a minute or two. By the end of the month you should be able to walk about 30 minutes at a moderate pace.Ask your doctor if it is okay for you to lift weights.

, Palpitations, chest pain, and shortness of breath are all indications that you’re pushing your heart beyond its limits. If you experience any of these conditions, stop your physical activity immediately. Make a note of these episodes and let your doctor know what happened so they can help you develop a plan that meets your needs and protects your heart health.


While your doctor might recommend how long and how fast you might increase your workout regimen, you should always stay aware of and exercise within your physical limits.

, They are therefore the preferred rehabilitation method for people recovering from heart attacks. Examples of aerobic exercises include:


Jogging
Riding a bike
Swimming
Dancing

Enroll in an outpatient rehab program.An outpatient rehab program is a regularly supervised education and exercise session aimed at helping you learn how to minimize your risk for future heart attacks.,
Find positive ways to deal with fear.Try to be honest about your fears with yourself and trusted loved ones.,
Identify healthy ways of coping with stress.,
Seek counselling.,
Take medications.There are a variety of medications that can help you get back to normal after you have a heart attack.",How to Return to Normal Activity After a Heart Attack2," You will also learn to deal with the causes of your heart attack. Your program may give you advice on how to lose weight, quit smoking, adjust your diet, and improve your overall health so as to limit the likelihood of another heart attack. Your doctor will let you know when and where to attend your heart attack rehab program. Use your rehab program and doctors as a resource.Ask questions such as:


What caused my heart attack?
How can I limit my risk of future heart attacks?
How should I change my diet to prevent another heart attack?
Will I need surgery or medication?

, What exactly are you afraid of? Do you fear that you’ll have another heart attack? That you’ll die? That you won’t be able to return to a normal level of activity? The first step to dealing with your fear is to admit what you’re afraid of.


Once you’ve given voice to your fear, write your fear down. Use a journal to track your thinking on the specific fear you have. Write how the intensity of fear you feel changes over time, as well as hopes you have for conquering your fear.
Write your best-case scenario for overcoming your fear. How would you live differently if you were free of heart attack-related anxieties?
Take steps to overcome your fear. If you’re afraid you won’t be able to engage in regular activity, try reintroducing yourself to something you love after a heart attack. Start slowly and work you way back up to regular activity levels. For instance, if you are afraid you won’t be able to run again, try doing brisk walks for a few weeks, then short, easy runs. Slowly increase the duration and intensity of your workouts.
Always resume physical activity with the consent of your doctor.

, You’ll probably be quite stressed due to your heart health. Taking care of yourself is the best way to deal with stress.Get plenty of sleep (at least seven to nine hours each night). Eat healthy meals based primarily on whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. Exercise at least three to five times each week for 30 to 60 minutes each time. And if you feel stressed, give yourself a break.


Set an alarm clock to mark the times you should sleep and wake up.
Incorporate healthy snacking choices into your daily routine. Instead of eating candy and potato chips, try snacking on berries or carrots with hummus.
Look for easy ways to get more physical activity into your daily routine. For instance, ride your bike to work, take the stairs, and walk your dog around the block a few times.
Seek counselling if you find you have a hard time dealing with stress.

, Many people experience depression after they have a heart attack.Fear or anxiety that you might suffer another heart attack (or even die) are common feelings for people who survive heart attacks. You might also feel angry at yourself or frustrated by the fact that you had a heart attack at all. In order to learn to deal with these mixed emotions, you should consult a trained therapist. Together, you can work through the complicated feelings that come with recovering from a heart attack.

, These include beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, and blood thinners.


Blood thinners are medications designed to make it hard for your blood to clot, thus reducing your risk of heart attack. Follow the directions for your blood thinners carefully, and always tell your doctor about any other medications you are taking.
ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors help your blood vessels open wider to allow more blood to pass through them.This can decrease blood pressure and reduce likelihood for a heart attack.
Beta blockers slow your heartbeat, thereby reducing stress on your heart.

"
Use caution when heading back to work.If your job involves little to no physical activity — for instance, if you work in an office environment — you can probably get back to work in two to three weeks.,
Have sex when you feel able.,
Sit on public transit.,
Wait about one month before driving.After a heart attack, you are at increased risk for another.Therefore, you should not drive or operate heavy machinery for about one month following your heart attack.,
Avoid extreme temperatures when bathing.Very hot water can superheat your heart and cause it excessive stress that could lead to another heart attack.",How to Return to Normal Activity After a Heart Attack3," However, if your job is very strenuous — for instance, if you move or lift lots of packages, boxes, or other heavy bundles — you might need to wait several months before returning to work. Talk to your doctor about setting a timeline for returning to work.

, After a heart attack, you can usually manage the stamina for sex after about four to six weeks.Sex does not increase your risk for another heart attack.


Due to anxiety or stress of the heart attack, men may experience erectile dysfunction (ED) after a heart attack. Beta blockers (a kind of medication commonly prescribed to people who have had heart attacks) may also produce erectile dysfunction. Talk to a doctor if you have ED.

, After a heart attack, even standing for too long can be exhausting. If you take the bus, tram, ferry, or subway, you should sit rather than stand.This ensures you will not get too tired, especially on long trips.


You may experience motion sickness in moving vehicles following your heart attack. If you do, simply get off until you’ve settled a bit, then get back on.
You might need a doctor’s note before traveling by plane. Before booking any flights, check with your airline about their rules regarding recent heart attack patients.

, This will give your doctor time to evaluate the extent of the damage to your heart and monitor your recovery. Your doctor will let you know when it is safe for you to begin driving again.


Contact your local Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) after you have a heart attack. Some states have rules requiring motorists to provide a doctor’s note indicating they are fit enough to drive again following a heart attack.Your doctor will probably also know if your state’s DMV requires a medical statement.

, Very cold water, likewise, can increase your risk for heart attacks, especially if you are already at risk for heart disease.Avoid saunas and hot tubs in addition to hot showers.
Very cold water causes the blood vessels of the heart to constrict. This could produce chest pains or a heart attack. Stay out of pools where the water temperature is very cold. Dip your fingertips or toes in the water before diving in. Don’t do a cold water “polar bear plunge” during the winter.
Keep the water temperature lukewarm when bathing or showering.

You will rest in a hospital bed in the recovery area or a hospital room. It is important to avoid moving around to prevent bleeding from the catheter insertion site.You will most likely be discharged within 24 hours of undergoing the angioplasty.If you have a heavy bandage over the insertion site, you may feel some discomfort. However, it is still critical to stay still and leave the bandage in place after the procedure, as this helps stop any bleeding. Do not remove any bandage unless instructed.;
, You will not be able to drive immediately following the procedure, so make sure that you ask a family member or a friend to take you home. Stop every hour and walk for about 5 to 10 minutes.


If you will be in the car for more than two hours, it is recommended that you stay in a hotel overnight.Wait at least one week after the procedure to fly.When you do fly, be sure to stand, stretch your legs, and walk in the aisle every hour., Keep your activity levels at a minimum for the first several days to one week following your angioplasty. You may feel tired and weak after the procedure, so it is important to rest to allow your body to heal. Plan to rest for the majority of the day, and only take short walks around your home., Most patients can resume normal activities and return to work within a week after the procedure, but it is important to gradually build up to them.

Take a warm shower to remove the tape and dressing easily., It is normal for the insertion site to be bruised or slightly swollen and pink for a couple of days following the procedure. You may even notice a small lump on the insertion site, which can be as large as a quarter.If you experience pus-like drainage and redness at the site and if the lump increases to the size of a golf ball, call your doctor right away.If you have a fever or if you experience extreme pain, swelling, numbness, or tingling in limb where the catheter was inserted, contact your doctor immediately.If the area starts to bleed, apply pressure and contact your doctor or hospital immediately.

, Since the insertion site is a small, open wound, you will need to keep it covered. Place a small adhesive bandage over the insertion site., To keep the insertion wound clean and free of bacteria, be sure to wash it daily with warm water and soap. Use a warm washcloth to gently cleanse the area, but do not rub or apply pressure.Do not apply creams, ointments, or lotions on the wound.

, Do not take baths, go swimming, or soak in a Jacuzzi for at least one week after an angioplasty.Showering is the best way to ensure that the wound site stays clean and free from infection.

Increase aerobic exercise.,
Eat a balanced diet.,
Stop smoking.,
Enroll in a cardiac rehabilitation program.",How to Recover from an Angioplasty3," After you have fully recovered from your angioplasty procedure, talk to your doctor about starting an exercise routine. Exercise helps lower your blood pressure and cholesterol, and it can help with weight management. It is recommended that the average person engage in 150 minutes of moderate exercise each week, or for 30 minutes for 5 days.Ask your doctor is this is right for you.


Take a brisk walk on your lunch break, swim laps in a pool, or cycle around your neighborhood.

, Increase the amount of fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins in your diet to help support your cardiovascular health.Avoid eating red meat too often, and opt for fish and poultry instead. Cut back on your intake of processed foods, fried foods, saturated fats, and sugar as much as possible.Choose to eat fish like salmon, trout, or herring a few times a week. Fish contains omega-3 fatty acids that help support heart health.Incorporate whole grains that are rich in fiber into your diet. Increasing your fiber intake can help prevent cardiovascular disease and help with weight management. Enjoy a cup of oatmeal for breakfast, and swap out white breads and pastas for whole grain versions., Smokers have a higher risk of having a stroke and are more likely than non-smokers to develop atherosclerosis, an aortic aneurysm, and other cardiovascular diseases. Even if you are a long-time smoker, your heart and lungs will begin to heal once you kick the habit.Ask your doctor if there is a support group in your area, or contact the National Network of Tobacco Cessation Quitlines for assistance.

, Cardiac rehabilitation programs help patients establish an exercise program, commit to healthy lifestyle changes, and focus on eating a heart-health diet. Many of these programs are covered by most U.S. health insurance companies for patients who have had a heart attack. Talk to your doctor about enrolling in a program in your area."

Consider enrolling in an outpatient cardiac rehabilitation program.",How to Recover From an Angiogram," During an angiogram, a doctor injects a dye into a catheter that is inserted into one of the arteries leading to your heart, lungs, brain, arms, legs, or kidneys. This procedure helps doctors determine how well the blood is flowing to a certain area and it may also help them to detect potentially life threatening blockages.


Your doctor may use a local or general anesthetic to perform an angiogram
The procedure takes between 30 minutes and two hours.
You may be able to return home soon after the procedure, as long as no blockages are detected.
The procedure is safe and usually painless, but you might have some bruising around the area where the catheter was inserted.;
, After your angiogram is over, you will have to stay in the hospital for several hours or possibly overnight. While you are in the hospital, your will be instructed to rest. Resting is important because too much movement may cause bleeding from where the catheter was inserted. Nurses will monitor your blood pressure and other vital signs while you recover from your angiogram.Limit your movement as much as possible. Stay in bed until you are told you may get up and walk. Do not walk around after an angiogram until your doctor says you may.
You will be monitored for 6 hours after your procedure.Sometimes the catheter will be left in place and removed the following morning. If the catheter is in one of your legs, you will need to keep them elevated., You may not need any medication if no blockage was detected. If a blockage was detected, you may need to take a blood thinner for about a year after your procedure. Make sure to follow your doctor’s instructions and take your medication every day. Do not stop taking your medication without consulting your doctor first., An angiogram is usually a safe procedure with minimal complications. If you experience any unusual side effects after having an angioplasty, you should tell your doctor or a nurse right away. Some side effects need to be treated right away to avoid a life-threatening situation. Tell your doctor or nurse right away if you notice:

Pain, swelling, or redness where the catheter was inserted. You may have a bit of pain after an angiogram, but there may be a problem if the catheter site is very painful or if you also have swelling and/or redness., After your angiogram is complete, your doctor will review your results and will share them with you the same day or soon after in a follow-up office visit.Try to relax and remain patient as you wait for your results.

, You are at the highest risk of having complications your first night home after your procedure. If you live with other people, you will not need to worry about asking someone to stay with you. If you live alone, you should ask a friend or family member to stay with you for your first night back home., After you return home from the hospital, you will need to continue resting for about a week. If you also had a heart attack or other serious complication, you will need to rest even longer. Plan to take at least a few days off from work to recover from your procedure.Avoid walking up stairs for the first couple of days after the angiogram if the catheter was inserted into your groin area.Avoid any heavy lifting or other strenuous activities for at least 24 hours. Ask your doctor when it will be okay to resume these activities again.
You may not be allowed to drive for up to a week after your procedure. Professional drivers may need to get medical approval before they can return to work. Wait 24 hours before showering., Since dye is injected into your artery during an angiogram, you will need to drink plenty of water after the procedure in order to flush the dye from your system.Adults should drink between six to eight cups of water per day, but you may need more or less depending on your body weight and health., If your doctor has prescribed you a medication for a condition that was detected and/or treated during your angiogram, you should continue to take this medication after leaving the hospital. Make sure that you understand the dosage instructions and contact your doctor if you have any concerns or questions about the medication. Do not stop taking your medication without consulting your doctor first., You may have some minor pain and/or swelling for the first few days after your procedure and you can use an ice pack to help relieve the pain and bring the swelling down a bit. Wrap a thin towel around an ice pack or a plastic bag filled with ice and apply the ice pack to your catheter site. Do not use the ice pack for more than 20 minutes at a time.If the pain and/or swelling worsens or does not improve, call your doctor as soon as possible.
Applying pressure with an ice pack may also help to control any light bleeding that you are still having. However, if your bleeding is more than light and does not seem to be slowing down, then call your doctor right away.

, Ice will help with pain, but it may not completely relieve your pain. If you are still having pain at the site of your angiogram even with the use of an ice pack, then you can take an over-the-counter pain reliever, such as acetaminophen. Follow the package instructions for dosage or ask your doctor for a recommendation., Make sure that you understand and follow your doctor’s instructions for care of your wound. You may be advised to avoid showering for the first two days after your procedure.

Chest heaviness is often described as an elephant sitting on the chest.Some also compare the pain to that of indigestion.;
, The pain may radiate from your chest to your arms, shoulders, jaw, or neck. It may also occur as primary pain in other areas such as your shoulders, arms, neck, jaw, or back.Women are statistically more likely than men to experience primary angina pain localized to an area other than the chest, or the chest pain may feel more like stabbing than pressure or tightness., Angina pain is caused by myocardial ischemia, which means reduced blood flow to your heart stops it from receiving enough oxygen.Because of this, you are likely to experience a range of symptoms in addition to the actual angina pain. Generally speaking, women are more likely to experience these additional symptoms, sometimes without even feeling typical chest pain.These symptoms include:Fatigue
Nausea
Dizziness/fainting
Sweating
Shortness of breath
Tightness in your chest

, You should immediately rest and stop putting any undue stress on your heart when you begin feeling a chest pain that you believe to be angina. Once you sit down and rest or take nitroglycerin, the pain should subside in a short amount of time—around five minutes—if you have what is called “stable angina,” which is the most common form.Unstable angina is another possibility where the pain is more severe and can last up to 30 minutes. It is no longer relieved by rest or medications. Unstable angina is considered a medical emergency and requires immediate professional evaluation to ensure that you’re not having a heart attack., Stable angina is deemed as such because the causes and severity are usually both consistent and predictable—at times when you force your heart to work harder.This means that the pain can flare up consistently after exercise, climbing stairs, cold temperature, smoking, and when you’re feeling especially stressed, emotional, etc.If you’re accustomed to monitoring symptoms of stable angina and your pain, the cause, the duration, or anything else deviates significantly from the norm, then you should seek immediate medical assistance because your angina has become unstable and could be a sign of a heart attack.Prinzmetal angina (or variant angina) is another form, but it’s related to heart spasms that interfere with blood flow.This form of angina can be alarming because it also deviates from a predictable schedule and is very painful. However, medications are available to help control the heart spasms at the root of it.These angina symptoms are often severe and occur at rest often between midnight and early morning and can be mistaken for unstable angina. Causes of Prinzmetal angina include cold weather, stress, medication, smoking and cocaine use. Consult your doctor immediately for a proper diagnosis., If you’ve never experience angina pain before and you’ve never been diagnosed with any heart condition, then you should call 911 at the first onset.Your symptoms could indicate a heart attack, so you should not wait to see if the symptoms subside on their own. If the symptoms indicate the onset of CAD, then your doctor will discuss treatment options and what to do for future instances of angina.

, If you’ve been diagnosed with CAD and know the usual triggers of your angina pain, then you should seek immediate medical care if your symptoms deviate from their usual pattern.This can be a sign of a heart attack. Your symptoms differ in several ways, including:Increased severity
Symptoms lasting longer than 20 minutes
Occurring at rest
Occurring with less activity than usual
New symptoms in association such as nausea, shortness of breath, a cold sweat, or a sense of impending doom
Symptoms are not relieved by taking medication, such as nitroglycerin

, Nitroglycerin is often prescribed to those with CAD because it dilates the arteries, helping to restore proper blood flow. You should call 911 if your pains don’t subside with rest or if they don’t respond to your nitroglycerin.Directions for nitroglycerin tablets and sprays usually suggest resting while taking a dose every five minutes (up to three doses) while symptoms continue. Use as directed and contact your care provider if the symptoms do not respond.

, The risk for angina increases with age. Specifically, the risk for angina increases for men older than 45 years and women older than 55 years.In general, the development of angina in women lags approximately ten years behind men. A decline in the natural hormone estrogen may be a factor in the increased risk for angina and heart disease among postmenopausal women., Angina is more often the presenting symptom of coronary artery disease (CAD) in women than in men.Low estrogen levels in women after menopause may play a role in the development of coronary microvascular disease (MVD), and thus microvascular angina.Up to 50 percent of women with angina have coronary MVD.The leading killer of both men and women is CAD.Estrogen protects women from heart disease. After menopause, estrogen levels drop drastically and translate into higher risks for angina in women. Women who have gone through early menopause, either naturally or as a result of hysterectomy (removal of the uterus), are twice as likely to develop angina as women of the same age who have not yet entered menopause., A family history of early heart disease increases an individual’s risk for angina and heart disease. If you have a father or brother who was diagnosed earlier than age 55—or if your mother or sister was diagnosed before age 65—then your risk is highest.Having one first-degree relative diagnosed with early heart disease may increase your risk for angina and heart disease by as much as 33 percent. That risk can jump to as high as 50 percent if you have two or more first-degree relatives diagnosed., Smoking increases the risk for angina and heart disease through several mechanisms. Smoking accelerates the development of atherosclerosis (buildup of fatty deposits and cholesterol in your arteries) by as much as 50 percent. Carbon monoxide in smoke also displaces oxygen in the blood, leading to a deficiency of oxygen in the cells of heart muscle (cardiac ischemia). Cardiac ischemia can lead to angina and heart attack. Smoking also decreases exercise tolerance, which can shorten exercise times associated with the development of angina., Diabetes is a modifiable risk factor for heart disease and thus angina. Diabetics have blood with a higher viscosity (thickness) than usual.This makes the heart work harder to pump blood. Diabetics also have thicker atrial walls in their hearts, allowing the passageways to block more easily.

, Consistently high blood pressure (hypertension) can cause hardening and thickening in your arteries. Persistently, or chronically, elevated blood pressure leads to damage of the walls of your arteries, which predisposes you to atherosclerosis (arterial buildup).If you are younger than 60 years of age, hypertension is defined as a blood pressure of 140/90 mm Hg or higher on more than one occasion. If you are older than 60 years of age, hypertension is defined as a blood pressure of 150/90 mm Hg or higher on more than one occasion., High cholesterol (hypercholesterolemia) also contributes to buildup on the atrial walls of your heart (atherosclerosis).The American Heart Association (AHA) recommends that all adults age 20 or older have a complete lipoprotein profile checked every four to six years to assess their risk for angina and heart disease.


A complete lipoprotein profile is a blood test that measures total blood cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (also known as “good” cholesterol), LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides.Both high levels of LDL (so-called “bad” cholesterol) and low levels of HDL (“good” cholesterol) can also result in atherosclerosis., Obesity (a BMI of 30 or higher) increases other risk factors since obesity is tied to high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and developing diabetes.In fact, this collection of associated symptoms is referred to a metabolic syndrome and includes:Hyperinsulinemia (fasting blood glucose level >100 mg/dL)
Abdominal obesity (waist circumference >40 in for men or >35 in for women)
Decreased HDL cholesterol levels (<40 mg/dL for men or <50 mg/dL for women)
Hypertriglyceridemia (triglycerides >150 mg/dL)
Hypertension

, If you take oral contraceptives, then you may also be at a higher risk of angina due to the increased risk of coronary artery disease.Talk to your doctor about your birth control medication to find out if it may be increasing your risk, and to learn about your other medication options., Your doctor may check your blood to find out if you have high blood levels of homocysteine, C-Reactive protein (CRP), ferritin (or stored iron levels), interleukin-6 and lipoprotein (a).These substances can all increase your risk of CAD and angina if you are outside of the normal ranges. You can also request these tests from your doctor, and then talk to your doctor about what you can do to lower your risk if any of your levels are abnormal., Stress makes your heart work harder by making it beat faster and more heavily. People who suffer from chronic stress are much more likely to develop heart conditions."

Avoid neglecting very low-blood pressure readings.,
Watch results over time.,
See your doctor.",How to Read Blood Pressure," Test your blood pressure at the same time every day. This helps ensure the most accurate reading.Consider measuring your blood pressure when you are most relaxed — in the mornings and evenings. You may also want to ask your doctor the best time to run the test for your purposes.;
, Different factors can influence your blood pressure. Getting yourself ready to take the reading can ensure you get the most accurate readings.Before you test:


Make sure you’ve been awake and out of bed for at least 30 minutes.
Stay away from food and beverages 30 minutes before the test.
Avoid caffeine and tobacco for 30 minutes before you test yourself.
Avoid any type of physical activity or exercise for 30 minutes before testing.
Make sure to empty your bladder.
Make sure to read the device instructions before you do any testing.

, It’s important to maintain proper arm and body positioning before and during your test. Sitting in a supported and upright position helps ensure the most accurate reading. In addition, you may want to sit and relax for a few minutes to help stabilize your pressure and further prepare yourself to get an accurate reading.Avoid moving or talking when you’re taking your blood pressure reading. Sit upright with your back supported. Place and keep your feet flat on the floor without crossing your legs.
Place the cuff directly above the eye, or crook, of your elbow.Support the cuffed arm on a table, desk, or the arm of a chair. Keep it at the level of your heart by propping it up with a pillow or cushion., After you’re comfortable and have sat quietly for a few minutes, start the test. Turn on the machine or test as calmly as you can so that you don’t elevate your pressure.Remove the cuff and/or abort the test if the cuff becomes uncomfortable, too tight or if you get lightheaded at any point.

, During the test, avoid moving or talking and remain as calm as possible. This can help you get the most accurate reading.Stay in the same position until the testing stops, the cuff deflates, or the monitor displays your blood pressure.

, Wait for the cuff to deflate and take it off your arm. Make sure to not move suddenly or quickly. You may be slightly lightheaded after you take off the cuff, but this sensation should go away relatively quickly., Run one or two additional test after your first reading. This can ensure you get the most accurate blood pressure reading.Wait a minute or two in between each test. Follow the same procedure for each of the readings you do.

, It’s important to record your test results when you’re done with each test. Write down any relevant information in a notebook or save it in your monitor if possible. The results can help you figure out the most accurate reading of your pressure, identify potentially problematic fluctuation.Note the reading and the time and date of the test. For example, “January 5, 2016 at 6:20am 110/90.”

, Your blood pressure reading is made up of two numbers, a top and bottom one. The top number is called the systolic pressure and the bottom one is the diastolic. The systolic number shows how hard the pressure is when your heart has to pump blood, while the diastolic number is the pressure when your heart is resting between beats.Read the number as, for example, “110 over 90.” You may see a mmHg after the number, which stands for the millimeters of mercury, or the units used to measure your blood pressure.
Be aware that most doctors will pay more attention to the systolic pressure (the first number), as it is a better measure of the risk for cardiovascular disease in people over the age of 50. The systolic number generally increases with age because of factors such as increasing stiffness in the large arteries, long-term build up of plaque, and increased frequency of cardiac and vascular diseases., You’ll likely be checking your blood pressure every day over time. This may be because your doctor is concerned about your blood pressure and related cardiac or vascular diseases. Figuring out the general range of your systolic blood pressure can help you identify potential fluctuations and health issues.The categories of systolic pressure range are:


Normal: less than 120
Prehypertension: 120 – 139
Stage One Hypertension: 140 – 159
Stage Two Hypertension: 160 or higher
Hypertensive Crisis: higher than 180

, Even though doctors pay a little bit more attention to the systolic number, your diastolic number is also important. Watching the general range of your diastolic pressure can also indicate potential problems, including hypertension. The categories of diastolic pressure range are:Normal: less than 80
Prehypertension: 80 – 89
Stage One Hypertension: 90 – 99
Stage Two Hypertension: 100 or higher
Hypertensive Crisis: higher than 110

, Although most people will measure and watch blood pressure over time, there are some instances when a rapid spike in either systolic or diastolic pressure requires immediately medical attention. This can ensure that your blood pressure is brought back to normal and minimizes the risk of severe health consequences such as heart attack and damage to your organs.Take a second reading if you get one high reading. Seek immediate medical attention if second reading is a systolic pressure over 180 or a diastolic over 110. You may have one number high and the other one normal or both could be high. Either way, it’s important to get medical attention as soon as possible.
Be aware that you may experience physical symptoms such as severe headache, shortness of breath, nosebleeds, and severe anxiety with a high systolic or diastolic reading.

, Most doctors don’t consider low pressure (for example, a reading of 85/55) a problem unless it is accompanied by noticeable signs and symptoms. Just as with hypertensive crisis, take two readings if you have a very low reading. Contact your doctor as soon as possible if you have two low readings and any of the following symptoms:Dizziness or lightheadedness
Fainting, or syncope
Dehydration and unusual thirst
Lack of concentration
Blurred vision
Nausea
Cold, clammy, and pale skin
Rapid, shallow breathing
Fatigue
Depression

, In most cases, you’ll be checking your blood pressure results over time. This can give you a sense of what is normal for you as well as factors that may contribute to it such as stress or activity. Keep your doctor informed of your readings as necessary or give her a copy of your records for your medical file. Keeping an eye on your average readings over time can also indicate possible problems for which you need medical attention.Be aware that one abnormal reading doesn’t necessarily mean you have high or low blood pressure; however, if levels stay at the same reading over a few weeks or months, it’s important to see your doctor to rule out underlying medical conditions. Remember to not wait too long to get medical attention so that you minimize the risk of serious health problems.

, Regular checkups are important to the health and wellbeing of any person. If you have issues with your blood pressure or notice fluctuations in your usual reading, this is especially true. If you have high or low blood pressure readings over the course of a few tests, schedule and appointment with your doctor. This can decrease the risk of developing conditions that can harm your heart and brain.Call your doctor if you have questions or are unsure of anything related to your blood pressure or readings your get. It’s better to be safe than sorry.

Ask if the person has vision trouble in one or both eyes.,
Watch for loss of coordination or balance.,
Note any sudden and severe headaches.,
Take note of a transient ischemic attack (TIA).,
Memorize the acronym FAST.",How to Recognize the Warning Signs of a Stroke1," The person may be unable to hold objects or suddenly lose balance while standing. Look for signs that only one side of the person's face or body has become weaker. One side of the person's mouth may droop when smiling or he may not be able to hold both arms up over his head., When certain areas of the brain are affected, the individual may have trouble speaking or understanding what is being said to her. Your loved one may look confused by what you are saying, respond in a way that indicates she didn’t understand what was said, slur her words, or speak in garbled noises that do not resemble speech.This can be very scary. Do your best to calm her after you have called your local emergency number for emergency medical treatment.


Sometimes the person will not be able to speak at all.

, During a stroke, eyesight may be suddenly and severely affected. People report losing eyesight in one or both eyes or seeing double. As the person if he cannot see or is seeing double (if he is having trouble speaking, ask him to nod yes or no if possible).You may notice that the person turns his head completely to the left to see what is in the left eye field of vision using the right eye.

, When the person loses strength in her arms or legs, you may notice the person has difficulty with balance and coordination. She may be unable to pick up a pen, or unable to coordinate walking due to one leg being unable to function correctly.You may also notice weakness or sudden stumbling and falling.

, A stroke is also called a “brain attack” and can result in a sudden headache that is described as the worst headache someone’s ever experienced. The headache may be associated with nausea and vomiting from the increased pressure in the brain., A TIA appears to be similar to a stroke (often called a “mini stroke”) but lasts less than five minutes and leaves no lasting damage. However, it is still a medical emergency and requires evaluation and treatment to reduce the potential risk of developing a stroke. These are highly predictive of a subsequent disabling stroke in hours or days after a TIA event.Doctors believe that the symptoms are caused by a transient blockage of the arteries in the brain.


About 20 percent of people who experience a TIA will go on to have a major stroke within 90 days and about two percent will have a major stroke within two days.
Experiencing TIA can lead to Multi-infarct dementia (MID), or memory loss, over time.

, FAST stands for Face, Arms, Speech, and Time, and will remind you what to check for when you suspect a person is having a stroke, as well as the importance of time. If you notice the above symptoms, it is important to call your local emergency number immediately. Minutes count when it comes to providing the best possible treatment and outcome for the person.Face: Ask the person to smile to see if one side of the face droops.
Arms: Ask the person to raise both arms. Can he at all? Does one arm drift downward?
Speech: Is the person slurring speech? Is he unable to speak at all? Is the person confused by a simple request to repeat a short sentence?
Time: Immediately call your local emergency number in the event of these symptoms. Do not hesitate.

You can even forgo sitting, and stand as much as possible during the day. Even these small changes can affect your heart.;
, Instead of parking as close as possible to your work or the grocery store, park as far away as you can. Instead of taking the elevator to get up just one or two floors, take the stairs. Simply being more active will help you increase your heart rate.

, Do common stretches after a bit of moving around to help keep your heartbeat above that resting rate. Good stretches includecalf stretches, hamstring stretches, and shoulder stretches.

, Walk in order to get around or just go for a walk for the sake of a walk. Walking is a great way to increase your heart rate. You don't even have to walk very fast! Just a normal pace will get your heart rate up and your body working.

, It sounds crude, but sex is actually very good at raising your heart rate. With foreplay plus sex, you'll easily hit the 30 minutes a day of raised heartbeat. Just 30 minutes of the activity will burn over 100 calories!

, If you have trouble doing standard exercises, yoga and tai chi are good options. These will increase your heart rate and provide excellent low-impact exercise, helping to skirt weight problems and muscle or joint issues.

, Jogging (which is a relatively slow, exaggerated running motion) is an excellent way to increase your heart rate. Start with lower impact exercises before working your way up to this, though. Starting on higher impact exercise too quickly can cause injury to your muscles.

, Hiking will not only get your heartbeat up, but it will also get you outside and experiencing the incredible world around you. You can hike in local nature areas, or you can even hike around your city! All you need is a couple of inclines and a route!

, Swimming is a great exercise that has the added bonus of being gentle on your bones. Swimming is also great if you have weight or joint problems that keep you inactive because the water will redistribute your weight, taking the pressure off of your body and allowing you to move.

, Ride a bike through your local neighborhood or in an area that is safe for bikers. You can even bike to get around, riding your bike to work or to your daily activities. You can go for a lower impact workout and keep to the flat roads, or you can give yourself a bit more exercise and look for some small hills.

, You might think of this as a kid's activity, but jump rope is actually incredibly good exercise. You'll be breathing heavy and feeling your heart pound before you know it! Just make sure you pick up a jump rope that is the right size for you. A child's rope will be too small and difficult to use for adults.

, Rock climbing, which can easily and safely be done indoors on your own or with a coach, is a wonderful way to raise your heartbeat and get in shape. Rock climbing can be a slightly more expensive exercise, but it's worth it (if you ask those who do it)!

, Progress from jogging to a full blown run. Having a track to run on is important here, as it will help you not only maintain speed but also reduce the chance of injury. Running can quickly raise your heart beat a tremendous amount.

, The gym class classic, while hard and uncomfortable, is actually really good exercise that will get your heart racing and build up important muscles all over your body. You gym teacher's weren't lying! Just make sure to do warm ups before doing exercises like this.

, Squats are an exercise where you stand with knees apart and bring your butt down as if you're sitting in a chair. It's harder than it sounds to do it right! However, it's also an excellent exercise that will raise your heartbeat and improve your core muscles, helping you to sit up straighter.

, Burpies are like the love child of all those exercises you always did in gym class. Start in a standing position, jump down onto your stomach, do a push up, and then jump back into a standing position. Repeat these movements as quickly as you can. Your heart will be absolutely racing.

In addition, a leaky heart valve can cause a heart attack. If you are unsure whether or not you are having a heart attack, you should call emergency medical responders to be safe. Heart attack symptoms include:Chest pain or pressure
Pain that travels to your neck, jaw, down the arm, or back
Feeling that you will vomit
Abdominal discomfort, especially in the upper central (epigastric) region
Heartburn or indigestion
Shortness of breath
Sweating
Exhaustion
Lightheadedness or dizziness;
, This valve is the one that leaks most frequently. In this condition, when the left ventricle contracts, blood travels both into the aorta and back into the chamber it came from (the atrium). This can increase the amount of blood in the left atrium, create more pressure in the pulmonary veins, and produce fluid build-up in the lungs. If your condition is mild, you may not notice any symptoms. If your condition is severe, you may experience:Heart palpitations when you lie on your left side
Shortness of breath
Coughing
Chest congestion
Fluid buildup in your feet and ankles
Dizziness
Chest pain
Heart failure

, When the left ventricle relaxes, blood is supposed to travel out of the heart into the aorta. But if the valve leaks, it also returns to the left ventricle. This can increase the amount of blood in the left ventricle, causing it to thicken and pump less efficiently. The walls of the aorta may also develop weak areas that may swell. Aortic valve regurgitation can be a congenital condition or be caused by high blood pressure, an infection, or injury to the valve. Symptoms include:A heart murmur when the left ventricle relaxes
Heart palpitations
Heart failure

, Blood travels through the pulmonary valve as it goes from the heart to the lungs. If the valve leaks, some blood returns to the heart instead of going to the lungs. This condition is rare, but can be caused by congenital heart problems, high blood pressure, rheumatic fever, or a heart infection. Not everyone has symptoms. If you do, they may include:A murmur between heartbeats
Enlarged lower right chamber of the heart
Chest pain
Exhaustion
Dizziness
Passing out
Heart failure

, You have tricuspid valve regurgitation if some of the blood flows backward into the right atrium instead of going to the lungs when the right ventricle contracts. This can be caused by an enlarged ventricle, emphysema, pulmonary stenosis, an infection of the tricuspid valve, a weak or injured tricuspid valve, tumors, rheumatoid arthritis, or rheumatic fever. Diet pills containing phentermine, fenfluramine, or dexfenfluramine may significantly raise your risk of tricuspid regurgitation. Symptoms may include:Weakness
Exhaustion
Swelling in the legs and feet
Abdominal bloating
Decreased urination
Pulsing veins in the neck

, The cardiologist can obtain a great deal of information by listening to the sound and timing of the blood flowing through your heart. Many valve leaks produce heart murmurs, which are atypical sounds as the blood travels through your heart. The cardiologist will evaluate:The sounds of the blood flowing through your heart. If you have a heart murmur, the doctor will consider how loud it is and when during the heart beat it occurs. This can help the doctor determine how serious your valve leak is and where in the heart it is located.
Your medical history, including any conditions that might make you more likely to develop leaky heart valves. This includes infections of the heart, injuries to the heart, high blood pressure, or a genetic predisposition to heart problems.

, This can help identify where the leaky valve is and how severe it is. This is important for determining the cause of the leak and creating a treatment plan. You cardiologist may want you to have:An echocardiogram. This exam uses sound waves to create a picture of your heart. The doctor can see if your heart is enlarged and see whether the valves have structural problems. The doctor will take measurements of the parts of the anatomy, and how well they are working. The test is typically less than 45 minutes long. The doctor or technician will put some gel on your chest and then move an ultrasound device over your chest. It is noninvasive and won’t hurt. It is also not dangerous for you.
An electrocardiogram (ECG). This test records the strength and timing of the electrical impulses that make your heartbeat. It is noninvasive, won’t hurt, and is not harmful for you. The doctor or technician will put electrodes on your skin which will enable a machine to read and measure the electrical signals of your heartbeat. This test can detect an irregular heartbeat.
A chest X-ray. X-rays do not hurt. They travel through your body without you feeling it and create an image of your heart. The doctor may be able to identify if parts of your heart are enlarged. You will need to wear a lead apron to protect your reproductive organs during this procedure.
Cardiac catheterization. This test is invasive. A small catheter enters a vein or artery and then is inserted into the chambers of your heart. The catheter measures the pressure in the different areas of your heart. This information can be helpful in diagnosing valve problems.

, A low-salt diet can help lower your blood pressure, which will in turn reduce the strain on your heart. It will not repair a defective valve, but it can reduce the likelihood that it will get worse. Even if surgery isn’t necessary for you, your doctor may still recommend you eat a low-salt diet.Depending on how high your blood pressure is, your doctor may want you to reduce your salt intake to 2,300 or even 1,500 mg per day. Some people eat as much as 3,500 mg per day.
You can reduce your salt intake by avoiding salted processed foods and canned foods with salt added. Avoid adding table salt to your food, salting meat when you cook it, or salting rice and pasta water.

, Which medications your doctor recommends will depend on your particular situation and medical history. If you are at a high risk of having blood clots or high blood pressure, your doctor will probably prescribe medications for those conditions. Medications will not repair a leaky valve, but they can improve conditions that make the leakage worse, like high blood pressure. Possible medications include:Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. These are common blood pressure medications for mild mitral regurgitation.Anticoagulants such as aspirin, warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven) and clopidogrel (Plavix). Blood clots can cause strokes and heart attacks. These medications reduce the probability that you will develop a blood clot.
Diuretics. These medications prevent you from retaining too much water. If poor circulation is causing your legs, ankles and feet to swell, you may be prescribed diuretics. They will also reduce your blood pressure. Diuretics can be used to relieve swelling caused by a tricuspid regurgitation.Statins. These medications lower cholesterol. High cholesterol is often associated with high blood pressure and it may exacerbate the leakage.
Beta blockers. Beta blockers reduce the rate and force at which your heart beats. This reduces your blood pressure and can reduce the strain on your heart.

, The standard way to repair a faulty valve is through surgery. If you have a valve repaired, be sure to go to a cardiac surgeon who specializes in valve repair. This will give you the best chances for a successful surgery. Valves can be repaired through:Annuloplasty. If you have structural problems with the tissue around the valve, it can be reinforced by implanting a ring around the valve.
Surgery on the valve itself or the supporting tissues. If the valve itself has been damaged through infection or injury, it may be necessary to repair the valve itself to stop the leak.
Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR). This is a newer, minimally invasive option for people who are unable to undergo open chest surgery.Instead of removing the faulty valve, a replacement valve is placed inside it via a catheter. The new valve is expanded and begins functioning in place of the old valve., Aortic and mitral regurgitation are common reasons for valve replacement. The first choice is generally to use as much of your own tissue as possible, but if that isn’t an option, your surgeon may recommend using tissue from a heart donor, an animal, or a metal valve. Metal valves last the longest, but increase your risk of blood clots. If you have a metal valve, you will need to take anticoagulants for the rest of your life. The new valve can be implanted using different techniques::A transcatheter aortic valve replacement. This method is used for replacing the aortic valve and has the benefit that it is less invasive than open-heart surgery. A catheter is inserted either through an artery in your leg or a cut in your chest and then used to insert the new valve.
Open-heart surgery. Heart valve surgery can prolong the life of your heart tissues and improve your quality of life. Most surgeries are successful and any complications are usually effectively managed (there is a 5% mortality rate). Possible complications include bleeding, a heart attack, an infection, an irregular heartbeat, or a stroke. If you need heart surgery, go to a specialist who is extremely experienced in the procedure you require. Ask your cardiologist for recommendations."

Get medical attention if you notice these symptoms.",How to Recognize Symptoms of Heart Failure Exacerbation," It's important to recognize when heart failure is progressing and experienced an exacerbation. However, to do this, the first step is to improve your knowledge of the symptoms of heart failure itself. This way you will be able to notice if those symptoms or worsening or if you start experiencing new symptoms., Listen to your breathing to see if it is more labored or faint than usual. Shortness of breath (called ""dyspnea"") is one of the most common symptoms of heart failure. When the left ventricle of your heart is not able to pump the blood forward, blood ""backs up"" in the pulmonary veins (the vessels that return blood from the lungs to the heart after oxygenation). The lungs then become congested, and collect fluid that prevents them from working normally and causes shortness of breath.Initially, breathlessness occurs only after exertion. It is one of the first symptoms in most patients of heart failure. Compare yourself with other people your age, or compare your current activity level with your level three to six months back to recognize if you have modified your lifestyle due to shortness of breath at exertion.
The congestion in your lungs may also cause a dry cough or wheezing.

, Some cases of heart failure are not accompanied by symptoms of congestion, but by low cardiac output, which can present itself as excessive fatigue and physical weakness.Low cardiac output means that the heart cannot pump enough blood to meet the needs of all your body tissues. As a response, your body diverts blood away from organs that are less vital, particularly muscles in the limbs, and sends it to organs that are more vital, like the heart and brain.This results in weakness, fatigue and a constant tired feeling, which makes it hard to do everyday activities, such as shopping, climbing stairs, carrying groceries, walking, or playing sports like golf.

, Edema, the accumulation of excess fluid in body tissues, is often a symptom of heart failure. Edema occurs because your heart is not able to pump your blood forward, resulting in blood backing up in the systemic veins (the veins that carry blood from our whole body to the right side of the heart). Blood then leaks out into the tissues and causes swelling, which can experienced as:Swelling in the feet, ankles and legs. Initially, you may find that your shoes feel tight.
Swelling of the abdomen. You may feel that your pants have become tight.
Generalized body swelling.
Weight gain.

, You may experience a rapid heartbeat (tachycardia) or an irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia) as symptoms of heart failure. It's important to note that both of these can also be complications of heart failure that can lead to cardiomyopathy, heart attacks, and strokes. , Get medical attention if you notice these symptoms. If you notice any of the above symptoms, you should consult your physician for testing and diagnosis.

, Exacerbation usually occurs when a change in your body places increased demand on your already weakened heart, which can't compensate to meet the demand by beating harder or faster. Triggers for exacerbation that ask your heart to do extra work that it can't do include:Failing to take heart medications correctly.
Developing a respiratory infection, like pneumonia.
Consuming too much salt.
Drinking too many fluids.
Consuming alcohol.
Other medical conditions, such as uncontrolled hypertension, anemia, poor kidney function, and other heart conditions like arrhythmia.

, While shortness of breath or labored breathing while or after exerting yourself is a common symptom of heart failure, shortness of breath in other, more restful situations is indicative of heart failure exacerbation. You may notice that your breathing becomes more labored even when doing simple tasks like getting dressed in the morning or moving between rooms. You may also experience shortness of breath even when resting. It's important to alert your doctor to these changes.Keep an eye on shortness of breath while you are lying down or sleeping. Shortness of breath while you are lying down or sleeping is perhaps the strongest indicator of heart failure, and a sign that you need immediate medical attention.
You may notice yourself suddenly waking from sleep with shortness of breath, potentially accompanied by feelings of smothering or drowning. These feelings are so strong that they may prompt you to sit upright, or seek fresh air from an open window, and to sleep propped up on pillows. Waking up short of breath usually occurs at a fixed time, usually one to two hours after falling asleep, and symptoms typically last for 15–30 minutes once you are upright.

, More severe and persistent coughing and wheezing that doesn't originate from a respiratory illness or cold can indicate the exacerbation of heart failure. You may also produce whistling sounds while breathing, which is called wheezing. This wheezing occurs because fluid accumulating in the lungs causes the airways to narrow.A cough that produces white or pinkish-colored phlegm is also a common feature of heart failure, especially if you also have shortness of breath. You may notice that your cough is more severe when lying down at night., This swelling may cause pain or discomfort. You may also notice the veins in your neck start to bulge. You may begin to notice that you can't even get your shoes on anymore and may also start to notice visible swelling of the feet, ankles, and legs.You may also experience swelling in the abdomen due to fluid buildup to the point that you begin experience stomach symptoms, including nausea, loss of appetite, or constipation.

, Weight gain is a noteworthy symptom, especially if you are already under observation for heart failure. If there's a increase of more than two pounds over the course of a day or something like three pounds in three days, this is a sign of worsening heart failure (even though it may not seem like much).


Keep track of your weight, weighing yourself daily (at the same time and without clothing on, preferably) and writing the result down in a log. This will make it easier for you to identify weight gain, which in turn can motivate you to consult your doctor about making lifestyle changes to avoid a full exacerbation.

, During heart failure, the blood supply is diverted from the stomach and intestines to the heart and brain. This can lead to problems with the digestion of food, manifesting as lack of appetite, early satiety, and nausea.You may also feel discomfort and pain in the upper right part of your abdomen, due to congestion of the liver.

, The conscious awareness of heartbeat is called palpitations and may be a symptom of heart failure. Usually, palpitations during heart failure are due to an increased heart rate, which feels like your heart is racing or throbbing. This is because when your heart begins to lose its pumping function, it compensates by beating faster.A increase in heart rate or irregular heartbeat is cause for concern and may also be accompanied by feelings of dizziness.

, Notice if you feel like your activity levels are dropping off more than normal or if you get more tired and fatigued doing activities that didn't previously tire you out. Increased fatigue isn't a symptom that on its own necessarily requires the attention of your doctor, but if accompanies some of the other signs mentioned above, then you should see your physician.Pay attention to the details—in particular what it is that is tiring you (walking, climbing stairs, etc.) and when (e.g., time of day).

, Heart failure can also cause some neurological symptoms, due to disturbances in the blood levels of some substances, especially sodium. These neurological symptoms include confusion, loss of short-term memory, and disorientation.Usually, a relative or a friend notices these behavioral and neurological symptoms first, as you will most likely be too confused to be aware of them.

, If you notice any of the above symptoms, you should call the Emergency Services and seek immediate medical attention.


Addressing heart failure exacerbation early can mean the difference between life and death. If you do not act quickly, you can suffer long-term damage to your brain and body, or death.
Make sure you contact your doctor as well, even if you end up being treated in the emergency room.

Assess the situation.,
Insist the patient drink plenty of water or other fluids.,
Provide something salty for the patient to eat.,
Think of circulation needs in relation to blood pressure.,
Determine whether or not the patient has missed necessary medications.,
Give any missed medications to the patient.,
Pump your feet and dance around on your hands a few times before standing up.",How to Raise Blood Pressure1," If this happens often, it may be chronic. Consider the health of the person at hand. Is this a result of sickness? Was anything unusual going on at the time that could have had a lowering effect on blood sugar levels? What's more, stay relaxed. There may not be a bigger problem at hand.You will need to ascertain if the symptoms point to dangerously low blood pressure. Generally the symptoms include dizziness, lightheadedness, unsteadiness, dimming or blurring of vision, weakness, fatigue, nausea, cold, clammy skin, fainting, and pale skin.;
, When blood volume is increased and dehydration is alleviated, hypotension may disappear.Sports drinks containing electrolytes return lost minerals to the body, too. Drinking these or water will keep dehydration from happening.


Another way of spiking blood pressure (temporarily, that is) is to drink caffeine. Scientists aren't quite sure how or why it does this, but it's thought that it either blocks hormones that widen your arteries or pumps up your adrenaline levels, directly causing a rise in blood pressure., The excess salt helps to make blood pressure rise. That's why heart patients are usually on low-sodium diets.


Sodium is known to raise blood pressure (and sometimes greatly), so doctors generally recommend limiting it. Check with your healthcare professional before you up your intake -- if you consume an amount that's not good for you, it can lead to heart failure (especially if you're older)., Raise the legs and put on compression stockings, if available. These are the same stockings that people use to reduce varicose veins and they're just as good for reducing blood pooling up in the legs., The problem could easily be failure to follow doctor's orders. Many medications lower or heighten blood pressure, even if just as a side effect. Certain combinations can also be more powerful than when taken alone.

, Make sure they (or you as the case may be) understand the importance of not missing doses. Or not taking too much!


In addition to their regular meds, know that acetaminophen (Tylenol) and certain anti-inflammatories and anti-depressants can also spike blood pressure levels. If you have some readily available, consider adding it in this instance., It's common for even healthy individuals to experience a dip in blood pressure when they rise after long periods of sitting. When going to stand (especially upon getting out of bed), sit up straight first and rise slowly.If you're able, get regular exercise to promote blood flow. If it's a chronic issue, keep up the exercise and eat small meals often.

Eat fruits rich in potassium.,
Consume some potassium-rich vegetables.,
Eat sources of protein that are high in potassium.,
Combine some of these items for high-potassium meals.",How to Raise Potassium Levels in the Body1," As most people know, bananas are very rich in potassium. In fact, one banana contains 594 mg of potassium. However, there are other fruits that can help you restore your levels of potassium. These fruits include:


Tomatoes (one small tomato can contain 900 mg of potassium), oranges, cantaloupe, strawberries, kiwis and the dried versions of apricots, peaches, prunes, and raisins.;
, Fruits are not the only great source of potassium. Vegetables can also give your potassium levels a boost. Veggies that will kick start your potassium intake include:


Carrots (one cup of raw carrots contains 689 mg of potassium), potatoes, spinach and other dark, leafy greens, mushrooms, and acorn squash.

, Salmon is one of the best proteins to eat when trying to restore your potassium levels. Three ounces of this fish generally contains about 319 mg of potassium. Lean beef and white beans are also excellent sources of both potassium and protein., While eating all of these potassium-rich foods separately is great, making a meal out of them is even better. Try composing your meals so that they are as high in potassium as possible. Some meal ideas include:


Yogurt (which is also potassium-rich) with bananas and raisins.
Cooked salmon with sauteed mushrooms and a spinach salad.
A snack of dried apricots and raw carrots.

Take appropriate action.,
Submit to a thorough history and physical examination by a doctor.,
Identify the type of stroke.,
Expect emergency treatment for a hemorrhagic stroke.,
Expect medications and further treatment in cases of an ischemic stroke.",How to Recognize the Warning Signs of a Stroke2," If you or a person near you experiences these symptoms, you should seek emergency medical treatment immediately. All of the above signs are strong indicators of a stroke.


You are encouraged to call the emergency medical service near you, even if these symptoms go away quickly or are painless.
Note the time that you first notice symptoms in order to help the medical staff accurately determine treatment.

, Although a medical emergency, the physician will perform a thorough and quick medical history and physical before ordering testing and treatment. Medical tests can include:Computed tomography (CT), which is a type of x-ray imaging that takes a detailed picture of the brain immediately after a suspected stroke.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which will also detect damage to the brain and may be used instead of, or in conjunction with, a CT scan.
Carotid ultrasound, which is painless and will show narrowing of the carotid arteries. This may also be helpful after a TIA when no permanent damage to the brain is expected. If the doctor notices a 70 % blockage, surgery may be necessary to prevent stroke.
Carotid angiography, which uses the insertion of a catheter, dye, and x-rays to visualize the interior of the carotid arteries.
Echocardiogram (EKG), which a doctor can use to evaluate the health of the heart and the presence of known risk factors for stroke.
Blood tests may be ordered to look for low blood sugar, which appears similar in nature to a stroke, and at the ability of your blood to clot, which can indicate a high risk factor for hemorrhagic stroke.

, Although the physical symptoms and outcomes of stroke may be similar, there are different types of strokes. The way that they happen and the subsequent treatments are different. The doctor will determine the type of stroke based on the results of all the testing.


Hemorrhagic stroke:During this type of stroke blood vessels in the brain will rupture or leak blood. The blood spills into or around the brain, depending upon the location of the blood vessel, causing pressure and swelling. This damages the cells and the tissues. Intracerebral is the most common hemorrhagic stroke and happens inside the brain tissue when a blood vessel bursts. Subarachnoid hemorrhage involves bleeding between the brain and the tissue which covers the brain. This is the subarachnoid space.
Ischemic stroke: This is the most common type of stroke and accounts for 83 percent of diagnosed strokes.A blockage in an artery in the brain from a blood clot (also called thrombus) or arterial buildup (atherosclerosis) stops the flow of blood and oxygen to the brain tissue and cells, causing inadequate blood flow (ischemia), resulting in an ischemic stroke., In cases of a hemorrhagic stroke, doctors will work quickly to stop the associated bleeding. These treatments may include:Surgical clipping or endovascular embolization to stop bleeding at the base of an aneurysm, if that was the cause of the stroke.
Surgery to evacuate the blood that has not absorbed into the brain tissue and to relieve the pressure on the brain (usually severe cases).
Surgery to remove an arteriovenous malformation if the AVM is located in an accessible area. Stereotactic radiosurgery is an advanced technique that is minimally invasive and used to remove the AVM.
Intracranial bypass to increase blood flow in some specific cases.
Immediately discontinuing blood thinners, which make it more difficult to stop a bleed in the brain.
Supportive medical care as the blood is reabsorbed by the body, such as it is after a bruise.

, Both medications and medical treatments may be used to stop a stroke or prevent further damage to the brain. Some of these options may include:Tissue plasminogen activators (TPAs) to break up blood clots in the arteries of the brain. The medication is injected into the arm of the person experiencing a stroke from a clot. It must be used within four hours of the start of the stroke; the earlier it is administered, the better the results.
Antiplatelet medications to stop further clotting in the brain and more damage. However, these medications must be taken within forty-eight hours, and they will do even more damage if the person has had a hemorrhagic stroke, so proper diagnosis is crucial.
Carotid endarterectomy or angioplasty if heart disease is present. During this procedure, a surgeon removes the inner lining or the carotid artery if it is blocked with plaque or has become thick and stiff. This will open the carotid vessels and provide more oxygenated blood to the brain and is performed when there is at least 70% blockage in the artery.
Using intra-arterial thrombolysis, during which a surgeon inserts a catheter in the groin and threads it up to the brain where he or she can release medication directly near the areas of the clots that need to be eliminated.

Take your age into account.,
Take previous strokes or TIAs into account.,
Note that women are more likely to die from stroke.,
Be aware of atrial fibrillation (AF).,
Note the presence of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs).,
Get tested for peripheral artery disease.,
Watch your blood pressure.,
Know the risks of diabetes mellitus.,
Reduce your cholesterol levels.,
Abstain from tobacco use.,
Reduce your alcohol consumption.,
Manage your weight to avoid obesity.,
Exercise to maintain good health.,
Take your family background into consideration.",How to Recognize the Warning Signs of a Stroke3," Age is the most important risk factor when determining stroke risk. The risk of having a stroke nearly doubles every ten years after people reach 55 years of age., One of the biggest risk factors for a stroke is if the person has already suffered from a stroke or transient ischemic attack (“mini-stroke”) in the past.Work closely with your doctor to minimize other risk factors if you have one of these events in your history.

, Though men are more likely to suffer from a stroke, women are more likely to suffer from a fatal stroke. The use of birth control pills also increases the risk of stroke in women., Atrial fibrillation is a rapid and weakened irregular beating in the left atrium of the heart. The condition leads to a slowing of blood flow, which increases the risk of blood clots. A doctor can diagnose AF with an electrocardiogram (ECG).Symptoms of AF include a fluttering feeling in the chest, chest pain, lightheadedness, shortness of breath, and fatigue., These malformations cause blood vessels in or around the brain to bypass normal tissue in ways that increase risk of stroke. AVMs are most often congenital (though not hereditary), and they occur in less than 1 percent of the population. However, they are more common in men than women., Peripheral artery disease is a condition in which your arteries narrow. This narrowing of the arteries makes clotting more likely and prevents the proper flow of blood throughout your body.The arteries in your legs are the ones usually affected.
Peripheral artery disease is a main risk factor for stroke.

, High blood pressure puts undue stress on your arteries and other blood vessels. This can create weak spots that rupture easily (hemorrhagic stroke) or thin spots that fill up with blood and balloon out from the artery wall (called an aneurysm).Damage to the arteries can also lead to the formation of clots and impaired blood circulation to cause ischemic strokes.

, If you suffer from diabetes, you have a greater risk of stroke because of the health problems associated with diabetes. If you suffer from diabetes, you may also have other health problems such as high cholesterol, blood pressure, and other forms heart disease, all of which can put you at an increased risk of stroke., High cholesterol is also a large risk factor for stroke. High cholesterol leads to plaque formation in the arteries and can block blood flow, which leads to stroke. Maintain a healthy diet low in trans fats to maintain appropriate cholesterol levels., Smoking tobacco damages both the heart and blood vessels. Additionally, nicotine use raises your blood pressure. Both of these issues put you at greater risk of stroke.Even exposure to secondhand smoke from others smoking raises the risk of stroke in nonsmokers., Consuming alcohol in excess can cause various medical conditions, such as high blood pressure and diabetes, that could increase your risk of stroke.


Alcohol consumption causes platelets to clump, which can lead to stroke or heart attack. Excess drinking can also cause cardiomyopathy (weakness or failing of heart muscles) and abnormalities of heart rhythm, like atrial fibrillation, which can cause the clot formation and lead to stroke.The CDC recommends that women have no more than one alcoholic beverage each day and that men have no more than two., Being obese can lead to medical conditions such as diabetes and high blood pressure, which increase the chances of being affected by stroke., Exercising regularly will effectively prevent many of the aforementioned conditions, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes.Aim for at least thirty minutes of cardio exercise every day.

, Certain ethnicities are more prone to stroke than others. This is due to a variety of genetic and physical attributes. Blacks, Hispanics, American Indians, and Alaska Natives are all at a greater risk of stroke based on predispositions.Blacks and Hispanics are also at a higher risk for sickle cell disease, which can cause red blood cells to form in an abnormal shape that makes them more likely to get stuck in blood vessels, leading to higher potential for ischemic stroke."

Drink plenty of water.,
Eat smaller meals more frequently.,
Balance your diet.,
Increase your Vitamin B12 and folate consumption.,
Reduce alcohol consumption.,
Drink caffeine.,
Try taking herbal remedies.",How to Raise Low Blood Pressure1," Low blood pressure can accompany dehydration, so you may be able to raise your blood pressure by increasing your water intake. Aim to drink at least eight to ten 8 oz cups of water per day.You should drink more water if this doesn’t help your symptoms or if you spend time outdoors or exercising.


Health drinks with electrolytes can also help raise blood pressure, but you should avoid drinks with high sugar content.;
, Eating several small meals, rather than one or two large meals, can help regulate your blood sugar and blood pressure. Aim to make these meals healthy and low in carbohydrates.When you do eat carbohydrates, avoid processed carbs such as pasta and white bread. Go for complex carbs instead, such as oatmeal, whole grain pasta, whole grain bread, and barley.

, An important way to regulate your blood pressure and improve your overall health is to eat a healthy, well-balanced diet. A balanced diet includes lean meats and fish, whole grains, and a lot of fruits and vegetables.Avoid heavily processed foods that are high in sugar and fat. While these do often contain higher levels of sodium, they are not a healthy source of other nutrients., These vitamins contribute to a healthy blood pressure function and circulation.Fortified cereal contains both minerals. Some other sources of B12 include fish and dairy products such a cheese, milk, and yogurt. Folate can be found in dark green vegetables such as broccoli and spinach., Alcohol contributes to dehydration, even if consumed in moderation. If you have problems with low blood pressure, you should avoid drinking alcohol in any amount., Caffeine constricts blood vessels, which can increase blood pressure. Increasing your caffeine intake by a moderate amount can help raise your blood pressure., Herbal remedies are not proven to help blood pressure, but there is anecdotal evidence that some herbs may lessen the effects of low blood pressure. Some of these include aniseed and rosemary.Adding these to your diet may offer some benefits, but you should ask your doctor before taking any herbal supplements. Cooking with these herbs is unlikely to have measurable effects, however.


Ginger may actually lower blood pressure, so do not use ginger supplements if you already have low blood pressure.Cinnamon may also lower your blood pressure. Do not use cinnamon supplements if you have low blood pressure.Pepper may also lower blood pressure."

Consult your doctor before taking potassium supplements.,
Take potassium supplements in pill form.,
Try a powdered or liquid form of potassium.,
Consider intravenous potassium.",How to Raise Potassium Levels in the Body2," If you are only mildly potassium deficient, eating potassium-rich foods should balance out your potassium levels. Once you have purchased potassium supplements, only take the prescribed amount--over compensating and taking more than the prescribed amount could lead to diarrhea, stomach irritation, and nausea and may cause muscle weakness, slowed heart rate, and abnormal heart rhythm.

, Extended-release form tablets are designed so that it will not dissolve in the stomach, but in the intestines. This extended release will help prevent the irritation of gastric lining. Potassium tablets should be taken with one full glass of water.Do not crush or chew potassium tablet as this will affect their extended-release feature.

, You can purchase potassium powder or liquid that can be mixed with water and then drunk. For the correct dosage, you should follow the instructions provided by your doctor. Generally, powdered and liquid potassium must be completely dissolved in a ½ glass of water. If too much of this powder or liquid is consumed, it could cause gastric irritation., Taking potassium intravenously is strictly intended for extreme cases of potassium depletion and used under strict physician supervision. If you think your potassium levels are dangerously low, talk to your doctor about intravenous potassium. Do not try this on your own. Fast infusion may lead to cardiac irritation causing life threatening irregular cardiac rhythms."

Check with your health insurance.",How to Put on Compression Stockings," When you first wake up in the morning, your legs have been slightly elevated or at least horizontal. As a result, your legs are likely not as swollen as they might be later in the day. This will make it easier to put on compression stockings.Try elevating your legs while you sleep by resting your feet on a pillow. You can also slightly tilt the foot of your mattress upward by putting a 2x4 piece of wood underneath the mattress end.;
, If your legs have any moisture on them, you might not be able to pull up the compression stockings. Sprinkle talcum powder or cornstarch on your feet and calves to absorb any excess moisture., One of the easiest ways to put on compression stockings is to turn the top part of the sock inside out. You’ll want to leave the toe of the sock right side out. Reach into the stocking and grip onto the toe., Pinch the toe so that it stays right side out while pulling the top of the stocking down over your arm. This will result in the top being inside out.

, Carefully slide the stocking off your arm so that the top remains inside out while the toe is ready for your foot.

, Putting on compression stockings can be difficult, especially if you have trouble reaching your feet. Try sitting down on a chair or on the side of the bed so that you can bend down to reach your feet.

, Wearing gloves will make it easier to grip onto the stockings and pull them up. Choose latex gloves such as those worn by healthcare professionals, or similar type gloves. Dishwashing gloves will also work., Slide your toes into the end of the sock and align the sock so that the toe of the sock is even and straight.

, As your toe holds the bottom of the sock in place, pull the bottom of your sock over your heel so that your entire foot is inside the sock.

, Use your palms to draw the stocking up and over your calf. The inside-out top part of the sock will roll upward to be right-side out. Your gloved hands will be able to grip the sock better than a bare hand.


Do not pull at the top of the sock to get it up your leg. This will likely rip the sock.

, Make sure to keep the sock straight and smooth while you bring it over your calf. Smooth out any wrinkles as you go.


If you are wearing knee-high compression stockings, they should come up to a point 2 finger widths below your knee.Some compression stockings go up to the top of the thigh.

, If your doctor has prescribed compression stockings for both legs, follow these instructions to put the sock on your other foot. Try to have the stockings come up to the same point on both legs.


Some prescriptions may only require a compression stocking for one leg., If your doctor recommends that you wear compression stockings to improve blood flow, then it’s likely you’ll need to wear them every day. Otherwise, it can be difficult to get them on your feet.Take off your compression stockings when you go to bed every night.

, If you have trouble reaching your feet or putting on your compression stockings, you might benefit from using a sock aid. This is a device or frame that resembles a foot shape. Put the sock over the device and slide your foot into the device. Then remove the device and your sock will be properly placed on your foot., If you are having trouble putting on your compression stockings because your feet or legs are swollen, try elevating your feet above your heart for 10 minutes. Lie down on your bed with your feet resting on a pillow, Before you go to bed, remove your compression stockings. This will give your legs a rest and will also give you a chance to wash your stockings.

, Gently pull down at the top of the sock with two hands. This will pull the sock down your calf so that the sock is inside out again. Remove the stocking from your foot., If you are having trouble getting the stockings off your ankles or feet, especially if you can’t reach your feet very well, try using a medical dressing stick to grip onto the compression sock and push it off your foot. This does require some arm strength, which can be difficult for some people., Hand wash your stockings with laundry soap and warm water. Wring out excess water by rolling your stockings in a towel. Hang them up to dry.Try to get at least two pairs of compression stockings, so you can have one pair to wear while the other is being laundered.

, Leg pain and/or swelling can be uncomfortable to live with, and compression stockings might make your legs feel better. Talk with your doctor to see if this option will reduce your discomfort.If you have poor blood flow in your legs, compression stockings are not the right choice.

, Your doctor will check to see if you have varicose veins, venous leg ulcers, deep vein thrombosis (blood clot in a deep vein), or lymphedema (leg swelling). If one of these conditions is present, your doctor may prescribe compression stockings for you.


You may need to wear compression stockings daily for up to two years., Almost one-third of pregnant women will develop varicose veins,which are veins typically in the legs and feet that have enlarged because of increased pressure in your veins.Wearing compression stockings can make your legs more comfortable and will promote blood circulation.


Ask your doctor if compression stockings will help your condition.

, In some cases, compression stockings will be prescribed for patients post-surgery to reduce the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), or the formation of blood clots in your veins. If your post-surgery recovery restricts your mobility or requires extended bed rest, your doctor may prescribe compression stockings., While research about the health benefits of wearing compression stockings during exercise is mixed, recovery time after exercising is decreased as blood flow is improved.Many runners and other athletes now wear compression stockings either during exercise or afterwards. It is up to you whether you find them comfortable enough to wear.


These are usually sold as compression socks, and are available at sporting goods stores and other athletic supply stores.

, The compression in the stockings is measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg).Your doctor will give you the proper pressure grade of stockings so that you are getting the proper treatment.

, Compression stockings are available in varying lengths, including knee-high and ones that reach the top of the thigh. Ask your doctor which length you need.

, Your legs will need to be measured so that you know the proper size of compression stockings to get. Your doctor may measure your legs; if not, a clerk at a medical equipment supply store should be able to help you., Locate your local medical equipment shop and verify that they carry compression stockings.


Compression stockings are also available through some online retailers. It is preferable to visit a professional to get fitted for the proper compression stockings, but if this is not an option, try shopping online for stockings.

, Some health insurance plans will cover compression stockings.You will likely need a doctor’s prescription for these stockings to be covered.

Add more sodium to your diet.Adding a pinch of salt to soups and potatoes adds flavor and increases blood pressure.,
Eat small meals.Sometimes after eating, digestion can cause blood pressure to drop.,
Avoid rapidly digestible carbs.If your body processes food very rapidly, it can lead to a decrease in blood pressure.,
Get enough vitamins and nutrients.,
Drink more water.Dehydration is the leading cause of orthostatic hypotension.,
Don’t drink alcohol.Alcohol dehydrates you and can lower your blood pressure.",How to Prevent Low Blood Pressure1," Topping a stir-fry or rice with soy sauce has the same effect; however, be careful when adding sodium to your diet. The amount of sodium you need depends on your body, age, and gender. Talk to your doctor or a trained nutritionist before adjusting the sodium content of your diet.;
, The amount of the drop occurs in direct response to the size of the meal. In other words, if you eat a large meal, you’ll experience a significant drop in blood pressure. When you eat small meals with low carbohydrate counts, you can avoid significant drops in blood pressure.


Instead of eating three large meals, try eating five or six small meals spaced evenly throughout the day.

, For instance, foods which are processed rapidly like white rice and white bread will lower your blood pressure. Foods with beans, protein, and whole grains will keep your blood pressure stable. Replace whole grain bread with white bread on your sandwich, and eat brown rice instead of white rice with beans.

, A lack of nutrients in your diet can lead to low blood pressure. For instance, if you do not have enough B12 in your diet, your body will not not have enough red blood cells. This can lead to anemia, a symptom of which is low blood pressure.A lack of folic acid can produce the same conditions. Broccoli, beans, and lentils are good sources of folic acid. Milk, eggs, fish, and fortified breakfast foods are good sources of B12. Incorporate these foods into your diet on a regular basis.

, Not only does water prevent dehydration, it increases blood volume. Increased blood volume translates to lower blood pressure. Aim to drink at least eight to ten 8-ounce glasses of water each day.


If you engage in exercise, drink more. Exercise can cause you to sweat out a good deal of your body’s water volume.
Replace sugary drinks like soda and juice with water if you struggle getting enough water each day.

, Even moderate consumption can cause your blood vessels to constrict, leading to lower blood pressure.If you’re thirsty, drink water instead.

Male family members who develop the condition by 55 and female family members diagnosed by 55 raise the risk for heart disease in children and siblings. Let your doctor know about your family history of heart disease, so you receive all the necessary screenings to detect the beginnings of cardiovascular disease, when treatment is still effective. For example, your doctor may give you medication for high blood pressure or high cholesterol levels, or he may recommend diet and exercise changes to lower your risk factors.

For women in the middle years of life, weight gain is a common occurrence. However, excess pounds increase the likelihood of diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disease. Women are typically considered overweight if their waistline exceeds 35 inches (88.9 cm). Even reducing your weight by 10 percent can offer significant health benefits.







,

There are few factors that increase your odds of developing heart disease like the smoking habit. Tobacco use increases blood pressure and makes blood more prone to clot, which can result in a heart attack or stroke. The combination of smoking and taking birth control pills is even more dangerous for women. When you kick the habit, you decrease your odds of developing heart disease by 50 percent within the first year of quitting.







,

While too much alcohol can increase blood pressure and triglycerides, one glass of red wine each day is thought to contain enough antioxidants to serve as effective heart disease prevention. You can also get antioxidants from fresh fruits like raspberries and blueberries.







,

According to the American Heart Association, women can prevent heart disease by committing to a half hour of exercise 5 or 6 days a week. Try a brisk walk, bike ride, swim or dance class. Start with a small goal and commit to it daily, slowly increasing your time and intensity level as your body adjusts to the activity.







,

Omega-3 fats have been shown to lower cholesterol levels in some patients, which can have a positive impact on heart disease risk as well. Common sources of omega-3 fats are fish like tuna and salmon, walnuts and flax seeds. Supplements are also available.







,

Many chronic conditions, like diabetes and hypertension, increase the heart disease risk. By getting annual screenings for blood pressure, blood sugar and cholesterol levels, you can treat potential problems in the early stages before a bigger health problem arises. In some cases, lifestyle changes like a reduced calorie diet and daily exercise are enough to treat these conditions. However, some patients require medication to regulate blood sugar, blood pressure or cholesterol as well.

Get regular aerobic exercise.,
Achieve and maintain a healthy weight.,
Quit smoking.,
Manage your stress levels.,
Identify the sources of stress in your life and make a list.,
Identify how you are coping with stress currently.",How to Prevent Ischemic Heart Disease1," Regular physical activity reduces cholesterol, reduces blood pressure and prevents atherosclerosis, therefore helping to prevent ischemic heart disease. You should engage in roughly 30 minutes of exercise, five times a week.Try:


Moderate-intensity physical activity (for example, brisk walk), or
Vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity (for example, running)
However, it should be emphasized that this is the minimum recommended exercise. Exercising more than this level, and opting resistance exercises such as weightlifting, result in further reduction in risk of developing ischemic heart disease.;
, Obesity is associated with an increased risk of ischemic heart disease. Obesity also causes hypertension and diabetes, which are risk factors for ischemic heart disease. Therefore, if you are overweight or obese (that is, if your BMI is >25), the healthy approaches to reduce your weight should be opted, including appropriate changes in your diet and lifestyle, and regular exercise, as discussed above.Regarding total daily calories, women should try to eat roughly 1200-1500 kcal/day, while men should aim for 1500-1800 kcal/day.

, Smoking is a very important risk factor for ischemic heart disease. Work with your doctor to come up with a plan to help you quit. This plan will involve picking a ‘start quitting’ day, and gradually weaning yourself off tobacco.


Your doctor may give you nicotine replacements, including nicotine patches and nicotine gums.

, Stress is associated with increased incidence of ischemic heart disease. The following steps will discuss how you can lower your stress levels.

, Include things like something related to your job, your family life, your friends circle, traffic jams, breaking news on the news channels, everything that makes you feel stressed must be included in the list.

, Is it any of the following unhealthy ways of coping with stress? Smoking, drinking, overeating, taking pills and sleeping for hours, fighting with others. If yes, then pay close attention to the following healthy ways of coping with stress, which are commonly called the 4 A’s of stress management:


Avoid the stress if possible. Look at your stress list and decide which situations or people who are the cause of stress in your life can be avoided. For example, if the 9 o’ clock news bulletin is stressing, switch off your television at 9.
Alter the stress if it can’t be avoided. Don’t just let things or people stress you. Take the control of your life in your own hands. Think about those unavoidable stress situations very thoroughly, focusing on identifying how you can make those situations not-so-stressful. For example, if you are preparing for your test, and your roommate is disturbing you, deal with the problem head on, rather than just getting stressed. Simply tell him to stop talking!
Adapt to the stress. If the situation can’t be altered, it may be you need to change your reaction to the situation. It may involve changing your expectations of people, looking at a broader perspective and finding positive aspects of the situation.
Accept the stress if nothing else works out. Trying to control the uncontrollable can never be beneficial. So, if something in your stress list cannot be avoided or altered, and there is nothing you can do to adapt to the situation, you should accept the situation as it is, rather than fighting a war that you can’t win.

Have your child's blood pressure measured annually.Ideally, you want to have a blood pressure measurement recorded each year by your child's family doctor (normally as part of your child's generally health check-up).,
Understand how high blood pressure is diagnosed in children.In adults, high blood pressure is defined as three or more measurements greater than 140 (systolic) over 90 (diastolic).,
Recognize the signs and symptoms of high blood pressure.High blood pressure in children may come on gradually, or all of a sudden.,
Treat the underlying condition, if there is one.If your child is found to have concerning blood pressure measurements, the doctor will likely proceed with tests to determine whether or not there is an identifiable underlying cause that is responsible for the elevated blood pressure readings.",How to Prevent High Childhood Blood Pressure1," The purpose of this is to ensure that her blood pressure is in the normal range, and to catch any abnormalities (or signs of high blood pressure) as soon as possible.


High blood pressure is normally not worrisome if it is mild and has only been going on for a short amount of time. This is why catching it early is key, and this is best done through regular monitoring of your child's blood pressure.
Doctors usually begin routine testing of blood pressure at age three, sooner if your child has risk factors for high blood pressure.
The risk happens when your child's blood pressure is elevated significantly over a period of time, as this can lead to long-term complications and increase your child's chances of having a heart attack or a stroke in her adult years, or rarely, lead to health complications while she is still a child.;
, However, in children, measurements for blood pressure are not as simple, because a child's blood pressure depends upon a number of factors including age, sex, and body size and composition. Therefore, your child's doctor will use a chart (similar to a growth chart) to measure and assess blood pressure, and to compare it to other children of the same age and sex.


""Pre-hypertension"" (the precursor to high blood pressure) is defined as anything above the 90th percentile on the charts that your doctor will be using, on three or more measurements.
""Hypertension"" (actual high blood pressure) is defined as anything above the 95th percentile on the charts that your doctor will be using, on three or more measurements.
The purpose of regular blood pressure measurements is to catch your child if and when he enters the ""pre-hypertension"" stage, so that further evaluation and treatment can be received as needed before your child develops worrisome high blood pressure.

, Therefore, it is important to be aware of signs and symptoms that may indicate high blood pressure, and to bring your child for a visit to her doctor if the following symptoms are present:


Shortness of breath
Unusual fatigue
A headache
Dizziness
Visual disturbances.

, Sometimes there is a cause that can be identified, and other times there is not. Some possible causes include:


Kidney disease
Obesity
Heart disease
Diabetes
An endocrine disorder.
Medications that are causing high blood pressure as a side effect
Note that if an underlying cause can be found, obtaining treatment for this often resolves the high blood pressure issue."

Eat meals as a family.",How to Prevent Heart Disease in Kids1," If bad eating habits are started at a young age, there is a good chance they will carry over into adult life. Try to keep your child’s intake of salt to a minimum, as salt has been linked to high blood pressure, stroke, and heart disease.


0 to 12 month old should get a maximum of 1 gram of salt each day.1 to 3 year olds should get two grams of salt each day.y.4 to 6 year olds can eat 3 grams of salt each day.y.7 to 10 year olds can eat 5 grams each day.y.11 years and older can get 6 grams of salt each day.y.;
, Teach your child that junk food is bad at an early age. Junk foods like chips, candy, and fried foods are all empty calories that lack almost any nutritional value. They are also generally high in salts, sugars, and bad fats.

, Bad fats are saturated fats and trans fats. These kinds of fats can raise your child’s lipo protein, or bad cholesterol, levels. This could result in heart complications later on in life.


Bad fats can be found in foods like processes cakes and cookies, deep fried foods, candy, and whole fat dairy products.

, Omega-3 promotes a healthy heart, and has been shown to reduce the chance of heart attacks and blood clots. Foods that contain omega-3 fatty acids include:


sardines, salmon, soybeans, flax seeds, walnuts, tofu, brussels sprouts, cauliflower, shrimp and winter squash.

, Fiber can help to lower your LDL cholesterol (bad cholesterol levels) which in turn can protect you against heart disease.Fiber can be found in grains, fruits, and vegetables.

, Obesity can either be hereditary, or linked to eating a lot of bad foods. Being obese can increase your child’s chances of heart disease and stroke later on in light. Foods that contain a lot of sugar and fat should be avoided in order to maintain your child’s healthy weight.


High saturated fats and sugar foods include: chocolate, sweets, fizzy drinks, ice cream, biscuits, crisps, fast food such as chicken nuggets or burger and other processed foods such as hotdogs and breakfast cereals that contain additional sugar.

, Eating meals as a family can help you to keep track of what foods your child is eating. Cutting out bad foods needs to be a family-wide change, as children often learn by example; if your child sees you snacking on a candy bar, she will be much more likely to snack on such foods herself.


Eating together can help you to monitor how much your child is eating, as well as what sort of foods she is eating.

Change body positions slowly.,
Avoid crossing your legs while sitting.,
Exercise regularly.,
Wear compression stockings.,
Avoid long, hot showers.",How to Raise Low Blood Pressure2," To reduce the effects of blood-pressure-related dizziness, be slow and deliberate with your motions. Use particular care when moving from lying down to sitting or from sitting to standing., Crossing your legs can restrict your circulation.In order to maintain healthy circulation to your body, try to sit with your legs comfortably resting with your knees about hip-width apart.

, Regular exercise benefits your health generally, but it will also help encourage and regulate healthy blood flow. Something as simple as going for a brisk 20-minute walk every day can help your mental and physical well-being.


Avoid exercises that involve heavy lifting if your blood pressure has not yet regulated. This can lead to strain or injury., Compression stockings are often worn to help reduce the swelling and pooling of blood in the lower body and to improve circulation.Wearing low-grade compression stockings during daily activities will help regulate blood pressure by keeping blood circulating regularly through your veins., The hot water from showers and spas can cause your blood vessels to expand, which can lead to a further drop in blood pressure. This can cause dizziness and fainting. You can remedy this by taking warm (rather than hot) showers and avoiding spas or hot tubs. You may also want to install a handrail or a shower chair in your shower in case of a dizzy spell."

New onset low blood pressure can be a major warning sign of life-threatening illness, especially for people with diabetes.


Even if the sudden drop in blood pressure is your only symptom, contact your doctor.

, Some medications lower your blood pressure as a side effect.Discuss with your doctor whether any of your current medications could be lowering your blood pressure and if a change in your prescription medication regimen could help you raise your low blood pressure., Low blood pressure could be a sign of another medical condition such as diabetes, heart disease, cortisone deficiency, or a thyroid problem.Have your doctor evaluate you for other medical conditions if your low blood pressure remains a problem after making diet and lifestyle changes., Fludrocortisone and Midodrine are both medications that can help raise blood pressure. Ask your physician if one of these medications would be right for your situation.


People are not generally prescribed medicine for low blood pressure, as it's not often a cause for concern unless it presents with symptoms., If your low blood pressure is accompanied by other symptoms, or if you had normal or even high blood pressure and now you suddenly have low blood pressure, you should seek medical attention.

Alert someone to get help.,
Whatever happens, get down.",How to Prevent Fainting," Simply put, the brain needs sugar and your body needs water. To prevent your body and brain from shutting down, your salt and sugar levels need to be stable.A quick way to do this is to drink some juice and eat a small bag of pretzels. You should feel better almost immediately.


It seems a little counter-intuitive that your body needs salt to stay hydrated, but it’s true. Water goes where the salt is; if you don’t have any salt in your system, the fluid doesn’t stay in your blood vessels.;
, Another common reason for fainting is that the body is overheated. If you’re in a hot, stuffy environment and start to feel dizzy, it’s your body telling you to get out. Consider these ideas to get cooler:


Shed some layers, if at all possible
Get into a less-crowded area (this way you also don’t collapse onto others)
Get near a window or door for airflow
Splash cool water on your face and drink a cold drink

, Though sugary drinks are great for turning your brain back on when it's running on empty, your entire body needs straight up healthy, pure hydration too, in the form of plain, unflavored water. You probably know if you’re getting enough or not. If you faint regularly, it could be because you just don’t drink enough.


Urine, ideally, should be clear or nearly clear. If your urine is very yellow, drink more water. If that’s too boring for your tastebuds, teas and unsweetened fruit juices are good, too.

, If you're feeling the slightest bit faint, lie down. Stay down for at least 15 minutes. Once you feel better, get up slowly. Putting your body into a vertical position means that in order for blood to get to your brain, it has to fight gravity. When you get up too quickly, that blood immediately drops down and leaves your brain wondering what happened. This can bring on the sense of fainting. If this is the culprit, move slowly, especially while getting out of bed.


This goes double if you've just fainted. Whenever you're feeling weak or dizzy, always move slowly and with caution. This is your body telling you it can't keep up with your pace. Give it a break and lie down.

, When we’re anxious, it’s natural to start breathing quickly and even hyperventilate. If this gets out of control, you brain will stop receiving oxygen; you’re not breathing deeply enough for it to process what it needs. If you think your fainting may be due to nervousness, concentrating on your breathing and slowing it down may make the urge disappear.


Count as you breathe: 6 seconds inhaling and 8 seconds exhaling. After a few rounds, you may find that your anxiety is dissipating.
Focusing on your breathing also distracts you from whatever it is that's making you nervous. This is another reason it may be easier to calm down.

, Blood sugar and salt levels, heat, and hydration are very common reasons for fainting and, in most cases, aren’t cause for alarm. However, there are a few other things that cause certain individuals to faint. If you know what triggers the urge for you, avoid it. It could be due to a few things, but here are the most common:



Alcohol. In a few unfortunate souls, alcohol leads to fainting.It’s because alcohol expands the blood vessels, leading to a drop in blood pressure.

Needles, blood, injuries or related phobias. In some individuals, certain phobias can trigger the vagus nerve which widens blood vessels, slows the heart rate, and drops blood pressure, resulting in fainting.Emotions. Severe emotions, like fear and anxiety, can change breathing and cause a drop in blood pressure, amongst other negative effects that can lead to fainting.

, The side effects of certain medications include fainting and dizziness. If you’ve just started a new medication and have just started experiencing the urge to faint, talk to your doctor to switch. It's like that your medication is the culprit.


Fainting is, in general, not serious. However, if you do faint, you may hurt yourself during your fall. This is the main reason it’s important to switch medications if at all possible.

, What it all boils down to is that the brain needs blood and oxygen to properly function. If you see someone who’s pale and complains of dizziness and fatigue, get them to lie down in an open area - they're probably going to faint.


If there's no place for them to lie down, have them sit with their head between their knees. This isn't as good as fully lying down, but it should stave off the urge to faint, at least for the time being.

, Someone fainting in a crowd of people is not uncommon, largely because it's so hot and there's no airflow between bodies. If you're with someone who's about to faint, get them in an open area where air can flow and the temperature isn't too hot and stuffy.


If you're stuck in a room and there aren't a lot of options, get them near an open door or window. Just a bit more airflow can make all the difference, even if the room is still too hot for comfort.

, The brain perks up with salt and sugar. It's highly likely they need hydration and energy, so a slightly sugary drink and a small amount of salt is best to get their brain back in the game. Help them drink and eat if need be; they may not have the energy.


The salt is actually for hydration. When there's salt in the body, the body then sends water to it. With no salt, water doesn't get processed into the cells it needs to be a part of.

, A first-time fainter will likely be scared by what they're feeling. They may have blurry vision, be unable to hear properly, and may have a very difficult time standing up. This stage can last minutes before the faint eventually happens or the urge goes away. Let them know that they're likely going to faint, but all will be fine once it's finally over.


Assure them that most fainting isn't dangerous. As long as they don't hit their head (which you will make sure doesn't happen), in a few minutes they'll be fine again.

, If this person is about to faint, be sure to stay by their side to quite literally catch them if they fall. Do not leave them for help unless you absolutely positively have to. They need you for moral support, too.


Instead, flag down someone, even if it's a stranger 50 feet (15.2 m) away. Tell them that the person you're with has fainted. They can find someone associated with the building you're next to, and they can hopefully bring some water and a snack, in addition to calling whoever needs called (parents, doctor, etc.).

, Fainting is generally caused by a lack of blood flow to the brain. Tensing your muscles in your limbs increases your blood pressure, which can stave off a fainting spell.This can be done before a fainting spell and in general, just to make sure your blood pressure is up.


Get into a squatting position (holding your balance against a wall, just in case) and tense your leg muscles repeatedly
Clasp your hands together in front of you and tense your arm muscles repeatedly.
If you're sitting, consider crossing your legs. This is commonly recommended to people who often faint when having blood drawn, for example.
Try these a few times - if it doesn’t seem to be working, move to a laying down position instead.

, People who faint regularly due to medication sometimes find that they can train their bodies to fight it. One common method is “tilt training,” where you stand up against a wall with your heels about six inches (15 cm) away from it. You keep this position for about 5 minutes without moving. For some reason, it “uncrosses the wires” in your brain, staving off a spell.Try to practice this in larger and larger increments, until you can do it for about 20 minutes at a time without feeling faint. This is a practice you do over time, preventing fainting from coming on - it's not to be used in the heat of the moment.

, If you have the energy, grab a salty snack to munch on. Alternatively, ask someone near you to find you a snack (let them know you're feeling faint). And if fainting is common for you, carry around a snack with you for a situation such as this.


A bit of juice or water won't hurt, either. Your body needs hydration, and salty snacks and juice or water is the best thing for it.

, You'll likely have about a minute or so (more or less, depending on the spell) of warning that you're going to faint. In this time, try to think about getting into an open area where you can lie down. The lying down is for you - the open area is so you don't hurt yourself.


Whatever you do, get away from stairs. If you faint, you could fall down them, gravely injuring yourself. The same goes for pointy edges of tables and desks.

, If you're in a school or a public area, tell the person nearest you that you're going to faint and to get help. After this, lie down. Ideally, someone will come to you with a snack and some water and help you handle the situation when you come to.


This can be a serious event in some locations as a paying customer who faints may mean the establishment is doing something wrong (they need more ventilation, fewer people allowed in at once, etc.). Rest assured that if you're in public, someone will come to help you.

, Even if you skip all the above steps, if you get yourself down to the ground, you'll likely be fine. If you do this consciously, you will not hurt yourself. If you do it unconsciously, you could seriously hurt yourself, and possibly others around you. Lying down is your number one rule.


What was the number one rule? That's right: lie down. It will save you possible injury and your behavior will likely alert those around you that something is wrong. What's more, once you get down, you'll be a lot more comfortable.

Do not stand up suddenly.,
Sleep with your head elevated.When you angle your body in such a way that your head rests slightly above your legs, you can overcome the effects of gravity on your blood pressure.,
Squat when reaching down.,
Don’t lie down longer than necessary.,
Don’t sit too long in one position.Sitting too long can also lead to hypotension.,
Don’t stand up for too long in one position.If you have a job which requires you to stand for long periods of time, find time to work your legs.,
Stay cool.",How to Prevent Low Blood Pressure2," If you have orthostatic (or postural) hypotension, the mechanisms which under normal conditions will prevent blood from pooling in your legs fail. You might experience dizziness, fainting, or feel light-headed. Limit these effects by standing up slowly after lying down.


Practice deep breathing before rising. Breathe in for four seconds, hold it one second, then breathe out over three seconds. Repeat for a minute or two to increase your blood flow before rising.

, You can achieve this in several ways. A simple solution is to stack bricks below the head of the bed frame. You could also purchase a mechanized bed which allows you to adjust the level mechanically.

, Don’t bend at the waist. Bending at the waist can cause your blood pressure to become imbalanced and drop. For instance, if you drop a piece of candy, bend at the knees and slowly lower your body down near the piece of candy. Grasp the candy with your hand when it is within reach. Push off from the floor with your heels slowly and return to a standing position. Keep your head above your shoulders during the entire process.

, Lying down for a prolonged period can lead to hypotension.Try not to surpass the recommended six to eight hours of sleep each night. When you wake in the morning, get up to brush your teeth, eat breakfast, and engage in your morning routine. Do not lie on the couch reading or watching TV for hours on end.

, If you’re on a long plane ride where you’re immobile, get up to walk down the aisle at least once each hour. Do the same if you’re on a bus. If you’re stuck in a car for a long ride, pull off the road once each hour in order to walk around a gas station or rest area for a few minutes.

, Physical activity will keep your blood pressure from dropping excessively.


For instance, suppose you are a dishwasher at a fine restaurant. After standing in front of the sink for thirty minutes or so, you could begin lifting your legs one at a time. Bending at the knees, bring the heel of one foot back and up toward your butt as far as it will go. Hold the position for three seconds, then do the same with the other foot.
You could also place one foot on an elevated object like a chair or low ledge, then lean forward for a count of five. Switch to your other foot and do the same.

, Warm temperatures can lower your blood pressure.If you’re spending significant amounts of time in a warm environment either inside or out, take time to rest occasionally. Move to a cool place by a fan or beneath a tree where you can lower your body temperature and increase your blood pressure.

Manage your stress levels.,
Eat a healthy diet.,
Achieve a healthy weight.,
Stop smoking.,
Exercise regularly.",How to Prevent Low Blood Pressure3," You can prevent heart problems by limiting stress. Engage in hobbies you enjoy and spend time with friends. Try yoga, deep breathing techniques, and regular exercise — at least 30 minutes five days per week — in order to reduce stress. Identify situations or people that stress you out and avoid them when possible.

, A diet rich in whole grains, fruits, and vegetables will keep your heart healthy and strong. Avoid processed foods with high levels of salt, sugar, and fat. Eat foods rich in vitamins and nutrients but low in calories like spinach, broccoli, kale, and strawberries. Obtain protein from lean sources like soy, nuts, seeds, and eggs. Avoid red meat.Eat berries in cereal, for dessert, or as a healthy snack.
Incorporate kale, spinach, and other leafy greens into salads and wraps.

,

Keeping your body mass index (BMI) within the healthy range is an important way to prevent heart problems. Monitor your caloric intake each day with an activity monitor like Fitbit, or use a diary to track the calories your burned and those you took in. If you need to lose weight, take in fewer calories each day than you burn. When you've reached a healthy weight, ensure the calories you burn and ingest each day are of equal amounts.

A useful BMI calculator is available at http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/educational/lose_wt/BMI/bmicalc.htm.
You also need to make sure you eat enough calories to avoid lightheadedness and episodes of fatigue and blood sugar fluctuations. Aim to eat at least 300 – 400 calories three times per day, plus one to two 200-calorie snacks. If you are trying to lose weight, these numbers may be different, so be sure to personalize your meals for your individual needs. Remember that women should not consume fewer than 1,200 calories daily and men should not consume fewer than 1,500.

,

If you smoke, quit as soon as possible. Reduce your intake from, for instance, one pack each day to one every two days. After a week or so, reduce your intake again by half. Continue in this way until you quit. Try nicotine patches or gum to curb cravings., You can strengthen your heart through even moderate exercise. Start slowly by incorporating simple physical activity into your daily routine. For instance, you could walk up stairs instead of taking an elevator, or ride your bike to work instead of driving.


While all exercise is beneficial, cardio is most important for strengthening the heart. Riding a bike or going for a run are two great options.
Work out with a friend or spouse to increase the fun. A workout buddy is also useful for keeping you on track with your workout goals.

Monitor your blood pressure regularly as you age.,
Keep an eye on your blood pressure if you are pregnant.,
Tell your doctor if you suffer from an illness or pre-existing condition.,
Take care when using medication.Many medications result in lowered blood pressure as either a side or primary effect of the pill.",How to Prevent Low Blood Pressure4,"

Older bodies have a harder time regulating blood pressure than younger bodies. Some people develop hypotension as they age. If you are experience regular bouts of fainting or dizziness, or feel lightheaded often, consult a doctor about your symptoms.

As people age, they are often placed on various medications to manage conditions they may develop over their lifetime. Sometimes weight loss can necessitate a need to adjust or discontinue your medication. Keep an up to date list of all your medications on you at all times, like in your purse or wallet.

, During pregnancy, a woman’s circulatory system changes. These changes can lead to a drop in blood pressure. While blood pressure usually returns to normal after pregnancy, you should stay aware of whether or not your blood pressure is changing during pregnancy and check it after giving birth to ensure it has returned to normal., Endocrine conditions including low blood sugar, diabetes, Addison’s disease, and thyroid disorders can lead to hypotension. Parkinson’s disease and other central nervous system disorders can also lower your blood pressure. Serious infections or pulmonary embolism, similarly, can reduce your blood pressure.

With this information in mind, your doctor will be able to prescribe medications and courses of treatment which will not lead to low blood pressure., High blood pressure medicines like calcium channel blockers, nitrates, beta blockers, and diuretics, for instance, can lower your blood pressure beyond where it should be. If your medication is causing your blood pressure to drop excessively low and you experience fainting or lightheadedness, talk to your doctor about alternative medications which might not have the same effect.

Eat a ‘heart- healthy’ diet.,
Eat more fruits, vegetables, and whole grain products.,
Switch to lean proteins.,
Eat less fatty foods.,
Keep hypertension in mind.",How to Prevent Ischemic Heart Disease2," A heart-healthy diet contains more fiber, vitamins, and minerals while eating less calories and fats, especially saturated fats and trans- fats because these bad fats deposit in vessels and cause atherosclerosis leading to ischemic heart disease. Among meats, red meats contain bad fats, so they should be avoided and poultry and fish should be preferred. Salt, sugar and artificial sweeteners should also be avoided.

, They are rich in vitamins (especially antioxidant vitamins A,C and E which clear the body’s toxic oxygen metabolites), minerals and fiber, while low in bad fats and calories.


Eat more whole grain products, like brown rice and whole grain pasta, as whole grain products are rich in fiber.

, Poultry and fish can help to prevent this condition. Fish, in particular, is good for your heart because it contains omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, which are good for strengthening heart muscles.

, Switch to low-fat dairy products, non-tropical vegetable oils and nuts (because they contain low levels of bad fats as compared to products containing saturated fats and trans fats, which cause deposition of cholesterol in blood vessels.

, For patients who are suffering from hypertension, additional recommendations including reducing sodium intake to 1500mg/day. At the very least decrease your daily consumption by 1000mg/day, by reducing the consumption of sodium containing salts. Sodium makes our body holds on to water, thus extra water stays in our body. This raises our blood pressure, which increases the risk of atherosclerosis. Therefore, decreased intake of sodium prevents atherosclerosis and thus prevents reduction in oxygen and blood supply to the heart


This pattern should be incorporated into the diet according to personal and cultural preferences; therefore you should consult your doctor/nutritionist about applying these principles in your daily diet. Appropriate calorie requirement is determined according to the weight and lifestyle of the individual.

Take statins.,
Get the right dose of statin medication.,
Treat underlying conditions.",How to Prevent Ischemic Heart Disease3," Statins are drugs that are used to lower blood cholesterol levels. They interfere with an enzyme (HMG Co-A reductase) that is involved in synthesis of cholesterol. You are a candidate of statin therapy if you belong to one of the following four statin-benefit groups:


Patients having clinical Athero-Sclerotic Cardio-Vascular Disease ( ASCVD)
Having very high LDL cholesterol levels (190 mg/dL or higher)
Patients who have type 2 diabetes and are between 40-75 years of age
Having a 7.5% or higher risk of heart attack or stroke in the next 10 years, as calculated by your healthcare provider.

, If you belong to one of the above mentioned groups, you doctor will advise you treatment with statins, for example:


Tab. Atorvastatin 40mg-80mg taken orally, once a day.
Tab. Rosuvastatin 20mg-40mg taken orally, once a day.
The usual side effects include muscle pain, fatigue, lethargy and liver toxicity, and statin treatment requires regular monitoring. Therefore, this treatment should only be started under supervision of a doctor.

, Diabetes mellitus and hypertension are risk factors for development of ischemic heart disease. However, in these patients, adequately controlling blood glucose levels and high blood pressure lowers this risk.Therefore, if you are suffering from one of these diseases, you should consult your doctor for adequate drugs and lifestyle management of these conditions.

Encourage your child to be active.Just like high blood pressure in adults can be diminished with a good exercise program, the same is true in children.,
Cook healthy meals.Providing nutritious meals for your child is a key aspect of preventing (and treating) childhood hypertension.,
Help your child to stay at a healthy weight.Your child's risk of developing high blood pressure has been shown in medical studies to be correlated to his weight.",How to Prevent High Childhood Blood Pressure2," Aerobic exercise is best for the treatment and prevention of high blood pressure. Aerobic exercise includes anything that elevates your heart rate for 20-30 minutes or longer — things such as jogging, swimming, or riding a bike.


Your child may prefer more ""fun sports,"" so consider sports that involve running and elevate your child's heart rate like soccer, basketball, or hockey.
It may also be motivational to get the whole family involved, and to all create a more active lifestyle together. Perhaps this involves weekend trips to the park to play sports, or vacations that have an active component. Having everyone on the same page can help to motivate your child to stay active.
It is also key to limit (or altogether avoid) your child's exposure to secondhand smoke, as this is an additional risk factor for childhood hypertension (high blood pressure).

, Foods to stay away from include processed foods that are high in salt, as well as sweets that are high in sugar. Explain to your child the importance of eating well, and aim for a well-balanced meal with protein, fruits and vegetables, and carbohydrates with a lower glycemic index (such as whole grains, quinoa, and brown rice).


Excess salt consumption (which is very high in processed foods) and eating bad fats (such as those present in junk food) are the two main things to stay away from if you are worried about the development of childhood high blood pressure.

, Therefore, ask your child's doctor about an ideal weight to aim for, and strategies to help you and your child achieve this goal.


It has also been noted that rapid weight gain has a higher correlation to high blood pressure than slower weight gain.
Therefore, if you notice your child gaining weight quickly over a short period of time, take steps to correct this as soon as possible.
If you need advice on how to do so, book an appointment with your child's family doctor.

Help your child to maintain a healthy weight.,
Try to limit the amount of time your child spends sitting in front of the computer or TV.,
Help your child to exercise regularly.,
Consider keeping an inventory of your child’s activities.,
Keep your teen from smoking, and do not smoke around your children.",How to Prevent Heart Disease in Kids2," While maintaining your child’s diet is a large part of being able to manage your child’s weight, exercising and being physically fit also play a part. To keep your child at a healthy weight, you can check her body mass index (BMI). To do this:


BMI is measured by the weight (mass) of your child in kilograms divided by the height in mass squared.
The ideal BMI is 18.5 to 25, so a BMI of 25 percent or more means that your child is overweight., One way to help keep your child healthy is to encourage physical activity, rather than sitting around in front of the computer or TV.


Sign your child up for a sports team, or plan fun physical activities for the whole family, like hiking or biking.

, Active children tend to grow up and become active adults. Regular exercise is important because it helps to control your child’s weight; it can also help to boost your child’s self-esteem and confidence. Exercising could include playing sports like soccer or test, running, biking, hiking, swimming, snowboarding, or rock climbing; the possibilities are endless.


If your child has a medical condition that may keep her from exercising as often as she should, work with her doctor to come up with an exercise regimen that takes your child’s condition into account.

, If you are concerned about your child’s weight or heart health, keep track of your child’s physical activities in a log or planner.


Doing this could help you to pinpoint the problem areas, like the fact that your child watches three hours of TV every Saturday morning.

, Smoking can increase your heart rate and tighten the major arteries in your body, making your heart work harder. This could lead to heart disease in the future.If you smoke, make sure to do so far away from your child. You should also seriously consider quitting for your own health.
If you think your child may be smoking, talk to her about the dangers of smoking.

"
Don’t smoke.,
Be active.,
Reduce your alcohol consumption.,
Eat more fruits and vegetables.,
Reduce your fat intake.,
Avoid fatty meats.,
Reduce hypertension by eating low-sodium foods.,
Call an ambulance if you might be having a heart attack.,
Call an ambulance if you are a woman with unusual symptoms.,
Identify an unstable angina.",How to Prevent Angina," Smoking contributes to hardening your arteries. This raises your risk for angina, hypertension, heart failure, and having a stroke. Quitting will significantly improve your health. If you need help quitting there are many resources for social support and getting medical assistance:Get social support by seeing a counselor, joining a support group, or calling hotlines.
Get medical help by talking to your doctor, using nicotine replacement therapy, or trying medications.;
, Consult your doctor before you start a new exercise regime. For some people exercise can bring on an episode of angina. This means that it is very important to check with your doctor before you start a new exercise program.If you think exercise might trigger angina for you, consult your doctor before starting any new exercise program. There are several options the doctor might suggest. The doctor might advise that you take medications before exercising to prevent angina. Another option may be for you to start easy and then slowly increase the amount of exercise you do as you get in good enough shape to avoid an angina attack.
Talk to your doctor about what forms of exercise are compatible with your health condition. The doctor may suggest that you start with activities that are less strenuous like walking, swimming, or biking. It is important not to do too much too soon because angina is a sign that you may be prone to heart attacks.

, Alcoholic drinks are high in calories. Drinking a lot can make you prone to obesity and increase the strain on your heart. If you do drink, stay within the recommended limits:Women should consume one or less one servings per day. Men should consume to two or less.
A drink is one beer, a glass of wine, or 1.5 ounces of liquor.

, Fruits and vegetables are healthy for your heart because they are low in calories and fat, yet have the fiber and nutrients to satisfy your appetite. Most people don’t eat nearly enough fruits and vegetables. The recommended daily amount is two to three servings of each. Eating many different fruits and vegetables will keep your meals interesting and give you the vitamins you need.Eat fruits for dessert. A fruit salad with bananas, apples, grapes, and orange slices will satisfy any sweet tooth at the end of the meal.
Eat vegetables as snacks. They are usually less juicy than fruits and easy to take with you to the office or to school. Tuck a carrot or green pepper slices into your bag in the morning.
Scrutinize the canned items you purchase. Fruits that are canned in sugary syrups will be higher in calories than fresh fruits. Similarly, many vegetables are often canned in salt water. Look for canned foods that don’t have sugar and salt added.

, Ideally you should eat no more than about 3 tablespoons of fats, such as butter, per day. Most people eat more fats than they need, so there are lots of ways to lower your fat consumption and make the fats you eat less harmful to you.When you do eat fats, it matters which ones you choose. Avoid saturated fats, trans fats, and dietary cholesterol. Saturated fats are usually solid at room temperature, like butter. It’s a little more difficult to avoid trans fats, but you can check on the packaging of processed foods. “Partially hydrogenated” fats are usually trans fats.Opt for heart-healthy fats such as margarines designed to reduce your cholesterol like Benecol, Promise Activ, or Smart Balance. When you cook, instead of using butter, try olive, canola, vegetable, or nut oils.
The following fat sources are generally less healthy for you: Lard, cream sauces, bacon fat, butter, palm, cottonseed, and coconut oils, chocolate, cocoa butter, hydrogenated margarine, and nondairy creamers., Steaks are tasty, but they are generally higher in fat than poultry and fish. Meat and fish are good sources of protein, but be careful not to overdo it. Eat, at most, 6 ounces of meat per day. Make your protein consumption as healthy as possible by:Cutting off any fat you see around the edges
Removing the skin —there is usually a layer of fat underneath
Baking, roasting, or grilling instead of frying
Substituting with plant-based sources of protein, such as beans or tofu

, Hypertension is also called high blood pressure. A high-sodium diet can make you prone to developing hypertension. This increases the strain on your heart. Try cutting down on sodium by:Using less salt when you cook. Instead of adding a large pinch of salt, just add a light sprinkle.
Checking the sodium content on pre-packaged or canned foods. Many have salt added as flavoring. Try replacing salty snacks with healthier alternatives like fruits or vegetables. A green pepper or an orange is just as easy to pack into your bag as a bag of chips.
Eating out less. Someone else preparing your food means you can't control the amount of salt added. Restaurants may use more salt than you would at home.

, Angina can be a heart attack symptom. If you have an episode of angina and are unsure about whether you could be having a heart attack, it is better to be safe and call an ambulance. People experiencing angina and heart attacks often report:Chest pain
Pressure or tightness in the chest
Pain that may radiate to your back, shoulder, arms, and/or up to your neck and jaw
Dizziness
Nausea
Sweating
Difficulty breathing
Exhaustion

, Women do not always experience the classic symptoms that men do. Women are less likely to experience chest pain, but they are still in need of immediate care. Women may report:Discomfort in the back, neck or jaw. This may occur without chest pain.
Discomfort that feels like a sharp, stabbing pain rather than a feeling of pressure
Feeling nauseous
Abdominal pain
Feeling like you can’t catch your breath
Fatigue

, Unstable anginas are frequently symptoms or precursors to heart attacks. If you are having an unstable angina, it is vital that you call an ambulance and get medical care as soon as possible. Indications that you are experiencing an unstable angina are:New, worsening or persistent chest discomfort
Discomfort that does not subside within five minutes of taking angina medication. If the medication does not help within five minutes, call an ambulance."

Purchase a blood pressure monitor.,
Set up to check your blood pressure.,
Position yourself properly.,
Measure at the same time every day.,
Inflate the cuff.,
Remain calm.,
Remove the cuff.,
Record your results.,
Take additional readings.,
Consult your doctor.",How to Monitor Blood Pressure," If you are checking your blood pressure at home, purchase an automatic cuff-style monitor. This can help give you the most accurate readings of your pressure in addition to being more simple to use than aneroid sphygmomanometers, which is the technical name of hand-employed blood pressure monitors.A digital or automatic monitor has a cuff that inflates at the push of a button and requires no real work from you.This is probably your easiest option if you are monitoring your blood pressure from home.
Choose a monitor that is validated and approved by an international organization such as the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation, the British Hypertension Society and the International Protocol for the Validation of Automated BP Measuring Devices.Make sure the monitor is properly calibrated — talk to your doctor or a medical supply store about calibration.
If you have special needs, such as being elderly or pregnant, make sure to choose a monitor specifically suited to your purposes.Make sure the cuff fits your arm by measuring the width around your bicep.Most companies make different sizes, which will help you get the most accurate reading possible.Too small of a cuff can cause false elevated readings, too large of a cuff can give false low blood pressure readings.
You can buy blood pressure monitors at many pharmacies and most medical supply stores. Your insurance company may cover the cost if you’re using the device to manage a medical condition. Make sure you can return or exchange if the apparatus doesn't work or malfunctions.;
, There are many factors that can affect your blood pressure reading. Preparing yourself for your monitoring test can give the most accurate readings.In preparation for your test:


Avoid testing right after you wake up.
Avoid eating or drinking anything for 30 minutes before testing.
Avoid caffeine and tobacco for 30 minutes before testing.
Avoid exercising for 30 minutes before testing, even if it’s light walking.
Empty your bladder.Make sure to read the device instructions before you do any testing.

, Before and during the test, it’s important that you position your body and arm properly. Sitting quietly and in a supported, upright position can help you get the most accurate reading.Sit down and relax for at least 30 minutes before you test your pressure.Do your best to not move or talk during the actual testing.Sit with your back straight and supported, such as in a dining room chair. Keep your feet flat on the floor and don’t cross your legs.Support your bare arm on a table, desk, or the arm of a chair. Your arm should rest at the level of your heart, for which you might need a pillow or cushion to prop it up.The cuff should be directly above the eye, or crook, of your elbow., Run the blood pressure monitoring test(s) at the exact same time every day. This can give you the most accurate reading and help you identify potential problems.You may want to measure in the mornings and evenings when you are most relaxed. Your doctor may also recommend optimal times for you to run the test.

, Once you’ve made the necessary preparations and sat quietly for a while, you can turn on the machine to begin testing. You may need to hit a specific button to inflate the cuff, which you should do as calmly as possible to minimize the risk of elevating your pressure.If the cuff becomes uncomfortable or too tight at any juncture, or if you get lightheaded, turn off the machine or engage the emergency release button.
Continue to remain still while the cuff is inflating., Once you inflate the cuff, the test should begin. It’s important that you remain as still and calm as possible. This can minimize the risk of getting an inaccurate reading.Don’t move or talk while the monitoring is testing if you can avoid it.Wait until the testing stops and the cuff deflates or the monitor displays your results.
Don't forget to breathe and don't take deep breaths — just breathe as you normally would.

, Some digital monitors will automatically deflate the cuff when they're finished testing, while others may require you to press a button. Once the testing is complete and the air is deflated from the cuff, remove your arm.You may feel slightly lightheaded when you remove the cuff. This should subside quickly.

, It’s important to accurately record your test results as soon as you are able after the monitoring. Record all relevant data in a notebook, on a computer, or see if your device will automatically record your results. These results can help identify trends in your pressure and help your doctor correctly diagnose any issues.Note what your blood pressure reading is along with the time and date you took the test. For example, “January 5, 2016 at 10:00am 120/80.”
The 120/80 would be whatever pressure the test measured. The top number represents your systolic pressure, which measures the pressure in your arteries when your heart beats. The bottom number represents your diastolic pressure, which measures pressure in your arteries between heartbeats.A normal reading is a systolic number between 110 and 120. A normal reading for the diastolic number is lower than 80., In order to get the most accurate readings and picture of your blood pressure, take one or two additional readings after the first test. Make sure to record the results of these tests as well.Wait one to two minutes in between tests to get additional readings.
Make sure to follow the same procedure for additional tests that you did with the rest. Sit still and remain calm as much as possible., If you notice elevated or low blood pressure over a couple of readings, contact your doctor as soon as possible. This can help minimize the risk of developing conditions that can harm your heart and brain.Write down any symptoms that may be occurring with your high or low blood pressure and report these to your doctor. Headaches with elevated blood pressure can indicated potential problems. Dizziness with standing or changing positions can give physicians clues toward a diagnosis.
In the event that your systolic pressure rises above 180 or your diastolic above 110, seek emergency medical treatment immediately.Contact your doctor at any point if you have questions or are unsure of anything."

Exercise.,
Give up drinking.,
Quit smoking.,
Cut down on caffeine.,
Be careful with medications.,
Avoid stress.",How to Minimize the Risk of Arrhythmia1," When you want to avoid conditions that can cause arrhythmia, conditioning your heart to be stronger is a good first step. To do this, you need to exercise for at least 30 minutes, five times per week. Heart problems are common in obese people, so exercise can help overweight people to lose and control their weight. Exercise also helps the heart to pump sufficient blood throughout the body.


Basic cardio exercises include walking, jogging, swimming and biking. These activities should be done four to five times per week, for a minimum of 30 minutes.People with pre-existing heart disease or arrhythmia are advised to see a doctor before proceeding with an exercise plan. The types of exercises you can do may be different than others. People with pre-existing conditions are usually advised to start gently and slowly increase the intensity of exercise over time.;
, Drinking alcohol may contribute to vasoconstriction, which can cause your heart to pump twice as fast. It can also affect the electrical impulses in your heart. These things may trigger arrhythmia. To avoid this, stop drinking so it doesn't cause further damage.If you are at risk for heart arrhythmia, you should not drink any alcohol. The consumption alone can cause an irregular heartbeat., Carbon monoxide may increase ventricular fibrillation (VF),in which the heart just twitches and stops pumping any blood to the brain, lungs, kidneys, or within itself. This state is lethal and will lead to death.Ask your doctor about ways to quit, such as gum, patches, lozenges, shots, medication, or group therapy.

, Coffee acts as a stimulant which increases the heart’s pumping action. This additional stress may trigger arrhythmia.This is typically true for caffeine in large doses in all people, but any caffeine can cause heart arrhythmia in those at risk.


The average person does not need to necessarily cut out caffeine completely. Instead, make sure you are consuming what is considered normal amounts for adults in one day, about 400mg., Certain over the counter and prescription medications have negative side effects that may cause arrhythmias. These medications include some cough and cold medicines, which have certain ingredients that change your heart rate. Prescription medication that do similar things include antibiotics and antifungals, drugs used in psychotherapy such as antidepressants like SSRI’s, MAOI’s, TCA’s, diuretics, and agents used to control sugar levels.Always talk to your doctor before taking any medications, as some drugs may increase your heart rate.

, High levels of stress can impact general heart health, though it may not have a direct impact on arrhythmia. Stress increases cortisol levels, which constricts the blood vessels and makes the heart pump twice as much.


Learn to cope with stressful events by sharing your worries and concerns with someone else, by going to spas or by doing yoga and meditation.
You can also avoid stress by cutting back on work, taking a vacation, and spending more time with your friends and loved ones."

Assess your current fitness levels.,
Exercise for 30 minutes each day.,
Avoid or quit smoking cigarettes.,
Maintain a healthy body weight.",How to Manage Hypertension with Healthy Habits1," A great way to reduce or manage hypertension is through increasing your physical fitness. Begin by assessing your current fitness level. Ask your doctor to measure your cardiorespiratory fitness. This can be calculated using algorithms and does not require your doctor to have any exercise equipment at their office. Individuals can increase their fitness relatively easily by introducing a small amount of activity into their daily routine., You can manage hypertension with regular physical activity. Exercising for a minimum of 30 minutes each day can actually help to reduce your blood pressure. The best type of exercise to reduce blood pressure is some form of cardiovascular activity. For example, take your dog for a 30 minute walk each day.You can also try jogging, cycling, or swimming.
You can track your fitness goals by wearing a step counter, such as a Fitbit.

, The nicotine contained in cigarettes and other tobacco products raises blood pressure. As a result, you should quit or avoid smoking in order to help manage hypertension. It can be very difficult to quit smoking because it is both psychologically and physically addictive. Try to quit smoking by:Avoiding triggers: Many people who smoke have a cigarette while engaging in certain activities. For example, during a coffee break, while consuming alcohol, after breakfast, etc. Learn your triggers and try to avoid or change them.
Changing habits: Instead of smoking during your morning coffee break, try taking a walk. By distracting yourself with a new activity you can help to fight or offset cravings.
Finding support: It is important that you have a strong support network to help you quit smoking. If you know someone else who is interested in quitting, try quitting together. This way you can support each other.

, Being overweight can lead to hypertension and increased blood pressure. If you weigh 10% or more over your ideal body weight, you can actually reduce your blood pressure through weight loss. A loss of just 10 lbs can lower your blood pressure. In order to lose weight you will need to follow a healthy diet and exercise routine.Ask your doctor to help you calculate a suitable weight for your height and body type.

Keep a journal.,
Visit your doctor for diagnosis.,
Consider an electrocardiogram.,
Get a blood test.",How to Manage Angina Pain with Home Remedies1," Write in a journal to track patterns or changes in your daily routine. This can help your doctor determine if your pain is a result of an underlying heart problem, especially if you experience chest pain frequently. Angina can be a sign of coronary heart disease (CHD), even if initial tests don't point to the disease. However, not all chest pain or discomfort is a sign of CHD. Panic attacks and other lung or heart conditions can also cause chest pain. Your doctor may ask about your symptoms, risk factors for heart disease, and your family history regarding CHD and other heart conditions.Take note of the following things in your journal:


What the pain feels like, symptoms you experience when you have chest pain, such as high blood pressure, and any symptoms you experience afterwards, such as nausea or dizziness.
How often you experience chest pain, where you feel pain or discomfort, the severity of the pain and how long the pain lasts.
Dietary changes or foods you ate two to three days prior to experiencing chest pain or indigestion. Also note any beverages such as coffee, tea, and soda, and how frequently you drink them per day or per week.
New exercise regimes or recreational activities that cause physical exertion.
Any stressful environments, work or relationships that may be causing symptoms of chest pain.
Any other conditions you may have or any illnesses you may have had, such as a fever or cold, prior to experiencing chest pain.
Any drugs, medications, supplements, herbs or home remedies you are currently using or may have used in the past two weeks.
If your chest pain is interfering with your daily activities.;
, Any kind of chest pain should be checked by your doctor, since it may be a symptom of an underlying condition. Your doctor may suggest lifestyle changes, medicines or medical procedures depending on the type and severity of your angina pain. Different types of angina have different symptoms and require different treatments. , ,If you have angina, you may diagnosed with one of the following:


Stable angina: Stable angina is the most common type which follows a regular pattern, such as when it occurs and what factors may trigger it. It usually occurs after stress or physical activity and may last one to 15 minutes. Stable angina isn’t a heart attack, but suggests that a heart attack is more likely to occur in the future. If you have stable angina, you can learn its pattern and predict when the pain will occur. The pain usually goes away a few minutes after you rest or take your angina medicine (usually nitroglycerin, taken sublingually or under the tongue).
Variant angina: Variant angina is rare. A spasm in a coronary artery causes this type of angina. Variant angina usually occurs while you're at rest, and the pain can be severe. It usually happens between midnight and early morning. Smoking is a major risk factor for this type of angina. Medicine can relieve this type of angina.
Unstable angina: Unstable angina doesn’t follow a pattern and it may occur more often and be more severe than stable angina. It often occurs while the person is at rest. This type is very dangerous as it suggests that a heart attack may happen soon and requires emergency treatment. Unstable angina also can occur with or without physical exertion — it often happens without physical activity. Rest or medicine may not relieve the pain.
Microvascular angina: Microvascular angina can be more severe and last longer than other types of angina. It is often noticed during routine activities and times of psychological stress. Symptoms include shortness of breath, sleep problems, fatigue and lack of energy. Medicine may not relieve this type of angina.

, Your doctor may suggest getting an electrocardiogram (ECG) to determine if you may have heart disease. If you experience angina pain or palpitations, an electrocardiogram is usually the first test to determine if you have heart disease. An ECG is a test that records the electrical activity of the heart to measure any damage to the heart, heart rate, size and position of heart chambers. It also measures the effects of drugs or devices you may be using to manage chest pain. In addition, an ECG can be used to monitor stress levels. The procedure for ECG is painless, done by attaching patches called electrodes to your arms, legs or chest to monitor heart activity. , Ask your doctor about an ECG if you experience angina pain and have had heart problems in the past or have a strong history of heart disease in your family. Make sure your healthcare provider knows about all the medications you are taking, as some can interfere with test results. Exercising or drinking cold water immediately before an ECG may cause false results.

, Blood tests check the levels of certain fats, cholesterol, sugar, and proteins in your blood. Abnormal levels may show that you have risk factors for coronary heart disease. Your doctor may recommend a blood test to check the level of a protein called C-reactive protein (CRP) in your blood. High levels of CRP in the blood may increase the risk for coronary heart disease and heart attack. Your doctor also may recommend a blood test to check for low levels of hemoglobin in your blood. Hemoglobin is an iron-rich protein in red blood cells. It helps the blood cells carry oxygen from the lungs to all parts of your body. If your hemoglobin level is low, you may have a condition called anemia.

Take your prescribed medications.,
Discuss cardioversion with your doctor.,
Get a catheter ablation.,
Consider getting a pacemaker.",How to Minimize the Risk of Arrhythmia2," If you are at risk of arrhythmia, there are medications that may be prescribed by your physician to control your heart rate. These are not over-the-counter drugs and are only available on prescription.



Anti-arrhythmic drugs: Beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, amiodarone and procainamide are some of the drugs that target Beta receptors and certain ionic channels located in the heart to normalize the heart rate as well as control blood pressure.

, Cardioversion is a procedure in which a cardiologist uses a machine to give the heart an electrical shock to help it conduct electricity within your heart and help restore a normal rhythm. This is done by placing patches or paddles on your chest and releasing the electric current into your chest.


This can be used in non-emergency conditions to help correct arrhythmias, especially in the case of blocked pacemakers., A doctor can identify the specific area of the heart where arrhythmias occur the most. With this procedure, your doctor threads catheters through your blood vessels to your heart. The catheters then emit extreme heat, extreme cold, or radio wave frequency to block the area of the heart that is causing the abnormal rhythm., Doctors may implant a pacemaker, which is a tiny device that is implanted in your body that facilitates electrical impulses to the damaged node in the heart to help it pump more slowly. Nodes are the source of the electrical impulses that help the heart to pump blood.


If the pacemaker feels an irregular heart rhythm, it emits an electrical impulse that stimulates your heart to beat correctly.
Also ask about implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). ICDs are very similar to a pacemaker except they help the ventricles, or lower portions, of you heart. They also emit electrical pulses to keep your heart at a correct rhythm when the normal rhythm falters."

Know what arrhythmia means.,
Recognize the signs and symptoms of arrhythmia.,
Research your family history.,
Keep a check on your blood pressure.High blood pressure can put you at risk for arrhythmia.,
Watch out for other risk factors.,
Work with your personal risk factors.",How to Minimize the Risk of Arrhythmia3," When the heart does not beat properly, it does not pump blood effectively all over the body, especially to the organs that are highly dependent on blood supply such as the brain, lungs and kidneys. Inadequate blood supply may cause these organs to become damaged in the long run and eventually shut down.According to the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention, an estimated 600,000 people die from sudden cardiac death per year and up to 50% or patients have sudden death as the first manifestation of cardiac disease., Normally, the heart fires impulses that start from the sinoatrial node. However some conditions, such as blocks in the conduction pathway, predispose the heart to fire in abnormal rates that cause irregular beats. These irregular beats may decrease blood supply to the vital organs.


This can lead to symptoms such as heart palpitations, fatigue, slow heart beats, chest pain, loss of consciousness, dizziness, lightheadedness, mental confusion, fainting, shortness of breath, and sudden death., Family history is the most significant risk factor for arrhythmia. Figure out if an immediate relative has heart disease and find out what age he was when he discovered the arrhythmia. This can make a difference — arrhythmia in an 80-year-old is most likely not genetic, but an arrhythmia in a 20-year-old is much more likely. Look for conditions such as a heart attack, angina, angioplasty, or a blocked artery. These conditions are genetic and cannot be changed.


Genetics plays the most important role in how you should manage yourself because these risk factors are ones that you cannot change. However, you can make sure you follow a healthy lifestyle that reduces any additional risk of arrhythmia over time., To keep a watch on your blood pressure, check your blood pressure often. You can get free readings from machines found at many pharmacies, grocery stores, or general stores.If you systolic blood pressure, which is the top number, is 140 or higher, you need to change your lifestyle, such as reduced sodium diet weight loss and close follow up. If you have a family history of coronary artery disease, you most likely will need medication and lifestyles changes to help reduce it., There are a few other conditions that can cause arrhythmia. Overactive and underactive thyroids can cause arrhythmia. Individuals with obstructive sleep apnea may suffer from some for of arrhythmia as well. You may also suffer an arrhythmia if you have an electrolyte imbalance in your blood.


Some of these conditions can be treated in other ways, so ask your doctor about treating the underlying condition that puts you at risk of arrhythmia., The risk factors for arrhythmia are varied and can affect each person differently. You need to be aware of how many risk factors you have. Make sure you understand your particular risk profile, which your doctor can help your to understand.


Once you understand, set personal goals specific to you personal risk factor profile so that your actions will help you the most.

Know the limitations of diet.,
Follow a balanced diet.,
Increase omega-3 fatty acids.,
Add avocados to your diet.,
Use olive oil.,
Snack on nuts.,
Consume more fresh berries.,
Try to eat more beans.,
Include flaxseed in your diet.",How to Minimize the Risk of Arrhythmia4," A heart-healthy diet is a good idea to improve overall heart health, but arrhythmia, which are a very specific electrical problem with the heart that, for the most part, is inborn and cannot be altered by diet., Eating a balanced diet is the easiest way to minimize the risk of arrhythmia. Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and protein sources from meat, poultry and dairy products.


See your doctor or a nutritionist and ask them to plan a heart-healthy diet for you to follow.

, Omega-3 is a type of healthy oil that is beneficial for the heart. Omega-3 fatty acid acts like a broom which sweeps LDL away from the arteries. It also help balance the rhythm of your heart.Eat oatmeal for breakfast because it is rich in omega-3s. Bake or steam salmon for dinner because salmon is a deep sea fish that is rich in omega-3 fatty acids.


Sweeping LDL away is especially important for the coronary arteries that are located near the heart, as plaque build-up from cholesterol is a common cause of coronary artery disease.
Add some fruit to your breakfast or some vegetables and whole-grain bread to your salmon to make them complete, healthy meals.
If you don't like salmon, try tuna, mackerel, or herring., Avocado is a rich source of monosaturated fats, which help to raise HDL (high density lipoprotein, or the “good cholesterol”) while decreasing LDL levels. Add avocado to salads, into sandwiches, or add a slice to any snack.You can also make desserts with avocado as well, such as chocolate mousse. These desserts are better for you because they use better, healthier ingredients., Like avocado, olive oil is a rich source of monosaturated fats that decrease LDL. Add olive oil to a marinade, as part of a dressing on a salad, or use it when sauteing vegetables. This will incorporate just enough of the oil into your diet to get the heart healthy benefits without increasing your fat intake too much.


When you're in the grocery store, look for “extra virgin” olive oil as it is less processed than regular olive oil.
Olive oil is a great substitute for butter or other oils when you cook., Live fish and oatmeal, nuts are also rich in omega-3 fatty acids and other healthy fats. Healthy fats help you lose weight and have more energy. Nuts also have fiber in them, which will help your overall health. Try eating a handful of walnuts, pecans, macadamias, or almonds as a tasty, healthy snack.You can also add nuts to recipes, such as almond crusted fish or roasted walnuts with sauteed green beans.

, Berries are naturally full of antioxidants, which reduce harmful substances and toxins in the body. They also contain anti-inflammatory properties that help to reduce the risk of heart disease as well as cancer. Grab a handful as a healthy, sweet snack instead of processed, refined sugar filled sweets.


Also try sprinkling some fresh berries like blueberries, raspberries, strawberries, or blackberries over your morning cereal or add them to yogurt., Beans are high in fiber, which helps to reduce cholesterol by pulling out LDL from your blood. Beans also contain omega 3 fatty acids and calcium, which help reduce heart problems and possible arrhythmia.


Try adding black beans to Mexican dishes, chickpeas or cannellini beans to a salad, and kidney beans to soups and stews. You can also eat them by themselves as a side dish to any meal, such as steamed salmon or baked chicken., Flaxseed is rich in fiber as well as omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids that are good for the heart. You can combine with your morning oatmeal or add a teaspoon of flaxseed to baked goods..


Also try flaxseed meal, which you can add to baked goods as well."

Choose nutritious foods.,
Increase your potassium intake.,
Decrease the amount of sodium in your diet.,
Consume less alcohol.,
Consider your caffeine consumption.",How to Manage Hypertension with Healthy Habits2," In order to manage hypertension, you should maintain a diet that is rich in whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. For instance, use the online guidelines provided in the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet to help make healthy food choices. You should also try to choose low-fat dairy products and stay away from saturated fats.For example, try low-fat yogurt and cottage cheese.

, One way to help decrease elevated or high blood pressure is by eating a diet high in potassium. Avoid simply taking potassium supplements, especially if you have a kidney disorder. Instead, you should eat foods that are high in potassium.Foods high in potassium include fruits such as bananas, mangos, papayas, and kiwis; vegetables such as baked potatoes and sweet potatoes; and certain protein sources like pinto beans and lentils., Sodium can contribute to increased blood pressure and hypertension. As a result, you should make sure your daily sodium intake is no more than 2,300 mg per day. You can reduce the amount of sodium you eat by reading food labels carefully and cutting down on processed food consumption.You should also avoid adding salt to your meals and choose low sodium options whenever possible.

, Drinking too much alcohol can raise your blood pressure and lead to weight gain. That being said, a small amount of alcohol consumption is fine. The average woman, and men over the age of 65, should not consume more than one alcoholic beverage per day. Men under the age of 65 should not consume more than two alcoholic drinks per day.One alcoholic beverage is equivalent to 12 ounces (355 ml) of beer, 5 ounces (148 ml) of wine, or 1.5 ounces (44 ml) of liquor., The impact of caffeine on blood pressure is not fully understood. For example, people who rarely drink caffeine may experience an increase in blood pressure immediately following a cup of coffee. However, people who consume caffeine on a regular basis may not experience the same spike in blood pressure.To determine if caffeine impacts your blood pressure, take your blood pressure 30 minutes after consuming a caffeinated beverage. If your blood pressure increases by 5 to 10 mm Hg than you should probably reduce the amount of caffeine you consume.

Create time to relax.,
Practice breathing exercises.,
Avoid your stress triggers.,
Set realistic expectations.",How to Manage Hypertension with Healthy Habits3," Set aside time each day to engage in an activity that you enjoy this is a great way to reduce stress. This will allow you to unwind from the stress of the day. For example, if you enjoy reading, you can read for 30 minutes every night before bed. Setting aside time devoted to self-care can help you reduce stress and high blood pressure.


For example, take a vacation, go to the spa, exercise, read, or watch television.
While it is unclear if there is a link between stress and long-term hypertension, it is known that stress increases the risk of heart disease, which is related to high blood pressure. In addition, common, unhealthy ways of coping with stress (overeating, drinking, smoking) can cause hypertension.Reducing stress should be a priority for your overall wellbeing and health.

, Practicing focused breathing exercises is also a great way to reduce stress and consequently high blood pressure. You can spend 5-10 minutes each day meditating and completing different breathing exercises. These exercises can also be excellent for reducing anxiety during stressful situations.


Take deep breaths and count to five while you inhale and then again while you exhale. This will allow you to clear your mind and focus only on your breathing.

, Many people have certain triggers that cause them to experience elevated stress and anxiety levels. If you want to manage your hypertension it is a good idea to avoid or control these stress triggers.For example, if you get stressed while driving during rush hour traffic, you could ask your boss to shift your hours slightly so that you can avoid the traffic. You could say “Could I work from home until about 10am and then leave the office at 6pm? I find driving in heavy traffic stressful and it impacts my productivity.”
If you are unable to change your hours, you could try listening to calming music or a podcast to help you relax while driving. Or look for other modes of transportation, such as taking the train.

, In many instances people place too much pressure on themselves, which can lead to the development of stress and anxiety. One way to reduce stress and manage your blood pressure is by setting realistic expectations for yourself. For example, give yourself enough time to complete specific tasks. Do not wait to the last minute to complete assignments for work.Alternatively, you may need to say “no” if you are overwhelmed with your workload.

"
Take your blood pressure twice daily.,
Visit your doctor regularly.,
Take medication.,
Try herbal remedies to reduce blood pressure.,
Get support from friends and family.",How to Manage Hypertension with Healthy Habits4," In order to manage hypertension, you should take your blood pressure daily. This will help you determine if your healthy habits are actually having an impact. Purchase a blood pressure monitor at your local drug store. They typically range in price from $50 to $100.Blood pressure measurements are made up of two parts: systolic pressure (the first, or ""top"" number) and diastolic pressure (the second, or ""bottom"" number). Normal blood pressure is less than 120/80. Hypertension is when your blood pressure is above 140/90.Record your blood pressure each time that you take it. This way you can track your progress over time.
For the best results take your blood pressure at the same time each day. You should also take it multiple times to ensure that you have an accurate reading.

, If you have been diagnosed with hypertension, you should visit your doctor at least once, possibly twice a year to help monitor your condition. High blood pressure can lead to a number of severe medical issues, including heart attacks and strokes. As a result, you should have regular medical check ups to make sure you are managing the hypertension.If you are unable to decrease your blood pressure through healthy habits, your doctor may need to prescribe medicine.

, If your doctor has prescribed medication to help you manage hypertension, make sure you take the medication regularly and follow all of the instructions provided. There are a wide variety of medications, called antihypertensives, used to treat hypertension. For example diuretics, such as Chlorthalidone are prescribed to get rid of excess salt and reduce blood pressure. You may also be prescribed Beta-Blockers, ACE Inhibitors, Calcium Channel Blockers, Alpha Blockers, Blood Vessel Dilators, as well as a host of other types of medication.Talk with your doctor to find a medication that is right for your condition.
Never change or stop taking your medication without consulting your doctor.

, You can also try reducing your blood pressure by taking a variety of different herbal remedies. Discuss any alternative treatments with your doctor first, as they can interact with other medications you may be taking. Try these remedies to see if they help manage your blood pressure:


Hibiscus tea: Hibiscus acts as a natural diuretic to remove salt from the blood stream. Make a hibiscus tea by 1 – 2 teaspoons of dried hibiscus with 1 cup of hot water. You can also add lemon and honey for taste.Coconut water: Drink 8 ounces (236 milliliters) of coconut water one to two times per day. Coconut water contains potassium which can help reduce blood pressure.Fish Oil: Take fish oil tablets daily. They have been linked to lowering blood pressure and can be purchased at your local drug store., Supportive friends and family can also help you manage and monitor hypertension. For instance, they can help encourage you to make healthy lifestyle changes. They can also help drive you to the doctor for regular check ups.You can also try and find a local support group. This will allow you to meet other people who are dealing with hypertension.

Drink lots of water.,
Get enough sleep.,
Avoid sitting for long periods.,
Avoid stress.,
Get moderate exercise.,
Monitor your blood pressure.,
Apply a warm towel compress.,
Take warm showers.,
Quit smoking.,
Limit alcohol intake.",How to Manage Angina Pain with Home Remedies2," Water helps flush out excess sodium that causes high blood pressure and hypertension. These symptoms often lead to angina pain and coronary heart disease.


Aim to drink at least eight ounces of water every two hours., 2 liters of water is the daily recommendation for the average adult. If you take caffeinated beverages, take 1 liter of water for every cup (1 fluid oz.) of caffeine.
If you are taking blood-thinning medications or diuretics (water pills) for angina pain, ask your doctor about how much water you should consume.
Not getting enough water can also lead to dehydration. Dehydration can cause headaches, irritability, dizziness, irregular heartbeat and shortness of breath. Non-caffeinated, glucose-free sports drinks with electrolytes can help alleviate dehydration as well.

, Not getting enough sleep has been linked to increased risk of high blood pressure, hypertension, diabetes, obesity and chronic stress, all of which can cause angina pain and increase the risk for heart disease. Studies show that sleep deprivation can weaken the immune system, increase the production of stress hormones, put you at higher risk for chronic disease and lower life expectancy., If you suffer from sleep apnea or insomnia, talk to your doctor for possible treatments. Other ways you can make sure you get enough sleep include:


Avoid caffeine, nicotine, alcohol and sugary drinks four to six hours before sleeping. These can act as a stimulant to keep you awake.
A quiet, dark, and cool environment can help promote sleep. Use heavy curtains or an eye mask to block light. Light is a powerful cue that tells the brain that it's time to wake up. Keep the temperature comfortably cool (between 65 and 75°F or 18.3 to 23.9°C), and keep the room well ventilated.
Make sure your bedroom is equipped with a comfortable mattress and pillows. Change your sheets and pillow covers often. If you have trouble breathing, try to prop your head up on a pillow to improve air flow.
Struggling to fall asleep just leads to frustration. If you’re not asleep after 20 minutes, get out of bed, go to another room and do something relaxing until you are tired enough to sleep.
Avoid activities such as work or exercise three to four hours prior to sleeping. Physically and psychologically stressful activities can cause the body to secrete the stress hormone cortisol, which is associated with increasing alertness. Try listening to relaxing music or doing some light reading a few hours before sleeping.
Having a regular sleep schedule helps to ensure better quality and consistent sleep. Try to set a routine by going to bed early and waking up early to set your body’s internal clock.
If you have congestive heart failure in addition to angina you may need to elevate the bed with pillows when you sleep so that your head is above your heart.

, Sitting idly greatly increases the risk for angina pain and other heart diseases. Do not sit in front of the TV, behind a work desk or driver’s seat for more than two hours if you have been diagnosed with angina.Think about ways you can walk while you work, such as standing while talking on the phone. Take five minute breaks between work to stretch your arms and legs. The muscle activity needed for standing and other movement seems to trigger important processes related to the breakdown of fats and sugars within the body. When you sit, these processes stall and your health risks increase. When you're standing or actively moving, you kick the processes back into action.

, While a small amount of stress is healthy, it can cause blood pressure, anxiety, irregular heartbeat and alter immune function, triggering angina pain and in severe cases cause heart attacks. As people age, achieving a relaxation response after a stressful event becomes more difficult.To avoid stress, practice meditation exercises like yoga and tai chi, make time for recreation and be sure to get enough rest. Other simpler ways to reduce stress are:


Slow, deep breathing in a quiet environment. Breath in through your nose and out through your mouth. Try and feel the diaphragm muscle when you breath in order to stimulate the parasympathetic nervous system.
Focus on positive outcomes.
Restructure priorities and eliminate unnecessary tasks.
Reduce use of electronic devices. These may cause eye-strain and trigger headaches.
Use humor. Research has found humor to be an effective way to deal with acute stress.
Listen to relaxing music.

, Studies show that regular exercise is beneficial for individuals with stable angina as it helps regulate high blood pressure, cholesterol, diabetes and obesity. Aerobic exercise, in particular, increases blood and oxygen flow to the heart while at rest and when you're doing everyday things like climbing stairs or carrying groceries. It also helps reduce the body’s production of stress hormones and has a positive impact on psychological health.,,Talk with your healthcare practitioner or a registered clinical exercise physiologist (RCEP) before starting an exercise program. Ask for specific program recommendations to improve cardiovascular fitness, increase muscle strength and endurance, and improve range of motion.
An extended warm-up and cool-down may reduce the risk of angina or other cardiovascular complications following exercise. Warming up and cooling down are important parts of every exercise routine. They help the body make the transition from rest to activity and back again, and can help prevent soreness or injury, especially in older people.
Choose low-impact activities such as walking, cycling or water exercises, which involve large muscles groups and can be done continuously. If your fitness level is low, start with shorter sessions (10 to 15 minutes) and gradually build up to 30 minutes five or more days per week.
Perform light-resistance circuit training and whole-body range-of-motion exercises two to three days per week.
Closely monitor your intensity level and stay within your recommended target heart-rate zone. Take frequent breaks during activity if needed. Stop exercising immediately if you experience angina. Contact your physician if you experience chest pain, labored breathing or extreme fatigue.
Don’t eat for two hours prior to exercise. Drink plenty of fluids before, during and after a workout. If nitroglycerin has been prescribed, always carry it with you, especially during exercise.

, Irregular heartbeat, high or low blood pressure and increased stress can trigger angina pain, and in severe cases cause heart attack. Your doctor may ask you to keep track of your blood pressure at home. To do this, you will need to get a home blood pressure monitor. The monitor you choose should be of good quality and fit well., , Digital monitors are the best choice for most people. Practice using the monitor with your doctor or nurse to make sure you are taking your blood pressure correctly. A digital blood pressure monitor will not be as accurate if your body is moving when you are using it. Also, an irregular heart rate will make the reading less accurate. Your arm should be supported, with your upper arm at heart level and feet on the floor with your back supported and legs uncrossed. It's best to measure your blood pressure after you rest for at least five minutes.
Blood pressure should not be checked right after experiencing stress, exercise, tobacco exposure, or consuming foods or beverages, such as coffee, that can raise blood pressure.
If your blood pressure monitor shows a reading of more than 120/80 mmHg, you may have moderate hypertension. If it shows a reading higher than 140/90 mmHg, you may have high blood pressure and should tell your doctor.
All adults should have their blood pressure checked every one to two years if their blood pressure was less than 120/80 mmHg at their most recent reading.

, Soak a small towel in lukewarm water (104–113°F or 40–45ºC), then wring the water out. Lie down and apply the warmed towel to your chest or mid-back for 20 to 25 minutes. This helps improve circulation in the arteries and reduce spasms to relieve acute anginal pain within five to 10 minutes. If the pain is extremely severe, causes dizziness or shortness of breath, you should seek medical care immediately., , Taking lukewarm showers (104–113°F or 40–45ºC) for five to 10 minutes can help improve circulation and reduce muscle pain, thus decreasing the chance of angina pain. You can do this up to two or three times per week.


Taking frequent showers or showers longer than 15 minutes is not recommended as it can cause dry skin.

, Smoking, secondhand smoke, exposure to carbon monoxide and taking in any form of nicotine can aggravate symptoms of angina pain. It can also cause hypertension and an irregular heartbeat, and it can constrict blood vessels. This increases the risk of having a heart attack and frequent angina pain. Try to avoid exposure to smoke and hazardous fumes in your environment. If you currently smoke, ask your doctor about ways to quit smoking. , , A moderate amount of alcohol, whether it is wine, beer or spirits, can help lower the risk of heart disease and heart-related conditions such as angina. However, alcohol should be taken in moderation. If you have a condition related to angina, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat) or diabetes, you should reduce alcohol intake to one drink a day for women, and two per day for men. , Avoid alcoholic drinks if you are: someone recovering from alcohol addiction, pregnant or breastfeeding women, someone with a family history of alcoholism, someone with liver disease, or someone taking one or more medications that interact with alcohol.

Avoid inflammatory foods.,
Eat certain fruits to improve heart health.,
Eat vegetables that may help to reduce angina pain.,
Increase your intake of foods with essential fatty acids.,
Use heart-healthy cooking oil.,
Add honey to your diet.",How to Manage Angina Pain with Home Remedies3," Foods that cause inflammation can increase your risk for heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol. They can also cause indigestion, bloating, stress and depression, all of which can trigger angina pain. These foods are also high in saturated fats, which can cause blood clotting, constricted blood vessels and plaque formation in the heart’s arteries, increasing the risk of heart attack in people with angina. Try to avoid these foods as much as possible:


Refined carbohydrates such as white bread, pastries and donuts
Fried foods
Sugar-sweetened beverages such as soda or energy drinks
Red meat such as veal, ham or steak and processed meats such as hot dogs
Margarine, shortening and lard

, Certain fruits can be effective in stopping angina pain. Because they are rich in antioxidants, they aid in purifying and thinning the blood, eliminating toxins and improving blood circulation. They are also a rich source of essential minerals, vitamins and nutrients. They may help to improve your immunity and the elasticity of your blood vessels. Fruits that promote heart health, and thereby reduce angina pain, include:


Grapes
Pineapples
Strawberries, blueberries and cherries
Oranges
Pomegranates
Apples

, Vegetables that are rich sources of minerals, vitamins and nutrients may aid in managing cholesterol, reducing inflammation and regulating blood flow to reduce risk of angina pain and other heart diseases. Some vegetables to include in your diet include:


Leafy vegetables such as spinach, kale, collard greens, lettuce and cabbage
Broccoli
Green beans
Sprouts
Carrots
Tomatoes

, Eggs, fish and lean poultry meats contain essential omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids. These acids help lower bad cholesterol that can cause obesity and plaque formation in the arteries. They also help reduce stress and improve blood circulation and immune function. These factors will help reduce the risk of heart disease, heart attack and angina pain.,,Foods that are high in omega-3 fatty acids are are:


Eggs
Flaxseed
Fatty fish such as salmon, tuna, mackerel and shrimp
Poultry meats such as quail, turkey and chicken
Nuts such as walnuts, almonds, and Brazil nuts

, Some vegetable oils such as flaxseed, canola, olive, and soybean are rich in omega-3 and omega-6 essential fatty acids, which help reduce cholesterol and reduce the risk of heart disease. Replacing your regular vegetable cooking oil with a healthier alternative can help decrease the risk of angina pain., , You can also use these oils for salad dressings.

, The phenolic constituents in honey such as quercetin, acacetin and galangin may help to treat cardiovascular conditions. Flavonoids in honey may also decrease your risk of other heart conditions. Because of this, honey may improve blood circulation, oxygen supply in the blood, and may enhance the functioning of your organs. It can also reduce the accumulation of fat in your arteries, thereby reducing the possibility of angina pain. Eat a teaspoon of wild honey in the morning every day.
You can also add ½ teaspoon of honey to decaffeinated tea or glass of water and drink the mixture, up to three times per day.
Make sure the honey does not contain added sugars, as these sugars can increase the risk of diabetes when used for a long period.

Stop smoking.,
Lose excess weight.,
Reduce consumption of saturated and trans-fats, and sodium.,
Address high LDL cholesterol, blood pressure, and blood sugar levels.,
Moderate alcohol consumption.,
Reduce stress levels.",How to Prevent Cardiovascular Disease1," So simple, and yet so difficult for those who battle addiction to cigarettes or other tobacco products. The first thing a doctor who is determining your cardiovascular disease risk will ask is likely to be “Do you smoke?”, and his first advice if you reply in the affirmative will be to quit.


Chemical compounds in tobacco contribute to atherosclerosis (narrowing of arteries), while the carbon monoxide in smoke replaces some of the oxygen in your blood. These two things force the heart to work harder and make arteries much more susceptible to blockage.The bad news: No amount of smoking is safe, even only occasional use or exposure to secondhand smoke. Likewise, other tobacco products (like electronic cigarettes) still expose the body to artery-damaging toxins.
The good news: Smokers, even longtime ones, obtain health benefits almost immediately after cessation. Five years after quitting, former smokers have about the same risk of cardiovascular disease as comparable non-smokers.;
, Carrying excess body weight, especially around the midsection, is a gateway to a host of risk factors for cardiovascular disease, including high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and diabetes.A calculation of your Body Mass Index (BMI) is an imperfect but useful measure of the need for weight reduction. A BMI of over 25 is associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease.
Since excess weight around the abdomen is of particular concern regarding cardiovascular disease, measuring around the waist is also a useful tool. A measurement over 40 inches for a male, or 35 inches for a female, is considered overweight.

, Saturated fats are fat molecules that have no double bonds between carbon molecules because they are saturated with hydrogen moleculeswhile artificial trans-fats are are created in an industrial process that adds hydrogen to liquid vegetable oils to make them more solid. Saturated fats and especially trans-fats contribute to the fatty deposits that lead to atherosclerosis, while excess sodium intake leads to more fluid retention, which increases blood pressure (and thus atherosclerosis risk).Red meat and dairy products are major sources of saturated fat, while fried foods, bakery items, and prepackaged foods are major sources of trans-fat. On a food label, “partially hydrogenated” equates to trans-fat.The healthiest amount for these fats is zero, so limit them as much as possible.
The significant majority of salt intake for most Americans comes from sodium in prepackaged foods, not the salt shaker. Consult the sodium content on packaging and menu boards, and skip adding salt to foods. Seek to limit sodium intake to 1500 milligrams per day., Elevated levels of one or more of these are significant risk factors for cardiovascular disease, and all can be combated through diet, exercise, and medication.LDL or “bad” cholesterol tends to build up on arterial walls, while HDL or ""good"" cholesterol helps clean arteries out. Reducing intake of saturated and trans-fats, exercising more, and taking cholesterol-lowering medications like statins under the care of a physician are all methods for reducing LDL cholesterol levels.
An increase in the force of blood pressing on arterial walls (high blood pressure) can cause damage that makes them more susceptible to blockage. A blood pressure reading of 120/80 (systolic/diastolic) is considered normal, while a systolic reading of at least 140 or a diastolic reading of at least 90 usually indicates the need for remedial action.
Some one-third of Americans have high blood pressure, and many don’t even know it because of the lack of obvious symptoms, but proper diet, exercise, and possible use of prescription medications can usually control what is often called “the silent killer.”
Even without reaching the point of a diabetes diagnosis, elevated blood sugar levels can damage arteries and thus substantially increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. Once again, diet, exercise, and, if needed, medication are the keys to reducing blood sugar levels.

, While there is a growing body of evidence that small to moderate alcohol consumption (1-2 drinks per day) is in fact beneficial to cardiovascular health, going beyond this amount has no known additional benefit. Excessive alcohol consumption, in turn, has a host of negative effects upon the body, including increased risk for cardiovascular disease., Excessive stress can increase blood pressure and affect sleep patterns, both of which can contribute to cardiovascular disease.


The best way to reduce stress is usually to identify your stressors and current coping mechanisms, then to consider ways to avoid, alter, adapt, and accept stress in your life (the 4 A’s of stress reduction).Excessive stress about your risk for developing cardiovascular disease, then, can in fact help bring it on.
Seek professional and/or medical assistance if you need it to help manage stress. It may benefit both your emotional and physical health.

Raise your awareness with age.,
Consider your activity level.Those who lead a sedentary or inactive lifestyle are at higher risk of pulmonary embolism, or a blood clot in the lungs.,
Calculate your body mass index (BMI).,
Pay attention to your hormone levels.Hormonal shifts, especially those involving estrogen, can put people at risk of VTE.,
Be aware of a hypercoagulation.Coagulation is just another word for clotting, which is a normal process for your blood.,
Learn about other health conditions that increase the risk of blood clots.,
Exercise regularly.,
Elevate your legs periodically throughout the day.,
Break up long periods of sitting with activity.,
Stay hydrated.,
Get regular checkups during pregnancy.,
Discuss alternatives to hormone replacement therapy (HRT) with your doctor.,
Take hormonal contraceptive only after medical recommendation.The combination of estrogen and progestin in most birth control pills can raise your risk of blood clots by three to four times.,
Maintain a healthy weight.,
Wear compression hose or socks.,
Talk to your doctor about preventative medication.,
Ask for medication specifically if you have cancer.,
Take natural treatments with a grain of salt.",How to Prevent Blood Clots," The risk of having a first-time blood clot (VTE) is 100 in 100,000. However, that risk goes up exponentially as we age: by age 80, the rate of VTE is 500 in 100,000.As you get older, it’s important to monitor your overall health with regular medical checkups.


Recent surgery or a broken bone in your hips or legs increases your risk of blood clots.;
, People who sit more than six hours a day in their leisure time are twice as likely to have pulmonary embolism of those sit for less than two hours. Prolonged periods of lying, sitting, or standing in one place can cause blood stasis, leading to clots. This is one reason why VTE is so common in hospitalized patients, especially after surgery, and people traveling long distances.

, People who fall in to the obese category have a much higher risk of VTE than those in a healthy weight range.The correlation is not completely understood, but experts believe at least part of it is due to the estrogen produced by fat cells. Estrogen is an independent risk factor for blood clots.Fat cells also produce proteins called “cytokines,” which may play a role in formation of VTE.Though not always the case, the obese may also lead more sedentary lives than those who fall into healthier weight ranges.


To calculate your BMI, use an online BMI calculator, like the one on the Mayo Clinic website. You will need to input your age, height, weight, and sex for your results.
An obese person will have a BMI of 30 or more. The overweight range is from 25-29.9, and normal from 18.5 to 24.9. Anything below 18.5 is considered underweight.

, This is often seen in postmenopausal women who take estrogen supplements as part of hormone replacement therapy. Women who take hormonal contraception to prevent pregnancy and those who are pregnant are also at risk.


Before beginning any hormone therapy, discuss the risks and your options with your doctor.

, Without it, you would bleed to death if you cut yourself! While coagulation is normal, hypercoagulation is when the blood clots too much, even when it's still in the body. Hypercoagulation can be caused by long periods of sitting or lying down, cancer, dehydration, smoking, and hormone therapies.You are at risk of hypercoagulation if:


You have a family history of abnormal blood clots.
You personally had a blood clot at young age.
You had blood clots during pregnancy.
You've suffered from multiple unexplained miscarriages.
Some genetic disorders, such as Factor 5 Leiden Disorder or Lupus Anticoagulant, can also cause this condition.

, Atrial fibrillation (irregular heartbeat) and the build up of cholesterol plaques in your arteries can all lead to blood clots.If you have atrial fibrillation, your blood isn't flowing properly, and may pool and begin to clot.People with atrial fibrillation may notice an irregular pulse but no other symptoms; it is usually discovered during routine check-ups. It can be treated with blood thinners or other medications, lifestyle changes, and in some cases a pacemaker or surgery.Waxy cholesterol plaques can build up in your arteries (sometimes as part of atherosclerosis) and, if the plaques break, they can begin the clotting process.Most heart attacks and strokes occur when plaque in your heart or brain bursts., Studies show that 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous exercise a week decreases your risk of many health problems.This averages to 20-30 minutes of aerobic activity (walking, cycling, aerobics, etc.) a day. Choose an activity you enjoy enough to stick with! Exercise keeps your circulation flowing, improving your overall health and preventing VTE.

, You can do this while resting or during sleep. Elevate your legs from your feet, not your knees; so, don't prop pillows under your knees to try and elevate them. Instead, raise your feet about six inches above your heart. Avoid crossing your legs.

, While it's important to get exercise on a daily basis, it's not enough to sit all day, then run for 20 minutes. If you're sitting or lying down for long periods of time — for example, if you're traveling, work at a computer, or are on bedrest — you need to take exercise breaks. Every two hours, get up and do some light activity. You can just walk around or do stationary calf exercises by rocking back and forth on your heels and toes.


Any situation where you're seated with your legs flexed at the knee (the typical sitting position) puts you at risk. , Severe dehydration ""thickens"" the blood and promotes clot formation.Everyone, but especially the elderly and others in high-risk categories, should drink plenty of water. The Institute of Medicine suggests men drink 13 cups of fluids (three liters) per day, and women drink nine cups (2.2 liters).Never let yourself get thirsty. Thirst is the first, most obvious sign of dehydration. If you are feeling thirsty, you are already on your way toward dehydration.
Another early sign a dry mouth or extremely dry skin.
Drinking water immediately should be enough to rehydrate the body. If you are suffering from diarrhea or vomiting, or are sweating excessively, you may need an electrolyte solution like Gatorade to rehydrate.

, High estrogen states put women at a higher risk of VTE. But during pregnancy, there's nothing you can do about how much estrogen your body's producing. All you can do is try to avoid other risk factors (like smoking or long periods of sitting) and make sure your situation is being monitored by a medical professional.


If you develop a VTE in a limb, the doctor can prescribe pregnancy-safe medication to prevent it from traveling to the lungs or brain and becoming potentially fatal.
There are risks to taking blood thinners while pregnant, as it can interfere with the attachment of the placenta.
However, in high-stakes VTE situations, Lovenox can potentially save lives. After delivery, the mother will switch to Coumadin, which is safe during breastfeeding.VTE is the leading cause of maternal death in the United States and Western Europe., HRT medications, taken to control the symptoms of menopause, place you at an increased risk of blood clots. A non-hormonal alternative is to try a soy isoflavone treatment like Estroven, which helps with hot flashes but has no VTE risk. You can also get soy from dietary sources like soybeans, soymilk, or tofu. There are, however, no guidelines available to help with dosing.You can also choose to simply live with the symptoms of menopause without treatment. While uncomfortable, they are not bad for your health in any way.

, The overall risk for healthy women without other risk factors is still pretty low, though — about one in 3,000 experience VTE.


Women who bleed heavily during menstruation or have abnormal uterine lining should choose non-hormonal options, if available. Non-estrogen (progesterone only) hormonal contraceptives or even non-hormonal choices such as certain IUDs can be considered.
Even if you have a history or risk of blood clots, hormonal contraception can still be taken if you take anticoagulant medication. Your doctor may also choose a very low estrogen form (or even non-estrogen form) of hormonal contraception, which can reduce your risk.

, Because the excess of fat cells found in obesity is correlated with VTE risk, you should try to bring your weight down to healthy levels if you are obese (BMI of 30 or greater). The healthiest way to lose weight is through a combination of exercise and responsible dieting. Although you should limit your caloric intake, most nutritionists warn against eating less than 1,200 calories a day.That number may be higher if you're exercising a lot. Consult your dietician for your personal recommendations.


Wear a heart rate monitor while exercising to track your heart rate.
To calculate your target heart rate, first find your maximum heart rate: 220 - your age.Multiply that number by .6 to find your target heart rate, and try to sustain that rate for at least 20 minutes while exercising at least 4 times a week.
For example, for a 50 year old woman, the target heart rate would be (220-50) x .6 = 102.

, Compression hose are also known as TET, or thromboembolism-deterrent, hose. People who are on their feet for long hours, such as servers or nurses and doctors, often wear them to improve circulation. They can also be worn after you've already suffered from blood clots to relieve leg pain and swelling.They're sometimes used with hospital patients who spend a lot of time on bed rest.


You can buy compression hose at most drugstores or pharmacies. They only need to be knee high to improve circulation.

, If your doctor feels like you are at high risk for a VTE, he may choose to put you on preventive medication. Depending on your individual assessment, he may recommend prescription (Coumadin or Lovenox) or over-the-counter medication, such as aspirin.


Coumadin is a prescribed drug usually taken in one 5 mg oral dose per day.However, in different people, it can produce different interactions with vitamin K, which is critical for normal blood clotting. Thus, dosages can vary wildly.
Lovenox is a prescription injection you can give yourself at home.You will get pre-loaded syringes that need to be administered twice daily. The dosage depends on your weight.
Aspirin is a good over-the-counter option for lower risk patient.It's been proven to prevent thrombotic events from blood clots to stroke and heart attack.

, One in five patients with malignant cancer will experience a VTE.This results from a multitude of reasons, including cancer-related inflammation, lack of mobility, or medication side-effects.Cancer patients who get a VTE will be placed on Lovenox or Coumadin and may get an IVC (inferior vena cava) filter. An IVC filter acts like a strainer in case a deep vein clot breaks off from a leg vein. It prevents the clot from reaching the heart or lungs, where it could prove lethal., Although there's anecdotal literature on natural therapies to reduce clot risk in cancer patients, there's no scientific backing to it. It's been argued that phytonutrients can prevent VTE in cancer patients.However, there's no known mechanism that would cause this diet to inhibit inflammation and cytokine production, as argued. Foods suggested in this diet include:


Fruits: Apricots, oranges, blackberries, tomatoes, pineapple, plums, blueberries.
Spices: Curry, cayenne, paprika, thyme, turmeric, ginger, ginko, licorice.
Vitamins: Vitamin E (walnuts and almonds, lentils, oats and wheats) and Omega 3 fatty acids (fatty fish such as salmon or trout).
Plant Sources: sunflower seeds, canola oil, safflower oil.
Supplements: Garlic, Ginko biloba, Vitamin C, nattokinase supplements.
Wine and honey.

Get more Vitamin C. Vitamin C is an important natural antioxidant that helps promote immune function, manage blood sugar, and stimulate cell growth and repair.,
Increase your intake of niacin.,
Get enough magnesium.,
Take resveratrol.",How to Manage Angina Pain with Home Remedies4," Vitamin C also lowers the risk of various chronic diseases including angina pain and coronary heart disease. Although vitamin C deficiency is rare, it can greatly affect the immune system. Vitamin C can be taken as a dietary supplement with a recommended dose of 500 mg split into two or three times daily. You can also add vitamin C-rich foods to your daily diet. Good natural sources of vitamin C are:

Sweet red or green peppers
Citrus fruit such as oranges, pomelo, grapefruit, limes or non-concentrated citrus juices
Spinach, broccoli and Brussel sprouts
Strawberries and raspberries
Tomatoes
Mango, papaya and cantaloupe


Since smoking depletes vitamin C, smokers may need an additional 35 mg per day.

, Niacin is a form of vitamin B3 used to improve blood flow and lower bad cholesterol levels. High cholesterol causes plaque to build up in your arteries. Lowering your cholesterol reduces the risk for angina and heart disease. Niacin may also help regulate blood sugar levels for type 1 and type 2 diabetes., The recommended dosage for niacin are 14 to 18 mg per day, whether taken as a supplement or through a food source. Do not take a higher dosage unless recommended by your doctor.
People with coronary artery disease, severe or unstable angina should not take niacin without their doctor’s supervision. Large doses can raise the risk of heart rhythm problems.
The best food sources of vitamin B3 are found in beets, brewer's yeast, beef liver, beef kidney, fish, salmon, swordfish, tuna, sunflower seeds, and peanuts. Bread and cereals are usually fortified with niacin. In addition, foods that contain tryptophan, an amino acid the body converts into niacin, include poultry, red meat, eggs, and dairy products.
Niacin is available as a tablet or capsule in both regular and timed-release forms. The timed-release tablets and capsules may have fewer side effects than regular niacin. However, the timed-release versions are more likely to cause liver damage. Doctors recommend periodic liver function tests when using high doses (above 100 mg per day) of niacin.

, Magnesium is a necessary nutrient for many body functions, contributes to energy production. It regulates anxiety, stress, chronic fatigue, and helps maintain healthy blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar levels to reduce the risk of angina and other heart diseases. Magnesium deficiency can also weaken the immune system and cause a number of health problems.Natural food sources of magnesium are salmon, mackerel, halibut, tuna, dark chocolate, dark leafy greens, nuts, seeds, brown rice, lentils, soybeans, black beans, chickpeas, avocado, and bananas.
Calcium can inhibit the absorption of magnesium supplements, so it is better to use more readily absorbed forms such as magnesium bicarbonate and magnesium oxide. 100 mg of magnesium supplements is recommended to be taken two to three times daily. Adults should get at least 280–350 mg of magnesium daily.
Symptoms of magnesium deficiency may include agitation and anxiety, restless leg syndrome (RLS), sleep disorders, irritability, nausea and vomiting, abnormal heart rhythms, low blood pressure, confusion, muscle spasm and weakness, hyperventilation, insomnia, and even seizures.
Excessive intake of magnesium can have adverse effects and reduce calcium absorption, so it is important not to overdose. Ask your doctor what dosage will be right for your individual needs.

, Resveratrol is an active compound found in grapes, grape seed and berries. It is shown to have beneficial effects on cardiovascular health by reducing high cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes and plaque formation in arteries, thereby managing and preventing angina pain. Resveratrol is available as a liquid extract, capsules or tablets at most pharmacies and nutrition stores.
The recommended dosage for resveratrol is 30 to 45 mg after meals, up to three times per day.

Drink lemon water.,
Increase your intake of garlic.,
Eat ginger.,
Take ginseng supplements.,
Try turmeric powder.",How to Manage Angina Pain with Home Remedies5," Some studies show that lemon juice contains antioxidants that can help with weight loss, manage high cholesterol levels and flush out excess sodium in the bloodstream. This will help reduce plaque build-up in the arteries and avert angina pain.Squeeze half a lemon into a cup of warm water and drink this mixture on an empty stomach in the morning.
You may also add lemon juice as flavoring to your regular foods.

, Garlic is used for many conditions related to the heart and circulatory system, such as hypertension, irregular heartbeat, high cholesterol, coronary heart disease, heart attack, and to reduce plaque build-up in the arteries, thereby managing angina. This is because garlic contains a component called allicin, which aids in relaxing hard blood vessels. Garlic can also help reduce headaches, stress and promote healthy liver function., Eat one clove of raw garlic in the morning. If you do not like eating raw garlic, you can add minced or chopped garlic as a flavoring to your meals.
Garlic supplements are also available at most pharmacies and nutrition stores. The recommended dosage for aged garlic extract is 600 to 1200 mg daily, divided into two to three doses. Garlic capsules or tablets should contain 0.5–1.5% of alliin or allicin to be beneficial, at a dosage of two 200 mg tablets, three times a day.
People using prescription or blood-thinning medications, or those with ulcers and thyroid problems, should ask their doctor before using garlic or garlic supplements.

, Gingerol, a natural compound in ginger root, may help to lower blood cholesterol levels thereby potentially helping to prevent angina pain from occurring. It is also an antioxidant that protects the blood vessels from damage by cholesterol, helps manage stress and lower blood pressure., , Do not take more than 4 gram of ginger per day without asking your doctor. Ginger should not be used with blood-thinning, hypertension or diabetic medications.
Ginger can be added to your diet in many ways. You can boil 2–4 grams of ginger in a 1 cup of water to make unsweetened ginger tea. You can also take a ginger supplement, which are available at most pharmacies or add chopped ginger to your food.

, Studies show that ginseng contains antioxidants that can help fight off free radicals, and improve heart health by regulating blood pressure, high cholesterol, blood sugar levels, reduce stress and improve physical strength and endurance, thus reducing the risk for angina and heart disease.Ginseng comes in different forms, such as liquid extracts, powders and capsules, and is often used in combination with other herbs or nutrients.


Ask your doctor before using ginseng, especially if you are using prescription medications to manage angina. Your doctor will help determine the right dosage for you.

, Curcumin, the active compound in turmeric, inhibits plaque formation in your arteries and reduces bad cholesterol levels, both of which can lead to angina pain. Turmeric may also aid in managing obesity that can lead to other heart conditions, as well as reducing arthritis pain., Turmeric and curcumin supplements are considered safe when taken at the recommended doses. The recommended dosage for adults is 400–600 mg, up to three times per day. Taking large amounts of turmeric for long periods of time may cause stomach upset and, in extreme cases, ulcers. People who have gallstones or obstruction of the bile passages should talk to their doctor before taking turmeric.
Add 1 teaspoon of turmeric powder to a cup of warm milk to create a heart-healthy drink that can be taken one to three times per day. You can also add a pinch of turmeric powder to your cooking for flavor.
Ask your doctor before using turmeric if you are taking blood-thinning or diabetes medications.

Watch for severe symptoms.,
Ask your doctor about angioplasty.,
Consider EECP therapy.,
Ask your doctor about medication.,
Make an emergency action plan.,
Take nitroglycerin for immediate relief.",How to Manage Angina Pain with Home Remedies6," See your doctor right away if you have new, unexplained chest pain or pressure. You should call 911 if your chest pain does not go away five minutes after taking medication, increases in severity or if a person with angina loses consciousness. , ,Other situations in which you should call your doctor are:


You experience new or recurrent angina symptoms more often.
You experience angina pain while sitting or resting.
You have trouble taking your heart medication
You feel tired, faint or lightheaded more often.
You experience an irregular heartbeat, low (below 60 beats per minute) or high (above 120 beats per minute) blood pressure.
You experience any other unusual symptoms that may be related to angina.

, Angioplasty is a non-surgical, minimally invasive procedure used to open blocked or narrowed arteries, improving blood flow to the heart. Angioplasty can be performed by a licensed cardiologist to help treat moderate to severe angina pain caused by plaque build-up in the arteries.,During an angioplasty, a small balloon is expanded inside the coronary artery to help compress the blockage and expand the artery wall. A wire mesh tube called a stent is sometimes implanted to keep the artery wall expanded. The procedure can last for two to three hours.
Ask your doctor if an angioplasty may help your condition.

, Enhanced external counterpulsation (EECP) therapy is a non-invasive procedure helpful for some people who have persistent angina. Large cuffs, similar to blood pressure cuffs, are put on your legs. The cuffs are inflated and deflated in sync with your heartbeat. EECP therapy improves the flow of oxygen-rich blood to your heart muscle and helps relieve angina.You typically receive 35 one-hour treatments over a period of seven weeks. EECP therapy can be performed by a licensed therapist or physician.

, Talk with your doctor if you have any questions or concerns about taking your angina medicines. You should know what medicines you're taking, the purpose of each, how and when to take them, possible side effects and if they are safe to take with other medicines, herbs or foods.If you have side effects from your medication, let your doctor know. You should never stop taking your medication without your doctor's approval. Your doctor may prescribe medicine to treat CHD, high blood pressure, diabetes, or high cholesterol levels. These may include:


Anti-platelet drugs, also called blood-thinners, such as aspirin. Take the baby strength (81 mg) aspirin or cut the regular strength (325mg) aspirin in half. Take one pill once a day with food. Studies have shown that taking aspirin decreases your risk of a cardiovascular disease.ACE inhibitors to treat hypertension and high blood pressure
Beta-blockers to treat hypertension, irregular heartbeat, angina pain and to prevent a heart attack.
Calcium channel blockers for angina pain and hypertension
Diuretics (water pills) to flush out excess sodium
Statins to lower cholesterol
Nitroglycerin pills or nitrates to stop an angina attack

, Angina increases your risk for a heart attack. It’s important that you and your family know how and when to seek medical attention. Talk with your doctor about making an emergency action plan. Discuss your emergency plan with your family members. Take action quickly if your chest pain becomes severe, lasts longer than a few minutes, or isn't relieved by rest or medicine.The plan should include making sure you and your family members know:


The signs and symptoms of a heart attack
How to use medications when needed, such as nitroglycerin
How to access emergency medical services in your community
The location of the nearest hospital that offers 24-hour emergency heart care.
Call 911 if you experience unstable angina, a heart attack, or loss of consciousness. You should also call 911 if the pain lasts longer than usual or if the pain returns a few minutes after taking medication.

, Nitroglycerin is used to prevent chronic or stable angina. This medicine works by relaxing the blood vessels and increasing the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart. This medicine is also used to relieve an angina attack that is already occurring. When used regularly on a long-term basis, or just before exercise or a stressful event, this helps prevent angina attacks from occurring. Your doctor may prescribe nitroglycerin as a tablet, capsule or spray to help relieve angina pain. This medicine should be used exactly as directed by your doctor. Do not take more than the prescribed dose, do not take it more frequently, and do not take it for a longer time than your doctor ordered.
If you miss a dose of this medicine, take it as soon as possible. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule. Do not take double doses.
When you begin to feel an attack of angina starting such as chest pains, tightness or squeezing in the chest, sit down. Use a nitroglycerin tablet or spray as directed by your doctor. You may become dizzy, lightheaded, or faint soon after using a tablet or spray, so it is safer to sit rather than stand while the medicine is working. If you become dizzy or faint while sitting, take several deep breaths and bend forward with your head between your knees. Remain calm and you should feel better in a few minutes.
Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets usually give relief in one to five minutes. Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets should not be chewed, crushed, or swallowed. They work much faster when absorbed through the lining of the mouth. Place the tablet under the tongue or between the cheek and gum, and let it dissolve. Do not eat, drink, smoke, or use chewing tobacco while a tablet is dissolving. If the pain is not relieved, you may use a second tablet five minutes after you take the first tablet. If the pain continues for another five minutes, a third tablet may be used.
Ask your doctor or nurse how to properly use a nitroglycerin oral spray if prescribed. You may administer one or two sprays of nitroglycerin oral spray at the onset of chest pain. If the pain continues after five minutes, a third spray may be used. You must wait five minutes after the first one or two sprays before using a third spray.
If you still have chest pain after a total of three tablets or three sprays, contact your doctor or go to a hospital emergency room right away. Do not drive yourself and call 911 if necessary.
Tell your doctor if you have any other respiratory or heart conditions. Also alert your doctor if you are using any other medications, supplements, herbal or home remedies, or if you experience an allergic reaction to nitroglycerin.
Nitroglycerin should not be used for severe or unstable angina, during a heart attack, to treat low blood pressure or for people with anemia. Call 911 if you or someone with angina experiences a heart attack.
Consult your doctor and see if nitroglycerin interacts with any of you current medication.

Get daily exercise.,
Increase your intake of heart-healthy foods.,
Maintain a Healthy Mouth.,
Strive for more restful sleep.,
Have regular health screenings.,
Work with your doctor.",How to Prevent Cardiovascular Disease2," Your heart is a muscle, and like any other muscle, it requires exercise to stay healthy and become stronger. A strong, healthy heart is less susceptible to cardiovascular disease, and a strong, healthy body is less likely to harbor risk factors such as obesity or high cholesterol / blood pressure / blood sugar.An average of thirty minutes daily of moderate exercise is usually considered sufficient to provide cardiovascular health benefits. Added frequency and intensity of exercise further enhances those benefits.
Being slightly out of breath and lightly sweating are usually good indicators of moderate exercise. Brisk walking, swimming, biking, gardening, dancing, and really just about any physical activity that reaches this level will suffice.
Breaking up the 30-minute average per day makes no difference in the benefit. So, three 10-minute brisk walks in a day are equivalent in benefit to one 30-minute brisk walk.

, While cutting back on saturated fats, sodium, and sugar benefits cardiovascular health, replacing them in your diet with more fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and healthy fats provides a substantial additional boost.Strive to eat 5-10 servings of fruits and vegetables daily. They contain vitamins, minerals, and fiber that help combat the buildup of plaque in blood vessels. The fiber in whole grains (such as oatmeal) is also beneficial.
Lean proteins, as found in beans, lowfat yogurt, chicken, and fish, among others, provide important nutrients without also delivering high saturated fat content.
Oily fish like salmon, mackerel, and fresh tuna also provide Omega-3 fatty acids, a type of polyunsaturated fat that can essentially help lubricate and thus protect the cardiovascular system. Always seek out poly- and mono-unsaturated fats instead of saturated or trans-fats.

, Studies suggest that oral health is an important component of overall cardiovascular health because bacteria from the mouth can enter the bloodstream through the gums. People who have higher blood levels of certain disease-causing bacteria in the mouth are more likely to experiencing hardening of the carotid artery in the neck.


Remember to brush and floss your teeth twice daily.
Remember to visit your dentist at least once or twice a year.

, The average adult requires 7-9 hours of sleep nightly, yet many fail to reach that average. Sufficient restful sleep enables the body to revitalize and recharge, and also can reduce stress levels and blood pressure.If you wake up in the morning without the aid of an alarm and feel refreshed, that is a good sign that you are getting enough sleep.
If you set aside 8 hours nightly for sleep but wake up groggy and lethargic, you may not be getting restful sleep due to a medical condition such as sleep apnea (a blockage of airflow that causes frequent, temporary stops in breathing). Talk to you doctor about taking a sleep study and/or utilizing sleep aids.

, If you know you have -- or think you may have -- multiple risk factors for developing cardiovascular disease, it is imperative that you have regular medical screenings to take stock of your current condition and risk. This can then lead to a development of effective prevention or treatment options with you medical professional.Have your blood pressure checked at least every two years, and more frequently if you have risk factors. This is a simple, painless procedure that can reveal a great deal about your cardiovascular health.
Get cholesterol tests done at least every 5 years starting at age 35 (men) or 45 (women) even if you are healthy with no risk factors, and earlier and more frequently if you are at a higher risk for cardiovascular disease. This requires a simple blood draw and lab testing.
Consider having fasting blood sugar testing done every three years starting at age 45 even if you have a low risk of developing diabetes, and earlier and more frequently if you have a higher risk.
Regular physical examinations and other medical tests as warranted can also be important tools in preventing cardiovascular disease.

, Be proactive in discussing your concerns about and risk factors for developing cardiovascular disease with your physician. Talk to your doctor about any concerns you may have about taking medications. If you do decide to take medications, take them as prescribed and dedicate yourself to making necessary lifestyle changes.


Your doctor might prescribe statins to reduce bad cholesterol, beta blockers to reduce blood pressure and heart rate, or calcium channel blockers that relax arterial walls, among other options.You may be prescribed a daily low-dose aspirin, which thins the blood and thus makes blockages less likely. Do not begin an aspirin regimen on your own, however, because aspirin can increase the risk of internal bleeding, for instance.Modern medicines can do wonders, but in the end it is up to you to make the necessary lifestyle changes that give you the best chance of preventing cardiovascular disease.

Learn to recognize the signs of cardiovascular disease.",How to Prevent Cardiovascular Disease3," While technically covering a range of disorders of the heart and blood vessels, cardiovascular disease most often refers to problems caused by atherosclerosis -- plaque buildup in arteries that restricts blood flow.Blood vessels become clogged as atheroma -- essentially small, fatty lumps -- build up on the walls of arteries. In the same way that a slow sink drain will turn into a complete stoppage over time, new fat deposits collect on existing ones, further narrowing the artery. Likewise, blood flows more slowly behind the clog, increasing the likelihood of clotting that adds to the blockage.

, Atherosclerosis makes the heart work harder and less efficiently to circulate blood throughout the body. Also, a complete blockage that cuts off blood flow to a part of the body can cause severe health crises.Angina (heart pain) and heart failure (inefficient functioning leading to breathlessness, lethargy, etc.) are common results of narrowed arteries. So too is peripheral artery disease, which is a pain in an extremity (usually the legs) caused by restricted blood flow.
Thrombosis refers to a blockage of blood flow to a part of the body due to a clot. A heart attack is caused by a lack of blood flow to the heart, while a stroke is a result of the same to the brain. These are life-threatening conditions linked to cardiovascular disease.
Approximately one-third of U.S. adults will develop cardiovascular disease in their lifetimes. The good news, however, is that about 80% of heart attacks and strokes are preventable when the proper steps for cardiovascular disease prevention are taken., Risk factors for cardiovascular disease come in three categories: fixed, treatable, and preventable.Knowing your risks in each category is the best way to plan your preventative attack.


Key fixed risk factors (those that cannot be changed) include: family history of cardiovascular disease (especially parent or sibling); male gender (although women are far from immune); and age (the older one gets, the more likely it becomes).
Treatable risk factors (those that can be managed) include, among others: high blood pressure; high LDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels; and diabetes.
The list of preventable risk factors (those that can be eliminated) includes: smoking; physical inactivity; poor diet; and obesity.

, Talk to your medical provider about your overall risk level for cardiovascular disease. If you would like to use a simple formula to determine a mathematical representation of your risk level, visit How to Calculate Your Heart Disease Risk. Don’t use this as a substitute for medical advice, however.

, The faster you are able to recognize signs of cardiovascular disease, the faster you can receive treatment.


Signs of heart attack include: chest pain or discomfort, upper body discomfort, lightheadedness, dizziness, or breaking out in cold sweats.
Signs of heart infections include: fever, shortness of breath, weakness or fatigue, swelling in your legs or abdomen, dry or persistent cough, or skin rashes or unusual spots.
Signs of Arrhythmia include: fatigue, dizziness, lightheadedness, shortness of breath, or chest pain.
Signs of valvular heart disease include: fatigue, shortness or breath, irregular heartbeat, swollen feet or ankles, chest pain, or fainting.
Signs of stroke include: face drooping, arm weakness, or speech difficulty. Call 911 if someone shows these symptoms.

Get tested for diabetes.,
Ask your family about heart disease.,
Lose weight if your body mass index (BMI) is over 25.,
Learn the warning signs of a heart attack.",How to Observe American Heart Month1," Experts believe 20 to 40 percent of heart disease related deaths are due to smoking. Call your health insurance company or local hospital to inquire about smoking cessation programs.Some smoking cessation programs are free of charge to the smoker.;
, Make an appointment to get a complete blood count (CBC) test to see if you have high cholesterol. Every one percent you can reduce your cholesterol, you reduce your chances of heart attack by two to three percent., Your doctor will test your blood pressure during routine appointments. They may suggest a medication to control it if it is above 120/80.

, If you lead a sedentary lifestyle, you can reduce your risk of a heart attack by up to 55 percent by walking or engaging in other exercise for at least half an hour per day. Exercise can reduce blood pressure, cholesterol, stress and weight, which add up to a healthier heart.


If you suffer from high-blood pressure or other conditions, it is important to increase your exercise slowly. Add approximately 15 more minutes per week. Increase the intensity by one level at a time to reduce the pressure on your circulatory system.

, Type two diabetes and heart disease go hand in hand. You can lower your risk by consulting your doctor, taking prescribed medication, eating healthy and exercising.


Your fasting blood sugar should be below 100., Genetics play an important part in determining your risk for heart disease. If your relatives have suffered from the problem, it is important that you eat right, exercise and get regular physicals., Although it is an imperfect method of testing overall health, it shows you what percentage of body fat you are likely to have. Check your BMI with a simple internet search.

, These symptoms include chest pressure, sharp pains in the back, neck and jaw, cold sweats, sudden fatigue, light-headedness, nausea and shortness of breath. Seek medical attention immediately or call the Emergency Services if you are experiencing these feelings."

Eat a healthy diet.,
Focus on adding heart-healthy “superfoods” to your diet.,
Avoid foods that are bad for your heart.,
Limit alcohol to a healthy amount.,
Add dietary supplements to your diet.",How to Maintain a Healthy Heart," Using tobacco increases your risk of heart damage. Both tobacco and nicotine contain many chemicals that cause harm to your blood vessels and heart, and this results in atherosclerosis, which is a plaque build-up of cholesterol, fat, and calcium in your vessels that can cause your arteries to narrow, decreasing blood flow.The carbon monoxide in cigarette smoke has also been linked to mortality and morbidity.It interferes with oxygen, so your heart is pressured into supplying additional oxygen to compensate. The tightening of the blood vessels, partnered by the stress on the heart can both result in a heart attack. The only way to stop this burden on your heart and strive for a healthier heart is to stop smoking.
Approximately 1 in 5 deaths in the United States is caused by cigarette smoking. According to the National Institute of Health, smoking is the main preventable cause of mortality in the United States.;
, One way to make any muscle stronger is to exercise it. The same is true for your heart. Here is what the American Heart Association recommends:At least 30 minutes a day of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise to get your blood pumping and dramatically improve your heart's health. Ideally, you should do this 5 days a week for a total of 150 minutes of aerobic exercise.
Alternatively, you can do 25 minutes of high-intensity aerobic activity for a minimum of 3 days a week, totaling 75 minutes in all.
You should also incorporate resistance training (weight/strength training) into your workout at least 2 days every week in addition to the cardio.
Always work up to a healthy routine! Only begin with what you are comfortable doing, and then systematically increase the difficulty as you are able to tolerate it. Too strenuous a routine too quickly can actually strain your heart and defeat the purpose. If you have any health conditions, discuss with your doctor before beginning any exercise routine.

, Increased weight causes your body to require more effort from your heart to maintain a baseline resting level. This continual strain on your heart can tax it and result in further issues in the future. Exercise and a healthy diet will help you lose the weight that is putting a strain on your heart. Dangerous cardiac issues that arise from being overweight include:Coronary heart disease - This condition arises from plaque build-up inside the arteries that serve your heart. Plaques can narrow your arteries as they grow and decrease the amount of blood flow, reducing the amount of oxygen that can be supplied to your body. In addition, your heart must work harder to push blood through the narrowed channels, which can cause angina (chest pain from oxygen deprivation) or even a heart attack.
High blood pressure - If your heart has to pump harder to get the appropriate amount of oxygen and nutrients through your body, the vessels and your heart can become damaged over time. Your risk of high blood pressure is significantly greater when you are obese or overweight.
Stroke - If a plaque that has developed in your arteries ruptures, the plaque can cause a blood clot to form. If the clot forms in close proximity to your brain, your brain can become deprived of blood and oxygen, resulting in a stroke.

, Doing so will keep you informed of your heart's health and allow you to take action before anything serious develops.


Blood pressure screenings - You should check your blood pressure every two years. If your blood pressure is above 120/80, then your doctor will likely recommend you have your pressure checked every year (or more depending on how high the reading is or if you have kidney problems, heart disease, etc.)Your workplace or pharmacy may also offer free, automated blood pressure machines. Use these as often as you want to supplement actual visits to your doctor. If your blood pressure is above 140/90 and your doctor is not aware, it is important that you contact your doctor as soon as possible.
Cholesterol Screening - All men above the age of 34 should be screened every five years. Your doctor will draw blood samples and have them tested in the lab for cholesterol levels. He or she will go over the results and readings with you. If you have any risk factors that could make you more likely to have high cholesterol, it is recommended that you be screened as early as 20 years of age. Risk factors may include immediate family history, diabetes, or prior heart disease.Depending on a regular workup, your doctor may request that you are screened more often., Stress can play a huge role in your heart health. Increased stress releases cortisol and adrenaline, which elevates blood pressure and cholesterol levels. Stress-related behaviors can also negatively affect your health, causing you to smoke more, drink more, overeat, and be physically inactive. All these behaviors will contribute negatively to your heart health.

Exercise, diet, and abstinence from smoking and coffee can help to reduce stress. You should consider these practices in your life particularly when you are stressed., Certain mental health conditions can lead to detrimental behaviors for your heart health. These include depression and anxiety disorders, which include disorders such as bipolar disorder and OCD. These behaviors can present with symptoms of excessive eating, decreased eating, apathy, physical inactivity, stress, elevated blood pressure, and many other symptoms that negatively impact your heart.If you are diagnosed with any mental health condition or believe that you may be suffering from one, be sure to visit your doctor as soon as possible. Only your doctor can effectively treat your mental health condition, as well as determine the effect it may have on the rest of your physical health.

, Opt for a diet that avoids saturated and trans-fat foods, such as red meat, deep-fried fast foods and processed foods. You should also avoid foods that are high in salt and cholesterol. Fish that contain omega-3 fatty acids, such as mackerel and salmon, can reduce risk of a heart problem. The American Heart Association recommends that your diet consist mainly of the following (see next section for specifics):Fruits and vegetables
Whole grains
Low-fat dairy products
Poultry
Nuts and fish

, Superfoods are a category of foods made popular by the media to denote foods with supposed health benefits. This term is not commonly used by clinically trained health professionals in the field of nutrition. However, many of these foods are believed to have high nutrient density and many may confer health benefits beyond other traditional food choices. Some of these foods include:Avocados - Avocados are considered “superfoods” due to their high amounts of monounsaturated fats. Monounsaturated fats, unlike saturated fats, are liquid at room temperature and have the ability to help reduce cholesterol levels. Avocados are also unique in that they contain phytosterols, which compete with cholesterol in the body for absorption. By competing with cholesterol, you absorb less cholesterol, lowering your blood cholesterol levels.
Extra-virgin olive oil - Extra-virgin olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fats, helping to lower “bad” cholesterol (LDL cholesterol). Olive oil has also been shown to aid in the prevention of blood clotting as well as maintaining even blood sugar.
Nuts - Peanuts and tree nuts (pecans, pistachios, walnuts, etc.) are amazing sources of phytochemicals, vitamins, fiber, minerals, and unsaturated fats. These have all been shown in studies to benefit the heart by raising HDL (good cholesterol), lowering LDL cholesterol (bad cholesterol), and lowering your blood pressure.
Quinoa - Quinoa is a staple plant food from South America. This food is high in protein and contains vitamins, minerals, and fiber.
Dark chocolate - Dark chocolates are required to contain at least 70% cocoa. This type of chocolate contains high levels of flavanoids, which can lower your blood pressure. Although it can be potent for your heart health, it also is very high in calories and should not be eaten in high amounts.
Salmon - Salmon is a very healthy protein source that also contains high levels of omega-3 fatty acids/fish oil, which have been shown to aid significantly in cardiovascular health.
Oatmeal - Oatmeal is a high-fiber whole grain that helps to inhibit the absorption of cholesterol. Steel-cut oats confer the highest benefit, as the digestion time is extended, and they have a low glycemic index. A low glycemic index will keep blood-sugar levels from spiking, which can help to prevent heart disease over time.
Oranges - Oranges are also rich in soluble fibers that aid in the reduction of cholesterol absorption. They also contain potassium (which can help keep sodium balanced) and vitamin C.
Beans - Almost all types of beans provide high amounts of protein, fiber, and minerals. Beans will convey benefits similar to steel-cut oats, helping to lower cholesterol and blood pressure with a low glycemic index.

, You should always avoid foods high in saturated fats, trans-fats, high-fructose corn syrup, sugar, and cholesterol. These include red meat, fast food, fried food, chips, sodas, excessive butter, etc. Most people know when they are eating unhealthy foods. Use your best judgment and common sense, and take note of nutrition labels, which show daily recommended values.

, Per the American Heart Association, men are allowed two alcoholic beverages a day to protect the heart and women can drink one.More than that will have the opposite effect.


Alcohol can damage the heart by contributing to high blood pressure, stroke, and obesity if not consumed in moderation.Additionally, alcohol can lead to increased levels of triglycerides. These are a specific class of fats that can cause conditions such as pancreatitis. Prolonged alcoholic drinking can lead to irreversible pancreatic damage (chronic pancreatitis)., While you should gain the bulk of your nutrition from foods, supplements can help to round out minor deficiencies in your diet. These particular supplements can be found in the superfoods discussed above and have been shown to confer some benefits to cardiac health:Vitamins and minerals - A daily vitamin is a good supplement that can provide you with heart healthy vitamin B3 (niacin), vitamin K, vitamin E, and magnesium.
Herbs - Garlic, echinacea, and ginseng are believed to confer benefits to heart health.
Others - Many people do not enjoy eating fish, which can provide many heart health benefits. Alternatively, you can try omega-3 fatty acid pills along with coenzyme Q10.

Follow a heart healthy diet to lower your risk of heart problems.,
Increase your intake of vegetables and fruits.,
Eat poultry and fish instead of red meat.,
Include more low-fat dairy products and nuts.,
Limit foods which cause high cholesterol.,
Decrease your sodium intake if you suffer from high blood pressure.,
Consult a doctor or nutritionist who can help you plan your diet.",How to Maintain a Healthy Cardiovascular System1," The risk of heart problems is significantly lower in patients who eat a heart healthy diet. A heart-healthy diet contains more fiber, vitamins, minerals and less calories and fats, especially saturated fats and trans-fats.


Among meats, red meat contain bad fats, so it should be avoided and poultry and fish should be eaten instead. Salt, sugar and artificial sweeteners should also be avoided.
The American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology recommend heart healthy nutrition for the entire adult population, and suggests the following dietary modifications.;
, Increase your intake of vegetables and fruits as they are rich in vitamins (especially antioxidant vitamins A,C and E which clear the body’s toxic oxygen metabolites), minerals and fiber, but low in bad fats and calories.

, Eat more poultry and fish, especially salmon, trout and herring, as they contain Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids which are good for the strengthening of heart muscles.

, These foods contain low levels of bad fats as compared to products containing saturated fats and trans fats, which cause deposition of cholesterol in the blood vessels.

, It is recommended that you limit your intake of sodium (salt), sweets, sugar-sweetened beverages and red meats. For patients who have high levels of LDL-Cholesterol, additional recommendations are:


Reduce the percentage of calories consumed from saturated fat to 5-6%.
Reduce the percentage of calories consumed from trans fat.
Aim for a total cholesterol score of less than 180 mg/dL, as this is considered optimal.
Discuss methods of achieving these goals with your nutritionist.

, For patients who are suffering from hypertension, additional recommendations are:


Reduce your sodium intake to 1500mg/day, or at least decrease your daily consumption by 1000mg/day, by reducing the consumption of sodium containing salts. Sodium makes the body hold on to water, thus extra water stays in our body.This raises our blood pressure, which increases the risk of atherosclerosis. Therefore, decreased intake of sodium prevents atherosclerosis and thus prevents a reduced oxygen and blood supply to the heart

, Heart-healthy foods should be incorporated into the diet according to personal and cultural preferences; therefore you should consult your doctor/nutritionist about applying these principles in your daily diet.


Appropriate calorie requirements are determined according to the weight and lifestyle of the individual. However, remember that these are general guidelines for the normal adult population.
For patients requiring special dietary management, such as diabetes, appropriate changes should be made accordingly.

Cut back on sugar.,
Fight the bad fats.,
Switch to healthy fats.,
Limit the cholesterol in your diet.,
Consume more fish.,
Maintain a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.",How to Lower Triglycerides1," Simple carbohydrates, such as sugar and foods made with white flour, can increase triglycerides. Generally if it's white, stay away. Lay off cookies, cakes, muffins, white pasta, white bread, candy, etc.High-fructose corn syrup is a serious culprit when it comes to high triglycerides, studies have shown. An abundance of fructose is bad news for your system, so avoid it whenever possible. Read food labels to see if the food you are about to eat contains this sugar.
To fight sugar cravings, try grabbing a piece of fruit. Fruits are also high in sugar, but those are natural, rather than processed, sugars.;
, Eating a leaner diet and cutting down on the saturated fat and trans fat in your diet can improve your triglyceride levels.The American Heart Association recommends that people with high triglycerides monitor their fat intake closely; they should only be getting about 25 to 35 percent of their daily calories from fat, from the ""good fats"" to be more specific.


Avoid fast food and most processed foods. These often contain partially hydrogenated fats (trans fats), which are extremely unhealthy. But if you live in the US, don't rely on packages that label their foods as free of trans fat. If a food contains less than half a gram of trans fat in a serving, it can be legally labeled trans fat-free. Even though this seems miniscule, negligible amounts can add up quickly if left unmonitored. You can tell that a food has trans fat in it (even if the label says there is none) if it lists partially hydrogenated oil in the ingredients.
Avoid saturated fats, like those in animal products, such as red meat, butter, and lard.

, Replace those bad fats with good fats, though you'll still need to eat even the good fats in moderation. Healthy fats include olive oil, nuts, and avocados.Make an effort to make healthy substitutions, such as olive oil instead of butter in your cooking or a small handful of 10 to 12 almonds instead of a pre-packaged cookie for a snack.
Polyunsaturated fats, unsaturated fats, monounsaturated fats, and omega-3 fatty acids are examples of healthy fats.

, Aim for no more than 300 milligrams (mg) of cholesterol a day if you're simply taking preventative measures. If you have heart disease, aim for less than 200 mg a day. Avoid the most concentrated sources of cholesterol, namely red meats, egg yolks and whole milk products. Check food labels to see how much you're eating makes up your daily recommended amount of cholesterol.Note triglycerides and cholesterol aren't the same thing. They are separate types of lipids that circulate in your blood. Triglycerides store unused calories and provide your body with energy, while cholesterol is used by your body to build cells and maintain certain hormone levels. Both triglycerides and cholesterol are unable dissolve in blood, which is when problems start occurring.With a growing awareness of the problems of high cholesterol, more and more food companies are producing products with lower cholesterol. To be marketed as ""low-cholesterol,"" the food has meet standards set by the government. Look for these options in stores., Eating more fish, which are high in omega-3s, can lower your triglyceride levels in a seemingly effortless way. Fish like mackerel, lake trout, herring, sardines, albacore tuna, and salmon are your best options because leaner varieties of fish don't have the same high levels of omega-3s.


To reap the benefits of fish's triglyceride-lowering powers, the American Heart Association recommends that most people eat fish high in omega-3s at least twice a week.It may be hard to get enough omega-3s from food to help lower your triglycerides, so your doctor may recommend a supplement of fish oil. Fish oil capsules are widely available in drug stores and health food stores., While you want to cut sugar, processed foods, and simple carbs, you'll want to fill your diet with whole grains and more fruits and vegetables. Maintaining a nutrient-rich diet will keep your mind and body healthy and thus contribute to your overall well-being.Choose whole-grain bread, whole-wheat pasta, and other grains such as quinoa, barley, oats, and millet.Eat a variety of fruits and vegetables every single day. A good way to get more fruits and vegetables at each meal is to make sure they comprise two-thirds of your plate."

Achieve and maintain a healthy weight.,
Get regular exercise.,
Follow an exercise plan for at least three months.,
Prevent anemia.,
Quit smoking.,
Treat any conditions that put you at increased risk for heart disease.",How to Maintain a Healthy Cardiovascular System2," Obesity is associated with an increased risk of heart problems. Obesity also causes hypertension and diabetes, which are risk factors for atherosclerosis and ischemic heart disease.Therefore, if you are obese, especially if your BMI is >35, you should take a healthy approach to losing weight, including appropriate changes to your diet and lifestyle.
If you are already at a healthy weight, you should make sure that you maintain this weight.To calculate your BMI, see this article.

, Several clinical trials have proved that regular exercise prevents atherosclerosis, therefore preventing ischemia and heart attacks. The general population and people at risk of developing heart attack should engage in:


2 hours and 30 minutes per week of moderate-intensity physical activity (for example, a brisk walk for half an hour daily for 5 days a week), or
1 hour and 15 minutes per week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity (for example, running for at least 10 minutes daily throughout the week, or 15 minutes daily for 5 days a week), or
an equivalent combination of both.

, Although exercise should be made a lifelong habit, trials have shown that doing the kind of exercise described above for 3 months results in a significant decrease in the risk of developing heart attack.


However, it should be emphasized that this is the minimum recommended amount of exercise. Exercising more than this will further decrease the risk of developing heart conditions.
Aside from walking and running, you can also engage in activities such as stretching exercises (to increase blood flow), swimming, dancing, cycling and yoga.

, As oxygen is bound to hemoglobin in order to be carried in the blood, decreased levels of hemoglobin also result in a decreased level of oxygen in the blood.


Therefore anemia should be prevented by eating foods containing enough iron, vitamin B-12 and folic acid. Rich sources of iron are meat, leafy green vegetables (spinach, collards), beans and dried fruits.
Vitamin B-12 is found in fish, liver, crab, cheese and eggs, while folic acid is present in green leafy vegetables., Smoking is a very serious risk factor for heart disease. Smoking also damages the lungs and causes lung diseases like COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and lung cancer. Therefore, if you are a smoker, you should discuss your plan for quitting with your doctor and set a “quit-smoking timeframe”.


Decide on a quit smoking day; it may be your birthday, the start of a new year, your wedding anniversary, or any other day that carries some importance in your life. Start gradually reducing the number of cigarettes that you daily smoke, and finally, on your quit-smoking day, announce to your family and friends that you have quit smoking, so that they can support you throughout the quitting process.
Your doctor may help you decide if you need any nicotine replacements, including nicotine patches and nicotine gums.

, Some medical conditions are risk factors for the development of heart diseases and should be treated according to the advice of your doctor.


These include, but not limited to, diabetes, hypertension, lipid disorders and kidney disorders.
Appropriate treatment of these conditions can prevent or delay the development of heart issues.

Identify the sources of stress in your life.,
Identify how you are coping with stress currently.,
Avoid the stress if possible.,
Alter the stress if it can’t be avoided.,
Adapt to the stress.,
Accept the stress if nothing else works out.,
Consider seeing a psychiatrist or psychologist.",How to Maintain a Healthy Cardiovascular System3," Something related to your job, your family life, your friend circle, traffic jams, breaking news on the news channels - everything that makes you feel stressed must be included in the list.

, Is it any of the following unhealthy ways of coping with stress? Smoking, drinking, overeating, taking pills and sleeping for hours, fighting with others. If yes, then pay close attention to the following healthy ways of coping with stress, commonly called as 4 A’s of stress management.

, Look at your stress list and decide which situations or people that are causing the stress in your life can be avoided. For example, if watching the 9 o’ clock news bulletin is stressing you out, switch off your television at 9.

, Don’t just let things or people stress you. Take control of your life into your own hands. Think about those unavoidable stress situations very thoroughly, focusing on identifying how you can make those situations not-so-stressful.


For example, if you are preparing for a test, and your roommate is disturbing you by talking on the phone, deal with the problem head on rather than just getting stressed. Simply tell him to stop talking!

, If the situation can’t be altered, maybe you need to change your reaction to the situation. This may involve changing your expectations of other people, looking at things from a broader perspective or finding positive aspects of the situation.

, Trying to control the uncontrollable is never beneficial. So, if something in your stress list cannot be avoided or altered, and there is nothing you can do to adapt to the situation, you should accept the situation as it is rather than fighting a war that you can’t win.

, It is important to understand that stress may need to be managed under the supervision of a psychiatrist/psychologist. So if the above steps do not work out, discuss your issues with your doctor.

Get a prescription for beta blockers.,
Take nitrates.,
Use calcium channel blockers.",How to Maintain a Healthy Cardiovascular System4," Beta blockers are drugs that interfere with the sympathetic nervous system by blocking the beta-receptors present in the body, including the heart. They result in a reduced heart rate, and thus reduction in the oxygen demand of the heart muscles.


Beta blockers are used in patients of known ischemic heart disease. Beta blockers that are mostly used in daily practice to slow the heart rate are Bisoprolol, Carvedilol and Metoprolol succinate.
Initial and maximum doses are discussed below. However, you should start these medications only after prescription by your doctor.
Bisoprolol is started at 1.25 mg once daily. Maximum dose is 10 mg once daily. Carvedilol is started at 3.125 mg twice daily. Maximum dose is 50 mg twice daily. (Once daily formulations, Carvedilol CR, are also available. Starting dose is 10 mg once daily. Maximum dose is 80 mg once daily) Metoprololsuccinate CR/XL (extended release formulations) are started at 12.5-25 mg once daily. Maximum dose is 200mg once daily.

, Nitrates have been used to treat patients with chest pain due to coronary artery disease for over 100 years. Nitrates act by dilating the veins and arteries of the body, including the coronary arteries. The most commonly used nitrates are discussed below.


Isosorbide dinitrate is started at 5-20 mg two to three times daily, then raised to a maintenance dose of 10-40 mg two to three times daily.
Isosorbide mononitrate is started at 5-10 mg two times daily to 20 mg two times daily. This is also available in an extended release formulation with a dose of 30-60 mg once daily
Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets, transdermal patches and rectal formulations are also available. Contact your doctor for the dosage according to clinical symptoms.

, These drugs act by relaxing the muscular walls of all arteries including the coronary vessels. Relaxation of the coronary artery will increase its diameter enabling it to carry more blood and oxygen to the heart muscle.


Commonly used calcium channel blockers include Cardizem, Procardia, and Norvasc.

"
"
Limit your alcohol intake.,
Read the packaging.,
Lose weight.,
Exercise regularly.",How to Lower Triglycerides2," Alcohol is high in calories and sugar and can increase triglyceride levels. Even small amounts of alcohol can raise your number. Some research has suggested that drinking more than one drink a day for women and two drinks a day for men can increase triglyceride levels significantly.Some people with very high triglycerides may need to cut out alcohol entirely.

, At the supermarket, spend a few minutes reading nutrition labels. This can help you decide whether you should buy certain foods or leave them on the shelf. An activity that takes just 1 minute can save you loads of strife in the long run.


If the label lists certain sugars in the first few ingredients, you should keep it on the shelf. Be on the lookout for brown sugar, high-fructose corn syrup, honey, molasses, fruit juice concentrates, dextrose, glucose, maltose, sucrose and syrup. These are all sugars, which can increase triglycerides.One helpful tip when grocery shopping is to focus your shopping on the outside perimeter of the supermarket. This is where most of the fresh produce, grains, and meats are located. Processed and packaged foods tend to be located in the centre of the store so try to avoid those aisles as much as possible.

, If you're overweight, even losing just five to ten percent of your total body weight can help lower your triglycerides and cholesterol and reduce your risk of heart disease. Obesity leads to an increase in fat cells. People who maintain a healthy weight typically have normal (in other words, healthy) levels of triglycerides. Belly fat especially is a key indicator of high triglyceride levels.Whether or not someone is overweight or obese can be determined by using the body mass index (BMI), an indicator of body fatness. BMI is a person's weight in kilograms (kg) divided by the square of the person's height in meters (m). A BMI of 25 — 29.9 is considered overweight, while a BMI greater than 30 is considered obese.To lose weight, reduce the number of calories you intake and increase the amount of exercise you do. This is the best way to lose weight. Always be sure to consult your physician and potentially also a registered dietitian before beginning any weight loss or diet-and-exercise program.
You can also make a concerted effort to watch portion sizes and to eat slowly and stop when you're full.
You can control how many pounds of weight you lose! You've probably already heard the number one rule of weight loss: you need to have a deficit of 3,500 calories. That sounds like a lot, but really, it's just burning 3,500 more calories than you eat, or 500 more calories than you eat in a week. Every week that you follow this, you could potentially lose a pound of fat!

, To see a reduction in your triglyceride levels, try to get at least 30 minutes of some form of exercise on most or all days of the week. Studies have shown that aerobic exercise (meaning exercise that gets your heart rate up to at least 70 percent of your target heart rate), sustained for an average of 20 – 30 minutes, will decrease your triglyceride level.Take a brisk daily walk, join the pool or hit the gym to burn off those extra triglycerides.Obtain your target heart rate by subtracting your age from 220 and then multiplying it by .70. For example, if you are 20 years old, your target heart rate would be 140.
Regular physical activity kills two birds with one stone; it boosts ""good"" cholesterol while simultaneously lowering ""bad"" cholesterol and triglycerides.
If you don't have time to exercise for 30 consecutive minutes, try squeezing it in in small increments throughout the day. Take a short walk around the block, climb the stairs at work, or try sit-ups, yoga, or core workouts as you watch television at night.

Consult your physician.,
Know what's normal.,
Ask your doctor about medication.",How to Lower Triglycerides3," There's a lot of information and fancy scientific and medical language — for example, triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and so on — that can be very confusing. It's best to get clear, precise and up-to-date information from your doctor about your health and risk levels.


The medical community still is unsure of exactly what triglyceride levels mean and signify for developing serious heart conditions. While we know that high triglyceride levels have been correlated with increased risk of developing heart disease, the relationship between lowered triglyceride levels and reduced heart disease risk is less clear. It's best to talk to your doctor to get the most recent and relevant information for your particular situation., According to the American Heart Association (AHA), a triglyceride level of 100 mg/dL (1.1 mmol/L) or lower is considered ""optimal"" for heart health. There's a scale you can consult to learn what ""normal"" levels of triglycerides actually means:Normal — Less than 150 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), or less than 1.7 millimoles per liter (mmol/L)

Borderline high — 150 to 199 mg/dL (1.8 to 2.2 mmol/L)

High — 200 to 499 mg/dL (2.3 to 5.6 mmol/L)

Very high — 500 mg/dL or above (5.7 mmol/L or above)

, For some people with high triglycerides, medicine may be the only quick-acting solution; however, doctors generally try to prescribe medication to lower triglyceride levels as a last resort since it can be complicated, particularly if you have other health or medical conditions. Your doctor will usually check for high triglycerides as part of a cholesterol test (sometimes called a lipid panel or lipid profile) before recommending any prescribed medications. You'll have to fast for nine to 12 hours (to lower your blood sugar) before blood can be drawn for an accurate triglyceride measurement. This is the only way to know if you're a candidate for medication. Here are are several medications that can improve triglyceride levels:Fibrates, such as Lopid, Fibricor, and Tricor
Nicotinic acid, or Niaspan
High-doses of prescribed omega-3s, such as Epanova, Lovaza, and Vascepa

Stretch regularly.,
Try a variety of exercises each week.,
Stay consistent with activity.,
Include a warm-up and cool-down with exercise.,
Push through light to mild aches and pains.,
Do strength training.",How to Loosen Joints with Exercise," One of the best exercises that you can do to loosen your joints is tai chi. In fact, one of the sought after benefits of tai chi is the ability to keep joints loose and flexible.Tai chi is an ancient Chinese exercise that was designed to help calm and focus your mind while reducing stress and loosening stiff joints.
If you want to loosen your joints, try starting with tai chi. It's a great exercise as its appropriate for any fitness or skill level. You'll be guided through a series of fluid movements while be instructed to calm and focus your mind.
Look for a local tai chi class that you can attend. Or you can look online for tai chi videos or consider purchasing a DVD so that you can do tai chi in the comfort of your own home.;
, Similar to tai chi, yoga is another great exercise to help loosen up your joints. Although a little more difficult than tai chi, it's still a great exercise that can be tailored to any fitness level.


Studies have shown that yoga has a variety of health benefits. In particular, yoga can help relieve joint pain and stiffness and improve range of motion and flexibility.Not all yoga classes will be useful to help loosen your joints. Look for restorative yoga, yoga for beginners or yoga for arthritis or pain relief. These classes will be geared toward improving flexibility and range of motion.
If you belong to a gym, see if they offer yoga classes. If not, try looking for a local yoga studio to take a class. You can also find a variety of DVD's and online videos that you can use to do yoga at home.

, To help get your heart rate up and burn some calories while loosening up your joints, consider using the elliptical. It's a great machine that's easy on the joints and helps with your flexibility.The elliptical machine is a great idea for those who want to get in a good cardio workout while loosening their joints. You'll work up more of a sweat compared to doing yoga or tai chi.
The elliptical is great because it allows your joints to move through a full range of motion without the rough impact. The machine pulls your body through fluid motions.
Try to use the handles of the elliptical as well. You'll work your body harder, but also keep your upper body and joints moving which will help loosen them up.
Do at least 20 minutes of the elliptical (or another form of cardiovascular activity). Don't forget to stretch afterward!

, Similar to yoga, pilates is a strength training class that also helps loosen and strengthen your joints. This is a great exercise to do if you want to build muscle mass or strength in addition to loosening stiff joints.Pilates is a class that uses a floor mat or machine to do exercises. It's focus is to help improve balance and flexibility by focusing on joint mobility and stability.
When you work through each pilates pose, you will be focusing on working one particular joint or group of muscles. This allows you to move through each joint and work on loosening it up and improving flexibility.
Look for a pilates class at your gym or a local studio in your area. Some pilates exercises can be done at home so following online videos or DVDs at home is also a great idea.

, Swimming, water aerobics or any type of water sport or exercise can help you loosen your joints. The buoyancy provided by the water helps make exercise easier while allowing you to relieve joint stiffness.When you're in water, it can help you feel 50% lighter (or more) than you would on land or out of the water. This lightness allows you to perform different exercises and move your body in ways that wouldn't be easy or possible otherwise.
One of the best parts about swimming or water aerobics is that these exercises require the use of multiple joint groups - both upper and lower body. As you warm up and move through exercises, you'll loosen up most if not all of your joints.
Look for a water aerobics class near you. If you can't find one, consider swimming laps at your local pool, gym or recreation center.
Other exercises that you can do in pool include cycling in a donut, walking back and forth, walking sideways, and walking backward. Some water-based strength training exercises include squats, side leg raises, step-ups, and balancing on one leg. If you are feeling that these exercises are too easy, then you may want to add water weights to your ankles.

, Although there are some specific exercises that you can do that loosen joints and decrease stiffness, one of the best things you can do are range of motion exercises.


Range of motion exercises are not aerobic activities or strength training. The goal of these exercises is specifically to loosen joints and maintain or improve the range of motion you have at each of your joints.If you want to loosen your joints, regardless of the reason, doing range of motion exercises is essential. They're easy enough to do on a daily basis and can loosen joints on the spot.
Range of motion exercises can be done at home. Try the following: neck or head rolls, shoulder shrugs, shoulder rolls, side bends, trunk rotation or hip rolls.

, If you need to focus on loosening your joints, you might have joint stiffness. In addition to loosening your joints with exercise, self-massage and foam rolling can also keep your joints loose.Foam rollers and self-massage isn't just for athletes. Studies have shown that these practices if done on a weekly basis can help reduce joint pain and stiffness by about half.
Foam rolling and self-massage specifically targets the fascia around your muscles and joints. When irritated (which happens more frequently as you age), it makes joints feel stiff, tight and sore.
Purchase a foam roller to keep at home to use on a regular basis. Spend a few minutes after you exercise or do range of motion exercises to roll over specific joints or areas that feel tight and you want to be more loose.

, Stretching on a regular basis is an easy way to keep joints loose as well. However, you need to be careful with what stretches you do and how you perform them.


Talk to your doctor or physical therapist about the best types of stretches for your body. Also get specific guidance and instruction on how to stretch safely.
Best upper body stretches include: lying abdominal stretch, tricep stretch, seated forward bend and mid back stretch.For your lower body, try: hip flexor stretch, hamstring stretch, butterfly stretch, and seated hip stretch.
Note that many stretching exercises can also be considered range of motion exercises and complete two types of exercises in one., There are many different types of exercises that you can do to help loosen your joints. Try to include a variety of these exercises each week, instead of focusing on just a single activity.


Studies have shown that if you continuously participate in only one or two types of exercises each week, you're more at risk for overuse injuries. This can weaken your muscles around the joint and cause your joint to take on more impact. Overtime, this can lead to joint stiffness, pain and even damage.
To prevent this from happening, aim to include a few different types of exercises each week. Alternate between the intensity of the exercise and which joints or muscle groups are primarily involved.
For example, if you normally go for a walk Monday and Wednesday morning, try out a water aerobics class on Tuesday and use the Elliptical on Friday.

, If your joints are tight, exercising may be something that can be hard to get started with. However, the more you exercise and the more consistent you are, the looser your joints will be.


Studies have shown that those who exercised at least 2 times per week had a significant decline in pain and stiffness in their joints.An occasional exercise session will loosen your joints and relieve stiffness. However, if you don't keep up with this routine, your joints will regress back to being stiff.
To avoid this, exercise consistently and regularly. This means you'll need to exercise at least 3-4 times per week or more often. You'll notice that the more consistent you are, the less pain and stiffness you'll feel with time.

, If you want to loosen your joints with exercise, it's important to put in some extra time before and after a workout to do just that.Exercise will loosen your joints. However, you need to give your body time to loosen up through a warm-up. Spend about 5-10 minutes getting your body warmed up.
A warm-up will help increase blood flow to your joints and muscles. This helps them get physically warm and increases the oxygen and nutrient rich blood that's being delivered.
Spend your warm-up doing a few minutes of a slower, lower intensity activity. You could walk on the treadmill, cycle slowly or use the elliptical without resistance.
Keep joints from getting stiff after your exercise routine by stretching and doing range of motions exercises as a cool down.

, If you have arthritis or another degenerative joint condition, it's likely that you have the occasional ache or pain in your joints. Most times, it's actually beneficial to push through those pains.


Health professionals note that it's normal and to be expected to have some initial pain, stiffness or tightness in your joints when you first start moving. However, if you continue with movement, stretching or range of motion exercises, the pain should subside.Continued movement helps lubricate your joint which can help it loosen it up and feel more flexible.
If the pain is sharp, doesn't go away or gets worse with movement, discontinue exercise. You'll most likely need to talk to your doctor about this type of pain.
Taking over-the-counter NSAIDS as needed may be in order to help you get through your workout. However, be careful with these medications, as they can cause gastrointestinal distress and gastric ulcers.

, Although cardiovascular exercise and stretching are great to loosen joints, strength training is equally important to prevent joint stiffness.Joints become stiff when the muscles and ligaments around them are tight and stiff. This can occur more frequently if those same muscles and ligaments are weak.
Strength training exercises not only build muscle, but also are key for building muscle strength and tone of the ligaments and muscle groups around your joints.
In addition to your cardio activities and stretching, include 1-2 days of strength training. Always warm-up before lifting weights as well.

Understand the importance of healthy blood flow.,
Understand the relationship between blood and oxygen.,
Familiarize yourself with the functions of blood and oxygen in the body.,
Learn about the conditions that affect cardiovascular health.",How to Maintain a Healthy Cardiovascular System5," Your heart is the power behind your cardiovascular circulatory system, pumping blood through your blood vessels, supplying every part of your body with the oxygen and nutrients it needs for proper functioning.


With poor circulation, not only is your blood flow impaired, compromising that blood supply, but your heart is compromised as well. Both have negative consequences and can lead to a variety of health problems.

, The coronary arteries deliver blood to the heart muscle, providing a continuous supply of oxygen and nutrients needed for it to stay healthy and functions normally.


The harder the heart has to work to pump blood, the more oxygen it needs. For example, when you exercise, your heart rate and blood pressure increases, which in turn increases your heart's demand for oxygen.
Good blood flow is essential for proper brain function and oxygen transport to vital organs in the body. Because your heart is the pump that keeps your blood circulating, it's important to maintain a strong heart.

, Oxygen enters the lungs when we breathe in. It is then carried around the body in the blood.


Nutrients from food can't provide energy until they combine with oxygen in the cells of the body. Oxygen (O2) is one of the most important elements required to sustain life. Gases such as oxygen and carbon dioxide are transported by blood.
Poor circulation can lead directly to heart attack, stroke, eye disease, kidney disease, and claudication (leg muscle pain or weakness that comes and goes after an activity like walking).

, There are a number of conditions that interfere with the proper function of the cardiovascular system. These conditions decrease blood and oxygen supply to the heart.



Coronary artery disease: This occurs when the arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle (coronary arteries) become hardened and narrowed due to the buildup of plaque on the inner walls or lining of the arteries (atherosclerosis). Blood flow to the heart is reduced as plaque narrows the coronary arteries. This decreases the oxygen supply to the heart muscle.

Angina: Angina is caused by reduced blood flow to your heart muscle. Your blood carries oxygen, which your heart muscle needs to survive. When your heart muscle isn't getting enough oxygen, it causes a condition called ischemia (lack of oxygen supply).
Physical trauma that reduces circulation and O2 supply
Infections that use up oxygen to combat bacteria, fungi and viruses.

Consume foods and drinks high in calcium.,
Get plenty of vitamin D. Scientists are still figuring out how much vitamin D is optimal in a diet, but you should get at least 600 international units per day.,
Eat a healthy diet rich in manganese, zinc, and copper.,
Drink at least eight glasses of clean water every day.,
Avoid excessive amounts of harmful substances.,
Consume the right amount of Vitamin A.,
Get enough exercise.,
Get at least eight hours of sleep every night.,
Work on good posture.,
Avoid smoking and drinking in excess.,
Ask your doctor to help with prevention.",How to Maintain the Skeletal System," Adults should be getting 1,000 mg of calcium every day. Calcium is the most important mineral for maintaining bone health, because bones use calcium to remain strong and prevent bones from becoming brittle. Men over 50 and women over 70 need more calcium – 1,200 mg per day.Foods high in calcium include dairy products, broccoli, salmon, leafy green vegetables, soy products, and cheese.
You should not consume more than 2000 mg of calcium a day. Side effects of calcium supplementation include constipation, indigestion, and increased risk of kidney stones.;
, Healthy teens and adults can have up to 4,000 IU per day. The main way to do this is by getting sunlight. If you cannot get sunlight, talk to your doctor about other ways to get vitamin D. The use of vitamin D supplements is controversial, so your doctor may offer specific advice.This doesn’t mean tanning, which is quite unhealthy for your skin and can cause cancer. It only takes a short time to get enough vitamin D – as little as 15 minutes depending on your skin type and where you live., A healthy diet includes a balance of lean protein, whole grains, and fruits and vegetables. Trace amounts of these elements have been shown to be prevalent in bones. There are foods you can eat to increase your levels of manganese, zinc, and copper.Foods high in manganese include nuts, shellfish, dark chocolate, soybeans, and sunflower seeds.
Beef, shellfish, and peanuts are foods that are high in zinc.
Copper is prevalent in foods like calamari, lobster, sun dried tomatoes, and oysters.

, The body needs to remain hydrated to be healthy. Hydration benefits your entire body, especially your organs and joints, and has been shown to reduce the risk of osteoporosis.The amount of fluids you need is based on various factors, but women should generally have nine cups per day, and men 13. Having at least eight on any given day is good, but try for more., Salt, soda, carbonated drinks, caffeine, and hydrogenated oils should be consumed in moderation. They are known to diminish calcium content in bones. They have numerous other drawbacks for your health, so it is best to avoid them in most situations.


You should be consuming a maximum of 5,000 IUs (international units) of Vitamin A per day. To avoid consuming too much Vitamin A, eat fewer eggs or egg whites only, switch to non-fat or low-fat dairy products and check the concentration of Vitamin A in your multivitamin supplements.

, This compound is important to bone growth, but too much actually contributes to bone loss. Teenage and adult males should get about 3,000 IU of Vitamin D, and teenage and adult females around 2,310.For your reference, an ounce of cheddar cheese contains about 300 IU of Vitamin A, and a cup of whole milk 500.

, Engage in regular weight-bearing exercise such as walking, jogging, climbing stairs, cycling and weightlifting. Regular exercise should include about 30 minutes of physical activity five days a week. Bones benefit from occasional stress, such as weight-bearing exercise, because they lose calcium without stress. Bones will grow stronger the more that they are used.


Studies have shown that sedentary lifestyles are harmful to bone health because you are not getting the exercise you need. Since spending too much time in chairs is bad for your spine, it’s a lose-lose., Sufficient sleep is important to bone health because the body repairs broken tissues during sleep. Be careful to sleep in a way that helps your spine stay straight. If you like sleeping on your side, place a pillow between your knees to keep your spine aligned. If you sleep on your back, place a pillow under your knees.


All bodies require a different mattress type, so try a few before settling on one. Try not to get one so firm that it creates pressure points, as this can cause back pain., This is an area many people don't often think about. There are simple ways to improve your posture as you are seated, standing, lying down, and lifting. You will be surprised how straight your back feels after a few days of making sure to keep your spine aligned.When seated, sit at the back of the chair with your spine straight. Keep your knees at a 90 degree angle and your feet flat on the floor. Get up and move around at least once every 30 minutes.
When lifting objects, bend straight down instead of bending over. Lift from your knees rather than with your back. Avoid any twisting or jerking motions.
Most people have less trouble standing with good posture. Make sure you aren't hunching over, and try to keep your spine straight.

, Nicotine and alcohol make bones weak and brittle by depleting their calcium content. Going to bed tipsy or drunk prevents your body from going through the necessary sleep cycles to allow you to be fully rested. This can translate into poor sleeping posture or tossing and turning, which is bad for your skeletal system., If you have osteoporosis or are at risk for the condition, you may need to let your doctor help you prevent or treat it. Tell them your concerns about bone health, and if they think dietary supplements are necessary. Keep them posted on any developments and mention your bone health at your yearly physical."

Seek medical assistance for a serious wound.,
Use kaolin dressing to stimulate clotting.,
Plug major wounds with zeolite bags.",How to Make Blood Coagulate Faster1," Injuries from accidents, violence, or animal bites, as well as dirty wounds with foreign objects, require quick first aid and professional medical attention. This is partly because coagulation is insufficient to prevent bleeding from hemorrhaging and other major injuries, even if you have healthy blood.If you are able to see muscle or fat tissue or unable to press the edges of the wound together using gentle pressure, get to a hospital.
Other reasons a wound should be considered serious include close proximity to a joint or genitalia, a jagged pattern of broken skin, a continuous or pulsing flow of blood, or impalement by something visibly unclean.
Reduce bleeding for transport of an injured person by applying pressure bandages and, if necessary, a tourniquet.;
, Kaolin is a mineral that has been used to help reduce blood loss following major injuries, including those sustained in combat. Use dressing that is impregnated with kaolin to apply a pressure bandage to the wound. The pressure counteracts the blood pressure that would otherwise push blood out of the body, while the kaolin will prompt the coagulation process to begin.Get kaolin-treated dressings for your vehicle’s first aid kit, or to carry in first aid kits while spending time in remote areas. They can be found a specialty supplies stores and online.

, Another first aid item used to treat injuries that involve major hemorrhaging are small mesh bags that contain the mineral zeolite. When activated, these bags not only fill a large wound and apply even pressure throughout, the zeolite prompts the blood in the area to begin coagulating and can even speed up the process.Mesh pouches filled with zeolite can be purchased from specialty first aid retailers. They will be easier to find online than in stores.
These items are designed to help treat large wounds, and are designed to stabilize wound victims for transport to a medical facility.
QuikClot is a zeolite containing product that stops bleeding fast."

Monitor the length of time that a minor cut bleeds.,
Recognize other symptoms of a potential bleeding disorder.,
Get a formal medical diagnosis.,
Consider treatment options.",How to Make Blood Coagulate Faster2," The most telling sign that your blood is not coagulating fast enough is excessive bleeding. It should not take longer than ten minutes for a small cut or scrape to stop bleeding, with anywhere from one to nine minutes being normal. If you are still bleeding after ten minutes, see a doctor as soon as possible.If you or someone else is losing substantial amounts of blood, provide first aid and get to a hospital as quickly as possible.

, In addition to excessive bleeding following a minor injuries, other symptoms may also indicate a bleeding disorder. These include unexpected or sudden bruising, red or pink urine, and black or bloody bowel movements. Dark spots in your vomit (which will look like coffee grounds) may also indicate a bleeding disorder. If any of these symptoms appear, see a doctor as soon as possible.Recurring or persistent dizziness, headaches, and vision changes may also indicate a bleeding disorder, as well as joint pain, bleeding gums, or irregularly heavy or long-lasting menstrual periods.

, Your doctor will need to do blood tests to determine whether you have a bleeding disorder. In addition to evaluating the contents of your blood (such as the amount of platelets and proteins), your doctor will also order a test to determine the efficiency of your blood’s coagulation process., There may be a serious underlying cause for a bleeding disorder that requires treatment. There are also treatments that can help remedy symptoms of a bleeding disorder directly. Follow your doctor’s guidance regarding any sort of treatment for a bleeding disorder.Potential treatment options include Vitamin K injections, plasma or platelet transfusions, or medications.
If you are diagnosed with a bleeding disorder, expect to take medication to help ensure your blood will be able to coagulate when necessary.

Drink less alcohol.,
Ask your doctor about aspirin use.,
Avoid supplements and food that can thin your blood.,
Talk to your doctor about the risk of blood clots.,
Consult a physician in an emergency.",How to Make Blood Coagulate Faster3," Alcohol reduces the “stickiness” of the platelets in your blood, making them less capable of clumping together to form a blood clot. In fact, the claim that alcohol in moderation is “good for you” stems from this effect. However, if you have a condition that causes your blood to coagulate slowly, drinking alcohol can worsen this symptom.While one or two alcoholic beverages from time to time are unlikely to have an affect on your blood’s ability to coagulate, frequent or heaving drinking can put you at greater risk.

, Aspirin is commonly recommended as a way to reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke, but it can also thin your blood, making it harder for it to clot. If you notice that your blood doesn’t clot well or that you bruise easily after you start taking aspirin, talk to your doctor about the pros and cons of continuing to take the aspirin.Don’t stop taking the aspirin without discussing it with your doctor.

, Common dietary supplements such as fish oil, Coenzyme Q10, and vitamin E thin your blood and make it harder for it to coagulate. Consult with your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking blood thinning medications.

Additionally, foods can have the same effect, including raisins, prunes, cherries, cranberries, blueberries, grapes, strawberries, tangerines, oranges, onions, olive oil, garlic, ginger, green tea, papaya, and pumpkin seeds.
Common herbs that can thin your blood include cinnamon, curry, cayenne pepper, paprika, thyme, turmeric, oregano, and peppermint.Alternatively, some foods can decrease bleeding, such as green leafy vegetables, broccoli, celery, and carrots.Eating pineapple a few days before surgery can reduce bleeding and bruising post-operation.

, For some people, the risk of blood clots is more dangerous than potential blood loss caused by slow coagulation. In fact, the clots that save your body from losing blood when you are injured can be deadly when they form within an artery or vein. In part for this reason, you should never take steps to help your blood coagulate and clot without professional medical guidance., If you are experiencing dangerous blood loss, there are some medications that are used exclusively for emergency treatment. For instance, antifibrinolytic drugs prevent blood clots from breaking down and can help prevent blood loss during surgery or following a serious injury. If you have an emergency situation, don’t hesitate to get medical attention because there are medicines available that can help your blood clot better.These drugs are administered by medical professionals, so seek treatment immediately.

Get some over-the-counter dramamine.,
Acquire a scopolamine patch.,
Apply a scopolamine patch.,
Try some ginger supplements.",How to Deal With Motion Sickness on Rides1," Dimenhydrinate (Dramamine, but brand names vary) is an antihistamine drug that can be purchased at most grocery stores and pharmacies. These drugs block receptors in the brain associated with nausea and vomiting. You can purchase dramamine in two tablet forms — drowsy and non-drowsy. Non-drowsy is best for amusement parks. If you are taking a train or a plane long distance and can sleep, the drowsy kind will work well.


To prevent motion sickness, the first dose should be taken 30 minutes to one hour before you go to the amusement park. Adults and children older than age 12 can usually take dimenhydrinate every four to six hours as needed to prevent or treat motion sickness. Children under 12 can usually be given dimenhydrinate every six to eight hours or as needed to prevent or treat motion sickness, but talk to your child's doctor before using medications on young children.
There are a few other similar medications used for motion sickness. check with your doctor or pharmacist on which medication may be best for you.;
, You’ll need to see a doctor to get a prescription for this medication. Generally, this medication is saved for those who aren’t helped by dramamine. Most of the time, scopolamine is administered in a patch form.


Talk to your doctor about potential side effects of this medication, which can include drowsiness, disorientation, dry mouth, or hallucinations.People with glaucoma or certain other medical problems may not be able to use scopolamine, so make sure to tell your doctor about any medical problems you have.

, The patch should be applied as directed on the package. Normally, it should be placed on the back of the ear, at least four hours prior to when it is actually needed. Wash behind your ear before applying. Remove the patch from the protective packaging. Place on the skin. Wash your hands thoroughly afterwards. Leave on for as long as you need it or as long as the package prescribes., Ginger (zingiber officinale) is cheap and effective. You can consume ginger raw or in lozenge/pill form. You can purchase ginger at any grocery store or pharmacy.


If you want to take raw ginger before you get on a ride, just peel it and dice it into a small cube. Picture a piece of gum and try to make your raw ginger resemble that size. Know that many find the aftertaste of ginger to be pungent and generally unpleasant. If this is you, choose the pill or lozenge form."

Eat something to settle your stomach.,
Sit in the most stable part of the ride.,
Keep your head and neck straight.,
Keep your eyes on a fixed point.,
Reduce your activity.,
Apply pressure to your P6 point.",How to Deal With Motion Sickness on Rides2," Either before you get on the ride or when you get off the ride, find somewhere to eat something that will soothe your stomach, like crackers or ginger ale. Bland food, high in carbohydrates and low in fats are best for motion sickness. Eat foods with ginger in them or breads, cereals, grains, or fruits.Spicy and acidic foods can irritate the stomach lining, making your whole system more susceptible to problems., Depending on the vehicle, this will change. Generally, the most stable part of a roller coaster is the middle. The back and front of the ride tend to whip around more than the middle. In cars, the most stable part is the front seat. On boats and planes, the most stable part is the middle again., Since motion sickness is often caused by conflicting signals from various parts of your body, try to keep your head and neck straight at all times. By keeping your body in a straight line, you’ll keep your head from bouncing around more. On roller coasters, this is especially important if you want to avoid head and neck injuries., You are more likely to get dizzy if your eyes are swirling around in front of you. Keep your eyes on a fixed point wherever you are. If you are on a roller coaster, it helps to stare at the car in front of you or simply to close your eyes. If you are on a boat, stare at the horizon. This will reduce sea-sickness., Simplicity is best for motion sickness. Obviously, this doesn’t really apply to amusement park rides, where multitasking is nearly impossible. But on planes, trains, boats, or in cars, try to do less. Stop reading your book or watching a movie. Just sit back and relax to cure motion sickness., The acupuncture point known as Pericardium 6 is said to relieve general nausea. It is on the inside of the wrist, a little more than an inch up the arm from the center of the wrist crease. Many travel stores sell wristbands with built in buttons that apply pressure to this point. Scientific studies have shown the effectiveness of this method on motion sickness.There is still some debate as to whether the pressure point or the act of pressing the point helps reduce nausea.Either way, give it a try.

Cook all food at the correct temperature.",How to Deal With Hepatitis A," Hepatitis A has a number of symptoms that typically appear between two and six weeks from the date of exposure. Some of these symptoms are generic, like a fever, while others, like jaundice, are telltale signs of hepatitis. Keep in mind that not all those infected with hepatitis A will show symptoms. Asymptomatic hepatitis A is more common in children than adults. When hepatitis A does show symptoms, it appears with the following signs.Abrupt onset of a fever
Loss of appetite
Fatigue or lack of energy
Nausea or vomiting.
Abdominal pain. Since hepatitis attacks the liver, abdominal pain is often concentrated on the right side of your body just below the ribs, where the liver is located.
Dark urine
Light or clay-colored stools
Joint pain
Jaundice. This is a yellowing of the skin and eyes. It is usually considered the telltale symptom for hepatitis, although it does not appear in all cases.;
, Like most diseases, hepatitis A can infect anyone. There are some people, however, who are statistically at higher risk than others for contracting the disease. The following activities are considered risk factors for hepatitis A.International travel. Besides the United States, Canada, Western Europe, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand, hepatitis A is rather common in most countries of the world. Traveling abroad, especially to developing nations that may lack sanitation infrastructure, puts you at increased risk for hepatitis.
Sexual contact with an infected person. During sex, you can come into contact with particles of the hepatitis A virus. Having an infected sexual partner can increase your chances of coming down with the disease.
Men who have sexual contact with other men. Since hepatitis A is spread through the fecal-oral route, male-on-male sexual contact puts participants at risk for contracting the virus.
Drug use. Both IV and non-IV drug use places you at greater risk for hepatitis A, especially if users share paraphernalia.
Living with someone who is infected. Household contact can spread the virus. If infected persons do not exercise proper hygiene like washing their hands after using the bathroom, they risk infecting other members of the household.

, If you are experiencing any of the symptoms stated above, go to the doctor for an evaluation. The doctor will physically examine your symptoms. If he suspects hepatitis A, he will perform a blood test to confirm. If this blood test comes out positive, you've contracted the virus. If this is the case, don't panic. Though you will feel very sick for a while, hepatitis A is rarely fatal and symptoms usually disappear within two months. After that, you'll be immune to the virus for life. In the meantime, you'll have to treat the disease properly., Hepatitis A will drain your energy through fever, vomiting, and diarrhea. To counteract this, you'll have to conserve your energy so you're strong enough to fight off the virus.Avoid strenuous activity like vigorous exercise. Light activities like walking may be possible if you're feeling strong enough, though you should always consult your doctor before trying this.
If possible, take time off from school or work. This is important both for your own energy levels and to avoid spreading the disease to others.

, Ibuprofen is an anti-inflammatory that can help treat the body aches and swelling associated with hepatitis A. Brand names include Motrin and Advil. Ibuprofen is the preferred pain reliever for hepatitis because it is easy on the liver. On the contrary, you should avoid acetaminophen and aspirin, as these are tougher on the liver and could cause further damage., You'll feel very sick, but you should still do your best to practice good hygiene. Wash your hands often, especially after using the bathroom, and don't drink out of cups or eat with utensils that other people will use. This will help prevent you spreading the virus to your family, friends, roommates, or any others living in close proximity to you.

, Your body will need to replace fluids lost through vomiting and diarrhea. Water is usually the best choice, but if you're having trouble eating or keeping food down, you may need to opt for a fluid with more nutrients to avoid getting malnourished. Good choices include Gatorade, milk, fruit juices, and nutritional supplement drinks like Ensure.Avoid alcohol completely while recovering. Alcohol puts strain on the liver, which can cause serious or permanent damage while you're recovering from the disease., Three large meals may make you feel nauseous or uncomfortable, so break up your eating schedule into smaller meals. This will prevent nausea and help your body process foods more efficiently., Protein helps the body repair damage, which is necessary for your liver to heal. Aim for 60 to 120 grams of protein daily. Also try to get protein from plant sources like beans, chickpeas, tofu, quinoa, nuts, and soy products. Your healing body will probably tolerate these foods better than meats., Since you may suffer from vomiting, diarrhea, and lack of appetite, it's important to eat foods that will keep your energy levels up. You can keep your calorie levels up by adding certain ingredients to meals or snacking on others throughout the day.Drink whole milk instead of reduced fat varieties
Eat fruit canned in syrup for sugars
Add butter to foods for fats and oil
Snack on vegetables dipped in salad dressing, nuts, and dairy products. These are all high in fats and calories.
Eat bread, bagels, pasta, and other foods high in carbohydrates
Avoid diet or fat-free foods. These will be lower in calories and won't help you keep your energy up.

, Since you'll lose nutrients through vomiting and diarrhea, you'll need to make sure you're eating enough to maintain your weight. If your weight stays consistent, your diet plan is working. If you start losing weight, you need to bring up your calorie intake. If you fail to do so, you could end up in the hospital with complications from your disease.It would also be a good idea to let your doctor know if you've lost weight. She may want to examine you to make sure there are no other issues with your recovery.

, Although rare, you could experience severe complications from hepatitis A. These can land you in the hospital and are potentially life-threatening. Monitor your condition closely and contact your doctor immediately if you notice symptoms of the following conditions.Cholestasis. This is a condition where bile builds up inside the liver. It is usually not a medical emergency, but your doctor should still be informed so he can decide on the best course of action. Symptoms include persistent fever, jaundice, diarrhea, and weight loss.
Liver failure. This rare but very serious complication stops liver function. Untreated, it can be deadly. Besides normal hepatitis symptoms, signs of liver failure include nosebleeds, easy bruising, hair loss, high fever, shivering, edema (buildup of fluid in the legs, ankles, and feet), ascites (buildup of fluid in the abdomen resulting in a noticeable bulge), and drowsiness/confusion. Contact your doctor right away if you experience these symptoms.

, It's likely your doctor will want to see you regularly while you recover to monitor your condition and test your liver function. Be sure to keep appointments with your doctor and keep her updated on your condition to ensure a healthy recovery., Fortunately, there is a vaccine available for Hepatitis A that is 99 – 100% effective in preventing the disease. It is recommended for all children. If you were never vaccinated, you should consult your healthcare provider to receive a vaccine. Also consult your doctor if you fall into one of the risk groups discussed in Part 1, as he may recommend a booster for your vaccine., Regular handwashing is considered one of the best ways to avoid contracting and spreading disease. Hepatitis A is no exception. Since hepatitis A is spread through fecal contamination, always wash your hands thoroughly after using the bathroom. Follow these steps for proper hand-washing technique.Wet your hands with clean, running water.
Apply soap and lather your hands by rubbing them together. Be sure to cover all parts of your hands, including the backs, between your fingers, and your fingernails.
Scrub your hands for 20 seconds. Popular timekeeping tricks are humming the ""Happy Birthday"" song twice, or singing the ABC's.
Rinse your hands under clean, running water. Make sure to avoid touching the faucet with your hands when you turn the water off. Use your forearm or elbow instead.
Dry your hands with a clean, dry towel or allow them to air dry.
If soap and water is unavailable, use hand sanitizer that is at least 60% alcohol. Apply the amount suggested by the label to your hands and rub them until they are dry.

, Foods you plan on consuming raw should be carefully washed. If they've been handled by someone who has hepatitis or exposed to human waste, you can get the virus by eating them. To prevent this, be sure all food is clean before you eat it.Rinse fruits and vegetables under running water. Don't use any soap.
If the food has thick or rough skin, like a watermelon, scrub it with a clean brush.
Dry the food with a paper towel or clean cloth.
Avoid eating food or drinking water while in endemic areas, or take special precautions to make sure you are not ingesting anything that may be contaminated.

, Like produce, meat can also be contaminated by hepatitis A if handled by an infected person. To prevent this, follow federal guidelines for properly cooking meat. Generally meat should be heated to at least 145 – 160°F (62.7 – 711°C) degrees to kill any pathogens. Reference this chart to see the right temperature to cook different meats.

Set up your computer monitor at eye level.,
Use an ergonomic chair with proper lumbar support.,
Do not replace your chair with an exercise or gym ball.,
Sit with both feet on the ground and your knees at or above hip level.,
Stretch, walk, or stand every half hour.It’s easy to get bogged down in work, but your posture will thank you by frequently moving a little bit.,
Drive sitting with your back firmly against the seat for proper support.,
Sleep on a firm mattress with pillows.",How to Maintain Good Posture1," Position the computer screen directly in front of the user so the body and neck do not have to twist to view.Ensure the screen rests at eye level so you do not have to tilt your head up or down to see the screen properly.


Keep your head level while using the computer to keep your spine straight.
Avoid tucking your chin into your chest.;
, If you have a desk job that requires you to sit for many hours a day, a chair with proper back support is a must. The lower back has an inward curve that straight-backed chairs do not account for.Sitting for extended amounts of time in a straight-backed chair can lead to back pain and muscle fatigue.


Purchase a chair with a curved back or one that has an adjustable lumbar support.
You can make a DIY lumbar support by using a rolled up towel or pillow and placing at the base of your spine.
Lumbar support add-ons can also be purchased for a marginal price if you don’t want to buy a whole new chair.

, Though it has been in fashion to swap out your office chair to balance on an exercise ball while sitting at your desk, there is no added benefit in doing so.It will not give you a mini ab work out, nor will it help improve your posture., When sitting for a long time, you might be tempted to cross your legs or slouch. The best way to keep good posture at your desk is to keep both feet planted on the ground.Use a footrest, if necessary.


Keep your back straight against the chair.
Keep your shoulders relaxed, but not rounded down or pulled backward.

, Set a timer on your desk and when it goes off stand up and stretch out. Walk to the break room to get some water, or go say hi to a work mate.


You don’t have to go on an extended walk, just take a lap around the office.

, Avoid reclining the seat too far. Use a lumbar support at the curve of your back. Make sure your knees are at the same level or higher than your hips.Move the seat close enough to the steering wheel to allow your knees to bend properly and your feet to reach the pedals.

, Find a mattress that is comfortable for you, but know that firm mattresses are recommended.Avoid sleeping on your stomach or curled up into a ball.If you are sleeping on your side, place a pillow between your legs to support spinal alignment during sleep. If you sleep on your back, place a pillow underneath your knees.Sleep with a pillow under your head as well. Choose a pillow that allows you to keep your head in a neutral position so that your head is neither in a flexed or extended position while sleeping.
Do not sleep with a pillow under your shoulders.

Know the correct way to stand.,
Bend from the knees when lifting heavy objects.Avoid lifting objects heavier than 30 pounds, but when necessary, always bend at the knees first.,
Wear supportive shoes.,
Test your standing posture.,
Consider a device to help you maintain good posture.",How to Maintain Good Posture2," Having good posture while standing is important, especially if you are on your feet all day. If you are standing with proper posture, you reduce stress on your body and may actually have more energy, as your muscles are used most efficiently when you have good posture.Use the following guidelines to make sure you are standing correctly.Hold your head up straight, not tilted forward, backward, or to the side. Picture a string attached to the top of your head, and someone is gently pulling it, keeping your head lifted.
Keep your shoulder blades back, but not so far that they are touching.
Knees should be straight, but not locked.
Tuck your stomach in without tilting your pelvis forward of backwards.
Keep your weight on the balls of your feet.

, Keep your back straight and bend your knees and hips to retrieve the object. Never bend forward from the waist with straight knees.


Use a wide stance with feet firmly planted on the ground. Start close to the object.
Straighten your knees in a steady motion, standing upright without twisting the body.
Hold heavy objects close to you, with elbows bent and stomach muscles tight.

, If you are on your feet all day, you'll want to look for shoes designed for comfort and to adequately support the weight of your body. Look for brands that offer added support and cushioning, plus a roomy toe.Look into orthotic shoes or inserts to support good posture, and avoid high heels., You can easily check your posture by doing a wall test. Stand against a wall, with your head, shoulder blades, and buttocks touching the wall. Your heels should be two to four inches from the wall. Place your palm against the wall and slide your hand behind your lower back.If your posture is good, then there should be a space about the width of a hand between your back and hand.
If there is more space than that, then you can flatten the curve of your back by tensing your abdomen and pulling in your belly button.
If there is less space and your back is touching your hand, arch your back until it is no longer touching your hand.
Once you have corrected your posture, walk away from the wall. Remember how you had to adjust your body to achieve good posture, and make an effort to correct your posture throughout the day.

, You could buy a back support brace, which can be worn under your clothes. You can buy different types of braces to support different parts of your back, such as a belt for lumbar support or a brace that focuses on pulling your shoulders back.


In addition, you might investigate devices that are on the cutting edge of technology, such as a sensor that attaches to your shirt and buzzes when you slouch or one that sticks to your lower back. You can even download an app that detects when you're craning your neck over your smartphone."

Develop a stretching routine.,
Strengthen your core with a Pilates or yoga course.,
Strengthen your spine muscles.",How to Maintain Good Posture3," If you are just starting out, keep your routine short and simple. Try to make it a daily or every other day habit. There are a number of small stretches that can be performed to quickly increase good posture. Try adding some of these exercises to your daily routine:Shoulder rolls: Stand or sit comfortably. As you inhale, lift your shoulders up towards your ears. On the exhale, roll them back, squeezing your shoulder blades together. Repeat five to 10 times.
Release chest: Raise your arms just below your shoulders, keeping palms facing forward. As you inhale, raise your straight arms in front of you, just below the shoulders, keeping palms facing forward. As you exhale, slowly rotate palms so that your fingers point behind you while you open up your arms, similar to a hugging movement. Repeat three to five times.
Pyramid: Step your right foot back so it is flat against the floor and square your hips. With both legs straight, clasp arms behind your back and lean forward from your hips. Keep your back straight and do not round your spine. Take three to five breaths from this position and rise back to standing. Repeat on the other side.
Snow angels: Lie down on the floor and slowly make snow angels with your arms for two to three minutes. Put a rolled up towel underneath your middle spine to increase the stretch.Do not put the towel under your lower back, as this can cause you to hyperextend your back.

, Keeping your core muscles tight helps maintain good posture. Pilates and yoga classes focus on strengthening pelvic and abdominal muscles. Strengthening your core helps support your muscles and keep everything balanced.


Check your local gym or fitness studio for available classes.
Start at the beginner level to avoid injury.
Some simple exercises you can try at home include:Bridge: Lie on your back with your knees bent. Keep your hips straight and tighten your abdominal muscles. Raise your hips until they are aligned with your knees and shoulders, forming a 90 degree angle. Hold for three breaths and slowly lower your hips back to the ground. Repeat three to five times.
Side plank: Lie on your left side, raising your body onto your left forearm. Align your left shoulder over your left elbow, keeping knees, hips, and shoulders aligned. Rest your right arm against the side of your body. Lift your hips off the ground engaging your abdominal muscles. Hold for three breaths. Repeat three to five times and then switch to the right side. To increase the difficulty, straighten your arm and support your weight on your hand instead of resting on your forearm.
Superman: Lie flat on your stomach with your arms in front of you and your legs straight out behind you. Lift your arms and legs as high as you can, keeping all of your joints aligned straight. Hold for three breaths. Repeat three to five times. You can place a pillow under your stomach to reduce the likelihood of hyperextending your back.
Russian twist:Sit on the floor with your knees bent. Lean back just enough to make a V-shape between your thighs and upper body. Keep a natural curve in the lower back. Extend your arms fully out in front of you and twist your torso to the left side until your arms touch the floor. Return to a neutral position, pause, and then twist to the right. Twist back to the right side. Do this from anywhere between 20 – 50 times. To make it more difficult, hold a weight in your hands.



, Oftentimes, bad posture is the product of weakened or imbalanced muscles.To correct this, try doing exercises that specifically focus on strengthening the muscles around the spine, such as the back extensors, neck flexors, and side muscles. Ask a trainer at the gym to suggest some strengthening exercises using the equipment available or try some of the simple exercises below.Reverse fly: Stand up straight, with knees slightly bent, back straight, and feet shoulder-width apart. Holding a 5-8 pound weight in each hand, bend forward at the hips, keeping your back straight. With palms facing down, raise your arms up as far as you can, squeezing your shoulder blades together. It should look like you are ""spreading your wings."" Keep your elbows slightly bent and make sure your head remains in a neutral position and is not flexed forward. Do two sets of 15 reps.
Row: Hold a five to eight pound weight in each hand. Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, knees bent, and lean forward at the hips keeping your back straight. Pull your hands up toward your chest and squeeze your shoulder blades together. Do two sets of 10 reps.
Arm and leg extension: Start on all fours keeping your back straight. Raise your left leg and extend it back behind you. With the leg extended, lift your right arm and reach forward. Hold this for five seconds and then switch sides. Repeat 10 times.
If any of these exercises cause extreme pain, stop immediately and talk to your doctor.

Walk briskly for a few hours a week.,
Take vitamin D for bone and muscle health.,
Eat calcium and nutrient-rich foods.,
Take medications for bone loss.",How to Maintain Good Posture4," Cells in your bones respond to stress by increasing bone density.Brisk walking is one way to lightly increase stress and encourage new bone growth.


Walking for just 30 minutes a day can increase bone density.
Consult a specialist before adding any intensive workouts to your daily routine.

, Keeping your muscles and bones strong will help prevent a hunched back as you age. It will also help you maintain good posture while you’re young. Vitamin D is essential for strong bones.Your body makes vitamin D in response to the sun, but be sure to wear sunblock. You can also increase vitamin D intake with a multivitamin or supplement., Green leafy vegetables are a great source of calcium and other essential nutrients needed for a healthy diet.Milk and calcium-enriched juices are also a good source to increase calcium. Calcium citrate or calcium carbonate supplements may also be used.


If you take a supplement, avoid taking it with other calcium rich foods. If you have milk for breakfast, take your pill at lunch., There are medications available to slow bone loss and increase bone density.These are usually used after a diagnosis of osteoporosis (bone loss) has been confirmed. Consult a doctor if you think this might be a good option for you.

Recognize a mild case of Pseudomonas.,
Know symptoms of different pseudomonas infections.,
Go to the doctor for a diagnosis.,
Discuss treatment options with your doctor.,
Talk to your doctor if you may be at risk.,
Alert your doctor if you think you are infected.,
Discuss medications with your doctor.,
Make dietary and activity changes as recommended by your doctor.",How to Cure Pseudomonas," Pseudomonas usually produce mild symptoms in healthy people with strong immune systems. These infections may be water-borne. There have been reports of:Eye infections in people who use extended-wear contact lenses. To avoid this, change your contact lens solution instead of topping it up. Do not wear your contacts for longer than recommended by your doctor or the manufacturer’s instructions.
Ear infections in children after swimming in contaminated water. This can occur if the pool does not have enough chlorine to adequately disinfect it.
Skin rashes after using a contaminated hot tub. This rash generally manifests as itchy red bumps or blistered filled with fluid around the hair follicles. It may be worse in areas where your skin was covered by a bathing suit.;
, Signs and symptoms of pseudomonas depend on where the infection occurs.

Blood infections are characterized by fever, chills, fatigue, muscle and joint pains, and are extremely serious.Lung infections (pneumonia) include symptoms like chills, fever, a productive cough, difficulty breathing.Skin infections may cause an itchy rash, bleeding ulcers, and/or headache.Ear infections may present with swelling, ear pain, itching inside the ear, discharge from the ear, and difficulty hearing.Eye infections caused by pseudomonas may include the following symptoms: inflammation, pus, swelling, redness, pain in the eye, and impaired vision., The doctor will likely want to look at the rash and may take a sample of the bacteria to send to the lab to confirm the diagnosis. This may be done in two ways:Swabbing the infection on your skin
Taking a biopsy. Doing a biopsy is rare.

, If you are otherwise healthy, treatment may not be necessary. Your immune system may clear the infection itself. However, your doctor may suggest:Anti-itch medications if you have an itchy rash
Antibiotics if you have a serious infection. The doctor may be more likely to prescribe antibiotics if you have an infection in your eye.

, Pseudomonas are most dangerous for people who are in hospitals and have weakened immune systems. Newborns have a higher risk. As an adult, you may have a higher risk if:You are being treated for cancer
You have HIV/AIDS
You have cystic fibrosis
You are on a breathing machine
You are recovering from surgery
You have a catheter
You are recovering from severe burns
You have diabetes mellitus

, Tell your doctor as soon as possible because you will need prompt attention. Pseudomonas can manifest as many different types of infections, depending on where they are located in your body. You may have:Pneumonia. This may be associated with an infected breathing machine.
An eye infection
An ear infection
A urinary tract infection that is introduced by a catheter
An infected surgical wound
An infected ulcer. This may occur to patients that are on prolonged bed rest and develop sores.
A blood infection that enters through an intravenous line

, Your doctor may take a swab sample and send it to the lab to confirm exactly what strain is infecting you. The lab may also be able to help determine what drugs are likely to be effective against the infection. Pseudomonas are often resistant to many commonly prescribed drugs. For many of the drugs that are effective, it is important that your doctor know your complete medical history, particularly if you think you could be pregnant or if you have renal (kidney) impairment. The doctor may prescribe:Ceftazidime. This is usually effective against a common form, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It may be administered as an intramuscular injection or through an IV. It may not be appropriate for patients who are allergic to penicillin.Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Tazocin). This is also effective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It may interact with other medications, so give your doctor a complete list of what you take. This includes over-the-counter medications, herbal remedies, and supplements.Imipenem. This is a broad-spectrum antibiotic which is often administered with cilastatin. The cilastatin increases the half-life of the imipenem and can also help it better penetrate tissue.Aminoglycosides (Gentamicin, Tobramycin, Amikacin). The dosages of these drugs may need to be adjusted according to your body weight and the health of your kidneys. Your doctor may monitor your blood and hydration levels during these treatments, as side effects can include kidney damage (such as nephrotoxicity) or ear and hearing damage.Ciprofloxacin. This can be taken orally or intravenously. Tell your doctor if you have epilepsy, renal impairment, or think you may be pregnant.Colistin. This can be taken orally, intravenously, or in a nebulized form., Some patients, such as those with cystic fibrosis, may need to change their diet and activity levels to ensure proper nutrition and promote healing.If you are on a ventilator to help you breathe, your doctor may recommend a diet that is higher in fats and lower in carbohydrates. Carbohydrates can increase the amount of carbon dioxide your body produces, making breathing more difficult when you are on a ventilator.
If you have a systemic infection, you may need to limit your activity levels. This may not be the case for a localized infection.

Create an ointment using natural oils and herbs.,
Mix chickweed with a natural oil or tea base.,
Try creating an ointment with turmeric.,
Add dried sage to neem oil or flaxseed oil.",How to Cure Lipomas Naturally1," Natural oils such as neem and flaxseed make excellent base for ointments. Experiment with different combinations of herbs and oils.


Neem oil is an astringent that helps protect your skin. It is commonly used in Ayurvedic (ancient Indian) medicine to treat lipomas.Flaxseed oil has high levels of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids. Omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids help to reduce inflammation.Be sure to buy flaxseed oil certified to be free of heavy metals, such as lead and mercury.While not a natural oil, cooled green tea is a great alternative for your base. It is high in antioxidants that help regulate blood sugar and blood fats.;
, Blend 1 teaspoon of chickweed to 2-3 tablespoons of neem oil or flaxseed oil. Apply the salve to the lipoma.


Chickweed is used to reduce fats.You can also use 1-2 tablespoons of cooled green tea instead of neem or flaxseed oil to make a paste.

, Put 1 teaspoon of turmeric together with 2-3 tablespoons of neem oil or flaxseed oil. Smooth the ointment onto the lipoma. Your skin will turn a bit orange or yellow because of the turmeric. Cover the lipoma with a bandage to protect your clothes.Turmeric, like neem oil, is commonly used in Ayurvedic medicine.
For a paste, add 1-2 tablespoons of cooled green tea instead of neem or flaxseed oil to the turmeric.

, Mix ½ to 1 teaspoon of dried sage with 2-3 tablespoons of neem oil or flaxseed oil. Coat the lipoma with the balm.


Substitute 1-2 tablespoons of cooled green tea for neem or flaxseed oil to make a paste.
Sage is used in traditional Chinese medicine to dissolve fatty tissue."

Switch to organic foods as much as possible.,
Increase the amount of vegetables and fruits in your diet.,
Eat more fish.,
Limit eating red meats.",How to Cure Lipomas Naturally2," Switching to organic foods reduces the number of preservatives and additives you eat. Your liver will then be able to focus on removing the toxins stored in the lipoma’s fatty tissue.


Limiting the amount of processed and pre-packaged food you eat will also limit the amount of additives and preservatives you eat.

, Fruits and vegetables have antioxidants which help lower fats in the blood.Choose brightly colored fruits and vegetables for the highest level of antioxidants. Some great examples of fruits and vegetables high in antioxidants are blueberries, raspberries, apples, plums, citrus fruits, leafy green vegetables, squash and bell peppers., Fish has good amounts of healthy omega-3 fats and good quality protein. Omega-3 fats help to decrease inflammation and may help limit the growth of lipomas.Salmon and tuna are excellent sources of omega-3 fatty acids as well as high in protein.Good sources of omega-3 fatty acids include mackerel, herring, trout, which are also high in vitamin B-12., If you do eat red meat, make sure it is grass-fed with no added antibiotics or hormones. Grass-fed meat has a lot of healthy omega-3 and omega-6 fats.Chicken, tofu, and beans are all healthy alternatives to red meat that are also high in protein.

Be aware that natural treatments may take some time to be effective.,
See your doctor if you are experiencing pain or discomfort.,
Choose a medical treatment.",How to Cure Lipomas Naturally3," It may take 1-3 months to see any reduction in size.

, Lipomas are generally harmless, but there is a very small chance that you may have liposarcoma. Liposarcomas are lumps that are similar to lipomas, but they grow rapidly, are painful, and do not move under the skin.Your doctor will diagnose you with a biopsy, MRI or CT scan if he thinks you have liposarcoma., Most lipomas are surgically removed or extracted. Scarring and bruising are possible side effects. Recurrences are not common.Liposuction is another treatment method. A needle and large syringe is used to remove the fatty tissue.Lipomas can be shrunken with steroid injections. This does not eliminate the lipoma, but it does reduce the lipoma before surgery."

Look for a swollen bulge of flesh in the groin area.,
Seek a medical assessment if you suspect a possible inguinal hernia.,
See if the bulge goes away or remains in place at all times.,
Recognize the signs that emergency medical attention is required.",How to Diagnose a Child's Hernia1," The telltale sign of any hernia is a bump, bulge, or bubble that protrudes from the body. Inguinal hernias in children usually occur in the crease in between the lower abdomen and the inner thigh, and the bulge may (but doesn’t always) continue into the genital area.Some inguinal hernias “stick out” at all times, while others are not noticeable at all times. Hernias that are reducible on their own will usually appear only when the child is coughing, laughing, crying, or doing something else that strains the abdominal region. They are often also more noticeable when the child is standing.;
, Some three-quarters of hernias diagnosed among the entire population occur in the groin area (and are known as inguinal hernias). This is a particularly common spot for hernias among small girls and especially boys, because an improperly closed inguinal canal (through which a male's testicles descend just before birth) can provide an easy path for the intestines to push through.Checking for inguinal and other kinds of hernias should be part of all regular pediatric infant and child physical exams.
Practically speaking, every inguinal hernia will (or at least should) result in a surgical intervention. Even if the hernia resolves on its own, it will almost certainly recur over and again if the opening in the inguinal canal is not closed.
Any inguinal hernia should be examined by a doctor or qualified Certified Pediatric Nurse Practitioner (CPNP). If the hernia does not pull back in on its own or is not “reducible” (able to be pushed back in) by the physician, immediate surgery is the most likely recourse. Otherwise, a simple surgical procedure done within a short period of time is usually advisable.

, Reducible hernias that come and go on their own are not immediately harmful in most cases, but should still be examined by a doctor within a short period of time. “Incarcerated” hernias, on the other hand, which are trapped in place and protrude continually, should be examined at once.Incarcerated hernias are not immediately harmful, but they can quickly become “strangulated” hernias, which are and must be surgically repaired as soon as possible.

, As indicated by the name, a strangulated hernia cuts off blood flow to the protruding part of the intestine (or other organ). This can cause irreparable damage to the organ within a short period of time, and can also result in a cascade of other severe consequences.If your child has a protruding hernia along with substantial pain in the general area; vomiting or nausea; noticeable irritability; fever; or if the bulge hardens or becomes red or discolored, assume it is strangulated and take the child to the nearest emergency room or call 911 or your emergency services number immediately. Do not wait. Act at once. Be safe, not sorry.

Consider your health status.,
Consider other options first.,
Know what is involved in liposuction surgery.,
Consider post-surgery needs.,
Be sure this is the way you really want to go.",How to Decide if Liposuction Is Right for You," Are there realistic, good reasons why liposuction will improve your health, both physical and mental? Also consider your age and fitness levels. Menopause is often a time of unwanted weight gains due to hormonal changes, and post-pregnancy can be a time for weight gains, but if you're not exercising or taking care of your nutrition needs then you should look at these solutions before surgery.;
, While being obese is unhealthy, having surgery comes with its own raft of risks. It is really important to gauge the entire range of alternative options as well as the advantages and disadvantages of liposuction with your health professional. It is also important to be able to honestly say that exercise and diet are not helping you in the way that you would really like before resorting to liposuction.

, Liposuction is usually a very quick procedure that uses minimum incision in the fatty areas and suctions out the fat very easily without much scarring and blood loss. Liposuction in women are mostly carried in abdomen, hips, buttocks, inner and outer thighs, and double chin. The surgery is performed for about 1- 2 hours with general anaesthetic or local anaesthetic often taken as a day case.

, Often the post-surgery aspect is challenging for many people. It is very important to wear a compression garment for about 3- 4 weeks minimum in order to avoid swelling in the operated parts. After the surgery, a person can very soon get back to normal activities after 1-2 weeks of recuperation., It will cost money, time and it will cause pain. Are you that unhappy with yourself and that unsure that you cannot improve your health through safer, less expensive means? Are you certain that taking this ""shortcut"" will be of long-lasting benefits for you?

Recognize symptoms of labyrinthitis.,
Avoid activity that can complicate or worsen the condition.,
Take an over-the-counter (OTC) antihistamine.,
Take an OTC medication to treat dizziness.,
Manage vertigo.,
Do exercises to reduce vertigo.,
Take necessary precautions as you get better.",How to Cure Labyrinthitis1," The inner parts of your ear are crucial for both your sense of hearing and balance. Swelling due to the condition can lead to an impairment of both, which then has other cascading effects. The most common effect by which to recognize labyrinthitis include:Vertigo (a spinning feeling when standing still)
Difficulty focusing due to your eyes moving on their own
Dizziness
Hearing loss
Imbalance
Nausea and vomiting
Tinnitus (ringing or other noises in your ears);
, Recent viral illnesses (colds and flus), as well as respiratory and ear infections, significantly increase your risk for labyrinthitis.However, a number of more controllable activities can raise your risk for the condition or worsen the condition once you have it. These activities include:Overconsumption of alcohol
Fatigue
Severe allergies
Smoking
Stress
Certain medications (such as aspirin)

, OTC antihistamines are used to treat allergies, and they can help reduce the congestion from a recent infection, which may be what’s causing the swelling leading to the labyrinthitis.Common antihistamines include diphenhydramine (Benadryl), cetirizine (Zyrtec), loratadine (Claritin), desloratadine (Clarinex), and fexofenadine (Allegra).Many antihistamines can cause drowsiness, so read the effects on the packaging closely, and always stay within the recommended dosages., Since labyrinthitis is most often caused by a viral infection, you must often wait for your immune system to do its job and beat the virus. During this time you can help reduce any associated dizziness with an OTC medication.The most common OTC medicine for dizziness is meclizine (Bonine, Dramamine, or Antivert)., The effects of labyrinthitis usually come as attacks rather than a continuous set of symptoms. When you have an attack of vertigo due to the condition, you can take several steps to help reduce the effects. You should:Rest as best as you can and try to stay still without moving your head
Avoid changing positions or making sudden movements
Resume activities slowly
Get help walking so you don’t injure yourself in a fall
Avoid bright lights, television (and other electronic screens), and reading during attacks

, There are some exercises that can help you to reduce the feeling of vertigo. The most effective exercise is called the Epley maneuver.This maneuver can help to reposition the small particles in the canals of your inner ear called otoliths. These particles, when knocked out of place, can induce vertigo. To perform the maneuver:Sit in the middle of your bed at the edge with your head turned 45° toward the direction that induces the vertigo.
Quickly lay down backward with your head still toward the direction that produces the vertigo. This will likely lead to a strong vertiginous response. Stay in this position for thirty seconds.
Turn your head 90° to the opposite direction and hold for another thirty seconds.
Rotate both your head and your body in the same direction (you will now be on your side with your head over the edge of the bed pointed 45° toward the ground). Hold for another thirty seconds before sitting back up.
Repeat this five or six times until you no longer experience a response of vertigo to the maneuver.

, While the most severe symptoms of labyrinthitis usually last about a week, you can still have milder symptoms for three weeks (on average).Sudden dizzy spells while driving, climbing, or operating heavy machinery can all prove dangerous as you recover.Take the necessary precautions and consider consulting a physician regarding when it is safe for you to resume these activities.

Watch for a bulging belly button.,
Take a wait-and-see approach, but only with your doctor’s approval.,
Decide if surgery is advisable and know when it is necessary.",How to Diagnose a Child's Hernia2," Umbilical hernias occur in the opening in the muscle tissue through which the umbilical cord passed before birth. As such, the telltale bulging of this type of hernia will appear right at or very near to the belly button.Most umbilical hernias are inherently reducible; that is, they appear and retract on their own. They appear most often when the child is crying, and may also appear when strain is placed on the abdominal muscles (coughing, hearty laughing, etc.).
So, if you spot a potential umbilical hernia and then it goes away, do not immediately assume it is gone for good. Keep checking occasionally, especially as the child has a crying fit, for instance.

, Umbilical hernias occur almost exclusively in babies and small children, and usually resolve on their own before an affected child reaches school age (if not by age two). They rarely cause significant health problems, but you should always notify your child’s physician if you suspect the condition. As is always the case with the health of small children, safe is better than sorry.It is possible that the doctor will simply tell you to keep an eye on the umbilical hernia and report any changes or new symptoms. You do not need to rush your child to the emergency room if you suspect an umbilical hernia, unless there are significant additional symptoms (vomiting, severe pain, redness or hardness, fever, etc.) that indicate a major problem and you should seek a qualified pediatric emergency room as soon as possible.
In manly cultures, parents by tradition will try and reduce the umbilical hernia affixing old coins secured with adhesive to the belly button. Unfortunately, this practice increases the risk of infection of the umbilicus with common germs or worse with dangerous germs such as botulism and should be avoided.

, Most umbilical hernias will go away for good on their own within the first few years of life and will not cause any health problems along the way. If the hernia is causing discomfort or embarrassment as the child gets a bit older, a simple elective surgical procedure may be warranted. Even then, however, surgery is usually not a necessity.If the hernia recurs beyond the age of four or five, is larger than two inches in diameter or grows in size, or causes pain, it should probably be dealt with surgically.
In the rare instance that an umbilical hernia presents along with other symptoms associated with potentially dangerous hernias — such as ongoing nausea or vomiting, significant pain, or redness, discoloration, or swelling — seek medical attention right away.

Identify hernia risk factors for children.,
Focus on the most common hernia types in kids.,
Know when to call the doctor and when to go to the emergency room.,
Gain additional insights into hernias.",How to Diagnose a Child's Hernia3," Any child can develop a hernia, but certain genetic and environmental factors can make the likelihood much greater for some kids. If you know that your child is at a higher risk for developing hernias, you can and should be more vigilant in watching for them and dealing with them if they appear.


Common risk factors for childhood hernias include: family history (increases likelihood by 10%); premature birth (increases likelihood by 30%); male gender (hernias are significantly more common in males of any age); cystic fibrosis or similar conditions; chronic cough; chronic constipation; excess body weight; and prior hernias.Umbilical hernias are more common in children with African ancestry., Many different kinds of hernias can occur, primarily in the greater abdominal region between the chest and the hips. As identified elsewhere in this article, however, inguinal (groin area) and umbilical (belly button) hernias are far and away the most common types in children.For instance, it is possible for a child to have a hiatal hernia (in which the stomach pushes through the diaphragm and into the chest) due to a birth defect, but this type of hernia usually happens in adults over the age of 50. See How to Know if You Have a Hernia for more examples of hernia types.

, Anytime you suspect a child has a hernia, you should inform his or her physician. The doctor will advise you to keep an eye on the hernia, bring the child in for an exam, or, in rare instances, seek immediate medical attention.Go to the nearest emergency room immediately if you suspect a strangulated hernia, in which blood flow is being cut off to a part of the protruding organ. Watch for significant pain, nausea or vomiting, or redness, discoloration, fever, or continued swelling.
Umbilical hernias often disappear without recurring on their own; inguinal hernias may disappear but will almost always recur without eventual surgical intervention. Either way, play it safe and contact your doctor.
Other serious hernias include: diaphragmatic hernias, a rare birth defect in which organs in the abdomen push through an abnormal opening in the diaphragm and enter the chest cavity;brain herniation, when brain tissue moves to an abnormal position within the skull, usually caused by a head injury, tumor, or other trauma that causes brain swelling; gastroschisis or omphalocele, a birth defect in which the baby's intestines are outside of his body when he is born., Especially if your child is at an elevated risk for developing hernias, talk to the pediatrician about signs and symptoms to watch out for and procedures to follow. Early detection of any type of hernia can usually prevent lasting negative health consequences.


Consult this detailed wikiHow article on hernias for a wide range of information regarding the identification and treatment of various types of hernias.

Learn when to seek immediate medical attention.,
Make an appointment with your doctor.,
Submit to any tests your doctor wants to order.,
Take any medications prescribed to treat the labyrinthitis.,
Ask about medications to help alleviate symptoms.,
Ask your doctor about vestibular rehabilitation therapy (VRT) for chronic conditions.,
Undergo surgery as a last resort.",How to Cure Labyrinthitis2," In most cases of viral labyrinthitis, your immune system will clear the infection on its own. However, less frequent instances of bacterial labyrinthitis can lead to much more serious (and potentially life-threatening) conditions such as meningitis.You should seek immediate medical attention if your symptoms also include:Convulsions
Double vision
Fainting
Severe vomiting
Slurred speech
Vertigo with a fever of 101°F (38.3°C) or higher
Weakness or paralysis

, Even without emergency-related symptoms, you should still see your doctor if you’re suffering from labyrinthitis.Your doctor will help diagnose whether the etiology (cause) of the condition is viral or bacterial.Your doctor can then take the proper steps to possibly shorten the duration of the condition, alleviate symptoms, and reduce the risk of any permanent hearing loss.


There are other causes of vertigo that are not from labyrinthitis, so its important for a doctor to evaluate

, If the presentation of your case makes your doctor suspect something other than labyrinthitis, he or she may order tests to rule out other conditions. Your doctor may ask you to submit to:An electroencephalogram (EEG)
An electronystagmography, which tests eye reflexes by warming and cooling your inner ear
A computed tomography (CT) scan, which creates a three-dimensional x-ray of your head
An MRI
Hearing tests

, Your physician may prescribe antiviral agents for severe forms of viral labyrinthitis or antibiotics if the underlying cause is a bacterial infection.Regardless of the type of prescription, take exactly as directed for the full course of the medication.

, In addition to any medications your doctor might prescribe to treat the cause of the labyrinthitis, he or she may also recommend prescription-strength medications to help you deal with the vertigo, dizziness, and other symptoms while you recover. Tell your doctor about any antihistamines, Dramamine, or any other OTC medicines you were taking before your consultation, and only follow the exact medication regimen that your doctor prescribes. Some common drugs prescribed for this purpose include:Prochlorperazine (Compazine) to control nausea and vomiting
Scopolamine (Transderm-Scop) to help with dizziness
Sedatives such as diazepam (Valium)
Steroids (prednisone, methylprednisolone, or decadron)

, If your symptoms do not subside with the use of medication and become chronic, then you should ask your doctor about VRT. VRT is a physical therapy that can help you adapt to and correct for the symptoms of labyrinthitis. Some of the strategies most commonly used in this therapy include:Gaze-stabilization exercises: These exercises help your brain adapt to the new signaling from your affected vestibular system (the system that helps you with orientation). A common exercise includes fixing your gaze on a specific target while moving your head.
Canal-retraining exercises: Chronic symptoms of labyrinthitis can lead to changes related to nerve signaling for balance and walking. These exercises improve coordination by helping you adapt to the affected sensory information you receive from your eyes and vestibular system.
Expect to see a physical therapist once or twice a week for four to six weeks for your VRT sessions.

, In very rare cases, your doctor may determine that an aggressive surgical option is necessary to stop advanced labyrinthitis complications from turning into potentially fatal meningitis or encephalitis. This may include a labyrinthectomy (removal of the infected portion of the inner ear) to help stop the spread of the infection."

Talk to your doctor.,
Determine the cause of the pain.,
Decide on a medication.,
Follow medical dosage instructions.,
Work with your pain management team.,
Get physical therapy.",How to Deal with Chronic Pain1," Start with your primary care doctor who can initiate an evaluation with blood work, imaging, and a trial of some medications and refer you to the right specialist. Let your physician know if you have a history of addiction, as you may be at higher risk for addiction to painkillers.If your pain is due to the aftereffects of cancer treatments, talk to your oncologist. Pain specialists and oncologists have the most experience dealing with the many complex issues surrounding the treatment of pain.;
, The first step in the medical management of pain is to determine the cause of the pain. The pain may be from disorders such as arthritis, fibromyalgia, cancer, and more. It might take additional studies, evaluation, and time to find the source. Once the underlying cause is determined, then treatment can be discussed.You may need to see a number of different doctors, including a rheumatologist, orthopedic, neurologist, and/or physical medicine and rehabilitation specialist.

, After you determine the cause of your pain, you and your doctor can discuss the use of medication. In general, acetaminophen (Tylenol) or NSAIDs (Aleve, Advil, aspirin) are used first. The idea is to start first with medications with the fewest side effects.For all these pain medications, it is very important to follow the instructions exactly as written. If the instructions are not clear, make sure you ask your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist to explain them until you are very clear on when and how to take the medication. Report any side effects or problems with the medications right away.


Under some circumstances, tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline may be used to control pain.
A third class of drugs that may be used are the Serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) such as duloxetine (Cymbalta).
Corticosteroids are primarily used for inflammatory rheumatology and autoimmune disorders. Sometimes a short course is ordered to treat acute pain as well.
Anticonvulsants such as gabapentin (Neurontin) or pregabalin (Lyrica) have been shown to be useful for some types of nerve pain, including fibromyalgia and neuropathies.
Opiates are generally reserved for pain that doesn’t respond to other pain medications. They should be used only for a short period of time and/or after you and your doctor develop careful treatment plan, as opiates are highly addictive.

, It is very important to be aware of and stick to the dosage recommended by your physician to minimize the chances of developing a problematic tolerance to the pain medication. Tolerance is defined as “a phenomenon or adaptation of the body over a period of time in which one or more effects of a drug become less with repeated use at the same dose.” This is often referred to as becoming “immune” to the action of the drug.It is important to understand that tolerance is not addiction. Tolerance is the body’s adaptation to the drug. The problem with tolerance is that more and more drugs are needed to achieve the same effect, and increasing doses also means there is an increased risk of dangerous or unacceptable side effects and the chance of an accidental overdose. Following the dosage schedule can slow down the tolerance process.

, More and more pain management programs are interdisciplinary and utilize many different professionals with a wide diversity of skill sets that can help you deal with chronic pain in the healthiest way possible, improving your quality of life as much as possible.This team first includes you. The pain management team can also include a physician and nurses, in addition to physical, massage, occupational, recreational, and psychological therapists. There may also be social workers, nutritionists and other support staff.
The important thing for you to remember is to access the team and make use of the services they have to offer you.

, You should consider including a physical therapist as part of your pain management team. A physical therapist can help you manage pain by giving you bodily treatments catered towards relieving your pain. These exercises include strengthening exercises, flexibility exercises, manual therapy, posture help, and body mechanics instruction."

Exercise more often.,
Consume more omega-3 fatty acids.,
Make sure you're not vitamin D deficient.,
Consider taking plant-based medicine.,
Try acupuncture treatments.,
Consult with a mental health professional.,
Ask your doctor about SSRIs.,
Consider SNRIs as an alternative.,
Be cautious with benzodiazepines and tricyclic antidepressants.",How to Deal When You Have a Chemical Imbalance," When you have anxiety or depression, exercise may not be high on your priority list, but research shows that it can make a big impact on mood by stimulating and/or balancing numerous chemicals and neurotransmitters in the body.Regular exercise is theorized to help ease depression and anxiety in a number of ways, such as: releasing feel-good brain chemicals (neurotransmitters, endorphins and endocannabinoids); reducing immune system chemicals that are linked to worsening depression; and increasing body temperature, which seems to have general calming effects.


Research published in 2005 found that walking briskly for about 35 minutes daily five times per week or 60 minutes daily three times per week had a significant impact on mild-to-moderate depression.Other types of cardiovascular exercise that may provide similar benefits include swimming, cycling, jogging and dancing.;
, Omega-3 fatty acids are considered essential fats, which means your body (particularly your brain) needs them to function normally, but the body can't make them.As such, you must get them from food or supplements. Omega-3 fats are highly concentrated in the brain and appear to be important for cognition (brain memory and performance) and behavior. A variety of studies have shown that supplementing with omega-3 fatty acids (between 1,000 and 2,000 mg daily) can help relieve symptoms of depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and attention deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD).Omega-3 fatty acids are found in fatty fish (salmon, mackerel, tuna, halibut), other seafoods, including shrimp, algae and krill, as well as some nuts and seeds (walnuts, flaxseed).
If supplementing, consider taking fish oil, krill oil and/or flaxseed oil.
Symptoms of omega-3 fatty acid deficiency include poor memory, mood swings and depression, among others.
In one study, it was shown that 10 grams of fish oil daily helped bipolar patients treat their symptoms., Vitamin D is necessary for a variety of body functions including calcium absorption, healthy immune response and normal mood fluctuations. In fact, vitamin D is much more hormone-like in its actions than any other vitamin and a lack of it has been linked to depression as well as other mental disorders.Unfortunately, many people (including most Americans) are deficient in vitamin D, which may be responsible for some of the nearly 15 million cases of depression among adults in the United States.Vitamin D is made by your skin in response to intense summer sunshine and found in some foods.


Avoidance of the sun may help explain why such a growing number of people are vitamin D deficient. Ask your doctor for a blood test to see if you're deficient.
Vitamin D is stored in the body, so getting enough summer sunshine can last you throughout the winter months.
If supplementing, use the D3 form of the vitamin and aim for between 1,000 to 4,000 IU per day (up to 40,000 IU daily has been shown to be safe).
Foods that contain vitamin D include the flesh of fatty fish (salmon, tuna, mackerel), fish liver oils, beef liver and egg yolks.
Keep in mind that vitamin D is fat-soluble, meaning excess amounts will be stored in your body (unlike water-soluble vitamins, which would just pass through in your urine), making it possible to overdose. The Institute of Medicine has defined a tolerable upper limit intake level to be 100 mcg or 4,000 IU a day in healthy adults.

, If you are feeling depressed or anxious and realize that your thoughts and behaviors are not healthy, then consider plant-based therapy to help balance your brain chemistry. It turns out that more than 1/2 of Americans with panic attacks or severe depression use some form of herbal therapy to combat it.Valerian root, passionflower, kava kava, ashwagandha root, St. John's wort, L-theanine, 5-HTP, ginseng and even chamomile are used as natural sedatives or antidepressants because of their ability to impact the brain and reduce stress and anxiety.


Valerian root contains phytochemicals that interact with a brain chemical called GABA, which is involved with regulating anxiety, depression and related moods (drugs such as Valium and Xanax work in similar fashion) — best thought of as a sedative and sleep aid.
St. John's wort reduces symptoms in people w/ mild-to-moderate, but not severe depression. Some research it works as well as antidepressant drugs Prozac and Zoloft.
L-theanine (found in green tea and some other plants) increases GABA and dopamine levels in the brain and causes psychoactive changes, including reducing anxiety, improving cognition and balancing mood.
5-Hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) is an amino acid that's converted in the brain to serotonin (brain's feel good chemical).

, Acupuncture involves sticking very thin needles into specific energy points within the skin/muscle in efforts to reduce pain, combat inflammation, stimulate healing and balance the body's processes. .Recent research suggests that acupuncture may be as effective for depression and other mood-related problems as antidepressant drugs, but without any of the side effects.Based on the principles of traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture works by releasing a variety of substances including endorphins and serotonin, which act to reduce pain and improve mood.


It's also claimed that acupuncture stimulates the flow of energy, referred to as chi, which may also be involved in balancing brain chemistry.
Acupuncture points that may provide relief for your chemical imbalance are spread throughout the body, including the head, hands and feet.
Acupuncture is practiced by a variety of healthcare professionals including some physicians, chiropractors, naturopaths and psychologists — whoever you choose should be certified by NCCAOM.

, If stress, anxiety and/or depression is negatively impacting your life, then talk with a mental health professional. A psychiatrist, psychologist or counselor can give you insights on your issue and attempt to address the underlying cause of your imbalance. Mental health professionals sometimes use drugless techniques and therapies, such as psychotherapy and cognitive-behavioral therapy.Whether psychotherapy or cognitive-behavioral therapy can balance brain chemicals is unclear, but both therapies have a track record of success dealing with depression and anxiety — although it often takes many weeks or months.


Psychotherapy is a type of counseling that addresses the emotional response to mental illnesses. Patients are encouraged to talk through strategies for understanding and dealing with their disorder.
Cognitive-behavioral therapy involves patients learning to recognize and change their thought patterns and behaviors that lead to troublesome feelings.
Unfortunately, there are no blood tests that can directly measure neurotransmitter levels in the brain; however, an imbalance of hormones (such as insulin or thyroid hormone) can be detected by blood tests and may be related to altered mood. Other measurable components in the blood that have been linked to depression include very high levels of copper, too much lead and low levels of folate., The neurotransmitters serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine are closely tied to depression and anxiety, so most antidepressant drugs are designed to affect these chemicals. For depression, doctors typically start by prescribing a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) because these drugs are relatively safer and cause fewer serious side effects than other types of antidepressants.SSRIs relieve symptoms by blocking the reabsorption (reuptake) of serotonin by certain nerve cells in the brain, which leaves more serotonin available to improve mood.SSRIs include fluoxetine (Prozac, Selfemra), paroxetine (Paxil, Pexeva), sertraline (Zoloft), citalopram (Celexa) and escitalopram (Lexapro).
SSRIs are considered relatively effective for treating all anxiety disorders, including depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
Common side effects of SSRIs include insomnia (inability to get to sleep), sexual dysfunction and weight gain.
Although SSRIs are often given to patients with an assumed chemical imbalance of serotonin, their use sometimes triggers ""serotonin syndrome"" — dangerously high levels of serotonin.
Symptoms of Serotonin Syndrome include flushing of the skin, elevated heart rate, elevated temperature, elevated blood pressure, vomiting, and diarrhea. If you are having these symptoms and are on an SSRI then consult you doctor immediately.
If you are having problems with side effects from SSRIs talk to your family doctor or psychiatrist. There are different profiles for each medication and each have different advantages and disadvantages. You doctor will know best which medication to prescribe.

, Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are similar to SSRIs, but they have a dual mechanism of action: they increase the levels of both serotonin and norepinephrine by inhibiting their reabsorption into neurons in the brain.SNRI drugs are considered as effective as SSRIs, so they are also considered a first-line treatment that's commonly prescribed by doctors, especially for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder.


SNRIs include duloxetine (Cymbalta), venlafaxine (Effexor XR), desvenlafaxine (Pristiq, Khedezla) and levomilnacipran (Fetzima).
Common side effects of SNRIs include insomnia, stomach upset, excessive sweating, headaches, sexual dysfunction and hypertension (high blood pressure).
Some SNRIs like Cymbalta are approved to treat depression in those with chronic pain disorders. A drug like Effexor hand might be used in people with generalized anxiety disorder as well as depression.
Taking SNRIs can also trigger an imbalance of serotonin levels in the brain referred to as serotonin syndrome., Benzodiazepines are an older class of drugs still used for short-term management of anxiety. They can be highly effective in promoting relaxation, reducing muscle tension and other physical symptoms associated with anxiety by enhancing the effect of the neurotransmitter GABA.Benzodiazepines are not appropriate for long-term use, however, as there can be serious side effects, such as aggression, cognitive impairment, addiction, and deeper depression. As such, concerns about long-term use of benzodiazepines led many psychiatrists and physicians to favor tricyclic antidepressants before SSRIs and SNRIs came on the market. Tricyclics are relatively effective for treating anxiety because they increase serotonin levels in the brain, but they are also problematic long term. Consequently, tricyclic antidepressants aren't usually prescribed unless you've been on a SSRI and it hasn't worked for you.Benzodiazepines include alprazolam (Xanax, Niravam), clonazepam (Klonopin), diazepam (Valium, Diastat) and lorazepam (Ativan).
Tricyclic antidepressants include imipramine (Tofranil), nortriptyline (Pamelor), amitriptyline, doxepin, trimipramine (Surmontil), desipramine (Norpramin) and protriptyline (Vivactil).Tricyclic antidepressants have the potential to be cardio-toxic and have to be used in caution in people with heart disease."

Stay social.,
Seek out support groups.,
Exercise.,
Distract yourself with activities.",How to Deal with Chronic Pain2," Try to stay as active and as socially engaged as you can. When you are dealing with chronic pain, sometimes having people around you can be the very last thing you want; however, having people around can also distract you from the pain and allow you a few moments, or maybe more, to forget the pain. Humans are social creatures and while you may not always want to have people around, and don’t need to 24/7, it has been shown that social contact can have significant effects on pain perception.Socializing can help alleviate loneliness and depression, which can negatively affect chronic pain.

, As social creatures, finding others who truly understand what you are dealing with can be a significant comfort. Support groups also help you not to feel so alone. The people in the group may be able to offer advice and coping techniques.To find a support group for people dealing with chronic pain, start by looking at the groups at the American Chronic Pain Association or the National Fibromyalgia and Chronic Pain Association.

, Exercise has been shown to increase the production of endorphins, which naturally reduce pain. Exercise also strengthens muscles along with reducing the risk of obesity, heart disease, and diabetes.Try low-impact activities, such as yoga, Tai Chi, walking, swimming, cycling, or strength-training.You will need to talk to your physical therapist and other members of your pain management team to determine whether stretching exercises, strengthening exercises, aerobics, or weight training is best for you.
Make sure to find the right level of activity for you. If you do too much, you may have increased pain the next day; however, staying inactive for too long can lead to further problems with pain and mobility. Find the right exercise and amount of activity for your condition., Staying busy and engaging your mind and body in activities that distract you from the pain can be an effective management strategy. Try reading or listening to music.These activities may not be able to let you forget the pain, but it can help you take control of your life.Consider finding a hobby that lets you get out of the house and connect with other people."

Try deep breathing exercises.,
Do progressive muscle relaxation.,
Use positive visualization.,
Say positive affirmations.",How to Deal with Chronic Pain3," Deep breathing is one relaxation technique that can help reduce stress.Learning to relax may help decrease pain.Lie flat on your back. Use pillows under your knees and neck to make sure you are comfortable. Put your hands palm-down on your stomach, right below the rib cage. Place the fingers of your hands together so you can feel them separate and know you are doing the exercise correctly. Take a long, slow, deep breath through your nose by expanding your belly. This ensures that you are using your diaphragm to breathe rather than your rib cage. Your fingers should separate as they lie on your belly. Exhale through your mouth. Do this as often as you can.Use a variation of a Chinese Qigong breathing exercise. Sit down comfortably. The lungs' natural rhythm will take over immediately. Take three short inhalations through the nose. On the first intake, lift your arms, reaching in front, keeping the arms at shoulder levels. On the second intake, move your arms to the side, keeping the arms at shoulder levels. On the third intake, lift your arms over your head. Repeat 10 to 12 times.
If either exercise causes any dizziness, stop. Do these exercises as often as you need.

, Another way to decrease stress and cope with pain is through progressive muscle relaxation.Start with your toes. Tighten them by curling them under your feet. Hold for five to 10 seconds. Then slowly relax the toes.


Move on to the feet next. Tighten all the muscles in your feet and hold for five to 10 seconds. Then slowly relax the feet.
Move up through your legs, thighs, abdomen, arms, neck, and face, tightening the muscles in each area. Relax slowly every time.

, Positive visualization can be a form of meditation. Positive visualization and meditation can help relieve stress, which can help ease discomfort and lessen pain.Pick a favorite spot and get comfortable. Remember a favorite place. Close your eyes and picture that place. Keep the image in your mind.
Breathe deeply as you keep the picture in your mind. Don’t worry if you lose the image. Just take a breath and start again.
Until you have some practice, you may need to start again a few times.
Try and make sure you do this during a time that you are least likely to get interrupted.
Look into doing guided imagery through YouTube videos or apps.

, Using positive affirmations may be effective in helping change your mentality about the pain and lift your mood.Publically say positive things about yourself and your pain. Positive self-talk can help boost your mental perception of the pain. Some people write down their positive affirmations on sticky notes and post these notes everywhere they can. Use the present tense and repeat as often as you can. Examples of positive affirmations are:


Yes, I can.
I can get through the pain.I am getting better.
I feel better every day.
I can control my pain.

Try chiropractic care.,
Consider acupuncture.,
Get a massage.,
Try biofeedback.,
Try an anti-inflammatory diet.,
See if medical marijuana is available.",How to Deal with Chronic Pain4," Chiropractors work with the alignment of your musculoskeletal structure to encourage healing and pain relief. Chiropractic care generally is an alternative treatment for pain in your muscles, joints, bones, cartilage, ligaments, and tendons.Chiropractic care is used most often for back, leg and neck pain., Another common alternative therapy for chronic pain management is acupuncture. Acupuncture can be very beneficial for arthritic pain, migraines and other forms of chronic pain.Before getting acupuncture, take the time to learn about acupuncture, where to find a reputable, experienced practitioner, and think about whether it is a treatment for you.Talk to your pain management team to get recommendations for either an acupuncturist or a chiropractor.

, Getting a massage will not only help relieve tension, but also help relieve stress. These two things can lead to increased pain. Massages are good for all pain, especially back and neck.Find a massage therapist who specializes in chronic pain.
For patients with fibromyalgia, normal massage can be very painful so make sure to let the therapist know and to ask for light, gentle techniques.

, Other alternative treatments can include biofeedback techniques and other newer medical devices, including neurostimulators and drug pumps. You can talk to your physician about which might be right for you.


When using biofeedback, you wear sensors on your body that lets you track body functions. As you study the beeps or lines the sensors report to you, you can learn to control certain bodily functions and impulses.There are also newer “wearable” devices and patches that can provide pain relief for a variety of conditions.There are headbands for migraine, patches for muscular pain, devices for joint pain and electrostimulators (often known as TENS devices).

, Research is showing that inflammation may play a part in chronic diseases.Though research is ongoing, it may be that diet can help — by avoiding certain foods, and including those with anti-inflammatory properties, you may be able to reduce your pain.

An anti-inflammatory diet is similar to the Mediterranean Diet. Emphasize lots of fruits and vegetables, snack on nuts, eat fish packed with omega 3's, and healthy fats (monounsaturated and polyunsaturated).Include these anti-inflammatory spices in your cooking: turmeric, ginger, cinnamon, garlic, cayenne, black pepper, and clove.Foods to avoid or minimize include sugar, saturated fats, trans fats, excessive omega 6 fatty acids, gluten, casein, refined carbohydrates, mono-sodium glutamate (MSG), aspartame, and alcohol., If medical marijuana is available to you, that is an approach that has proven very effective for many people. Studies are indicating that medical marijuana is a safe and effective approach to pain relief.Discuss this option with your pain management team and find out if it is legal where you live.

You can choose to drink something other than water. However, you'll be drinking a lot, so if you choose juice or milk, you may become very full.
Avoid carbonated beverages, as they can trigger hiccups.;
, Now hold it. Avoid breathing in or out for as long as you can. People are able to hold their breath for different amount of time. Aim for at least 10 seconds.


Count in your head or watch a clock with a second hand to pass the time.
Make sure you're not accidentally breathing in and out through your nose.

, Without breathing, start to pour the water into your mouth. You should be able to swallow about 10 gulps of water without breathing or hiccuping.


If you spill some water, it's okay. Simply keep drinking without breathing in or out.

, Once you’ve drank the entire cup of water, continue to hold your breath. When you can no longer hold your breath, you can exhale and again breathe normally.


It may take you several seconds to catch your breath. This is perfectly normal.

, Wait 30 seconds to see if another hiccup comes. If it doesn’t, you’ve cured your hiccups! If the cure didn’t work, you can repeat as necessary.

Exhale.,
Check to see if your hiccups are gone.",How to Cure Hiccups by Holding Your Breath2," Use a lunch-bag sized bag. Paper grocery bags will be too big. The bag should be clean, since you'll be breathing in and out of it.

, Breathe down into your belly, so that you fill up your lungs. Once you've taken the biggest breath possible, close your mouth.When you take a very deep breath, your stomach will likely expand. This is normal.
Make sure you don't accidentally breathe in or out through your mouth while you try to hold your breath.

, Place your mouth inside the paper bag. Hold the paper bag up to your face. Breathe all of the air into the paper bag, so that it blows up like a balloon.Don’t put the paper bag over your head.
Blowing into the paper bag may raise the levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) in your blood. This inhibits the spasms that cause hiccups.

, Breathe the air back in from the paper bag. Fill up your lungs with air. The bag will crumple and empty.


When you’ve breathed in as much as you can, hold your breath for a few seconds.

, Breathe the air back into the paper bag. The bag will blow up again. Try to fill the bag completely with air.

, Wait 30 seconds to see if another hiccup comes. If it doesn’t, you’ve cured your hiccups! If the cure didn’t work, you can repeat as necessary.

Even with your mouth closed, make sure you’re not breathing in and out through your nose.
Feel your stomach with your hands. You should feel it expand like a balloon as you breathe in.

, Count the number of seconds that you hold your breath for. Aim for holding your breath longer than is comfortable, but not so long that it’s unsafe. Most people should be able to hold their breath for at least 10 seconds.


If you can't hold your breath for 10 seconds, simply hold it as long as you can.
If your face changes color or you start to feel dizzy, let your breath go.

, Exhale all of the air out of your lungs. Resume breathing normally. Don’t attempt to continue holding your breath.


If you hold your breath too long and too frequently, you can make yourself lightheaded.
Make sure your breathing has returned to normal before you hold your breath again.

, While you wait, you can do any regular activities. Set a timer so that you don’t forget how long you’ve been waiting. Meanwhile, try to take your mind off the hiccups.


You can watch TV, go for a drive, or chat with a friend to help distract yourself from your hiccups.

, Take another deep breath, and go through the same process. By now, your hiccups may have gone away. However, you can still repeat the process if you think your hiccups may come back.If your hiccups won't go away after an hour, try another method.

Only certain types of mold are potentially hazardous to your health. These types produce ""mycotoxins,"" which have been linked to respiratory symptoms similar to hay fever.Common species of mold that grow in the home include Cladosporium, Alternaria, Epicoccum, Fusarium, Penicillium, and Aspergillus.Since mold is present everywhere, just seeing mold in your home is not necessarily cause for concern. Large mold damage in a home or other building usually produces a tale-tell smell, which is musky and damp.
Look for mold in areas of the building that have exposure to moisture and humidity, such as tiles in the bathroom, warm air humidifiers, or ceiling panels that might get wet from a leaky roof. Mold tends to grow best on materials that have a high cellulose (paper) content, like fiberboard, paper, and lint.While some people say that dangerous molds tend to be black or dark green in color, it is impossible to tell if a mold is dangerous or not by just looking at it. The Center for Disease Control recommends that all indoor mold damage be treated as potentially hazardous.Don't touch mold with your bare hands, and if you feel that you are becoming ill because of exposure to mold, you may need to take steps to get rid of the mold.;
, Only certain respiratory symptoms have been linked to indoor mold. Keep in mind that while mold may be causing your symptoms, these symptoms can also be caused by other problems with indoor air quality like dust, smoke, and animal dander, or by seasonal allergens like pollen and ragweed.Scientific studies have linked asthma-like symptoms like cough, wheeze, and upper respiratory tract infections to indoor exposure to mold. Early exposure to mold in children can also make children more susceptible to developing asthma.Severe reactions might include a fever and shortness of breath, but these types of reactions usually only occur when a very large amount of mold is present (such as among farm workers working with very moldy hay).There have been some reports of very rare effects like memory loss or pulmonary hemorrhage, but there have been no studies that have shown a link between these rare conditions and mold., Most molds are harmless, and even molds that produce toxins don’t typically bother otherwise healthy people with strong immune systems.However, some molds do cause respiratory symptoms, especially among people who are already vulnerable to respiratory infection:


Mold may be more dangerous to people with suppressed immune systems, cancer, or HIV.
People with other allergies, such as a sensitivity to dust or pollen, may also be more susceptible to mold allergies.If you have chronic respiratory disease, you may be susceptible to difficulty breathing.People who have suppressed immune systems, either from using certain medications or from specific medical conditions, may have a greater risk of infection from molds, as may people with lung disease., If you are having respiratory or other symptoms and feel that mold is the culprit, you can treat your symptoms for relief, but you will also need to eliminate the source of mold. Otherwise, treating your symptoms will most likely be ineffective, since more exposure to the mold will only bring back the symptoms.


See a doctor for en evaluation and tests to find out if mold is to blame for your illness.Your doctor can perform skin and blood tests to find out if you are suffering from some sort of infection caused by your exposure to mold.
You will need to have your home evaluated if you find out that you have an illness caused by mold. Call a professional to deal with extensive mold damage. Search your local area for experts who deal with water damage or environmental hazards. They can advise you on the best way to eliminate the mold in your home or other building.

, If you are experiencing any strange symptoms, you should always contact a doctor first before trying to treat it on your own. A doctor can help determine the cause of your symptoms, and provide medical support as you work to eliminate the cause and treat the symptoms.


A doctor will also be able to monitor your symptoms to see if they worsen and identify any potential underlying causes not associated with mold, such as the flu, hay fever, or other issues.

, The most common symptoms people report from exposure to mold are the same symptoms you might experience if you have bad seasonal allergies, since people can be allergic to the spores.If you think you might be allergic to mold, you should see an allergist if you can. Antihistamines can help relieve the symptoms of itching, sneezing, and runny noses, but they won't treat the underlying cause.You can get loratadine (Claritin or Alavert) or cetirizine (sold as Zyrtec) over the counter, or ask your doctor for a prescription if you need a higher strength. These come in kid-friendly chewable tablets, liquid, and pill form.You can also use antihistamines that come in a nasal spray, such as azelastine (Astepro) or olopatadine (Patanase). These are only available with a prescription., Nasal corticosteroids can be used to decrease the congestion in your nose and sinuses.


Be aware of the possibility of developing ""rebound symptoms"" (symptoms that return) when you stop using the medication. This sometimes occurs following heavy or repeated use of nasal corticosteroids.Remember that nasal corticosteroids do not treat the mold itself; rather, they simply work to alleviate symptoms commonly associated with mold toxicity.

, These work ""systemically"" (throughout your body) to attack any fungi (mold) that may be present.The downside to antifungal medications is that, in addition to killing off any fungi (or mold), they can also be damaging to human cells if taken over a long period of time. They can cause liver and kidney damage, so most doctors will want to monitor your use of antifungals and discontinue it after a short period of time.

, If you believe you have toxic mold in your home, do not try to rip it out or clean it yourself. A professional has the right equipment and knowledge to safely remove damaged areas of ceiling, wall, or tile without further exposing you to more spores from the mold.You can do an internet search with your city's name and the words ""mold removal"" or ""water damage repair"" to find professional repair workers in your area. Ask your friends and family for recommendations, or search for online reviews to find a reputable company.

, Generally, after you've called a professional, they will come to your residence or other location to inspect for mold.


They will provide an assessment of the damage and let you know if the mold requires removal or repair. Then, they will schedule a time to repair the mold damage. If the problem is very severe, be sure they schedule repairs soon. If they don't have any openings, you may want to find another company to do the actual repairs.
In the case that you have to wait for repairs, consider staying in a hotel or with a friend if you are concerned about more exposure to the mold. At the very least, close the doors to the affected area and avoid going in there until the mold is repaired.

, Professionals will bring in equipment to cut out the area of wall, ceiling, or tile that is affected.


Sometimes, this repair process can leave a big hole in your ceiling, wall, or floor, and you may need to either repair it yourself or call in another expert to fix this damage.

, If you have a real mold problem in your home, it is being fed by excess moisture. You may need to fix your air filtration system in your home, repair a leaky roof, or otherwise eliminate that source of humidity or water that is creating a mold problem.


These repairs may be expensive, and in some cases you can file for an insurance claim to pay for repairs to your home. You may also be able to take out a home improvement loan from your bank if you are unable to pay for the repairs outright.

Learn about goiters.,
Know the symptoms of a goiter.,
Prepare for your appointment.,
Visit your physician.",How to Cure Goiters1," To diagnose and then treat a goiter, you must first learn what a goiter is. A goiter is an abnormal, but usually benign, growth in the thyroid gland. This may be associated with normal, decreased, or increased thyroid production.


Goiters are usually painless, but they can cause coughs, breathing problems, difficulty swallowing, diaphragm paralysis, or superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome.
Treatment depends on the size of your goiter and symptoms, as well as the reasons the goiter developed.;
, To figure out if you may have a goiter, know the symptoms. If you're experiencing any of the following, you should make a visit to your primary care doctor for an official diagnosis:A visible swelling the base of your neck, which may be very obvious when you shave or put on makeup
A tight feeling in your throat
Coughing
Hoarseness
Difficulty swallowing
Difficulty breathing

, As goiters are somewhat nebulous medical conditions — they can be caused by a number of conditions and there are a variety of options for treatment —come in with a list of questions. Questions should include:What is causing this goiter?
Is it serious?
How should I treat its underlying causes?
Are there any alternative treatments I can try?
Can I use a watch and wait approach?
Will the goiter get bigger?
Will I have to take medication? If so, for how long?

, Your doctor will perform a variety of tests to diagnose a goiter. These tests depend on your medical history and what the doctor suspects is causing the goiter.


Your doctor may perform a hormone test to see the amounts of hormones produced by your thyroid and pituitary gland. If the levels are too low or too high, this is likely the cause of the goiter. Blood will be drawn and sent to a lab.An antibody test might be performed, as abnormal antibodies can cause goiters. This is done through blood tests.In ultrasonography, a device is held over your neck and sound waves from your neck and back form images on the computer screen. Abnormalities that cause goiters can be identified.
A thyroid scan might also be performed. A radioactive isotope is injected into the vein in your elbow and you then lie on the table. A camera produces images of your thyroid on a computer screen, providing information about what's causing the goiter.
A biopsy may be performed, usually used to rule out cancer, in which tissues is drawn from your thyroid for testing."
"
Use radioactive iodine to shrink the enlarged thyroid gland.,
Use medications.,
Consider surgery.",How to Cure Goiters2," In some cases, radioactive iodine can be used to treat an enlarged thyroid gland.


The iodine is taken orally and reaches the thyroid gland through your bloodstream, destroying thyroid cells. This treatment option is common in Europe, and its usage dates back to the 1990's.
The treatment is effective in that 90% of patients have a 50 – 60% reduction in goiter size and volume after 12 to 18 months.This treatment can result in an underactive thyroid gland, but such an issue is rare and usually shows up in the first two weeks after treatment. If you're concerned about the risk, talk this option over with your doctor beforehand., If you're diagnosed with hypothyroidism, that is an underactive thyroid, medications will be prescribed to treat the condition.


Thyroid hormone replacements, such as Synthroid and Levothroid, help with symptoms of hypothyroidism. This also slows the release of hormones from your pituitary gland, a compensatory response of your body, which may decrease goiter size.
If your goiter does not decrease with hormone replacements, you will still stay on the medication to treat other symptoms. However, your doctor might suggest aspirin or a corticosteroid cream.Thyroid replacement hormones are usually well tolerated in patients, but some side effects can occur. Side effects may include chest pain, increased heart rate, sweating, headaches, insomnia, diarrhea, nausea, and irregular menstrual cycles., The goiter can be removed surgically. A 3 to 4 inch (7.6 to 10 cm) cut will be made in the middle of your neck, on top of the thyroid gland, and all or part of the thyroid is removed. The surgery takes about four hours and most people go home the day of the surgery.If your goiter is large enough to cause compression of the neck and esophagus, resulting in difficulty breathing and nighttime choking episodes, surgery is usually recommended.
Although rare, a goiter can be caused by thyroid cancer. If malignancy is suspected, your doctor will likely want to remove the goiter surgically.
A less common reason for surgery is cosmetic concerns. Sometimes, a large goiter is simply a cosmetic concern and patients may opt for surgery in this case. However, if it's a cosmetic concern insurance may not cover the cost of the operation.
The same kind of hormone replacement therapy used for an underactive thyroid usually becomes necessary for life after the removal of the thyroid."
"
Watch and wait.,
Get more iodine.",How to Cure Goiters3," If your doctor finds your thyroid to be functioning normally, and your goiter isn't big enough to cause health problems, she might recommend simply watching and waiting. Medical intervention can cause side effects, and if there's no problem other than a small amount of irritation you should wait and see if the problem clears up with time. Down the road, if the goiter increases in size or begins to cause problems, you can make other decisions.

, Sometimes, goiters can be caused by problems in your diet. Iodine deficiencies have been linked to goiters, so getting more iodine in your diet can reduce their size.Everyone needs at least 150 micrograms of iodine a day.Shrimp and other shellfish are high in iodine, as are sea vegetables such as kelp, hiziki, and kombu.Organic yogurt and raw cheese are high in iodine. One cup of yogurt contains 90 micrograms, and an ounce of raw cheddar contains 10 to 15 micrograms.Cranberries are extremely high in iodine. There are 400 micrograms in 4 ounces of cranberries. Strawberries are another great berry choice. One cup has 13 micrograms.
Navy beans and potatoes also contain high amounts of iodine.Make sure you get iodized salt.

Stay inside when pollen counts are high.,
Use air conditioning.,
Consider a HEPA filter.,
Delegate tasks if possible.,
Use physical barriers as needed.,
Pick natural fibers.,
Don't touch your eyes and face in the garden.,
Take a shower immediately after engaging in outdoor activities.,
Wash your sheets.,
Pay attention to certain fruits.",How to Live With Allergies to Pollen1," Check pollen forecasts to find out when there's a high pollen count in your area. When the pollen count is high, it's best for you to avoid outdoor activities as much as possible. Stay inside to try to avoid exposure to pollen.Typically, pollen counts are at their highest for a few hours after both sunrise and sunset. Try to avoid being out for extended periods during these times.
Plan outside activities for cloudy, rainy days. It may seem counter-intuitive, since you want to enjoy the nice weather, but pollen counts are often reduced when it's cloudy and rainy. Also, pick days without wind, as wind can spread the pollen around.;
, Keeping your windows open in the spring is tempting, especially when the weather is in that perfect temperature range. However, when pollen counts are high, it's best to keep the outdoors outside. Close your windows, and turn on the air conditioning instead.It's also a good idea to keep your windows shut when traveling by car. Turn the air on recirculate to avoid introducing more pollen into the car.

, Even staying inside, you may find that some allergens seep in. A high-energy particulate air filter (HEPA) can help reduce allergens in your home, including pollen. Most of the time, you'll find these as standalone units. The bedroom is an ideal place to have a filter.Also, when vacuuming, make sure your vacuum has a HEPA filter, as well.

, If your allergies are triggered by outdoor pollens, it's best to avoid them. That means delegating tasks like lawn-mowing and weed-pulling when you can. If you live alone, consider hiring someone for these tasks., If you must do lawn work or be outside when pollen counts are high, try using physical barriers to help reduce your pollen intake. Sunglasses and a wide-brimmed hat can protect your eyes from pollen, though goggles work better if you are having a severe attack. You can also use an allergen mask to keep pollen at bay, which you can find at your local pharmacy., Synthetic fibers tend to attract pollen more than natural fibers, keeping the allergen on your body. Therefore, try choosing natural fibers like cotton, as you'll have less of a chance of attracting pollen. It can also help keep mold at bay, if you're allergic to mold, too., If you enjoy gardening, you still need to take steps to minimize your exposure to pollen. One way to help yourself is to make sure you don't touch your mouth or face while you're gardening, as that could spread pollen to your face., Showering will help remove pollen from your hair and body. Doing so helps keep your allergies in check. Also, wash all clothes you had on while you were outside,and avoid drying clothes outside.Pollen can become trapped on furniture and pillows, extending your exposure to it. Go straight to laundry room and then the shower as you come indoors. Also, don't forget to put your coat away in a separate closet when you get home.Washing your hands often can also help.
If you don't take a shower when you come in, try taking one before you go to bed.

, Pollen and other allergens can become trapped in your sheets and bedding. Be sure you wash your bedding at least once a week. Also, use hot, soapy water to help remove the allergens. Doing so can reduce your exposure to allergens at night., If you're allergic to pollen, you may react lightly to certain fruits and vegetables that have similar proteins. You could have any number reactions, from an itchy mouth to stomach problems and hives.

Try antihistamines.,
Use a nasal corticosteroid.,
Consider decongestants.,
Ask about inhalers.,
Have yourself tested for allergies.,
Utilize immunotherapy treatment.",How to Live With Allergies to Pollen2," Antihistamines are often the first line of defense for allergies. Fortunately, many antihistamines are readily available over-the-counter. You have your choice of several non-drowsy antihistamines.Some of your options include loratadine (Claritin), cetirizine (Zyrtec), and fexofenadine (Allegra).
It is important to closely follow the package instructions when taking medication.

, This type of nose spray is another common treatment for allergies, and they are also available over-the-counter. It is a type of steroid, but it doesn't have the systemic side effects of oral steroids. Be sure to follow package instructions when using a nasal corticosteroid. Most pharmacies carry these types of sprays.Two common types of these sprays are mometasone furoate (Nasonex) and fluticasone propionate (Flonase).Corticosteroids may be safe to use long-term, unlike some other types of nasal sprays. Talk to your doctor first.

, Decongestants can help un-stuff your nose. The main types of decongestants are pills, sprays, and drops; however, sprays and drops should only be used for a couple of days in a row. Otherwise, they may make symptoms worse.The most common oral decongestant is pseudoephedrine (Afrinol, Sudafed). Sprays include phenylephrine (Neo-Synephrine) and oxymetazoline (Afrin).Some oral medication combine both antihistamines and decongestants, so make sure you don't double-dose.

, Some people have asthma symptoms in relation to pollen allergies. See your doctor if you have symptoms such as shortness of breath, tightening in the chest, or wheezing, you may need a medication to deal with these symptoms specifically.Common types of asthma medications include inhaled steroids or bronchodilators, oral anti-leukotrienes or bronchodilators, and/or injected medications.

, If you haven't been tested for allergies, it's a good idea to find out what you're allergic to. You may already know you're allergic to pollen based on the fact that you have allergy symptoms when there's a high pollen count; however, if you don't realize that you also have other allergies, you may not be doing all you can to alleviate your symptoms.The most common type of allergy test is a skin test. Basically, the skin on your forearm or back is divided into small sections and marked. They will then drop a bit of each allergen in each section. Your skin will be pricked so that the allergen penetrates the top layer of skin better. After the test, you wait to see which patches of skin react, usually with a red, itchy patch.
Another common type of test is a blood test. A blood test is not quite as sensitive as a skin prick test, but it can help detect some of your major allergens.Before an allergy test, you must stop any antihistamine you're on five days ahead of time, as antihistamines may prevent you from reacting to allergens. You may also need to stop other medications, so talk to your doctor about what you're taking.

, If your allergy symptoms persist longer than three months of the year or if medication is not helping, you may want to discuss getting allergy shots with your doctor. Allergy shots can help dampen your immune response to specific allergens by injecting you with tiny amounts of the pollens you are allergic to. This is not a cure, but may help alleviate symptoms.


Based on your response to the allergy test, your doctor will determine what you are allergic to and have immunotherapy formulated specifically for you Then you will be given an allergy shot schedule. It is important to adhere to the schedule for best results.
Tablets that dissolve under your tongue are a new form of immunotherapy; however, some studies have shown that they don't work as well as shots and may only provide minor relief."

Consider acupuncture.",How to Live With Allergies to Pollen3," Saline can help both your eyes and your nose. Use saline drops in your eyes when you come inside to help rinse them out. Similarly, you can use saline nose spray to rinse out pollen from your nose., Rinsing your nasal passages with a saline solution using a squeeze bottle or Neti pot may help relieve nasal congestion by flushing out mucus and allergens. You can purchase a sterile saline solution at the drugstore or make your own at home using distilled or purified water (water that has been boiled for at least one minute, then allowed to cool)., Some people have luck with taking extracts of either spirulina, which is dried algae, or butterbur, which is a type of shrub; however, not everyone benefits from these treatments, and the safety of these extracts has not been established., Other people have had luck with acupuncture as treatment for allergies. In fact, some scientific evidence backs it up, but it will not work for everyone. Nonetheless, there's little risk with this treatment.

Treat the symptoms of tetanus.",How to Know when You Need a Tetanus Shot," Usually, the bacterial toxins enter the body through a break in the skin caused by an object contaminated with tetanus. If you have one or more of the following injuries or wounds that are prone to tetanus, you should get a tetanus booster shot. These include:


Any wound visibly contaminated with soil, dust, or horse manure.
Puncture wounds. Objects that can cause these types of wounds include wood splinters, nails, needles, glass, and human or animal bites.Skin burns. Second degree (partial-thickness or with blisters) and third degree (full-thickness) burns are at higher risk for infection than first degree (superficial) burns.Crush injuries that damage tissue by squeezing it between two heavy objects. They can also happen when heavy objects are dropped onto parts of the body.Wounds involving necrotic, or dead, tissue. This kind of tissue has no blood supply, increasing its risk for infection (along with severely compromised tissue). For example, areas of gangrene (dead body tissue) are at increased risk for infection.Wounds with foreign objects in them. Wounds that have foreign bodies, such as splinters, glass shards, gravel, or other objects in them are at higher risk for infection.;
, If you never received the first series of tetanus shots (primary vaccination series) or you're not sure when you had your last tetanus shot, you should go get a tetanus shot. If you've been injured, you may be wondering whether you need to get a tetanus booster shot. You will need a tetanus booster shot if:Your wound was caused by a “clean” object, but your last tetanus shot was over 10 years ago.
Your wound was caused by a “dirty” object and your last tetanus shot more than 5 years ago.
You're not sure if the wound was caused by a “clean” or “dirty” object and your last tetanus shot was over 5 years ago.

, In order to help transfer tetanus antibodies to your baby, you should get a tetanus vaccine when you are between 27-36 weeks pregnant.Your doctor will likely recommend the inactivated Tdap (Tetanus, Diptheria and Pertussis) vaccine during the third trimester of your pregnancy.If you have not had the Tdap vaccine before and don't have it during pregnancy, you should get vaccinated immediately after giving birth.If you get a dirty cut or wound while pregnant, you will likely need to get a tetanus booster shot.

, The best way to ""treat"" tetanus is to prevent it in the first place. Most people don't experience serious reactions to the vaccine, but there are a few common mild reactions. These include localized swelling, tenderness, and redness at the injection site, but these often clear up in 1-2 days.Don't worry about getting an extra tetanus booster. There's usually no problem if you don't wait the 10 years in between shots before getting the shot. There are several vaccines that protect against tetanus. They are:DTaP. The diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (whooping cough) vaccine (DTaP) are usually given to babies at ages 2, 4, and 6 months, and again at 15 to 18 months old. DTap is a very effective vaccine for small children. Kids will need another booster between ages 4 and 6.
Tdap. Over time, protection from tetanus decreases, so older children need to get a booster shot. It has a full dose of tetanus and lower amounts of diphtheria and pertussis. All people between the ages of 11 and 18 are advised to get the booster, preferably around 11 or 12 years old.
Td. If you're an adult, get a Td (tetanus and diphtheria) booster shot every 10 years to stay protected. Since some people may lose the protective antibody levels after 5 years, a booster vaccination is recommended if you get a deep, contaminated wound and haven't had a vaccination in more than 5 years., Nearly all cases of tetanus occur in people who have never gotten the tetanus vaccine, or adults who don’t stay up to date with their 10-year boosters.The disease is not spread from person to person though, which makes it very different from other vaccine-preventable diseases.Instead, it's spread by bacterial spores that usually enter the body through a puncture. These make a powerful neurotoxin that causes muscle spasms and stiffness.


Complications from tetanus are highest among people who have not been immunized or in older adults with inadequate immunization in industrialized countries.You may also be at increased risk of tetanus after a natural disaster, especially if you live in a developing country., As soon as you get an injury or wound, clean and disinfect it. If you delay disinfecting the new wounds by more than 4 hours, you increase the chances of tetanus infection.This is even more important if the wound was caused by an object that punctured the skin, which can force bacteria and debris deep into the wound, making it an ideal environment for the growth of bacteria.


Pay attention to whether the object that caused your wound is clean or dirty to decide whether you need a tetanus booster. A dirty, or contaminated, object has dirt/soil, saliva, or feces/manure on it, while a clean object does not. Remember that you can't necessarily know if an object has bacteria on it.

, The incubation period for tetanus varies from 3 to 21 days, with an average of 8 days. Tetanus severity is determined by a graded scale from I through IV. The longer it takes symptoms to appear, the more mild the disease is likely to be.Common symptoms of tetanus (in order of appearance) include:Spasm of jaw muscles (commonly referred to as “lockjaw”)
Stiffness of the neck
Difficulty swallowing (dysphagia)
Board-like rigidity of the abdominal muscles

, The diagnosis of tetanus relies solely on recognizing its symptoms. There are no blood tests that can diagnosis tetanus, so it's important to pay attention to any symptoms. You may also notice fever, sweating, elevated blood pressure, or rapid heart rate (tachycardia).Understand possible complications, including:Laryngospasm, or spasm of the vocal cords, which can make breathing difficult
Bone fractures
Seizures/convulsions
Abnormal heart rhythms
Secondary infections, such as pneumonia, as a result of prolonged hospitalization
Pulmonary embolism, or blood clots in the lungs
Death (10% of reported cases are fatal)

, If you think or even suspect you have tetanus, seek medical treatment immediately. It's a medical emergency and you'll need to be hospitalized, because tetanus has a high mortality, or death, rate (10%). In the hospital, you'll be given a tetanus antitoxin, like tetanus immune globulin. This will neutralize any toxin that hasn't already bound to your nervous tissue. The wound will be thoroughly cleaned and you'll get a tetanus vaccine to prevent future infections.Being infected with tetanus does not give you immunity from future infection. Instead, you'll need to get the tetanus vaccine to keep from getting it again.

, There are no blood tests that can diagnosis tetanus. So, lab testing is not useful in the evaluation for disease. Because of this, most doctors do not take a wait and see approach, but instead opt for aggressive treatment if infection is suspected.


Doctors will base their diagnosis mainly on the symptoms and clinical signs that are present. The more severe the symptoms, the more rapid the course of action.

, Since there is no cure for tetanus, treatments are directed at symptoms and emerging complications. You'll be given antibiotics intravenously, by injection, or orally and you'll also get drugs to control muscle spasms.


Some of the drugs to control muscle spasms include sedatives from the benzodiazepine group (like diazepam (Valium), lorazepam (Ativan), alprazolam (Xanax), and midazolam (Versed). Antibiotics are not generally effective against tetanus, but they may be prescribed to keep the Clostridium tetani bacteria from reproducing. This can help slow the production of toxins."

Choose special bedding.,
Protect your mattress.,
Steam your bed.,
Bag your bedding.,
Wash bedding and other fabrics.",How to Live With Allergies to Dust Mites1," Some fabrics contain natural dust mite repellants, like the lanolin found in wool. If you live in a colder climate, wool blankets and sheets will help stave off allergies during the long winter months. You’ll also find that wool keeps you warmer in the winter and cooler in the summer, as it traps warm air and also pulls moisture from your skin., Some mattresses are made with a barrier that prohibits mites and mite feces from passing through and affecting one’s rest. You can also use antimicrobial mattress and pillow protectors. Remember that the mattress should still be cleaned regularly, and depending on the severity of your allergies, should be cleaned with increased frequency., High heat kills dust mites and other organisms. You can purchase a steam cleaner to help your allergies at home. For better results you can use a portable cleaner and cleanse hotel rooms and guest rooms as you travel. You should also clean every other week. Companies like Coit and Stanley Steamer can come to your home and clean all of the beds in your home in one visit., Many have found that putting your bed in an enclosed mattress bag keeps dust mites and their droppings from affecting their allergies.You should also make sure any bag you purchase is tested and certified to not permit the passing of mites., Regularly launder your drapes, towels, curtains, tablecloths, and linens. Using hot water will kill the dust mites and cleanse their feces from your home. It’s recommended that you wash items on a weekly basis, ensuring the water temperature of at least 130° Fahrenheit (54° Celsius), otherwise the water will not be hot enough to kill the mites.

Take a look at available air-conditioning technologies.,
Dust and vacuum.,
Eliminate your rugs and carpet.,
Use the sun.,
Bathe your pet.,
Clean stuffed animals.,
Apply a pesticide.",How to Live With Allergies to Dust Mites2," Dust mites can’t live when the humidity falls below a certain point, so allergy sufferers should keep the level between 30% to 50% humidity.Installing a humidity control system helps control the level of moisture in your home. To use the system, adjust the dial according to the outside temperature. A complete list of instructions tells you how to adjust the settings. You can find whole-home systems made by Aprilaire or Healthy Climate that start at around $285.You should also consider putting in a dehumidifier to remove the excess moisture in the air. This is particularly important for basements, which tend to maintain higher levels of humidity. If you choose to get a dehumidifier, it’s a good idea to install a hose that you can connect directly into a drain. This way you don’t have to continuously empty the drain pan, which when full turns off the machine.

, Several manufacturers have started to offer small, portable air purifiers for the home. These can be effective in dealing with dust mite sensitivities. As another alternative, there are also whole house purifiers that attach to a furnace for forced-air purification. Some of these installations can be pricey, but they can really improve indoor air quality and help with a full range of allergies.


Many options also exist on the more affordable end with single-room air purifiers that only require a new filter once every 4 to 5 months. Using a smaller unit will reduce the amount of electricity you use and also allow you to turn down or turn off the unit when you are away from home for extended periods., This regular household maintenance helps keep more dust mites and debris out of the air. It’s recommended that you vacuum once or twice a week to keep up with the problem. Not only will this clean your home, frequent vacuuming will lengthen the life of your carpet.


For other surfaces like hardwood floors, regular mopping will remove the mites and other dirt, which likewise makes your floors last longer by keeping dirt from scratching the surface.Simple cleaning can kick up dust mites and cause issues, so consider having someone without allergies clean your bedroom and home. You can ask a friend, family member, or even hire a private company to clean on a regular basis.
Vacuuming and dusting will temporarily help with dust mites but won’t control the problem. These allergens are also on other surfaces like beds, drapes, linens, and furniture. You will need to employ other methods mentioned herein to sufficiently treat a dust mite problem.

, While they provide warmth, rugs and carpeting could be the culprit. Severe allergy sufferers may think to use rugs sparingly, or completely get rid of the carpeting in their home. As an alternative, hardwood, laminate and tile floors are more conducive for avoiding dust mites., Sunlight kills mites, and it’s free. The main way to use our most abundant renewable resource is to hang your linens and drapes outside to dry in the fresh air and sunlight, or perhaps leave your shades open during peak sunlight times.Note that sunlight does kill the mite itself, but does not remove the allergen from the environment. You’ll need to use another method of cleaning and removal to eliminate the physical presence of the mites from your home.

, We love our dogs and cats, but not the dust mites they carry in their fur. Regularly bathe your pet to help reduce allergens like dust mites and pet dander. You might also think about getting one of the many breeds of hypoallergenic dogsand cats.Getting non-allergy producing pets and bathing your pets regardless is a step in the right direction, but always you’ll also need to regularly clean your home to help the problem.

, Don’t forget that mites live on fabrics and that is what stuffed animals are covered in. Clean your or your child's fluffy friend with heat by putting it in the dryer for 10 minutes. Be sure to avoid putting anything in the dryer that may melt, such as plastic.


Another way to clean these items is to place them in a plastic bag and put them in the freezer for a short time, then shake them off outdoors after they come out, as this will kill dust mites.Washing also provides an efficient method of cleaning. Use a mild laundry detergent and launder the animals for a high heat cycle. Place delicate animals in a laundry bag for protection.

, While using a pesticide can be effective, it’s important to mention that they may have a limited effect, as mites are immune to pesticides while dormant. That being said, you can choose to use a spray, powder, or fogger to help with your mite problem.When using a pesticide, make sure you use a natural, non-toxic product like an organic dust mite killer on items that cannot be laundered. Otherwise, you can choose one of several other options that should be done weekly. For example, you can apply Lysol spray on any surface or Good-Night dust spray, which you can use on mattresses and bedding. You will still need to wash the items after using such a spray.
Also try a carpet treatment like Allerseach X-Mite. Use this product by brushing the treatment into the carpet with a broom and leaving it for three hours. Afterward you need only to vacuum it up."

For example, you might try using an antihistamine, like Benadryl, to provide relief from itchy, watery eyes, or a decongestant, like Vicks Sinex, to unclog a stuffy nose. Also available are nasal steroids that can help reduce swelling in the nasal cavity.Double-check with your doctor prior to taking any medications.

, This treatment involves receiving allergy shots. Regular, controlled exposure to allergens can help reduce your sensitivity to them. Your doctor can advise you as to whether this is the right course of action for you., Have a skin prick test or a blood test in order to determine that your symptoms are indeed caused by an allergy to dust mites. A skin prick test is done by pricking the skin and exposing the tiny scratch to specific allergens, watching for a physical reaction.


For those who are too sensitive to the skin prick test you can have a blood test done. The blood test also relies on exposure to allergens, but this time each allergen is added to a sample of your blood. The blood is then observed to see how many antibodies it produces as it reacts to the allergen."
