Identify symptoms of anaphylaxis.,
Ask if the person needs help using the emergency pen.,
Use the emergency pen.,
Call emergency services.",How to Know if You Need an Allergy Emergency Pen2," When a person is exposed to a specific allergen, they can experience anaphylaxis. The reaction can be severe, and even life-threatening. Anaphylactic reactions usually occur within minutes of exposure, but can take as long as a half-hour or longer to occur in some cases. Look for the following symptoms of Anaphylaxis:Dizziness and/or fainting
Skin reactions like hives, itching, and flushed or pale skin
Low blood pressure
Swollen tongue or throat
Trouble breathing
Rapid or weak pulse
Vomiting
Diarrhea

, If a person already has an emergency pen on them and is experiencing symptoms of anaphylaxis, ask them if they need help using the allergy emergency pen. A person who knows they need an injection should be able to instruct you. If not, instructions are printed on the side of the emergency pen., Hold the emergency pen with your fist firmly on the middle of the device. Inject the emergency pen into the muscle or fat of the mid-outer thigh directly through the clothing, and then hold in place for a slow count of three seconds. Remove the device and then massage the injection site for 10 seconds.Do not administer the emergency pen in the buttock, veins, hands, or feet.
The effects of an emergency pen may wear off after 10-20 minutes. You may administer a second dose if symptoms are not subsiding, but do not administer more than two doses., Even if you administer the emergency pen and symptoms appear to be improving, it is critical that the person receives professional medical help as soon as possible. Call emergency services and immediately tell them your location. Then describe the situation and ask that medical help be sent immediately.

Look for signs that indicate allergic reactions.,
Seek medical assistance if you notice any of the symptoms.,
Avoid contact or ingestion of eggs in any form, including dried egg, egg white, egg yolk, powdered egg and whole egg.

,
Check for any ingredients that could cause allergic reactions.,
Replace nutritional deficiencies with other food sources.",How to Live With Allergies to Eggs," There are 4 major symptoms associated with egg allergy as well as other miscellaneous symptoms.


Abnormal marks on the skin such as hives and flushing or swollen areas.
Disturbances in the digestive system such as stomach aches, diarrhea or vomiting.
Breathing problems that cause wheezing or breathing difficulties.
Heart disorders such as low blood pressure or fast pulse.
Other miscellaneous symptoms include nausea, runny nose and itching near the mouth.;
, The most common symptom to appear among babies is a rash or sick reaction after eating eggs. The doctor can conduct various tests to confirm whether a person is allergic to eggs.


Skin test: The doctor will expose the skin to egg extract and prick the skin gently. The appearance of a raised and reddish spot where the egg extract was placed indicates that the subject has egg allergy.
Blood test: If the skin test yields negative the doctor may decide to do a blood test. The doctor will take a sample of the subject's blood and send it to the lab for chemical testing.

,, Such ingredients include albumin, globulin, alpha-livetin, lysozyme, ova, ovoglobulin, ovomucin, ovomucoid, ovotransferrin, ovovitellin, ovovitellin, silici albuminate, simples and vitellin.

, Eggs are a healthy source of protein so for someone who needs to avoid eggs other sources of protein need to be used.


Replace each egg with half a tablespoon of oil and 1 teaspoon of baking powder during common baking recipes. Eggs are one of the most common ingredients used in baking but this trick allows people to still enjoy many treats such as cookies and cupcakes despite having to live with allergies to eggs.
Increase the intake of protein from other sources such as chicken, fish, peanuts and beans.
Talk to a dietitian and devise a plan that will allow you to fulfill your nutritional needs while avoiding eggs.

The most common over-the-counter first generation antihistamine is diphenhydramine, the active ingredient in Benadryl.
Second and third generation antihistamines generally have fewer side effects. Second generation antihistamines include cetirizine (Zyrtec) and loratadine (Claritin). Third generation antihistamines include desloratadine (Clarinex) and fexofenadine (Allegra). These medications cause less drowsiness than other antihistamines.;
, Antihistamines may cause reaction with other medications or substances. For example, you should avoid alcohol when taking antihistamines. Antihistamines can also interact with muscle relaxants (such as carisoprodol and cyclobenzaprine), sleeping pills (such as zolpidem), and sedatives (such as benzodiazepines) so avoid taking antihistamines with these medications.If you have glaucoma, overactive bladder or trouble urinating, respiratory issues such as asthma, heart issues or high blood pressure, kidney or liver issues, or thyroid disease, make sure to ask your doctor before taking antihistamines., Try taking over the counter antihistamines if you have predictable, intermittent, short-term (few weeks) mild to moderate symptoms of an allergy such as sneezing, itchy, watery eyes or runny nose, or mild hives. If these don't work or you experience side effects, prescription medications may be a better option., Follow the directions on the label for the particular medication you are taking. Most of the oral antihistamines should be taken everyday during the time you are experiencing allergy symptoms. If allergies are severe, uncontrolled by the medication, last longer than the common allergy season, or chronic contact your doctor.If you are elderly, have other health conditions, are taking medications or supplements or treating a child for allergies contact a doctor before taking an over the counter antihistamine. Your doctor may determine that other medications or treatments may be a better option for you.

, Several antihistamines are available in child-strength formulations. Your pediatrician or pharmacist can advise you which is right for your child. Never give a young child adult-strength antihistamines.Children’s antihistamine is available in caplets, syrups, chewables, and melt-away tabs for easy dosing.
Follow the directions on the label. Generally, child-strength antihistamines are approved for use in children 2 and older. Some are approved for as young as 6 months. Consult your pediatrician if your child is younger than 2., Once you've started taking antihistamines, talk to your doctor if your symptoms are severe or get worse. You should also call your doctor if you develop a nosebleed or other nasal symptoms. Tell your doctor if the symptoms don't lessen or go away. Common symptoms include:Dizziness
Dry mouth
Feeling irritable, jittery, or excited
Changes in vision, including blurred vision
Loss of appetite
If you start having shortness of breath or trouble breathing, contact emergency services right away. You may be having an anaphylactic reaction.

, Children are particularly prone to medication overdose. If you notice any of the following symptoms after giving your child antihistamines, call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222and seek emergency medical attention for your child:Extreme drowsiness
Confusion
Agitation
Muscle weakness
Convulsions
Hallucination

, If you have allergic rhinitis or hay fever, you can take first or second generation antihistamines. First generation antihistamines, like diphenhydramine (Benadryl) or chlorpheniramine, can cause drowsiness and other side effects. These are available over the counter. Second or third generation antihistamines may be a better option for ongoing symptoms of hay fever.


Second and third generation antihistamines usually require only once or twice daily dosing, which is easier to comply with.
Second generation antihistamines like cetirizine (Zyrtec), fexofenadine (Allegra), or loratadine (Claritin) cause significantly less drowsiness and fewer other side effects.
Prescription third-generation antihistamines include desloratadine (Clarinex) and levocetirizine dihydrochloride (Xyzal) and may be a better option if you have side effects with over the counter antihistamines.

, Antihistamine nasal sprays are used to directly treat cold and allergy-related nasal symptoms. These are available by prescription and include azelastine (Astelin, Astepro) and olopatadine (Patanase).Side effect of these antihistamines slightly differ from the oral ones and include bitter taste, fatigue and weight gain, burning sensation in nostrils, and possible drowsiness.Use as directed by your doctor.

, You can get them over the counter or as a prescription. For example, you could try azelastine (Optivar) or olopatadine (Pataday, Patanol) by prescription. Or, try ketotifen (Alaway, Zaditor) or pheniramine (Visine-A, Opcon-A) over the counter.Side effects can include headache, burning sensation and dry eyes.


To insert eye drops properly, wash your hands with soap and warm water. Next, remove your contact lenses, tilt your head back, look up and pull down the lower eyelid. Apply the prescribed number of drops. Keep your eyes closed for 1 to 2 minutes. Place one finger at the inside corner of your eye and apply gentle pressure. This will prevent the medication from draining out. Wait 10 minutes before reinserting your contacts.

,


Take the medication with a glass of water. Do not crush or chew the tablets.Examples include fexofenadine and pseudoephedrine (Allegra-D) or loratadine and pseudoephedrine (Claritin-D). Both are available as a 12 or 24 hour treatment taken twice or once a day respectively.

, If you have a dry cough, an antihistamine can be a good first option to treat it.Most antihistamines are effective to treat cough.Try diphenhydramine (Benadryl) at night or something like cetirizine (Zyrtec) or fexofenadine (Allegra), which don’t cause as much drowsiness, during the day.

, Certain OTC antihistamines sold can be used to treat nausea and vomiting associated with motion sickness. Many products act on the part of the brain that prevents nausea, which is why some people take antihistamines before traveling on an airplane or by boat. You should usually take them one hour before the activity or departure.


Long-lasting, low drowsy options include: dimenhydrinate (Dramamine, Gravol, Driminate), meclizine (Bonine, Bonamine, Antivert, Postafen, and Sea Legs), and cyclizine (Marezine, Bonine For Kids, Cyclivert). Promethazine (Phenergan) is prescribed for treating nausea or vomiting, motion sickness, and allergic reactions, but can cause more drowsiness., Rashes and hives may be caused by the production of too much histamine, and second or third generation antihistamines can help block your body’s release of histamine.Talk with your doctor about taking one of the following daily:


Cetirizine (Zyrtec)
Fexofenadine (Allegra)
Loratadine (Claritin, Alavert)
Levocetirizine (Xyzal)
Desloratadine (Clarinex)
If the newer-generation antihistamines do not appear to work, your doctor may recommend that you take a first generation antihistamine such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl). Take these before bed each night, as they cause drowsiness.

, Topical antihistamines come in lotion or cream form and can be applied directly to the affected area as needed, up to 4 times a day. They usually contain diphenhydramine, often in combination with a skin protectant like calamine.If you develop pain, redness, swelling, hives, or difficulty breathing after an insect bite, contact emergency services right away. These are signs that you are having an allergic reaction to the bite.If you have pus, swelling, or if your rash gets bigger, changes color, or does not go away in a couple days contact your doctor. This may be a sign of a different skin condition or infection that may need prescription medication.
Don't use topical antihistamines with oral antihistamines which can increase the concentration of antihistamine in your body. Make sure not to apply topical antihistamines to a very large area of your skin or skin that is broken or blistered.If you have insect bites or a rash over a large area of your body, try an oral antihistamine instead. Contact your doctor if your bites or rash is very severe.

, Some over the counter antihistamine products are marketed as sleeping aids because of the side effect of drowsiness. But, you can develop tolerance to the drowsiness caused by antihistamines. So the more or longer you use them, the less effective they will be. Be aware that they can also cause drowsiness and grogginess the next day.Options include diphenhydramine (Benadryl, Unisom SleepGels) or doxylamine succinate (Unisom SleepTabs).
Only take drowsiness-inducing antihistamines before you go to bed. Do not drive or operate machinery after taking drowsiness-inducing antihistamines.

, Some antihistamines may help with anxiety because they can cause sedation. The most common antihistamine prescribed for anxiety or preoperative sedation is hydroxyzine.


This is usually given as 50-100 mg by mouth every 6 hours. Side effects include dry mouth, drowsiness and tremors., Antihistamines may help with abnormal movements in patients with Parkinson's. Diphenhydramine can sometimes be used since it blocks the neurotransmitters. This helps control abnormal movements associated with early stage Parkinson’s or as a side effect of medication., Avoid things that you have noticed trigger allergies. Common allergy triggers include certain foods, dust, insect bites, pet dander, drugs, latex, mold, and cockroaches.When you eat out, tell your server about any food allergies you have. Restaurants usually have strict policies in place to help avoid allergic reactions.
Stay indoors between 5AM to 10AM if you have pollen allergies. Pollen counts are usually highest during these hours.Wear a face mask and eye protection if you do yardwork. Shower immediately afterward to remove any dust or pollen.
Apply insect repellant when you go outside to avoid insect bites.

, It’s more difficult to avoid allergens out in public, but there are several things you can do to make your home more allergy-friendly.Dust and vacuum regularly. Get a vacuum with a HEPA filter to filter out minute allergy-causing particles.
Cover your pillows and mattresses with dust mite covers. You can buy these online or at many home or department stores.
Look for cleaning products, such as Febreze Allergen Reducer, that you can use on things such as upholstery, carpet, and curtains.
Never smoke inside your home.
Use antibacterial cleaners for your kitchen and bathroom. Ventilate your kitchen and bathroom by running vent hoods and fans to avoid mold growth.
Bathe pets once a week to reduce dander. If you have bad pet allergies, don’t sleep with your pet.
Wash bedding in hot water every week or two. This will help kill dust mites., If you have reduced allergens in your home and used antihistamines and you’re still not seeing relief, see an allergist and ask for an allergy test. These tests allow your allergist and physician to determine your precise allergies and come up with a treatment plan for you.You may experience an allergic reaction to some tests. It’s important to have an allergy specialist perform any allergy test. The American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology has a “Find an Allergist” feature on their website.Allergy tests can be done as either skin tests or blood tests. Skin tests are fast and allow many allergens to be tested at the same time. Blood tests are often used if you have a severe skin condition or are likely to have a severe allergic reaction to a skin test., Certain natural treatments may help reduce allergy symptoms. You should always consult your doctor before trying any treatment, including ones that are natural or herbal. Even natural treatments can interfere with medical conditions and prescription medications.Vitamin C supplements (2,000 mg daily) may help improve allergy symptoms.Spirulina, a type of blue-green algae, may help reduce symptoms such as nasal discharge, sneezing, and congestion. It may also improve immune response, although more study is needed. take 4-6 500mg tablets a day.Butterbur (Petasites hybridus) has been shown to be effective at reducing allergy symptoms such as itchy eyes. It may also relieve nasal allergies.Pregnant and breastfeeding women and young children should not use butterbur. Take 500mg a day or as directed by your doctor.Biminne is an herbal formulation in traditional Chinese medicine. It has been shown to be effective at improving allergy symptoms.Speak with your doctor before taking biminne., Some studies suggest that acupuncture can help relieve allergy symptoms, although more study is needed.Talk with your doctor to see whether acupuncture is a good option for you.

Place your child around cats in temporary situations.,
Observe your child.,
Listen to your child.,
Remove your child from the allergen.,
Have an allergist test your child.,
Spot more severe allergies.",How to Know if a Child Is Allergic to Cats1," Go to a friend or family member's house where you know a cat is living and get the child to interact with the cat. This way, you can watch for signs of a cat allergy.


Be aware that cat allergies can arise from contact with the skin, fur, dander, saliva and urine of the animal.It is important to note here that you should not try exposing your child to cats, or any animals, without knowing if they do or don’t have an allergy if your child suffers from asthma. Simple allergic symptoms can trigger potentially deadly asthma episodes.;
, If your child shows any of the following symptoms, he may be allergic to cats:Excessive coughing, wheezing or sneezing
Gets hives or a rash on the chest and face
Has red or itchy eyes
Redness on a spot of skin where the child was scratched, bitten, or licked

, If your child complains about any of the following symptoms while exposed to the cat, your child may have a cat allergy:Itchy eyes
A stuffy, itchy, or runny nose
Itchy skin or hives where the cat touched the child

, If you do notice any of the above symptoms in your child, it is important to remove her from contact with the cat until you have devised a plan to lessen or eliminate the symptoms of her allergies.

, Observational and anecdotal evidence may be enough to determine a cat allergy in a child. However, you will want to visit the doctor and get an allergy test. Keep in mind, though, they aren't always accurate, so if your child tests negative, you should still observe the child for signs of allergies when he is exposed to a cat., Most allergic reactions are limited to redness, itching, hives and nose stuffiness, but signs of more severe allergic reactions may become apparent when exposing your child to a cat. Swelling of the throat can occur in severe allergic reactions, which can lead to the constriction of airways. If this happens, get your child to a medical professional immediately and do not expose them to any more cats in the future."
"
Note whether your child experiences a mild or severe allergy.,
Use antihistamines.,
Use decongestants.,
Get your child allergy shots.,
Pair medication with other preventative measures.,
Monitor the medication’s effectiveness.",How to Know if a Child Is Allergic to Cats2," If your child’s allergy symptoms are mild, you can probably control them with over-the-counter medication and proper sanitation around your house. If the symptoms are severe, such as breaking out in body-wide hives, or swelling of the throat or other airways, you will need to ensure your child is no longer exposed to cats.


If you already have a cat and find out that your child is severely allergic, you will likely need to rehouse your cat.

, Antihistamines are designed to reduce the production of an immune system chemical that is responsible for causing the symptoms associated with allergies. They also help relieve itching, sneezing and runny nose. You can purchase these medications over-the-counter or acquire them with a prescription. Antihistamines come in pill form, as nasal sprays or in syrups, which are specifically designed for children.Never give over-the-counter or prescription allergy medications to children two years of age or younger unless directed by a doctor or medical professional., Decongestants work by shrinking swollen tissues in your nasal passages, making it easier to breathe through your nose.Some over-the-counter allergy tablets combine an antihistamine with a decongestant.
Never give over-the-counter or prescription allergy medications to children two years of age or younger unless directed by a doctor or medical professional., These shots, usually administered once or twice a week by an allergist, can help a child overcome the symptoms of allergies that can’t be controlled with either antihistamines or decongestants. Allergy shots ""train"" your immune system by desensitizing it to specific allergens. This is typically called immunotherapy. The initial shots expose you to very small doses of the allergen, in this case, the cat protein that causes an allergic reaction. The dose is, “gradually increased, usually during a three- to six-month period. Maintenance shots are needed every four weeks for three to five years.” Also, be sure to ask your doctor or allergist about age and dosage restrictions as they may apply to your child. , While also continuing a regimen of allergy medications, it is important to also follow the steps listed below, under “Controlling Cat Allergies with Preventative Measures,” to ensure you minimize the symptoms of your child’s allergy to cats., Once you have found the proper dosage and type of medication for your child, monitor its effectiveness over time. People have a tendency to build up an immunity to the active ingredients in allergy medication, which ultimately minimizes their effectiveness. If you see this occurring in your child, you will likely have to change the dosage or type of allergy medication he or she is taking."
"
Reduce exposure to cats.,
Warn others about your child’s allergies.,
Give your child an allergy medication a few hours before interacting with a cat.,
Restrict your cat’s access.,
Invest in a central air conditioner with an allergen control.,
Clean often and well.,
Bathe the cat regularly.",How to Know if a Child Is Allergic to Cats3," As obvious as this sounds, removing exposure or limiting the amount of time your child is exposed to cats will drastically improve their allergy symptoms., If you're going to visit someone with a cat, warn the hosts about your child's allergy. Ask them to keep the cat out of the the room where your child will be from now until the end of your visit., If you are taking your child to a house where you know there are cats, give your child an allergy medicine a few hours before exposure. This can minimize his reaction and he won't have to be uncomfortable waiting for the allergy medicine to kick in if he takes when he is already exposed to the cat.

, Keep your cat out of bedrooms, playpens, off the couch, and generally away from any area where your child spends a lot of time. If you have a finished basement that your child doesn't go into often, keeping the cat segregated in the basement can be viable solution., Reducing the amount of airborne allergens in your home can go a long way in relieving your child's allergy symptoms. Air conditioners with allergen control filters, such as HEPA filters, successfully reduce the amount of airborne allergens in your home., Cat fur and skin can buildup on your couches, in your carpet, on the drapes, and generally anywhere else the cat goes. Invest in a good vacuum cleaner and use it often. Also, use carpet shampoo, de-sanitizing sprays and anti-bacterial wipes often on the surfaces in your home to eliminate any unnecessary allergens left by your cat.Cats, by nature, have a tendency to get into, under, and on top of everything in your home. So make sure you pay attention to areas that you wouldn’t usually consider high-traffic, such as behind the couch or under the bed.

, Bathing your cat regularly can help to reduce the amount of dander and excess fur she leaves around the house. As such, washing your cat is another effective step in combating your child’s allergies.It is important to remember that cats don’t like baths, and they naturally do not need them very often. Be sure to check with your vet about safely giving your cat a bath, as bathing her too often can have a negative impact on her physical health.

, A collection of itchy spots could be mosquito bites... or it could be a rash due to a skin irritant such as poison ivy.. or it could be hives caused by an allergic reaction to detergent. If the hives are concentrated along lines where your clothing rubs or is snug (such as underwear lines) you could be allergic to either latex (in elastic) or to detergents you wash your clothing with., This is one of the more common allergic reactions and could be your first clue that you and pollen were not meant to cohabit., Swollen hands, face etc can be in indication that you have ingested something you are allergic to., This can help you and your physician determine what allergen you contacted and when., If you have experienced an allergic reaction, keep your allergy medications handy.

It also enhance both physical and sexual performance as well as male and female libido by balancing hormones.It can also be taken to enhance energy.;
, Maca can be purchased as a powder, as a flour, or as a supplement, usually in capsule form. You can buy it in many health food stores, nutritional stores, or from online vendors that specialize in herbs and natural remedies.Look for organic maca root from Peru, as this is the species that has been studied the most.

, Maca has been used to thousands of years as a food staple. There are no known safety issues as long as you use the recommended dosing. However, you should always talk to you doctor about new things you put into your diet that you use to treat certain health issues.


Maca may interact with sildenafil and other drugs used to treat erectile dysfunction. Make sure to check with your doctor before using maca if you are taking a prescription drug for erectile dysfunction.
Rare allergic reactions have been reported, but those are minimal and non-lethal.Since maca root regulates hormones, it is not recommended that you take them if you are pregnant or nursing.Even though maca is very safe, it is always recommended that you talk to your physician to be certain that maca can benefit you.

, Maca has been shown to be effective in treating erectile dysfunction. Maca may increase levels of nitric oxide, known to be important in achieving and maintaining an erection. Maca is a member of the cruciferous vegetable family, which is the family that broccoli, cauliflower and Brussels sprouts belong to. It is effective in reducing the effects of an enlarged prostate, which may also benefit sexual function and activity.Animal studies have indicated that maca can also improve sexual performance and frequency of erections, though human clinical studies are not available., Maca has been studied in relation to fertility and hormone control. Maca does have some phytoestrogenic activity. This means that the phytoestrogens, which are plant substances that can function in varying degrees as human estrogens, are active in maca and may help regulate the hormones in your system.


Maca has been studied in animals with regards to increasing fertility. The results of these studies indicate that maca can increase both male sperm count and female litter size in animals, providing evidence that maca may be useful in increasing fertility in humans. It also increased both testosterone and estrogen, the male and female hormones, levels in animal studies.Maca may be used to increase libido in post-menopausal women. Most studies have been relatively short term, and results may be seen within 6-8 weeks., If you want to have sexual or hormonal benefits from maca, you need to take the right dosage. Take between 1500 to 3000 mg in divided doses daily to increase sexual interest, performance, and fertility. This amount can also act as an aphrodisiac. Take this dosage for up to 12 weeks for these benefits.


Longer term safety studies are not available, but historically, the vegetable itself has been safely consumed on a long-term basis. This means that you can likely take it longer with minimal to no side effects., Maca is often called “Peruvian Ginseng” because of its reported energy boosting effects.In traditional herbal terms, maca is classified as an adaptogen, which means that it supports physiological properties that help restore the body’s balance after periods of stress.

Identify if your employees are “at will.” In every state but Montana, employees are “at will” unless you have changed the relationship.,
Check your state or local law.,
Identify exemptions created by antidiscrimination law.,
Meet with an attorney.,
Adopt a flu shot requirement.,
Notify employees of the requirement.,
Create a process for exemptions.,
Require supporting documentation.,
Analyze the request for exemption.,
Reassign employees instead of firing them.,
Document any termination.,
Download the Toolkit.,
Schedule an on-site flu clinic.,
Print out flyers.,
Speak to employee managers.,
Hold a contest.,
Encourage employees to get flu shots on their own.",How to Legally Require Employees to Get a Flu Shot," You can fire “at will” employees for any legal reason, at any time.However, you may have changed the “at will” status in the following ways:


Your employees are unionized and you agreed to a collective bargaining agreement. In this situation, the terms of the bargaining agreement will control whether you can require flu shots.
You signed an employment contract with an employee. This contract probably states that the employee can only be fired “for cause.” Furthermore, the contract should have defined “cause.”
You created an implied contract with employees based on promises you made in an employment offer letter, employee handbook, or in person. Although rare, you can sometimes create a contract accidentally based on promises you make.;
, Federal law doesn’t generally prohibit flu shots. However, your state or local law may. In some states, hospital staff must get flu shots, so if you have a business in that field you need to know that information as well.You can visit the website for the Centers for Disease Control, which collects information on state vaccination requirements for hospital and ambulatory care employees.You can also do a general search on the Internet. However, there may not be much information available. Type “your state” or “your city” and “mandatory flu shot.”

, Antidiscrimination laws limit your ability to fire “at will” employees. For example, you can’t fire or demote someone based on a protected characteristic, such as race, ethnicity, or sex. With respect to flu shots, some people might claim an exemption based on the following:Religion. Some religions prohibit vaccination. If you want to require employees to get a flu shot, then you need to provide an exemption for religious reasons. If you don’t, then you could be sued for employment discrimination.
Medical/disability. Some people should not get flu shots because they may be allergic to eggs, which are used in some vaccines. Accordingly, you need to provide exemptions for disability. However, you should realize that shots have now been created without egg.

, Only a qualified attorney can offer you accurate information about the laws that limit your ability to require employees to get a flu shot. If your company does not already have a lawyer, then you should get a referral.


You can ask another business if they would recommend their lawyer, or you could contact your state bar association and ask for a referral.Call up the lawyer and schedule a consultation. Ask ahead of time how much he or she charges.
Because this is an unsettled area of law, the attorney may need to do extensive legal research and get back to you at a later date.

, Remember you have to adopt the program legally. For example, if your employees are unionized, then you should make getting a flu shot part of your next collective bargaining agreement. In the past, some employees have been successful at defeating a flu shot requirement when it was imposed outside collective bargaining.Talk with your attorney about whether you can adopt a policy outside collective bargaining, as this is not a clear area of law.


Also, if you have an employment contract with an employee, then include a flu shot requirement in the new contract. For example, you could define “just cause” for termination to include refusal to get a flu shot.

, You can notify employees that they need to get a flu shot by letter, email, or both. Give the employees a deadline and tell them what kind of verification you will need, such as a form completed by a doctor or nurse.


Some employers have created webpages explaining to their employees why they must get the flu shot. Johns Hopkins Hospital, for example, has a website in which it explains that it has adopted a mandatory policy because voluntary policies were ineffective. It also identifies the employees who must get the flu shot.The Johns Hopkins webpage also clearly tells employees what will happen if they decline to get the flu shot and are not awarded an exemption: they will be placed on administrative leave for a week and then considered to have voluntarily resigned.

, To comply with antidiscrimination laws, you will have to give employees a chance to seek an exemption (called an “accommodation”) for religious or medical reasons. You should create a form for employees to fill out stating their name and the reason for the accommodation. Tell employees where they can get the form and where they should submit it. Require that they submit the form a few weeks before the deadline for getting the shot so that you can review it.Remember that your state law may also require that you accommodate philosophical reasons, which could be something like not wanting to violate their bodily integrity. Make sure you consider any accommodation required by state as well as federal law.

, You don’t have to accept an employee’s claim that his or her religion prohibits vaccines. Instead, you could ask that the employee provide you with a signed letter from a faith leader.


Likewise, if your employee claims a medical exemption, then request that a doctor sign a waiver form.

, Someone claiming a religious or medical objection is not automatically entitled to the exemption. Instead, the law requires that you as the employer balance the employee’s rights against the burden on your business.If granting the accommodation would cause your business “undue hardship,” then you don’t need to grant it.


“Undue hardship” is not a difficult standard to meet. Essentially, if granting an accommodation would cause more than minimal financial harm, then you don’t have to grant the accommodation.However, you should be sure to give each request an individualized review. Consider any potential workarounds. For example, you could have an employee wear a surgical mask during flu season. This could be a cost-free way of keeping the employee.

, You can avoid some of the difficult legal issues if you reassign an employee who objects to a flu shot instead of firing them.This might not always be possible, depending on the person’s job and your business needs.


In some situations, however, you could reassign a person away from customer contact. For example, a staff member at a nursing home might clean resident rooms. However, you could reassign him or her to work in a back office.

, After you adopt your policy, an employee may refuse to comply. You might have rejected their request for an exemption because any workaround would have caused your business an undue hardship. In this situation, you have the option of firing the employee.


You should follow your business procedures for termination as set out in your current business policies. Remember to document everything, in particular your reason for denying the accommodation.
See Prevent Wrongful Termination Lawsuits for information on how to terminate an employee legally.

, Your best bet is to encourage employees to get flu shots but not require them. The Centers for Disease Control has a toolkit you can download from the Internet.This toolkit provides helpful information and resources for starting a voluntary flu shot program in your company.

, You can encourage employees to get a vaccine by offering them free or for a reduced cost. If you have an on-site health clinic, then you can offer the flu shots there. However, if you don’t, then you can contract with a pharmacy or vaccinator to come to your worksite.You can research companies that handle the planning and delivery of on-site clinics. Some of these companies have networks of over 6,000 health professionals around the country who they work with. Search online for “on-site flu clinic” and contact them to ask about their rates.
If you don’t want to offer an on-site clinic, then you could create flu shot vouchers, which could be redeemed at many different pharmacy chains, such as Rite Aid, CVS, and Walgreens.Some of the companies that coordinate on-site clinics also run voucher programs you could use.

, The Toolkit has flyers you can print out and post around your worksite. They are available free of charge.Alternately, you could download a flyer and send it around as an attachment to a company-wide email.

, You can encourage participation if employees can get a flu shot without having to use personal time. Speak to managers in your company and get them to agree that their employees can get a vaccine on company time.By giving employees some time off, you will lose some profitability. However, you should more than make up for it with decreased employee absenteeism.

, You can also encourage participation by holding a contest. For example, you could offer a prize to the department that has the highest participation rate.Offer the winning department a pizza lunch or an after-work party as a reward.

, If hosting a vaccine provider at your worksite isn’t possible, then you can still encourage your employees to go get flu shots on their own. You can encourage greater participation if you use the following:Give employees one or two hours off to go get a flu shot somewhere off the worksite. They might go to a nearby clinic or hospital.
Provide employees with written material that explains the benefits of getting a flu shot for your employee and their family. You can print off material from the Toolkit.
Display posters in break rooms and high traffic areas. The more times someone sees information, the more likely they are to remember it.

Let your child know that school is a supportive space.",How to Help Your Child Manage Stress," A good way to reinforce your willingness to help your child manage stress offering unconditional love and support from you and other family members. Let your child know that you are available to talk and will help however you can.Reinforce your love and willingness to help your child with stress support by repeating these reassuring statements often. Your consistency is important to can help your child more effectively handle a stressful situation. For example, saying, “I know how much this situation with Chandler stresses you out, Emma. We love you very much and will help in any way you like that we are able. Even if you just want to vent, your mom and I are always here for you.”
Avoid telling your child to “stop stressing.” No child wants stress and yours would likely stop if he or she could.
Praise your child for doing things well or even just trying. This can really help your child feel less stressed. For example, “I realize how much stress gym class can cause you, Max. I’m really proud of you for going and participating. You said you scored a couple of points—that’s awesome!”;
, Children are very sensitive to their environments. This includes how their parents are feeling or if a family member is under stress. Children can easily pick up on the anxieties or stress from family members and friends, which may cause them to worry. Setting a good example by not discussing stressful situations in front of your child or keeping your stress in check may prevent your child from stressing.Reduce any worry you may have caused your child as soon as you notice it. For example, “I’m sorry you heard me say grandma is sick and I’m worried, Ava. Grandma is going to get better in no time and can come and visit again soon. Do you have any questions?”

, Mornings are the time when you and your child set the tone for the day. If you’re in a rush, it may stress out your child throughout the day. Maintaining a morning routine each day can help manage any existing stress in your child and prevent it from increasing through a rushed pace.Plan as much as you can the night before. This includes outfits and getting breakfast and lunch ready for the next day.
Greet your child positively. A, “Good morning, Liv!” is much better than a “Time to get up, Liv, we’re running late.”
Have your child only do what’s important and keep tasks manageable. For example, making a bed may be more important than cleaning the cat litter box.

, Every individual needs rest to maintain both physical and mental health. Children need enough rest to ensure that they have the energy to combat stress.Your child should get 9 to 11 hours of sleep every night. This can help your child relax and may relieve stress.Allow your child to nap for 20 to 30 minutes if necessary. This may also manage any stress., A stressed child may feel like the world is working against him or her. Any little sign of impatience from another person may increase your child’s stress. Reminding yourself that your child needs help managing stress can help you remain patient and understanding.Inhale deeply if you feel like you’re going to scold or give negative feedback to your child. This can help relax you and your child.

, It may be difficult for some children to notice when they are getting stressed. Talk to your child about the physical symptoms of stress. This may help your child recognize when they are stressed and put in place measures to reduce it. The physical symptoms of stress in a child include:Decreased appetite or changes in eating habits.
Headache.
Sleep disturbances.
Bedwetting.
Nightmares.
Stuttering.
Upset stomach or stomach pain.

, It is important for your child to know that stress can also cause a variety of emotional symptoms. Teach your child to look for these as well so that they will know when they are feeling stressed. These symptoms may include:Crying, whining, or having a hard time controlling your emotions.
Feeling anxious, worried, fearful, or nervous.
Clinginess, such as not wanting to be away from their parents or siblings.
Anger and stubbornness.
Withdrawing and not wanting to participate in activities with friends and family.
Going back to behaviors from a previous developmental stage, such as thumbsucking.

, Adults often use stress relieving techniques to help themselves feel calm, and these techniques can be helpful for children as well. Try teaching your child a stress relieving technique that they can use on a daily basis, such as before bed every night and also whenever they are feeling stressed. Some stress relieving techniques you can teach your child include:



Meditation.

Yoga.

Deep breathing.

Progressive muscle relaxation.

, Anticipate when your child may face a situation that may cause stress. This could be encountering a bully, taking a test, or seeing a doctor. Figuring this out can help you prepare your child for the situation and give them techniques to effectively handle it.Help your child rehearse how he or she will deal with the situation when it arises. For example, if your child is having a conflict with a friend at school, say, “Avery, you may see Taylor at school today, how are you feeling about that?” “You’re scared? I understand. Maybe we can practice some phrases you can say to Taylor to make things easier on you. If not, you can always call me.”
Help your child figure out a couple of different ways to handle what is causing stress., It’s hard to watch a child deal with stress. Most parents’ instinct is to protect their child from anything that may cause stress. However, stress is an inevitable part of anyone’s life. Overprotecting your child won’t help your child manage stress. Instead, let your child occasionally experience minimal stress so that he or she learns how to effectively cope with it.For example, if your child is stressed as a result of losing a competition, remind him or her that it’s ok to lose. Then let your child figure out how to overcome any stress caused by the situation. This can help your child deal with future disappointments without stress.

, Social situations, schoolwork, or disabilities can contribute significantly to your child’s stress. Reducing your child’s exposure to contributing stressors may help your child manage stress. It may also minimize the risk for anxiety or depression.Talk to your child’s school about reducing homework to help your child relax and not feel overwhelmed by an inability to finish or understand assignments. If you child is experiencing bullying that causes him or her stress, ask if switching classes is a possibility.
Take similar steps at home as well. Reduce or simplify chores or help your child break them up into smaller, more manageable pieces.

, Regular exercise is a great way to manage stress for any one. It helps relieve tension in the body; provides physical fitness, which makes it easier to combat stress; and clears the mind, which can help your child relax.Encourage your child to some form of exercise every day. You may also want to exercise with your child, which can help your child get physical activity on a regular basis.


Let your child choose any exercises or physical activities that he or she enjoys. This might be running, hiking, biking, swimming, or even jumping on a small trampoline. Creative activities including dancing can also help reduce stress.
Tell your child you want to try tai chi, yoga, or qigong together. These types of low-impact relaxing exercises may be particularly effective against stress. They may also minimize the risk that stress turns into anxiety or depression., Educational professionals, including teachers and counselors, are interested in the best for child’s welfare. Keeping them informed about your child’s stress can ensure that they show your child understanding, extra love, and support. Keep in mind that educational professionals are required to keep the information about your child’s stress confidential, so you and your child shouldn’t worry about other students or parents finding out.Inform teachers, administrators, school nurses and counselors about any problems at school that contribute to your child’s stress. For example, you could say, “Mr. Salzburger, I wanted to let you know that Clementine has had considerable stress lately. Her dad and I are separating. We’re doing our best to keep it civil and let her know that we love her and this won’t change that. However, it’s a big change to our family dynamic and I would appreciate if you could be a bit more understanding with her. Her father and I are also very happy to address any issues you may see.”

, Your child may become easily overwhelmed and stressed in school situations such as intramural activities. Encouraging your child to take regular breaks can help relieve stress.Ask the teacher if your child may put his or her head on a desk in the back of the room or go to the nurse if he or she feels stressed or overwhelmed. Prepare your child for assemblies, fire drills, or other activities that may make cause stress.

, Some children who are easily stress may also have underlying conditions such as anxiety or depression. If your child is easily stressed, consider asking for your child to have an IEP. These are specifically tailored to help alleviate your child’s stress. An IEP may include:

Letting your child sit in a comfortable place.
Calling on your child when he or she is relaxed and confident.
Letting your child take tests at an alternative location.
Providing alternative homework and testing assignments.
Providing extra support when your child misses school., Telling your child that educational professionals will help him or her can provide comfort and minimize stress. Let your child know that teachers, nurses, and counselors will talk or give a little extra consideration when it comes to work and other activities or tasks.

Make sure your child knows that there is no pressure to talk or ask for help. Let your child know that the educational professionals’ doors are always open to listen to problems and give help. For example, “Oliver, I let Mrs. Lundrigan know about how much stress you’re feeling. She cares a lot about you and wants you to know that you can always talk to her and ask for help.”"

Collect your supplies.,
Prepare your daughter.,
Wash your hands thoroughly.,
Clean your daughter's genitalia.,
Put on gloves and open the collection cup.,
Collect the urine sample.,
Put the lid on the cup and label it.",How to Help a Female Child Provide a Urine Sample1," If your female child is old enough to pee while sitting on a toilet and can understand your instructions, then try the clean-catch method of collecting a urine sample. You'll need a sanitized specimen cup to collect the urine, some antibacterial wet wipes, a roll of paper towels and a pair of latex or vinyl medical gloves.Your doctor will likely supply you with a specimen cup and medical gloves so you can collect a urine sample at home. Your doctor may also supply you with special wipes for this purpose.
The wet wipes are to thoroughly clean your daughter's genitalia so no bacteria on her skin gets into her urine sample.
Paper towels are a good idea to keep on hand to wipe up any urine spills and to dry your hands after washing.;
, Explain to your daughter what you need from her and why, then ask her to tell you when she feels the need to urinate. Once she needs to go, quickly undress her from the waist down, including removing her panties so they don't get in the way. She can still wear socks and a top to keep warm, as long as the top doesn't interfere with cleaning her vagina or collecting a urine sample. Place your daughter on the toilet, with legs spread far apart and prepare to clean her.If you are able, before attempting to collect a urine sample, give your daughter a bath earlier in the day and wash her genitalia with soap and water. It's best not to rely on wet wipes entirely for cleaning.
To trigger your daughter to pee, give her lots of water or milk to drink after her bath.
So you're not in a big rush to prepare, ask your daughter to tell you when she first feels the slight need to pee, not when the feeling has become urgent.

, Once your daughter is undressed and on the toilet, wash your hands thoroughly with warm water and soap so you don't transfer any bacteria onto your daughter.Dry your hands completely with paper towels, use them as a barrier to open the wet wipe container, then toss the towels into the garbage.


Be sure to lather between your fingers, underneath your fingernails and all the way up past your wrists for at least 20 seconds.
In addition to soap and water, consider also cleaning your hands with some alcohol-based sanitizer.
Avoid touching anything, particularly your mouth or face, after you sanitize your hands and are about to clean your daughter.

, Once your daughter is straddling the toilet with legs spread far apart, ask her to lean back so you have better access to her vagina. Using your index and middle finger of one hand, gently separate her labia (the skin folds around where the urine comes out). With the other hand, take a wet wipe and clean directly over the meatus (the pee hole), using one stroke from top to bottom, then discard the wipe.The meatus is just above the opening to the vagina.


Take another antibacterial wet wipe and use it to clean within the skin folds off to one side of the meatus, then a third wipe to clean the skin folds on the opposite side.
Use only one stroke, going from top to bottom (or towards the anus), with the wet wipes before discarding them. Don't clean in a circular motion.
Don't wipe from bottom to top because you may introduce bacteria from the anus into the vaginal area.

, Once you've carefully cleaned your daughter's genitalia and disposed of the antibacterial wet wipes, wash and dry your hands again and put on the medical gloves.The gloves will prevent any transfer of bacteria to your daughter and they'll protect your hands from getting peed on. Urine is not harmful to your hands, but some parents might think it's gross or get bothered by it. Once your gloves are on, take the top of the sterilized plastic collection cup off and hold it near your daughter's urethra (pee hole).


When opening the collection cup, don't contaminate it by touching the insides of the lid or container with your fingers, even if your think they are clean.
Place the cup upside down on a clean paper towel while you're waiting to collect the urine sample.
If you don't have a sanitized collection cup from your doctor, boil a small glass jar and lid for about 10 minutes. Allow the jar and lid to air dry in a clean place before using it.

, While holding your daughter's labia apart with one hand and holding the specimen cup in the other near her urethra, tell her she can release her urine. After she has peed a small amount, position the cup directly under the stream and be careful not to touch her with the cup.Take the cup away when it's about 1/3 full (don't let it spill over) and then let her finish peeing normally if she has to.


If your daughter has any difficulty starting her stream, try turning on the water faucet to trigger her.
Collecting urine midstream (after a second or two) is recommended because the first ounce or two help flush out any debris (dead cells, protein).
Urine doesn't keep very long at room temperature, so put it in the fridge immediately after collecting it.

, Once you've collected the urine sample, place the cup on a paper towel and screw or snap the plastic lid back on tightly without touching the inside of it.Once the lid is secured, take off your gloves and wash the outside of the cup and your hands again, making sure to dry it with a clean paper towel. After the collection cup is dried, write the date, time and your daughter's name on it with a felt marker.


If you're collecting urine from your daughter at the doctor's office, then simply give the sample to the nurse or assistant.
If you're at home and unable to go directly to the doctor's office, then refrigerate the sample until you can go — don't wait more than 24 hours, or else any bacteria in the sample will proliferate.

Collect your supplies.,
Prepare your infant daughter.,
Wash your hands with sanitizer.,
Clean your infant's genitalia.,
Place the collection bag on your infant.,
Empty the bag into the sterile cup.",How to Help a Female Child Provide a Urine Sample2," If your female infant is not old enough to pee while sitting on a toilet and can't understand your instructions, then your best bet is to try the bag specimen method of collecting a urine sample. You'll need a special bag to collect the urine and a sanitized specimen cup (both provided by your doctor), as well as some antibacterial wet wipes or special wipes provided by your doctor and a bottle of hand sanitizer.


The special collection bag is a plastic bag with a sticky strip on one end, which is made to fit over your infant's genital area, but underneath their diaper.Urine infections are very difficult to diagnose from urine samples in a bag specimen because of the high risk of contamination. However, it can give your doctor a general idea of the genitourinary health of your child.

, The collection bag is meant to fit over the labia of your daughter, so she needs her clothing and diaper removed to gain access.She can still wear socks and a top to keep warm, as long as the top doesn't interfere with cleaning her vagina and attaching the collection bag. Place her on a changing table and remove her diaper and throw it away. Clean her as best you can if she's soiled herself.


Don't use any baby powder after cleaning her, as it may contaminate the urine sample.
In the morning, before trying to collect urine, give your daughter a bath and wash her genitalia thoroughly with soap and water.
After the bath, avoid overfeeding her before trying to collect a sample so she doesn't poop in her diaper and increase the chances of bacterial contamination.
Giving her lots of liquids after her bath will trigger her to pee sooner.

, Once your daughter is undressed and on the changing table, lather your hands thoroughly with alcohol-based sanitizer and let them air dry while keeping an eye on your infant to make sure she doesn't roll off the table.Once she's on the changing table, it's too risky to run to the bathroom and wash your hands with warm water and soap, so sanitizer is best.


Remember to lather underneath your fingernails and all the way up past your wrists with the sanitizer.
Apply a second squirt of sanitizer to your hands to be on the safe side, but don't use it on your infant's genitalia — it might irritate the skin, so stick with the antibacterial wet wipes.

, After you've sanitized your hands, it's time to clean your daughter's labia and the area around the opening of her urethra (meatus) more thoroughly. The meatus is just above the opening to the vagina. Using your index and middle finger of one hand, gently separate her labia. With your other hand, take an antibacterial wet wipe and clean directly over the meatus, using one stroke from top to bottom.Take a couple more wet wipes and use them to clean within the skin folds of the labia near the urethra — first one side and then the other.


Feel free to wear vinyl or latex sanitary gloves at this stage, although it's not crucial.
Wipe in only one direction, going from top to bottom (from the vagina to the anus), with the wipes before discarding them. Don't clean in a circular motion.
Wiping up from the anus may introduce bacteria into your infant's vaginal area.

, Open the small plastic collection bag and place it on your daughter. The bag is meant to be placed over the two folds of labia skin on either side of her vagina.Make sure the sticky strip adheres to her surrounding skin, then wrap her up in a fresh diaper and let her crawl or walk around.


To prevent a mess, always place a clean diaper over the collection bag so there's no leaking.
Check your daughter every hour to see if she's peed. You'll need to open the diaper and then re-close it if she hasn't
An active infant can cause the bag to move around and become unstuck, so it may take multiple tries with multiple bags to collect a sample.

, Once you've noticed your daughter has peed, wash your hands again and then carefully remove the small bag without spilling too much of the urine sample.You may want to put on gloves for this part as some of the urine may spill onto your hands. Transfer the urine from the bag to the sterilized collection cup and then throw away the bag. Fill about 1/2 to 1/3 of the cup only. Tightly fasten the cups lid and then wash any urine off it and let it air dry. Once dry, write the date, time and your daughter's name on it with a felt marker and store it in the fridge until you have a doctor's appointment.


Prior to removing the collection bag, it's a good idea to unscrew the the lid from the sterile collection cup and place it upside down on a clean paper towel.
Do not touch the inside of the sterile cup or lid when transferring the urine from the collection bag.

Talk to your child in advance.,
Leave home on time for a planned stay.,
Check with staff to make sure you have everything you need.,
Be a positive role model.,
Talk to your child about their fears and answer their questions.",How to Help Your Child Manage a Hospital Stay1," If possible, talk to your child in advance of their stay to give them an idea of what to expect and how long they could be gone. Get your child a book on going to the hospital, as many are available to help answer questions and relieve anxiety.

Let your child pack their favorite stuffed animal, blanket, or comfort object in advance, as these provide familiarity during their stay.;
, If your child has an admission time scheduled, arrive 30 minutes to an hour early, or as directed by your hospital. Neither you nor your child need the stress of running late. Your child's treatment could be affected if you are not ready at the time the hospital staff are prepared to perform any procedures. If being late causes you to feel stressed, your child will likely notice that and feel stressed also.

, Check with the hospital staff that you've got everything your child will require during their stay. Typically, a nurse will call you a couple of days prior to your stay for a pre-check, but if you are unsure you can always call again. Remember any medications your child takes, or at least a list of their medications so the hospital can supply them. Your child may need day and night clothes, their glasses, pacifier, diapers, their walking sticks or frame, CPAP machine, braces, shoes and slippers, or anything else they use on a daily or nightly basis.


If your child’s hospital stay was unplanned, ask hospital staff what your child might need overnight and in the days to come. It will help to write down a list so you can pick up what you need or ask another loved one to bring the items to you.

, Whether your child’s hospital stay is planned or unplanned, they will look to you to know how to react and respond to the situation. If you show fear and sadness about your child’s hospital stay, they will probably feel the same way. Stay calm and positive about going to the hospital.This doesn’t mean you should lie about where you are going, how long your child will be there, or what will happen. Don’t make promises you can’t keep (like, “you don’t have to stay overnight!”) because this will cause fear and mistrust for your child if it’s untrue.
Explain things honestly but in ways they can understand, for instance, “We’re going to see some doctors and you might get to stay in a special room until you feel better.”

, Give age-appropriate answers, and remember that it’s okay not to know something.Don’t make up an answer if you don’t know (again, don’t encourage doubt and mistrust) – say something like, “I don’t know right now, but everything will be okay and I’ll tell you as soon as I find out.”

Be with your child as much as possible.,
Inform staff about your child’s coping behaviors.,
Provide your child's favorite things from home.,
Get your child comfortable in their bed.,

Treat your child as normally as possible.,
Encourage your child to play.,
Give your child choices.,
Respect the privacy of older children.,
Help your child stay in touch with their friends.",How to Help Your Child Manage a Hospital Stay2," Children, especially young children under 3 years old, will probably feel afraid of being away from you.Be present with your child as much as you can. Of course, you still have to maintain your own life routine, and some hospital rules and schedules may not allow you to be present at all times. Many, though, allow a parent to stay with the child at all times, and even sleep in the room if desired.


Enlist other loving family members to visit when you’re not available. When you leave, tell your child who will be there to take care of them.
Stay overnight when you can. Your child may be more likely to worry around bedtime.When you leave, tell your child and their nurses where you are going and when you will be back. Try to stay in contact by phone as much as possible.
It’s okay to ask hospital staff if you can stay past visiting hours, but you must respect hospital regulations. If they say no, it’s for an important reason.
You can also have another family member take your place if you have to leave the hospital for awhile but do not want to leave your child alone.

, Unfortunately, you may not be able to be with your child for every minute of their hospital stay. It will help to tell their care team what usually calms them at home. For instance, say something like, “She really likes to have her blankie with her when she’s scared.” That way even when you’re not around a member of the staff may be able to provide some familiar comfort.It is also helpful to share your child’s routine with their care team, so they can maintain a normal routine as much as possible.For instance, you can tell the nursing staff when your child typically wakes up and falls asleep. Hospitals have their own schedules, but they are often flexible with children.

, Take coloring books, stuffed animals, blankets, and other favored items to your child’s hospital room. Keep them close by their bed to be easily accessible to provide comfort. Consider giving your child something of yours to hold onto when you're not able to be there.If you did not have time to bring toys from home with your child to the hospital, there will be toys there for him or her to play with, just ask.
Clearly label all of your possessions with your child’s first and last name before leaving them at the hospital.

, If your child needs another blanket, more pillows, or to have the headboard raised or lowered, simply ask a nurse or hospital aide. If they say they are too hot or too cold, let staff know – it’s important for children’s body temperatures to stay regular.


Sometimes it might be important for your child to remain in a specific position, or they need to be carefully moved to avoid hurting something further. Be sure to ask hospital staff before moving your child, and they will either tell you not to do it, instruct you on a specific way to do it, help you do it or tell you that they can be moved normally.

, Most hospitals are on a strict schedule of exactly when breakfast, lunch, and dinner are served. Remind your child this is because of visiting hours, not because the doctors are ""being mean."" If your child gets hungry between meals, call a nurse and request a snack.


Hospital food can be different than at home. Remind them it will not be the same food they usually eat, but that it’s important to eat to stay nice and strong.
You may be required to monitor exactly what your child eats and drinks.
Remember that prior to surgery, fasting is often required, sometimes requested as NPO or nothing by mouth, and your child may not be allowed to eat starting the night before. You can explain this to your child by saying something like, “Tomorrow the doctors are going to give you some medicine to help you sleep while they fix you up, and the medicine works best on an empty tummy.""
Some procedures may require your child to eat nothing by mouth for at least a day. If you know for sure what the requirement will be, tell your child, but if you don't, ask the doctor beforehand.

, As much as their condition allows, treat your child like you would at home. Stick to a daily schedule, observe household rules as much as you can, and include your child in any family discussions going on. Children can often pick up on anxiety, so stay calm and be as helpful as possible.If your child is school age, bring their homework to the hospital.

, Many children's wards have a playroom that children may use between certain hours. If you child feels up to moving around and their care team agrees, encourage them to play. This will take their mind off discomfort and anxiety, help them be a little active, and stay connected to their normal routine. This is also a valuable time to observe your child for changes in behavior – if your child is too young to tell you how they feel, whether or not they engage in their regular play activities can indicate if they feel stressed or unwell.If there’s no playroom available, be sure to bring toys, games, and books to your child’s room. Encourage playtime throughout the day to keep your child’s mind active.
Some hospitals even organize playtime; ask your nurse or Child Life Specialist about this.
If your child has had surgery, your child may be able to only walk up and down the hall. Make sure you know what your child's restrictions are by talking to the nurse before playing or taking walks

, Even if it’s as simple as a bandaid color or which arm to use to check their blood pressure, letting your child make choices when possible will help them to feel more in control of the situation. This can help them feel less afraid and more confident., Older children and teens may feel anxious about their bodies and have a strong need for privacy. Respect this as much as possible by knocking on their door before entering, being sensitive to who is around when your child is being examined or having a procedure, and asking your child if it’s okay to share information with outsiders before doing so., Older children may feel isolated and lonely in the hospital. Help them keep in touch with friends over the phone or internet so they feel more connected to their regular life and routine. You can use a smart phone with FaceTime or a similar videophone app, if you have one available.


If your child is well enough to have visitors, encourage them to ask their friends to come visit. This can really lift their spirits and be a good distraction. Remember that some hospitals have limits on the ages and number of visitors in a room at a time.

Provide physical comfort.,
Be there for your child during stressful procedures.,
Teach your child deep breathing.,
Provide distractions.,
Teach them to do guided imagery.,
Encourage play, even when they’re in pain.",How to Help Your Child Manage a Hospital Stay3," Pain might be an inevitable of your child’s hospital stay, whether it’s due to their condition or to invasive procedures that need to be done for their treatment. Providing gentle, calming touch can help ease anxiety and redirect their focus to good, rather than painful, sensations. Rock or cradle younger children, stroke their hair, or gently rub their back. Hold hands with older children and tell them to squeeze your hand as hard as they can., Starting an IV, having blood drawn, and many other procedures may be frightening and uncomfortable. Try to be present for procedures to provide comfort, and give your child a big hug afterward. Tell them that they’re brave and did a great job – positive reinforcement can make them feel less afraid of the next procedure.Do not tell your child that something won’t hurt if it will. Instead, talk to them about ways of coping with fear and discomfort. You can say something like, ""It'll probably hurt a little like a bee sting, but it will be over in just a second and because you're so brave it won't be a big deal.""

, Deep breathing relaxes the body, eases anxiety, and lessens pain.If your child is old enough to cooperate, teach them to breathe in deeply and exhale slowly. It can help to have them count during inhalation and exhalation. A good general plan is to exhale for twice as long as they inhale.


With young children, you can use a pinwheel or bubbles to get them to exhale deeply.

, Help your child redirect their thoughts and attention away from their pain and onto something else that’s more pleasant. Music, books, movies, toys, games – anything that takes their mind off the pain is helpful. The more they have to focus on the task, the better. Older children might benefit from challenges like chess, crossword puzzles, or Sudoku. Distract young children by telling them a story or singing their favorite song.Most children will likely have a TV in their room that can use when they feel well enough to watch it.

, Mimic the role of guided imagery as a relaxation technique by engaging your younger child’s imagination. Have them read or make up a story and focus on very fine details, recall their favorite TV show or movie and tell you its plotline, or have them remember in detail a time or place that they really liked.Older children can use visualization during deep breathing exercises. Tell them to imagine breathing in bright, healing light that fills up their whole body. Then imagine exhaling out feelings of tension and discomfort.

, Young children learn and grow through play, and this shouldn’t stop when they’re in the hospital. Playtime may be a much needed distraction, a way to release emotions, and will make their day feel more normal."
"
Assure your child they are not being punished.,
Introduce the medical staff to your child.,
Explain to your child that they may have to be checked regularly by a nurse or doctor.,
Request a Child Life Specialist, if available.",How to Help Your Child Manage a Hospital Stay4," It’s common for ill or injured children in the hospital to feel like they’re being punished for doing something wrong.Talk to your child and let them know that they did not do anything to “earn” or “deserve” being sick or hurt. Let them know that everyone gets sick and needs help sometimes. It may help to talk about a time that you or another loved one were in the hospital, got better, and went home happy.


Try engaging your child’s imagination in a positive way. Tell them a story about a big white castle full of magical healers who like to help people feel better. Use the names of your care team and other details from the hospital. Try to show your child that the hospital is a positive environment, not a punishment.
It may be especially challenging to convince your child that painful procedures like IV sticks and blood draws are “good for them.” Use positive language about treatment. For instance, if your child is scared of getting an IV explain that it’s medicine to make them feel better. Try using terms like “magic potion” or “all-better juice” to create positive associates with medicine.

, To your child, doctors and nurses probably just seem like strangers in scary clothes who do things that make them uncomfortable. Find out the names of your child’s staff, introduce them, and let your child ask them questions.Changing the nurse from a stranger to a person with a name, hobbies, and maybe children of their own can improve how your child relates to their care team.


This can help your child get to know the people around them and build a friendly, comforting relationship.

, It's likely that every couple of hours a healthcare professional will stop in to check on your child. They may check blood pressure, start a new IV line, or do some blood draws as ordered by your child's physician. Explain to your child that this happens to make sure they are getting better.

, Some hospitals staff a Child Life Specialist, a team member who is available to help ease the stress and fear of hospitalized children, and advocate for their needs. Find out whether this professional is available in your hospital; if so they may be a valuable asset.Many hospitals can also provide information and support for parents and family if you are feeling overwhelmed.

See your doctor.",How to Grow Taller Faster (Kids)," Food can give you the energy to get through the day, but it also helps your body grow. Getting the vitamins and minerals your body needs by eating healthy, regular meals and snacks can help you grow taller faster.Have breakfast, lunch, dinner, and two healthy snacks every day. This makes sure that your body has enough energy to get you through your day and encourages it to grow.;
, You need different vitamins and minerals to grow. You can get what you need by eating a variety of foods from the five food groups every day. The five good groups are: fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, grains and dairy every day. Make sure to choose different food options at every meal so that you get enough nutrients to grow.Select fruits and vegetables such as strawberries, blueberries, apples, broccoli, spinach, and potatoes. Lean proteins like chicken, fish, and eggs are good options to help you grow. You can get grain by eating whole wheat breads and pasta or some cereals. Dairy is found in sources like milk, cheese, yogurt, and even ice cream.
Eat two healthy snacks in between meals. Some good snack choices are low-fat string cheese, yogurt, an orange or apple slices.Healthy snacks help keep you full in between meals as well as avoid junk food.

, Create a plan for your meals each day of the week. This can help you make sure you’re getting enough vitamins and minerals to grow. Talk to your parents about doing the plan together so that you can get healthy meals at home and when you’re at school.


Write a specific plan for each meal every day. For example, you could write, “Monday: whole wheat toast with peanut butter, a cup of strawberries in Greek yogurt, and a glass of orange juice for breakfast; apple slices for a mid-morning snack; turkey sandwich, cut veggies and dip, and glass of milk for lunch; string cheese and crackers for afternoon snack; chicken breast, steamed vegetables, and salad for dinner; cup of blueberries and raspberries for dessert.”
Pack your lunch on days that the food isn’t as healthy as you would like. For example, you might want to pack a salad or sandwich on wheat bread instead of having the pizza and fries your school offers. Remember that you can have one “cheat” day a week so that you don’t crave or overindulge in your favorite foods.
Get your parents involved in your meal plans. This might include writing the plan together, cooking with your mom and dad, or even helping them grocery shop.

, Just like food, getting enough to drink helps your body grow faster. Water is the best choice. But even milk, fruit juice, and sports drinks can help you grow taller.Drink the recommended amount every day. Boys between 9 and 13 should drink 10 cups every day and girls of the same age should drink 8 cups. Boys between 14 and 18 should drink 14 cups every day and girls between those ages should have 11 cups. If you are physically active or it is very hot outside, you may need to drink more.
Eating nutritious food like fruits and vegetables can add 2-3 cups of water towards your daily total.

, Nutrition is important to your growth. Because of this, you don’t want to eat too many unhealthy foods. Foods like sweets or French fries or drinks such as soda may keep you from getting what you need to grow.Choose healthy foods whenever you can. For example, a salad instead of fries will help you grow faster and grilled chicken is better than a cheeseburger. If you choose where to go out for dinner, choose a restaurant with healthy food options instead of a fast food restaurant.

, If you eat a lot of unhealthy foods and want to grow taller, try replacing them with more healthy options. You can do this gradually so that it isn’t a shock to your system. It will also help you figure out what you like and don’t like.


Change your food and drink choices simply and gradually. For example, you could have brown rice instead of white rice or cake with fruit instead of cake with frosting. To drink, you could have sparkling water with flavor instead of soda., Tell your parents that want to eat healthier to grow taller. Ask them to help you get the nutrition you need by helping you make healthy choices and cook food. Getting your whole family involved can make everyone a bit healthier and you taller.Ask your parents if you can shop with them. You can all make decision on food and meal planning together.Make sure to include foods from all five groups., If you are worried that you’re not getting enough vitamins, you could take children’s vitamins in addition to eating a healthy diet. Always talk to your parents and doctor before taking any vitamins or other medications.Get most of your vitamins and minerals from food and drinks. This is easy if you eat a variety of healthy foods every day and get enough to drink.
Stay away from megavitamins, supplements, hormones, or anything not safe for children. These may harm your health and prevent you from growing taller.

, Just like nutrition, exercise or even just moving are important to growing taller. Playing sports or even going for a walk help build your bones and muscles, which also help you grow taller. Try and to do some type of activity every day.Do at least an hour of moderate activity every day.You could do things like running, swimming, biking, or even walking. Activities such as playing hide-and-seek, jumping on a trampoline or with a rope are other ways to get your body moving.Join a sports team or intramural club at your school. For example, if you’re not into competitive sports, participate in a group that plays a sport like volleyball or dodge ball for fun.

, As you walk or sit during the day, the bones in your spine press together. This makes you a bit shorter at the end of the day.Doing some stretches in the morning, afternoon, and evening can grow taller throughout the day.


Stand against a wall with your back against it. Raise your hands in the air as far as you can. You can also sit with your back against a wall, raising your arms and bend forward to touch your toes. Hold each stretch for 5-10 seconds and repeat 10 times.Sit on the floor and spread your legs wide apart. Bend forward at your hips and stretch your arms out to touch each of your feet. Hold the stretch for 5-10 seconds and repeat 3-4 times.
Hang from a bar or a set of rings. Try to touch your legs to the ground to make yourself taller.
Recognize that your body will be its natural height after a good night’s rest., Doing some gentle yoga can stretch out your body. Even if you’ve never done yoga, just trying one or two poses can do a lot to stretch you out and make you taller. If you do an entire yoga session, this also counts towards your daily activity. Join a local yoga class or do a yoga DVD or podcast at home.


Do a gentle form of yoga like restorative or yin yoga for the best stretching.If you can’t do a full yoga session, do downward facing dog for 10 deeps breaths. Downward dog looks like a triangle: you put your hands and feet on the floor and raise your bum in the air.

, You might really enjoy playing video games or spending time on your tablet. These types of activities don’t help you move and grow. Make a schedule of when you have down time on your computer or devices. Ask your friends to do activities that move your whole body instead of sitting around the house.


Try video games such as karaoke or Wii that get you moving.
Remember that some down time or mindless play will help you rest, which is also an important part of growing.

, How you stand can affect not only on how tall you appear, but also how tall you grow. Standing up straight and sitting in a chair with a back can make sure you stand properly and help you grow taller. They’ll also help you look taller than if you were slouching.Avoid sitting with your shoulders hunched over or forward, which can cause your spine to grow crooked. Pull your shoulders back and pull in your belly for the best posture.

, Just as moving your body is important to growing, so is giving it enough rest. Sleep helps your body recover from the day and grow better. Remember that sleeping also gets your body back to its taller self, too.Sleep between 10 and 12 hours every night. Take a short nap of 30 minutes during the day if you’re tired. You can also do a relaxing activity that doesn’t require a lot of movement or using your brain.

, Like unhealthy food, unhealthy habits can also keep you from getting taller. Drinking alcohol, taking drugs, or smoking cigarettes can keep your bones and muscles from growing properly. These habits can cause your posture to be hunched or stooped with osteoporosis as you get older.Talk to your parents, a trusted adult, or medical professional if you drink, smoke, or take drugs. These people can help you find a way to stop any of these habits, which will help you grow taller in the long run.

, Genetics play a major role in determining how tall you are. For example, if both of your parents are not very tall, you may not end up very tall. However, you may also have tall relatives that you don’t know. You may end up taller than you expected- or even taller than the rest of your family!Ask your parents and grandparents if they know how tall your ancestors were. You can also ask your siblings and parents when they grew. This can give you an idea of when you might have a growth spurt.
Remember that you have other awesome things about you other than your height. Try and focus on things such as your great hair or something that you do really well.

, If you are worried about your height, make an appointment to see your doctor. A medical professional can not only make sure that you’re growing properly, but also diagnose potential issues hindering your growth. A doctor may also be able to give you tips to grow taller faster.


Be honest with your doctor about your concerns about getting taller. Make sure your doctor knows things like what you’re eating, what activities you’re getting, and if you have any bad habits such as alcohol.
Ask any questions you have about getting taller. Your doctor may be able to reassure you that just being patient is all you need to do. Puberty affects growth and can happen at different times for different people.
Your doctor can also show you what percentile you fall into compared to your peers of the same age for height. Together, you can then use this information to discuss potential issues."

Create a plan with your child’s doctor.,
Involve your child in their own care.,
Track your child's asthma symptoms consistently.,
Record peak flow readings, if applicable.,
Use techniques to judge how well the asthma is controlled.,
Adjust asthma medications appropriately.,
Teach the child to use their inhaler properly.,
Assist your child in avoiding asthma triggers.,
Give a copy of the asthma action plan to other caregivers.,
Discuss your child’s asthma with their doctor regularly, and as needed.",How to Help a Child With Asthma1," Work with a doctor to create a customized action plan for your child.The doctor can help you understand asthma symptoms and medications. The asthma action plan you make should include at least the following:The name and dose of the child’s long-acting medications, and how often to take them.
The name and dose of the child’s short-acting rescue medication.
A list of the child’s asthma triggers, or at least a list of common asthma triggers and how to avoid them.
A system to rate severity of the child’s symptoms from normal breathing to mild symptoms to moderate symptoms to severe symptoms.
Indications for when to use rescue medication and when to contact emergency services.
Emergency contact information for the child’s doctor.;
, Sit down with your child and review their action plan with them, explaining things at an age-appropriate level. Help your child learn self-management skills to empower them and encourage them to stick to their care plan. You can use tools from the American Lung Association to determine if your child is ready to carry their own inhaler, and interactive websites for kids to learn about asthma management.For instance, you can say something like, “This is your inhaler to use every day, just like how you take a vitamin every day. If you ever really can’t breathe well, this other inhaler will help. You should always have it with you, but just use it when you need to.”
One interactive website is called ‘Lungtropolis: Where Kids with Asthma Learn to Play.’Check out a Student Readiness Assessment Tool to see how prepared your child is to manage their own care.

, Record when, how often, and the duration of when your child experiences symptoms like coughing, shortness of breath, and wheezing. Note times when symptoms interrupt school, playtime, and sleep. Keep track of how often your child uses a rescue inhaler.Use a wall chart, journal, or anything that helps you stay organized. If your child is old enough to participate, consider using an electronic system like GoogleDocs – something that you can both access and update regularly.
Note any medication side effects so you can discuss these with your child’s doctor., If your child is old enough to use a peak flow meter, they should have one and use it every day. This simple device can help indicate how well their lungs may be working; a low peak flow reading means their lungs might not be performing as well as they should be.Record peak flow readings in your records so you can correlate these measurements with symptoms you have noticed.


These readings may help you determine whether their condition is getting worse or better. If your child’s peak flow readings are decreasing, contact their doctor’s office. The doctor will assess your child, as well as any recent symptoms, to decide if a new treatment plan is needed. If the readings are increasing, they may be able to decrease their medication.

, The Asthma Control Test (ACT) is a questionnaire that measures symptoms over the course of a month. You can also use other systems to keep track of symptoms severity – the asthma plan that you and your doctor create should give you some guidelines.For example, the green-yellow-red traffic light system indicates severity of symptoms. Green means “go:” breathing is normal and peak flow is at least 80% of your child’s normal best flow reading. Yellow means “caution:” there are some symptoms like wheezing and chest tightness, and peak flow is between 50-80% of normal. Red means “danger:” symptoms are interfering with daily activities and peak flow is less than 50% of normal., Your asthma action plan should indicate when changes in symptoms require changes in medications. Many people on asthma medication, including children, will be on a long-acting inhaled medicine. Most people are also prescribed a “rescue” inhaler, a fast-acting medicine like albuterol for quick relief.As symptoms change, doses and medications may need to change as well.


Remember that some medications are used daily while others should only be used in case of emergency. You may want to label these different medications with different colors to help you and your child remember which is which.
You, your child, and your doctor should discuss your child’s asthma medications. It’s important to know which medicines to use when. For instance, it is not appropriate to use a rescue inhaler multiple times per day to “control” asthma – if your child needs their rescue inhaler that often, their asthma is not controlled and they require different long-acting medications., Many children and adults do not use their inhaler properly, and thus don’t get all of their medication. Asthma can be much better controlled if inhalers are used correctly so all the appropriate medication is delivered.


When your child receives their first inhaler, have the doctor show both of you exactly how it works. That way you can re-teach your child if they ever forget how to use it.
Metered dose inhalers, dry powder inhalers, and nebulizers are all slightly different. Check with your doctor to be sure you’re using yours properly.If your child has a metered inhaler, your doctor may recommend that they use it with a holding chamber or spacer. Make sure your child uses these as directed, as they can help the medication reach deeper into their lungs.

, What triggers asthma attacks can vary between individuals. Common triggers include mold, pollen, dust, pet dander, cold air, smoke, exercise, and infections of the lungs and upper respiratory tract.Simple things such as vacuuming and dusting while your child is not home, replacing regular pillow covers with hypoallergenic covers, and helping them to minimize their exposure to pollen can help minimize triggers.

Never smoke around a child with asthma. Tobacco smoke is a big asthma trigger.
If your child has exercise-induced asthma, be sure they always keep a rescue inhaler around when being active. Some doctors may recommend that your child use the rescue inhaler shortly before exercising to prevent problems.

, Provide a copy of the asthma action plan to your child’s teachers, school nurse, coaches, and babysitters or other caregivers.Make sure all of the caregivers know how to give your child their medicine. Also keep a copy in your purse, briefcase, or car in case an asthma attack happens away from home.


Check your child's school for its policy on asthma medications. In some schools the child is allowed to carry his or her inhaler, but in others the child must leave the medications with the school nurse.

, Discuss any questions or concerns with your child's doctor, as well as any changes in symptoms. Asthma tends to evolve over time as the child ages, so make – and keep – regular appointments with the doctor to talk about asthma symptoms and management.Bring your asthma action plan to every visit for updates and to ensure that you are tracking information accurately and using medications properly.

"
"
Use your action plan to recognize when to use rescue medications.,
Get emergency help if the child appears to have significant trouble breathing or persistent coughing or wheezing.,
Seek immediate medical attention if the peak flow meter reading is in the red zone.,
Get help immediately if their rescue inhaler doesn’t improve symptoms.,
Try to calm and comfort the child.",How to Help a Child With Asthma2," Your asthma action plan should clearly indicate when you should encourage a child to use their rescue albuterol inhaler. Whether your system uses a symptoms-severity scale or a minimum peak flow reading, know the symptoms of a full-blown attack in your child and treat it using the correct short-term medications. You can determine what caused the attack later., This can indicate an asthma emergency, which can be life-threatening. Signs that a child is having a very difficult time breathing include:Having trouble speaking without gasping
Using abdominal muscles to breathe
Having flared nostrils while inhaling
Leaning forward in a sitting position to breathe
Breathing in so hard the stomach is sucked in beneath the ribs (especially in children under age 5)Breathing faster than usual

, Your asthma action plan should indicate what level of peak flow reading indicates an asthma emergency. Anything in the red zone should prompt you to call your doctor or visit the ER. If this is accompanied by serious symptoms, you may want to call emergency services.While waiting to receive emergency care, follow your asthma action plan until you are able to get medical attention. For example, if you visit the ER, do whatever rescue procedures are listed on your plan during the drive there and while you wait to see a doctor.

, If the child uses their rescue inhaler and symptoms don’t improve, it’s probably an asthma emergency. Call for help or go find assistance immediately., Having an asthma attack or emergency can be frightening for a child, and anxiety can only make matters worse. While waiting for rescue meds to work or emergency services to arrive, try to keep the child calm. Remain calm yourself so as not to frighten the child further. Talk to them calmly, help them into a sitting position, inform them that help is on the way, and reinforce that everything will be okay.If the child is panicking, help them use their inhaler. Most children who carry an inhaler should also carry an instruction card directing how to use it."
"
Make sure your child drinks three glasses of milk per day.,
Keep in mind that non-dairy milks have less calcium.,
Feed them dairy products, leafy greens, and other calcium-rich foods.,
Consult your child’s doctor about their prescription medications.",How to Help Your Kids Avoid Broken Bones1," An eight ounce glass of milk contains a third of the 1300 mg of calcium recommended for children above age nine. Three glasses of milk a day will also ensure your child gets the recommended amount of vitamin D, the substance that makes it possible for bones to absorb calcium.Try to limit the amount of soda they drink, since soda contains no nutritional value. Some preteens and teens think drinking milk will make them gain weight, so they choose diet sodas instead. Talk to your child about choosing skim milk or other low-fat options if maintaining a healthy weight is a concern.
If your child doesn’t like milk, try to include flavored options, like chocolate or strawberry milk. However, make sure to check the calories and sugar in flavored milks and choose lower sugar and calories options whenever possible. Consider fruit smoothies containing yogurt or milk as well.
Talk to your child’s doctor about options if your child is allergic to milk. Orange juice fortified with calcium and vitamin D is a healthy option for kids who can’t drink milk or who don’t like the taste of milk.;
, Soy and rice milks, especially calcium-fortified varieties, are good alternatives if your child doesn’t like cow’s milk or is allergic. These and lactose-free milks can also offer a healthy beverage option if your child is lactose intolerant. However, it’s important to keep in mind that fortified non-dairy alternatives actually contain about half as much calcium as the value listed on nutrition labels, so you’ll have to make sure your child drinks more or consumes other calcium-rich items.This is because about half of the calcium they contain separates and deposits at the bottom of the container. Even shaking the container won’t fully resuspend the mineral.

, Make sure their diet includes yogurt, cheese, and other dairy products. Feed them a calcium-fortified cereal for breakfast. One serving of each of these items will provide about a third of your child’s recommended daily need.Leafy greens such as kale and turnip greens contain about ten percent of recommended daily need per serving.
If your kids don't like leafy greens, experiment with cereals to find a few favorites, making sure to check labels for calcium content. Try serving yogurt to dip with fruit as a snack and making cheesy mashed potatoes or meatballs to add calcium to other meals.Remember that you can rely on flavored milks or fortified orange juice if your toddler or young child is especially picky. If even chocolate milk doesn't solve pickiness issues, talk to your child's pediatrician about a daily vitamin or calcium supplement.

, Treatments for asthma can reduce bone density after long-term use, including corticosteroids such as prednisone, cortisone, and dexamethasone. Other medications that can decrease bone strength include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), methotrexate, and some anti-seizure medications, like phenytoin (Dilantin).If your child is prescribed any of these medications, make sure they consume more calcium than recommended. Talk to their doctor about how to modify their diet for their specific age and sex.
Talk to your child’s doctor about bone health if they have conditions such as Crohn’s disease, celiac disease, type 1 diabetes, and Cushing’s disease, which can each affect calcium and other nutrient absorption.

"
"
Be sure they get an hour of exercise every day.,
Get them to play outside for extra vitamin D. Human skin makes large amounts of vitamin D when exposed to direct sunlight.Without vitamin D, bones cannot absorb calcium.,
Have them wear helmets, wrist guards, and other safety equipment.,
Make sure they take safety precautions when playing sports.",How to Help Your Kids Avoid Broken Bones2," Bones, like muscles, benefit from physical exertion: making them work more makes them stronger. Weight-bearing exercises like walking, running, dancing, jump rope, basketball, and soccer are particularly beneficial for bone health.Activities like swimming and bicycling are not weight-bearing and, while great for overall health, don’t help build bone density.
Make sure your kids spend less time sitting and more time active and on their feet. A sedentary lifestyle weakens bone mass and is harmful for overall health.

, Encourage your kids to play, go for walks with them, or even simply lounge outside, especially on clear days when the sun is high in the sky.It is best to use sunscreen for most of the time that your child spends outside, but up to 10 minutes without sunscreen may help with vitamin D production.

, Provide your children with the proper equipment, and require them to use it. Do your best not to allow them to ride bikes, skateboards, or roller skates without a helmet, wrist guards, and knee and elbow pads.Safety equipment is particularly important for children under age 14, since their bones are less dense. Your teen still needs to wear protective equipment, however, even if their bones are more fully formed.
Wrist guards are especially helpful, since the majority of fractures in children occurs when they fall and try to catch themselves with their hands.

, Organized sports are a great way to maintain bone health, but can also put your child at a greater risk of injury. Choose sports that are appropriate for their size and overall health, and consult their doctor if you have any concerns about whether a particular sport is too dangerous.Always make sure they wear the proper safety equipment for their sport, including helmets, guards, and pads.
Make sure your child warms up by jogging and stretching before a hard practice or game. Talk to them about the importance of not overdoing it, and to obey their body’s limits if they feel any pain while playing. Make sure they don’t feel pressured to do more than they can.

Supervise your toddler or young child.,
Double check window and doors for safety hazards.,
Use safety gates.,
Secure rugs to floors or use non-slip pads.",How to Help Your Kids Avoid Broken Bones3," You should certainly encourage your younger child to jump, play, and practice developing their motor skills. However, avoid leaving them unsupervised, and try to remove any safety hazards from their play area.For instance, if your toddler is running around your living room, consider moving aside obstacles like a sharp-edged coffee table. Secure or remove objects that could fall and injure your child.
Try not to let them jump off furniture or do stunts that are beyond their motor skills or coordination abilities.

, Check all windows to make sure they don’t slam shut when lifted open. Install safety guards on unsafe windows to prevent broken fingers. If any doors have a hydraulic or self-closing system, make sure it’s adjusted properly to avoid slamming, and install finger-pinch guards if necessary., Install sturdy gates at the tops and bottoms of staircases. You might think about installing the bottom gate a couple steps from the bottom to provide your youngster with some stairs for practicing.Use gates to block off bathrooms, which can be slippery and are full of hard surfaces.

, Prevent your child from slipping and falling by using adhesive strips for rugs and non-slip treads on bare floors. Consider purchasing non-slip pads to place under slippery area rugs. Look especially for areas where a child might run, slip, and run into a large piece of furniture or wall hanging, such as a mirror."

Do not give laxatives without first consulting your child's doctor.If feces are blocking the intestines, it may be necessary to give the child something stronger to force it to pass, but this should be supervised by a doctor.,
Treat fecal impaction.",How to Help a Child Who Is Constipated," Children who are constipated may try to not have bowel movements if doing so causes pain. They may tighten their buttocks and contort their bodies in an effort to prevent having a bowel movement. Your child may be constipated if he or she:Has difficulty passing stool
Passes hard, dry stool with or without blood on it
Passes stool less than three times per week
Has pain while passing stool
Is nauseous
Has abdominal pain
Passes small amounts of liquid or clay-like stool. You may find this also in the child’s underwear.;
, Children in certain situations may be more likely to become constipated. These include:Not engaging in regular physical activity
Eating a low fiber diet
Frequent dehydration
Taking medications that increase the risk of constipation, such as some antidepressants
Having a medical problem with the anus or rectum
Having family members are also prone to constipation
Having neurological problems, such as cerebral palsy
Having emotional issues or new causes of stress
Having an underactive thyroid or other metabolic problem

, Most of the time, constipation does not develop complications or indicate a more serious problem. Signs of complications and serious problems include:Fever
Vomiting
Bloody stools
A distended abdomen
Weight loss
Areas where the skin around the anus has ripped open
A rectal prolapse, in which the intestines are coming out of the anus
Frequent or painful urination, which can be a sign of a urinary tract infection. This is common in children with constipation.
Poor appetite.
Severe or constant abdominal pain.

, This will help soften the stool and make it easier to pass. Water and juices are excellent for this purpose.Milk may cause constipation in some children.
Avoid giving your child caffeinated drinks like tea and coke.The amount of water children need varies based on age, activity levels, and the climates in which they live. However, if your child is tired and passes cloudy or dark urine, this indicates that he or he is dehydrated.

, Fiber will help your child produce soft stools that are easy to pass. High fiber foods include beans, whole grain breads, fruits and vegetables. The following are recommended amounts of fiber for children:Approximately 20 g of fiber per day for young children
About 29 g per day for teenage girls
Roughly 38 g per day for teenage boys

, Most are rich fruits that your child will probably readily enjoy:Prunes
Peaches
Pears
Plums
Apples
Apricots
Raspberries
Strawberries
Beans
Peas
Spinach

, These include:Milk and dairy products for some children
Carrots, squash, potatoes, bananas, and other foods with a high starch content
Highly processed foods that are high in fat, sugar, and salt, but low in fiber will also increase a child's tendency to become constipated. Those foods will make the child feel full and they are likely to pass up other, healthier, high-fiber foods.

, This will help stimulate bowel movements. Activities include:Taking your child to a playground to run around
Encouraging bike riding
Going swimming

, Suggest that your child sit on the toilet for at least 10 minutes approximately 30-60 minutes after each meal and try to have a bowel movement. You can pair this with relaxation techniques that may reduce your child’s anxiety about having painful bowel movements.Use deep breathing to help your child concentrate on relaxing his or her muscles.
Have your child imagine relaxing images or a bowel movement that isn’t painful.
Gently massage your child’s belly before he or she tries to have a bowel movement
Be supportive and reward your child for trying. You can give a small reward such as stickers or playing his or her favorite game.
Provide a stool so that your child’s knees are above his or her hips. This may make the bowel movement easier.

, Fiber supplements or stool softeners may make it less painful to have bowel movements. Though they are available over the counter, it is best to consult a doctor before giving them to a child.The doctor will recommend a dosage that is tailored to your child’s age and weight.
Common fiber supplements are Metamucil and Citrucel. These work best when your child also drinks at least a liter of water per day.
Glycerin suppositories may also help when used occasionally.

, There are a few different kinds of laxatives, including:A home remedy of mineral oil
Bulk-forming laxatives (Ispaghula husk, Methylcellulose, Sterculia) which cause the body to retain fluid and form wetter stools
Osmotic laxatives (Lactulose, Macrogols, MiraLax) which help the body pass stool by putting more liquid in the bowels
Stimulant laxatives (Senna, Bisacodyl, Sodium Picosulphate). These are used when the stools are soft enough to pass but your child’s body isn’t passing them. These medications stimulate the muscles in the digestive tract to contract and push waste along towards the end. They are generally a last resort for treating constipation in children and used only short term in most cases., If hard, dry stool has collected in the rectum, it may be necessary to do an enema or use a suppository to clear it out. These should only be done by the doctor or following a doctor's instructions.A suppository is medication that is inserted in capsule form into the anus where it dissolves and is absorbed. Bisacodyl and Glycerine are often given as a suppository.
An enema is medication in fluid form that is introduced into the large intestines via the anus. This is usually the most effective way to quickly clear out impacted stool.

Prepare the boy.,
Reassure the child.,
Make it a game.,
Minimize stress.",How to Help a Male Child Provide a Urine Sample1," If your son is old enough to understand that you need to take a urine sample, it is possible he may be uncomfortable or resistant to providing a sample. Such resistance can cause stress to the child and the parent who is trying to collect the sample, so preparing the child ahead of time can help make the test go smoothly., Tell your son that the test will not hurt or cause him any physical discomfort, and reassure him that you will be there to guide him through the test., For boys, the urine test can be turned into a game, which will make your son more comfortable and perhaps even eager to complete the test correctly.


Tell him to think of the test as target practice. Learning to urinate in the toilet is part of toilet training, so tell him that urinating into the test cup is the same thing. Come up with a fun reward for your son for when he ""hits the target"" during the urine collection.When the test is for protein in the urine, tell your son that the nurse or doctor will have to dip a special paper strip into the urine for a color test. Ask the doctor or nurse if your son can watch the strip being dipped and have your son guess what color the strip will turn., You can minimize stress for your son and for yourself if you do the following:


Come prepared. Ask when you make your son's doctor's appointment whether a urine sample will be required. This way you can try to avoid having your child urinate right before the appointment. You should also ask if the urine sample must be a ""clean catch"" (a sterile specimen) so that you can practice having your son wipe with sterile towelettes before the appointment.Explain the test to your son. Telling your son that he will have to provide a urine sample prior to the doctor's appointment and then explaining the test to him in a reassuring, calm manner will also help prepare your son. Explain that even grown-ups collect a sample of urine this way when their doctors ask them to. Assure them this is a normal test and that it is not difficult.Give your son water prior to the test. Encouraging your son to drink plenty of water before your visit to the doctor's office can help him to urinate when it is time to collect the sample.Having an empty bladder and being unable to urinate may cause your son to feel pressured or stressed during the test, so make things easier for him by getting him to drink liquids beforehand.
Simplify the test procedure. Ask the doctor's office which supplies they offer to make the collection as easy as possible. A receptacle placed in the toilet, such as a bedpan, can be simpler and more familiar for a child than catching urine in a cup.Follow your doctor's recommendations for how to simplify the test.

"

Do a clean catch.,
Prepare the test supplies.,
Wash up.,
Help your son to pull down his pants and underwear.,
Open the specimen container.,
Clean your son's urinary area.,
Have your son stand facing the toilet or urinal.He may assist by aiming at the toilet/urinal or, if he is uncircumcised, by gently holding back his foreskin (it should remain retracted until the sample has been collected).

,
Ask him to pee.,
Collect the urine.,
Remove the cup.,
Close the specimen cup.,
Help your son dress and wash his hands.",How to Help a Male Child Provide a Urine Sample2," A clean catch is also known as a mid-stream urine sample. This works best for older, toilet-trained boys who can pass urine when asked to do so. However, such boys may still need help. A clean catch involves placing a cup under the urine stream to collect the urine., Lay out a couple paper towels to provide a clean area to set the specimen cup, three sterile wipes, and the urine specimen cup. You should be able to reach the supplies easily., Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water, and have your son wash his hands with soap and water. It is important that you keep everything clean in order to avoid contaminating the urine sample.Avoid touching anything unnecessary, such as the wall, your face, etc. until after you collect the urine.
Put on rubber gloves if they are available.

, It is best to pull underwear and pants down to at least his mid-thighs to avoid getting urine on them.

, Place the lid with the flat side (outside) facing down on the paper towel. Do not touch the inside of the lid or inside of the specimen container. It is best to keep your fingers away from the rim when handling the container., You must clean your son's penis in order to prevent contamination of the urine sample.


If your son is uncircumcised, gently retract the foreskin. Ask a nurse or doctor how to do so if you are unsure. Wipe the entire surface with the sterile/alcohol towelettes provided by the doctor's office.Using the sterile wipe, stroke around the urethral opening (end of the penis) toward his stomach. Discard the wipes.Replace the foreskin once the area dries.Gently pat the tip of the penis dry with a sterile cotton swab or gauze pad.,, With the specimen cup ready, have him start urinating into the toilet. If he has difficulty, try turning on the water faucet., After your son has urinated a small amount into the toilet, position the cup under the stream.He should continue to urinate. Hold the cup close enough so that the urine doesn’t splash, but not so close that his penis touches the cup.Moving the cup into his stream while he is peeing is a bit messy, and your fingers may get wet.

, Take the cup away when it's about 1/3 full. Do not allow the cup to overflow.


Your son should finish urinating into the toilet/urinal after you have removed the cup.If the cup is even a 1/4 full and force of his stream lets up, remove the cup before he stops peeing., Place the cover tightly on the specimen cup without touching the cup rim or inside of the lid. Once it is closed, you may wipe off any urine from the outside of the cup.


Set the cup in a safe place to give to the doctor/nurse, or place it inside the special door for urine samples if there is one in the bathroom.If you are taking the sample at home, refrigerate the sample until you take it to the doctor's office., If he is uncircumcised, gently pull the foreskin forward after he has finished urinating. Help him to pull up his underwear and pants, and have him wash his hands. Wash your hands, also."

Tap your son above his bladder.,
Catch the urine in the cup and put on the lid.",How to Help a Male Child Provide a Urine Sample3," For babies who are not yet potty trained, collecting a urine sample is a bit more involved than for a toilet trained child. You will need to coax your son to urinate and then collect the urine. Start this test one hour after your son has had plenty of liquid so that he has urine in his bladder., Wash thoroughly with soap and water to prevent contaminating the urine sample., Set up your clean, sterile urine container, sterile wipes, sterile cotton swabs or gauze, and paper towels or baby wipes (in case of mess) prior to beginning the test. Make sure they are within reach and easily accessible during the test.

, Place him on his back on the changing table., Do not worry if your son has already urinated in the diaper. He may have more urine in his bladder., You must clean your son's penis in order to prevent contamination of the urine sample.


If your son is uncircumcised, gently retract the foreskin. Ask a nurse or doctor how to do so if you are unsure. Wipe the entire surface with the sterile/alcohol towelettes provided by the doctor's office.Using the sterile wipe, stroke around the urethral opening (end of the penis) toward his stomach. Discard the wipes.Replace the foreskin once the area dries.Gently pat the tip of the penis dry with a sterile cotton swab or gauze pad., Have the test cup ready. Do not allow anything other than the urine to touch the inside of the container or the lid, otherwise the urine test may be contaminated., Tap with two fingers on the center of his stomach toward the lower abdomen. This will encourage his bladder to empty. Ask if your doctor or nurse will show you where and how to tap before beginning the test.Alternate giving one tap every second for one minute, then stopping for one minute, until your son urinates or until 10 minutes have elapsed.Pay attention. The urine stream may happen very quickly, and you may miss it if you're not looking.Keep the urine cup in the hand that you're not using to tap with so that you can catch the urine as soon as it comes out.
Be patient. The average time it takes to collect urine in this way is approximately 5.5 minutes. 77% of children will produce urine within 10 minutes.If your son does not urinate within 10 minutes, stop and try again after the next feeding.

, Even if it is just a few drops, that may be enough for the test, so collect whatever you can."
"
Use a urine pad if you cannot do a clean catch.,
Wash your hands.,
Prepare your work space.,
Remove your son's diaper.,
Clean your son's urinary area.,
Position the urine pad.,
Check the pad and remove when wet.,
Use the syringe to collect urine.,
Put the urine in the cup.",How to Help a Male Child Provide a Urine Sample4," A ""clean catch"" is when you can get your son to urinate directly into a test cup. If that is not an option for your non-toilet trained son, you can also use a urine pad. Although using a urine pad has a higher risk of contaminating the urine sample, it is the next best option after a clean catch.Another option is a urine bag. Your doctor's office may provide you with one if they feel it may be helpful. This is placed inside the diaper, like the urine pad, to collect urine.

, Wash thoroughly with soap and water to prevent contaminating the urine sample., Set up your clean, sterile urine container, sterile wipes, sterile urine syringe (5 ml), urine pads, and any other supplies you might need prior to beginning the test. Make sure they are within reach and easily accessible during the test.

, Place your son on the changing table, and remove his diaper so that you can clean him and prepare him for urine collection.

, You must clean your son's penis in order to prevent contamination of the urine sample.


If your son is uncircumcised, gently retract the foreskin. Ask a nurse or doctor how to do so if you are unsure. Wipe the entire surface with the sterile/alcohol towelettes provided by the doctor's office.Using the sterile wipe, stroke around the urethral opening (end of the penis) toward his stomach. Discard the wipes.Replace the foreskin once the area dries.Gently pat the tip of the penis dry with a sterile cotton swab or gauze pad.Also wash the rest of your son's penis and bottom using soap and water or a sterile wipe.

, Turn a disposable diaper inside out and place it under your son with the outside (plastic) facing up. Place the urine pad on the outside of the diaper. Position it so that when you put the diaper on your son, the pad will cover his penis and bottom. Put the inside out diaper on your son with the urine pad inside.

, Check inside the diaper every 10 minutes until the pad is wet.


Once your son has urinated, take off the diaper and pad.
If your son has also defecated (moved his bowels), then discard the pad and start the test over again. You only want clean urine for the test.
Place the pad on a flat surface with the wet side up.

, Take your 5 ml syringe, and place its tip on the wet pad in the middle of the urine. If the urine is puddled on the pad, that is the best spot to place the syringe. Gently pull up the plunger. You will see urine slowly appear in the syringe as you suck the urine out of the pad.

, Hold the syringe over the urine testing cup. Push down the plunger so that the urine squirts into the cup.


If you need more urine, use the syringe to collect more from the pad.
When you have enough urine in the cup, put the lid on the cup.

Explain the process to your child in age-appropriate terms.,
Encourage them to ask questions.,
Assign special jobs to divert their attention.,
Let your child know if you have to leave.",How to Get Through Your Child's Hospitalization1," Honesty is the best policy when it comes to talking to kids about a hospital stay. Decide how much is appropriate to share with them without increasing their anxiety. If you are unsure, ask to speak with a social worker or child life educator on staff.

Use minimally-threatening terms they can understand. For instance, you might say, “When you went to the doctor, they noticed a lump in your tummy. We had to bring you here so the doctors and nurses can look after you and make the lump go away.”;
, Children are naturally curious, and their imaginations may run wild if you don’t fill them in. Let your child know that they are welcome to ask you any questions they may have. If they have questions, do your best to answer them as honestly as you can.For instance, you might say, “I know that is a lot to take in. Let me know if you have any questions, or if you’re worried about anything. I’m happy to listen, if you are.” Discuss their worries or fears about the hospitalization by listening and offering reassurances.
If your child asks a question and you don’t know the answer, tell them you’ll find out. It’s okay to not have all the answers.

, Avoid explaining the procedures by saying they won’t hurt. For example, it would be cruel to tell a child that it won’t hurt for the nurse to draw blood. Instead, give your child a job to do, such as “Hold very still for me, okay?” This helps them feel in control and takes their focus away from any discomfort., Your child may become anxious if they wake up and find you gone, or come back to any empty room after testing. If you need to leave the hospital, be sure to tell them (and their nurse) that you’re leaving and give them an estimate of when you might return."
"
Offer some comforts of home.,
Treat them the same way you do at home.,
Be there for your child as often as you can.,
Allow siblings to visit, if possible.",How to Get Through Your Child's Hospitalization2," Staying in the hospital wreaks havoc on their normal routine. By bringing some creature comforts from home, you might help your child adjust to hospitalization. Give them some control in what you bring by asking, “What toys do you want?” Or, “What pajamas would you like me to pack?”


Watch favorite TV shows, read books at bedtime, or bring along a favorite stuffed animal to help them sleep., If you typically don’t let your child stay up past midnight watching TV, don’t allow this at the hospital. You may be tempted to indulge a sick child, but you’ll have to break these habits all over again upon their discharge. Setting limits helps the child get the same sense of structure they get at home.Also, maintaining consistency with parenting helps your child feel at ease. Failing to parent as usual may send the message that the problem is bigger than you’re letting on.

, Your presence during this process is important to your child’s sense of security. Try to be there for them as much as you can. Staying overnight is also recommended, especially if your child is quite young.Spend time together like you normally would. Talk to them about the pictures they draw or books they read.

, If your child is in a hospital unit that allows younger visitors, consider letting their siblings come for a visit. Just seeing one another for a short period of time may help your child and their siblings relax about the hospitalization. Visits from friendly faces also help your child stay connected to the outside world."
"
Share your feelings with someone you trust.,
See if family or friends can help with chauffeur duties.,
Explain the situation to your other children’s teachers.",How to Get Through Your Child's Hospitalization3," You may be trying to keep a strong demeanor in front of your child, but you are likely experiencing a range of emotions. It’s unhealthy to keep all those feelings under lock and key. Turn to someone you trust for a listening ear and needed support.

This might be a best friend, a sibling, a parent, or your spouse. You might say something along the lines of, “I could really use someone to talk to who’s not a medical professional. Do you mind?”

, Other obligations still need handling despite the stress of your child’s hospitalization. If you have other children, make arrangements with neighbors, family, or friends so that you won’t have to run back and forth from the hospital for school drop-offs and pickups.You might also need someone to prepare meals and snacks for your other children, or bring you meals at the hospital.

, Your other children may struggle with the disruption to their normal routine, or with missing their sibling. Alert their teachers to the situation so they can be on the lookout for any crying outbursts or other abnormal behavior.It’s common to inform the sick child’s teacher, but other kids may have to miss school or fall behind on assignments due to a sibling's hospitalization, too.

"
"
Stay informed.,
Keep a positive outlook.,
Get as much rest as you can.",How to Get Through Your Child's Hospitalization4," Being in the know about your child’s medical care can help keep your imagination in check. If you don’t have answers about their condition or different procedures, it’s easy to let your mind wander. Put your mind at ease by staying updated with their medical care team. Ask questions about any procedures you don’t understand.Staying in the loop about their care can help you feel more in control and keep stress at bay.
No one knows your child better than you. So, don’t hesitate to offer your insights about your child’s status to their doctors and nurses, too.

, Parents are trained to fear and prepare for the worst. But such a perspective won’t help you get through your child’s hospitalization. Try to maintain a positive outlook, especially when in the presence of your child.You can keep your attitude positive by not giving in to fear or negative thinking. If you catch yourself worrying or catastrophizing, immediately find a task to distract yourself, either by reading a book to your child or engaging in a spiritual ritual.

, Regular sleep is essential during stressful times like a child’s hospitalization. Aim to sleep as much as you can. Doing so can help relieve stress and tension, and equip you to make tough medical decisions. Many hospitals offer special suites for families staying overnight. If you use a suite, bring comforts from home that can help you sleep better.You might also alternate overnight shifts with your spouse, co-parent, or a relative. That way, you can sleep a few nights at home in your own bed without your leaving your child alone.

Remember that relapse isn’t total failure.",How to Prevent Drug Addiction Relapse," Behavior therapy is often used when treating people with drug addictions. Therapy for addiction prevention often involves identifying thoughts and behaviors that contribute to drug use and modifying or changing them to be more positive and productive. You may learn skills to increase your ability to cope with stress and cravings.Find a therapist you trust and with whom you feel comfortable sharing your thoughts and feelings.;
, Part of some people’s treatment includes medication. Medication can be used to help treat withdrawal symptoms, stave off cravings, and to treat other existing disorders.When taking medications to help with treatment and prevention, use as directed. Do not take more or less than prescribed.


Talk with your prescriber about your drug use history prior to obtaining medication. Avoid or use extreme caution with prescription drugs that can become addictive.If you have any questions or concerns about medication, talk to your prescriber., For many, a support group can be hugely beneficial in aiding recovery. Meeting with other people who have endured similar experiences as you can feel helpful and supportive. Among the group, people can share their experiences, personal ways they have prevented relapse, and provide guidance to those struggling.Many groups exist to assist people with recovery, including Secular Organizations for Sobriety, SMART Recovery, Narcotics Anonymous, Cocaine Anonymous, Crystal Meth Anonymous, Marijuana Anonymous, and Dual Recovery Anonymous.

, If you’ve experienced long-term drug use, a good option may be to attend a treatment program. These programs can help you cope with withdrawal symptoms and provide medical and psychological support and counseling. Many programs offer aftercare once you’ve completed treatment. This includes referrals to recovery services and support groups in the community. They should also create a discharge plan for you once you’re ready to leave.Look for a program accredited by the state with licensed mental health professionals and addiction specialists.

, You may find yourself thinking back to “the good ‘ol days” of using, having fun, and going to parties. Instead, remember why you got sober. There came a point where the use was no longer fun and instead interfered with living a happy life. Remember the problems you had: personal, relational, financial, health, and professional life. Remember how these things suffered.Write down things that make you happy in your sober life. Reflect on this list when you need a reminder of why you choose to be sober.

, You may want to prove to yourself that you can be in situations or events without using. Maybe you want to go to events or parties you’ve enjoyed and convinced yourself that you can enjoy it and have fun without drugs. This is especially dangerous if you are recently out of recovery. While you may be able to avoid the first time, it’s a dangerous trap to think you can be around drugs and not use. Avoid physical and emotional triggers of drugs and past drug use.Avoid places you know will have drugs. Don’t try to rationalize with yourself. You know that the risk of relapse is high, so it’s best to avoid these situations.

, You may miss your friends, but use caution in connecting with using friends. Part of prevention is choosing to create new friendships and avoiding tempting situations. Avoid people who want you to continue using or people who encourage you to go to environments where there’s known drug use.You may need to discontinue friendships with these people. Take them out of your address book and remove them from social media accounts. Safeguard yourself against possible temptations the people in your life may provide.

, Major life stressors can include personal injury, loss of a loved one, moving, changes in marital status, and changes in employment or financial situation.You may even feel triggered if you feel especially bored in life. Be aware of any major life stressors and get help right away.


Find new ways to manage your stress. Go for a walk or jog, put on some calming music, visualize a calm and peaceful place, or engage in meditation., If you’re starting to slip back into using, have a relapse prevention plan ready. Creating a relapse plan isn’t jinxing your treatment or prevention, it’s safeguarding your future. You may authorize people to take you to treatment, accompany you to support group meetings, or be in contact with your therapist. Involve people in your plan that you can rely on and that support your success in treating drug addiction.Create a detailed plan of action if relapse is occurring. Say who will be involved, what their involvement is, and what specific steps will be made.

, Stress is likely to cause a relapse if it gets out of control.By developing some healthy stress reduction techniques, you may be able to prevent a relapse during periods of high stress. Try to learn at least one stress reduction technique that you can use to reduce stress daily and during periods of high stress as well. Some good stress reduction techniques include:Deep breathing exercises.

Progressive muscle relaxation.

Meditation.

Yoga.

, Health problems can trigger drug use. Stay on top of regular medical appointments, be consistent with any prescribed medications, and live a healthy lifestyle. Prioritize your health and take care of your body.


Get adequate sleep, exercise regularly, and adopt healthy eating habits. When you feel good, you’re less likely to use., Surround yourself with friends who do not use. Engage in healthy friendships with people who support you and your recovery.Find people to do activities with that do not include substances. Pick up a new hobby and meet people who also enjoy doing similar things as you do.


Join a sports league, a board game club, or a hiking group.

, Notice periods where you feel depression, anxiety, sadness, grief, rejection, hurt, or other triggering feelings. In the past, you may have turned to drugs to help alleviate the pain. Now, stay aware of these feelings yet approach them differently. Acknowledge the emotions you have and approach them differently.Remind yourself that the pain is temporary, as is substance use. Your problems still exist even once the drugs wear off. Approach your emotions in curiosity, kindness, and acceptance.

Learn the signs of internet addiction in children.",How to Overcome Internet Addiction," Make a list of activities you used to enjoy or need to take on but can’t because of all of the time you’ve been spending online. This isn’t meant to make you feel bad, but rather to provide motivation for cutting down on your Internet usage., Unlike some addictions, total abstinence may not be the answer for Internet addiction, since the Internet is used for so many purposes in daily life. However, you can and should decide on an appropriate amount of time to set aside for personal Internet usage.Omit any time that you must use the Internet strictly for work, business, or school.
Make a list of all of the other obligations you have and desired uses of your time, such as sleeping, time spent with friends and/or family, exercise, commuting, working or studying, etc.
Determine how much time per week you would ideally devote to these needs.
Consider how much time you have left per week, how much time you want to set aside for relaxing or personal use. From the remaining time, set aside an appropriate number of hours for personal Internet use. You can then apply this information to other methods to cut back on the time you spend online.

, If Internet usage is taking up too much of your time, you can block the problem by filling your schedule with alternative activities.Disrupting your schedule with neutral activities can break the habit.For example, if you find yourself compulsively browsing online at home every evening, change your schedule so that during that time you go to the grocery store, clean your house, or some other activity that will keep you away from your computer.

, Having someone or something interrupt your Internet use can be very effective. Since the stopper is external, it will take some of the pressure off of you, and it can also lead you to fill your time with alternative activities.You can set an alarm clock to go off at a certain point when you think you should get offline.It might be difficult at first, but stick to the goal.
Plan necessary activities or events so that they will prevent you from being online. For instance, if you know you tend to start browsing aimlessly in the afternoons, schedule important meetings and appointments for that time.
There are a variety of apps you can use to cut back on your Internet use.For instance, some of them work by shutting down Internet capabilities for a predetermined period.

, Internet addiction can be curtailed if online activities are put in perspective in comparison with the rest of your life. Make a list of all the offline things you want to or need to do, and rank them in importance relative to time spend online.For example, you may decide that you want to get around to that book you’ve been meaning to read rather than spend another hour shopping online for things you really don’t need or want.
Prioritize offline versions of activities over online ones. For instance, set a goal of spending more time with friends in person instead of interacting with them via social media.
You can also set priority tasks that you want to do prior to spending any personal time online. For instance, tell yourself that you will spend the weekend cleaning out the garage before getting online.

, If you know that you spend a significant amount of time on a particular kind of Internet usage, you may want to cut it out entirely.Internet games, social media, gambling, and shopping are common culprits, but any kind of Internet use can become problematic.

, Creating visual reminders your Internet addiction and your determination to stop it can be a powerful way of cutting back time spent online.Using an index card or sticky note, write down messages for yourself and leave them in obvious places (like on or near your computer, on your refrigerator, on your desk, etc.) or carry them around. Try messages like:


“Playing X game is taking away time I could spend with friends.”
“I’m not happy when I spend all night online.”
“I won’t take my laptop to bed tonight.”

, Getting enough exercise is has many benefits. Regular exercise can help keep you healthy, boost your mood, make you more self-confident, sleep better, and much more. If you are struggling with Internet addiction, exercise will also serve as a good alternative use of your time., Awareness of Internet addiction is growing, and there are now sources for help in many locations. Support groups for Internet addicts can provide an understanding community, strategies for successfully overcoming your problem, and information about additional sources of help.Check with a local community center or ask a trusted person, such as a family member or doctor, to help you find a support group in your area.

, Professional assistance from a specialist trained in treating Internet addiction is helpful in many cases.A counselor can help you develop a plan of action for reducing the time you spend online, increasing your involvement in other activities, and understanding the habits or motivations that caused you to become addicted to the Internet. Support groups or a doctor may be able to refer you to a counselor.


Motivational interviewing and reality therapy are techniques sometimes used by counselors to treat Internet addiction.These methods involve a therapist providing open-ended questions, reflective listening, and other techniques to help you understand your problem better.

, Internet addiction can have detrimental effects on both you and your family, depending on your situation. If this is the case, family therapy can help both sides understand and deal with the problem. Family members can also provide emotional and practical support to help you overcome your addiction.Counselors can help you develop a strategy for family therapy, or refer you to a specialist in the field.

, As recognition of Internet addiction grows, addiction treatment centers have begun to develop programs to help those afflicted with the problem. In addition, there “digital detox” camps are available in some areas. These provide an Internet-free space to reflect and learn to overcome addiction to the Internet., Specialists are still studying the causes of and treatment methods for Internet addiction. There is still no universally accepted drug treatment for the problem. However, medications such as escitalopram, bupropion SR, methylphenidate, and naltrexone have been used to treat Internet addiction in some trials.Talk with your doctor if you are interested in trying medications to treat your addiction.

, Some amount of time spent online is common in much of the world. Internet addiction, however, implies spending more time online than is needed for work, school, or a healthy personal life. You can start to think about whether you are addicted to the Internet by recording the number of hours you spend online each week as well as the impact that time has on other activities in your life. Too much time online might cause you to:Be online longer than you intended. Checking your email, for instance, turns into hours of browsing.
Think about being online even when you are doing other activities.
Need to use the internet more and more just to have the same level of satisfaction or enjoyment

, Using the Internet too much can cause a variety of emotional problems. If you notice any of the following, you may have Internet addiction:Feeling restless, angry, irritable, etc. when you don’t have as much time online or try to cut back.
Using time online to escape or to relieve an emotional problem.
Getting online instead of other activities you need to do or used to enjoy.
Feelings of guilt, shame, or disgust due to time spent online.
Inability to cut back after repeated attempts.

, Internet addiction can cause a variety of physical problems. However, these symptoms might not appear suddenly, or be obviously connected to being online. Significant problems caused by the addiction might include:Weight gain
Weight loss
Headaches
Backaches
Carpal tunnel syndrome
Neglecting sleep to get online

, In addition to harming you emotionally and/or physically, Internet addiction can have detrimental effects on your personal and professional relationships. Signs that you might have a problem include include:Loss of a job or poor work performance due to time spent on the Internet
Decreasing performance at school
Trouble in a personal relationship (fighting because of time spent online, for instance)
A relationship has ended because of your Internet usage
Lying to others (significant others, family, coworkers, etc.) about your Internet usage
Neglecting time with family or friends in order to be online

, Because the Internet is so readily available in many areas and at many ages, all kinds of people can become addicted, including children. Parents or guardians have the ability to help control a child’s Internet use, however, so treatment is possible, especially when a specialist is consulted. Signs a child may have Internet addiction include:Sneaking around to get online
Lying about time spent online
Anger or irritability when electronic devices or Internet privileges are taken away
A strong desire to get back online as soon as possible
Staying up all night to be online
Refusing or forgetting to do chores, homework, or other tasks
Forming new bonds with people online (especially when offline relationships deteriorate)
Loss of interest in activities the child previously enjoyed

Decide you really want to stop this behaviour.,
Make a list of all the reasons you want to stop the addictive behaviour.,
Take your list and alter it so that every benefit of giving up your addiction is written in the POSITIVE, not the negative.,
Take your new list and go to a nice quiet spot (without TVs or other people around).,
In your peaceful place, take your list and begin to say, ""Here I am in this wonderful place, and I am not smoking.,
Continue with this practice all the way down your list.",How to Overcome an Addiction Using a Guided Meditation," If you are not sure about whether you really want to stop, you probably won't. But, if you genuinely feel and think you are ready, then go to step 2.;
, For example, if you want to quit smoking, your list might be: i. I will smell better, ii. I will have more money, iii. I will feel more energetic and healthy, iv. I will know I have overcome something that was harming me, v. My mood will get better. etc. If you want to stop gambling, your list may be: i. I will have more money. ii. I will stop feeling guilty after losing money. iii. My relationships with my friends and family will improve. iv. I will feel powerful for overcoming this affliction.

, For example, if you want to quit smoking so that you will NOT smell bad, rewrite your list to say ""I want to quit smoking so that I will smell fresh and clean"". Or if you said you want to quit drinking because you DON'T LIKE feeling depressed and hung over all the time, rewrite this to say that you will feel much more energetic, peaceful, and healthy. Write your reasons for giving up the addiction in how you will feel, not how you won't feel.

, Take a few deep breaths and relax. Listen to the sounds around you and let yourself feel however you feel for a few moments. Don't be too hard on yourself. Begin to visualize a ""peaceful place"". This is a nice, calm, peaceful place such as on the beach or on a warm calm hillside with the winds in your face and the soft ocean sounds all around. Pick the spot that is right for you. Just keep visualizing that peaceful place, and really allow yourself to go into it fully. Use all your senses to go into it as deeply as you can. You may feel the soft sand under your legs, or the warm smell of the fresh air outside. The soft sun rays may warm your skin and make you feel safe and secure. Go deeply into your peaceful place.

, I am feeling peaceful and relaxed, and I smell fresh and good. Here I am in this peaceful place, free from my addiction to cigarettes, and I am happy because I have so much more money to spend on my family and my future. Here I am, in this peaceful place, and I am enjoying all the energy and balance since quitting smoking."" And so on down your list. ""Here I am in my peaceful place, and I am free of my dependency on ____________ (insert addiction), and I am feeling so good because ____________________ (insert item from your list).""

, You can do this many times, if you like. Perhaps every evening before bed.

Think about which aspects of your electronic uses you need to change.,
Brainstorm what the addiction is doing to your life.,
Decide on your limits.,
Write down your ""rules,"" if desired.,
Follow your plan.,
Find alternative activities to fill your time.,
Don' be too hard on yourself.",How to Overcome an Addiction to Electronics," Before you can stop using any electronic device(s), it is important that you can identify what electronic device(s) you do not want to use for a while.;
, Once you are able to identify the electrical device(s) that you want to stop using, you should reflect on how the device has impacted your life negatively. This can be done by making a list of what opportunities you missed because of the amount of time and energy you extended on the electronic device.


Making a list helps you to realize the amount of time that you have spend on the electronic device; this allows you to realize how much time and energy you have extended onto the electronic device(s). It is by understanding this that will help to motivate you to come up with a plan to replace the energy and time that you have wasted on the electronic device and to use the time and energy more productively to get other things done.

, If you need for some reason to go ""cold turkey"" and quit using one or more electronic devices for good, then the limits are simple. However, chances are you'll need to use some electronics in life, especially for work or school, so quitting altogether isn't an option. Assuming you're going to keep using some such devices, decide on a daily limit.


You can base your limit on time used on particular devices, or on which tasks you're going to let yourself do. For example, you might decide only to use the computer for one hour a day, or you might decide only to use it on homework or workplace tasks, but not for any recreational activities.

, Often, seeing something set as a list of rules or a schedule in front of you can help you stick to it. Putting it in writing confirms your plan. You might also share it with a friend or loved one who can hold you accountable for sticking to it.

, Allow yourself the allotted electronic use, without guilt, but stick to your rules. When you hit your limits, move on to something else and stay away from the electronics in question.


If you have set time limits for yourself, consider using timers and alarm clocks to help you stick to them. Otherwise, you might lose track of time and unintentionally break your new rules.
It might help you avoid temptation to actually physically remove the electronics from your view. Ask a parent, roommate, or friend to keep your gaming system or tablet away from you until your next time for use. Alternatively, remove the power chords and any batteries and stow them out of sight, where you'd have to actively go and get them in order to break your plan.

, There are plenty of non-electronic activities you can pursue in life!


Try hanging with your loved ones. Your family is your first priority, before electronics. Go see your parents; parents are good company usually. Or, see that movie you've been dying to see with your friends, or go out and have fun at the clubs!
Work out! Try a gym, or even at-home workouts. There are many workouts out there that are fun and easy, this will distract you.

Get a job. Some jobs may be boring, but then you have time to kill. You don't need some fancy job if you're a teen; work somewhere simple and interesting. Plus, it can get you college money.
Read a book. You may be surprised how engaging a great storyline or interesting nonfiction piece can be.
If all else fails, try a vacation. Go to the beach or some place you have always wanted to go to.

, Setting limits and sticking to them is key to overcoming your electronic overuse. However, you're only human, and the whole world uses electronics on a daily basis these days. Do what you feel is right for you, but don't beat yourself up about a regular amount of screen time.


If you really feel you have an addiction that is interfering with your relationships and responsibilities, consider seeking help. There are therapists who specialize in addictions of all kinds, as well as in-person and online support groups (as ironic as it sounds to attend an online support group for an addiction to electronics, these groups can still help you through such an addiction, depending on what kind of electronics you're addicted to).

Stay focused on your goal.,
Celebrate your accomplishments.",How to Overcome Sexual Addiction," A sex addiction is not the same as having a vigorous sex drive. You might have a sexual addiction if you exhibit persistent, escalating patterns of sexual behavior despite increasing negative consequences for yourself and others.The high that you feel from sex occupies your mind constantly. You always are looking for your next chance to feel that pleasure.Examples include persons who spend half their income on prostitutes or business people who watch pornography at work despite warnings that they will lose their jobs. This preoccupation with sex leaves less room in your life for healthy relationships and other interests. Anyone can have a sex addiction, no matter his/her gender, sexuality, or relationship status.The following signs indicate a possible sex addiction:


Seeking extramarital affairsUsing compulsive sexual behavior as an escape from loneliness, depression, anxiety or stressThinking about sex to the exclusion of other interests and occupations
Using pornography excessively
Masturbating frequently, especially in inappropriate situations such as while at work
Having sex with prostitutes
Sexually harassing other people
Having unprotected sex with strangers that could lead to sexually transmitted diseases (STD)s. If you are unsure whether you have an STD, get tested right away. If you are in a relationship, your partner should get tested as well.;
, For some people with hypersexual disorder or a sex addiction, they can treat their condition on their own through lifestyle changes. Ask yourself: can you manage your sexual impulses? Are you distressed by your sexual behaviors? Is your sexual behavior harming your relationships and work life, or leading to negative consequences like arrest? Do you try to hide your sexual behavior? If you feel your condition is leading to negative consequences, seek help.Risky sexual behavior is a hallmark of Borderline Personality Disorder, which the DSM-5 recognizes, and is treatable through therapy and sometimes medication.Get help immediately if you might harm yourself or others, have bipolar disorder, or are suicidal., Ask your family practitioner for a recommendation of someone who specializes in sex addiction. Psychologists, psychiatrists, marriage and family therapists, or licensed clinical social workers are all potential options. It is preferable to find someone who has experience helping people work through sex addiction. Hypersexual behavior can appear similar to behavior associated with impulse-control or substance-use disorders. Still, it is unclear whether the brain operates the same way with hypersexual disorder as it does with substance addiction.Thus, rather than finding someone who works on substance addiction, look for a specialist on hypersexual disorder.


If you are in a committed partnership, marriage and family therapists can help both you and your partner.

, Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment method.CBT is a short-term, goal-oriented psychotherapy treatment, which utilizes a hands-on, practical approach to problem-solving. In CBT, you work with your therapist to change patterns of thinking or behavior with the goal of changing the way you feel.Your therapist might also prescribe medication. For example, anti-depressants curb compulsive sex behavior. Common examples are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) including fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil), or sertraline (Zoloft). Your therapist also might prescribe anti-androgens, mood stabilizers, or another drug.An experienced therapist can help you handle the intricacies of your situation. As societal acceptance of sexual addictions varies, your therapist can help you navigate your relationships and overcome any shame you might feel., Focus on the positive benefits of treatment. Remember that your therapist is there to help you. It is her job not to judge you or make you feel ""bad"" about your compulsions. Finding a therapist you feel comfortable with and who you feel like you can trust is essential for recovery.


If you're having trouble because you feel embarrassed, consider therapy like any other form of treatment.If you had a physical illness, you'd see a doctor. If you had a cavity, you'd see a dentist. You probably wouldn't be embarrassed or ashamed about seeking those treatments. Remind yourself that you are seeking help to make your life healthier and happier, and that's a sign of courage and belief in yourself that is admirable.
Remember you are not alone. Many people struggle with hypersexual disorder. Mental health providers are discreet and understanding. They will keep your information confidential unless you report that you will hurt yourself or another, report the sexual abuse of a child, or report abuse or neglect of someone in a vulnerable population (e.g. elderly or underage)., Quitting a sex addiction can be a lonely endeavor. Even though your previous sexual activity might have lacked an emotional connection, you might miss the physical closeness. Spending time with loved ones will help you remember why you are quitting and commit to stop.


You might have loved ones who do not understand sex addiction or who are angry with you for your past behavior. These feelings are normal. Try to find a few people who can understand your struggle and help you be successful. Do not spend too much time with critical people.

, Whether you want a structured 12-step program, a faith-based program, or a hotline you can call, it is a good idea to connect with other patients. Look for groups online or ask your doctor for recommendations. Examples include The Society for the Advancement of Sexual Health, Sex Addicts Anonymous (12-step program), and COSA, formerly an acronym for Codependents of Sex Addicts. COSA can help your family with their recovery., To begin your personal recovery, consider journaling about your addiction. Think about how sex addiction has affected your family, your personal relationships, and other areas of your life. Describe how your addiction has impacted your mental and physical health. Your writing can serve as a reminder of the negative aspects of your addiction and give you extra incentives to move forward.

, Once you have detailed your problems, write how you would like your life to look post-addiction. What positive changes will come once you gain control? For example, you might:


Feel a new sense of freedom.
Care about things besides sex and spend more time on things you love.
Concentrate on forming deeper bonds with people.
Repair your relationships.
Feel proud about being able to overcome an addiction.

, Your mission statement is a summary of the reasons you are fighting your addiction. It is a personal commitment to quitting. Having a list of reasons will serve as a reminder when you feel like faltering. You know your reasons for wanting to quit and you can overcome the mental and physical hurdles. Here are a few reasons:


I am quitting because I want to repair my relationship with my partner and move back to my family.
I am quitting because I contracted an STD and know I need to make better choices.
I am quitting because I want to set a good example for my children.

, Create a schedule for your recovery. Include goals like attending therapy or joining a support group. Although your recovery might take more or less time than planned, having achievable goals will direct your steps. Schedule your therapy appointments. Plan when you will join a support group. Decide when to have conversations with people you have hurt.

, If you are surrounded by items that remind you of sex, it will be harder to quit. Dispose of or recycle pornographic magazines, pictures, videos, and anything else that puts you at risk of backsliding. Delete porn from your computer, and clear your history of sites you formerly visited. Consider installing software that blocks pornography sites., Stay away from red light districts and do not visit sex shops. If your friends want to go out in these areas, ask them to go somewhere else with you.Certain situations might trigger addictive behavior. For example, maybe you have one-night stands when you travel for work. Figure out a way to prevent yourself from doing this. Travel with a colleague or try to stay with a platonic friend instead of alone at a hotel.

, Delete numbers and names of former sexual partners from your phone, computer, and any other devices. Having a list of people willing to have sex could be tempting when you crave sex. Notify regular partners that you will no longer be seeking relations with them. Be sensitive to their feelings but do not waver in your commitment to stop.


You of course can retain the information of your committed partner or spouse.

, When you stop doing addictive sexual activities, you might have excess energy. Try healthy activities like exercising or other forms of recreation.If one activity is not stimulating enough, try something else. Keep searching for ways to keep yourself occupied. Here are a few ideas:


Write daily in your journal.
Take music lessons or join a choir or band.
Take an art class or draw, paint, or sculpt at home.
Take up a new hobby that requires physical exertion, such as woodworking.
Try stress reduction activities like yoga or tai chi.Do activities that get your heart racing like caving or parachuting.

, As you disengage from addictive behaviors, reengage with loved ones. Your partner, best friends, children, parents, and siblings can support you. Focus on repairing relationships that need to be fixed and nurturing those that have faltered. The more you invest in people around you, the less you will need sex as an escape mechanism.

, Overcoming sexual addiction doesn't mean you must stop having sex forever. Instead, it means that you don't allow compulsive behaviors to control you. You feel in charge of your sexual behaviors, and happy and fulfilled by them instead of guilty or ashamed.


Your therapist can help you work toward this. You may even find that a therapist with specific training in sexual health issues can be useful in teaching you ways to develop a healthy attitude toward sex.
Explore what you like about sex. When you're addicted to sex, you may do things that you don't even really enjoy doing because they feed your compulsion. Take some time to explore what you actually enjoy about sex. What makes you feel valued as a sexual partner? What feelings do you enjoy inspiring in others?Try to consider sex as a part of a healthy life, rather than its own ""forbidden fruit"" or something to hide or be ashamed of. Someone with a problem overeating won't simply stop eating food; similarly, you do not have to simply stop having sex. You just want to learn a healthier way of integrating it into your overall life., Recovery will take time. You probably will experience cravings for addictive sex. It is fine to have sex with an intimate partner, but having a one-night stand or watching porn could return your addiction. Be open with your therapist and family about your struggles. Keep your mission statement in mind and remember you can repair damaged relationships and fix financial problems.If you relapse, reflect on what went wrong. Try to avoid the triggers that caused the relapse. Overall, do not give up. Keep pushing forward.


If you relapse, review your journal. Read your mission statement and remind yourself why you want to recover. Stay fully engaged in therapy and your support group.

, After you accomplish some of your goals, take time to celebrate how far you have come. If you go a month without exhibiting addictive behavior, acknowledge your achievement with a treat. For example, visit a favorite restaurant, tour a museum, or purchase a new clothing item. Celebrate how far you have come. Set a new goal to work towards.

Handle relapses delicately.",How to Overcome an Addiction to Porn As a Teenager," Is your use of porn relatively normal or getting into serious addiction territory? Look for these signs and symptoms to get a clearer sense of how much porn dominates your everyday life:You cannot stop watching porn or doing behaviors associated with porn, despite attempting to leave them behind.
You feel angry or irritable if you are asked to stop using porn (even when you ask yourself).
You keep all or part of your porn use secret from family and friends.
You feel like you lead a double life because of your hidden porn use.
You continue to view porn despite negative consequences, such as suffering relationships or trouble in school.
You have lost track of large chunks of time because you've been absorbed in porn use.;
, To better understand what you're going through, learn what could be at stake. It can be easy to convince yourself that everybody watches porn and that maybe you don't have a problem after all. Knowing the following potential effects of porn addiction shows you the real dangers of the problem:Broken or troubled intimate relationships
Difficulty staying interested in relationships and dating prospects
Feelings of shame and/or guilt
Problems with work or school, like dropping grades
High risk of engaging in dangerous or unhealthy sexual activity, with an increased risk of sexually transmitted diseases
Eventual inability to become aroused in non-pornographic situations

, Because the addiction involves lewd material, you might be tempted to think of yourself as impure, perverted, or morally in the wrong for having ever developed the problem in the first place. However, adding blame and guilt to the mix will only make it more difficult to find the confidence needed to resist temptation and throw yourself into other activities.


Popular methods like pinching yourself every time you look at porn will create a forbidden fruit effect which makes it all the more difficult to give porn up.What’s more, you’ll come to have negative associations with your own sexuality, which can make getting to the root problems of the porn addiction more complicated.

, A trigger is anything that makes you feel like you want to watch porn.A trigger could be a certain moment in your routine, like getting ready to go to sleep, or it could be a pop-up ad of a scantily clad actor. Knowing your triggers is important because you will learn when to ramp up your efforts not to watch. You can then replace watching with something that will successfully divert your attention until the urge goes away on its own.


For example, if you see an ad that makes you want to watch porn, train yourself to play a round of your favorite video game instead. You may not be able to avoid the ad entirely, but you can begin to replace porn with a less harmful habit.
After a while you may not need to take such strong efforts to avoid certain triggers or rigidly replace porn watching with the same alternative behavior every time. When you’re trying to kick the habit initially, though, be very diligent about diverting yourself in moments of temptation.
If there are triggers you can avoid entirely, you may want to do so. This could make the initial decrease in use easier. Just be careful that you don’t spend so much time avoiding, say, certain music or friends that get you in the mood to watch. If you try to let these triggers back into your life after intense avoidance of them, you run the risk of relapsing into porn use., As an alternative to stopping ""cold turkey"", you might decide to ease yourself into less or no porn use. Make goals for certain periods of time based on whether you want to stop watching altogether or become a more moderate viewer.Doing this will help the transition happen more smoothly, as you will only have to take on small behavioral challenges at a comfortable pace.


For example, say your goal is to watch only 3 times per week. You could begin by cutting your use down to once a day at the times when you most want to watch, like before going to sleep.

, Remove temptation to watch more often than your goal allows. It can be helpful to limit or cut off your access to the majority of sources of pornography. Here are some more specific ideas to use depending on your personal viewing habits:


If you usually watch porn on DVDs, scratch them up with a pen or paperclip before throwing them away.
If you use magazines, tear out individual pages and put them through a paper shredder or recycle bin.
If you use the internet, try using a browser extension or other software that will help you limit the sites you can open. These Internet censors, like StayFocusd or Net Nanny act the way parental controls do—slowly you can block websites altogether, should you choose to. They also monitor the time you spend on chosen sites.
If you use a PC, you can also block your frequently visited sites by editing your hosts file on a Windows system editing hosts file.

, There are many things you can do to make sure that your environment is set up such that porn use becomes more difficult and less of a temptation. Start with your computer itself, or your phone if you also watch on that device.


Clean up your computer by removing viruses and malware that give you lots of pornographic ads and pop-ups.Remember to also remove any files you have stored.
Try eliminating the privacy that normally encourages you to watch by moving your whole computer set up to a common area of your home.This may only be a temporary measure as you are getting used to less porn. Your family might be surprised, but will understand if you let them know that you are attempting to limit your time isolated in your room.
Avoid being with friends who share and encourage extreme use of porn.

, Remember to give yourself enough praise and acknowledgment to feel supported and energized in the difficult times. Since overcoming addiction takes lots of time, effort, and usually slip-ups, getting an objective look at how far you’ve come will stop you from beating yourself up over moments of struggle.


Try monitoring your usage with the same browser extension that you use to put controls on your access to porn. If you use DVDs or print media, keep track by marking use in a schedule or calendar.

, Take up a new habit or hobby to replace the time you spend watching porn. If you let the time you would spend watching porn stay empty, it will be much harder to resist the temptation to watch.Try finding ways to fill the lulls in your life so that you no longer have time for porn. Adopt a hobby you've always wanted to take up, such as an art or team sport. You could also spend your time on self-improvement, whether it's reading, volunteering, or contributing to your life in some other way.


Another consideration for choosing an activity is something that you can talk a lot about. Do something that you're proud to tell your parents and friends about, like getting into shape or learning how to play a musical instrument.
If you don't drive, it can be helpful to get a bike or another form of transportation. This will give you freedom to leave the house and do things besides watching porn.

, A great way to make sure that you stay engaged in new hobbies and activities is to do them with friends or people you like being around. This way you will be held socially accountable for sticking with the activity--not to mention the opportunity to bond with others over new things. When you are well connected to people who feed you, porn will become less of a pull and you'll remember that there are other fulfilling ways to spend time.

, A mental health professional will be able to give you additional tools to cope with the difficulties of overcoming the addiction.If you decide to go see a therapist, you will not be judged or scolded for having a problem. As a matter of fact, the more honest you are about the details of your problem, the more your therapist will be able to help you.


A major benefit of therapy is that you will get a chance to deal with pain from your past that may be contributing to the root cause of your addiction., Asking for help can be embarrassing, especially because of the nature of the addiction. But, asking for help really shows that you have the strength and capability of spotting and solving problems in your life. If you want to avoid describing the details of why you need help, ask to be referred to a therapist by saying something vague, like ""I haven't been feeling like myself lately"" or ""I feel disconnected from everyone"".


If you do not feel comfortable asking your parents, try asking your school counselor or another trusted adult.

, In some cases, an addiction to pornography can be the result of a hormone imbalance that ramps up your sex drive. If you feel like your compulsion to use is totally unaffected by all the steps you have taken to recover, you could have an underlying problem that a doctor can help you diagnose.

, This is especially important since the secrecy involved in porn addiction is one of the elements that keep the problem going strong.A group will help you be accountable for your goals and have a place to share stories, successes, and detailed coping tips. Try a local 12-step group for overcoming addictions; Sex Addicts Anonymous and Sex and Love Addicts Anonymous are both groups that welcome people with pornography addictions.


There are also many online groups you can join if you are unable to attend in-person meetings.

, It's understandable to be disappointed if you relapse into watching porn over and above the limits you set for yourself. Indeed, a relapse may be a sign that you need to be more focused on your coping skills and more serious about the lifestyle changes you make to fend off the addiction. But, make sure you don't spiral into excessive watching because of how unsuccessful you feel from having relapsed.Remember that the following are all signs of progress despite relapses:


Low-severity relapses; for example, trying to look at porn on the Internet but then quickly turning it off rather than going on a major watching spree.
Significant amount of passed time between relapses
Strong ability to bounce back from a relapse by using the methods listed here and suggested by your therapist

Write down the harmful effects of your addiction.It might not feel good to acknowledge all the ways in which your addiction is harming you, but seeing the list on paper will help you resolve to stop as soon as possible.,
Make a list of positive changes you want in your life.,
Write down your quitting commitment.,
Set a date to quit.,
Seek personal and professional support.,
Identify your triggers.Everyone has a certain set of triggers that make them automatically want to indulge their habits.,
Start ramping down your addictive habit.,
Get your environment ready.,
Stop the addictive behavior as planned.,
Fill your time.,
Keep clear of your triggers.,
Don't give in to rationalizations.,
Don't let a relapse be the end of your journey.,
Celebrate your accomplishments.",How to Overcome an Addiction," Take out a pen and a piece of paper and brainstorm a list that includes all the negative effects you've experienced since your addiction started.


Think about how your addiction has affected your physical health. Are you at greater risk for getting cancer, heart disease, or another illness as a result of your addiction? Maybe the addiction has already taken a noticeable physical toll.
List the ways in which it has hurt you mentally. Are you embarrassed about your addiction? In many cases addictions lead to shame and embarrassment, as well as depression, anxiety, and other mental and emotional issues.
How has your addiction affected your relationships with other people? Does it prevent you from spending time with people you love, or having enough time to pursue new relationships?
Some addictions take a big financial toll. List the amount of money you have to spend feeding your addiction every day, week and month. Determine whether your addiction has affected your job.
What daily annoyances are caused by your addiction? For example, if you're a smoker, maybe you're tired of having to leave your office every time you need to light up.;
, Now that you've detailed all the negative effects of your addiction, think about how much your life will improve once you've kicked the habit. Create a picture of your life post-addiction. How do you want it to look?


Maybe you'll feel a sense of freedom you haven't had in years.
You'll have more time to spend on people, hobbies, and other pleasures.
You'll be able to save money again.
You know you're doing everything you can to stay healthy. You'll feel immediate physical improvements.
You'll feel proud and confident again.

, Having a list of solid reasons to quit will help you stick to your plan in the long run. Your reasons for quitting must be more important to you than continuing your addictive behavior. This mental hurdle is tough, but it's a necessary first step to quitting any addiction. No one can make you quit but yourself. Write down the true, solid reasons you're stopping this habit. Only you know what they are. Here are a few examples:


Decide you're quitting because you want to have energy to live life to the fullest again.
Decide you're quitting because you're running out of money to support your habit.
Decide you're quitting because you want to be a better partner to your spouse.
Decide you're quitting because you're determined to meet your grandchildren one day.

, Don't set it for tomorrow, unless you're pretty sure quitting cold turkey will work for you. Don't set it for more than a month from now, because you might lose your resolve by then. Aim for a date in the next couple of weeks. This will give you enough time to become mentally and physically prepared.Consider picking a date that's meaningful to you, to help motivate you. Your birthday, father's day, your daughter's graduation day, etc.
Mark the day on your calendar and announce it to those close to you. Build it up so that you won't be likely to back down when the day arrives. Make a firm commitment to yourself that you're going to quit by that date.

, It might not seem like it now, but you're going to need all the support you can get during your journey to overcome addiction. Because so many people battle addictions, there are many wonderful institutions in place that serve as support systems, helping you stay motivated, providing tips for success, and encouraging you to try again if you have a false start.


Research in-person and online support groups designed to help people with the specific type of addiction you're battling. Many resources are free.
Make an appointment with a therapist skilled in helping people through addictions. Find someone you're comfortable with so you'll be able to rely on him or her in the months to come. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), behavioral therapy, Motivational Interviewing, Gestalt techniques and life skills training are amongst the techniques that have been proven successful for those seeking to overcome addictions. A therapeutic setting ensures that you will have privacy and that the treatment will be based on your particular needs and goals.
Seek support from your closest loved ones and friends. Let them know how much this means to you. If you're addicted to a substance, ask them not to use it in your presence.

, For example, if you're struggling with an alcohol addiction, you might find it difficult to attend a certain restaurant without feeling a strong urge to drink. If you're addicted to gambling, passing a casino on the way home from work might make you feel compelled to stop. Knowing your triggers will help you face them down when the time comes to quit.


Stress is often a trigger for all kinds of addictions.
Certain situations, like parties or other social gatherings, might act as triggers.
Certain individuals can be triggers.

, Instead of quitting immediately, start by decreasing your use. For most people, this makes it easier to quit. Indulge less frequently, and gradually continue reducing it as your day to quit for good approaches.

, Remove reminders of your addiction from your home, car and workplace. Get rid of all the objects that goes along with the habit, as well as other items that remind you of the habit.Consider replacing the objects with items that help you feel positive and calm. Fill your refrigerator with wholesome food. Treat yourself to a few good books or DVDs (provided they don't contain content that could act as a trigger). Place candles and other aesthetically pleasing items around the house.
You might want to try redecorating your bedroom, rearranging the furniture, or just buying a few new throw pillows. Changing your environment will give you the feeling of having a fresh start.

, When the big day arrives, keep your promise to yourself and quit. Those first few days are going to be hard. Keep yourself busy and stay positive. You're on your way to an addiction-free life.

, If you need distractions, try exercising, taking up a new hobby, cooking, or hanging out with friends. Joining a new club, sports team, or other kind of community group will help you make new friends and start a new chapter of your life in which addiction is not a part. Positive social interactions can stimulate the release of neurochemicals which elicit feelings of happiness and satisfaction without the need for drugs.


Exercise releases endorphin chemicals like the ones released in addiction, which is why sometimes you'll hear the term ""runner's high"".Exercise could open a lot more windows for new and improved health and could lessen the blow of withdrawal by giving you something else to feel good about.

, Stay away from the people, places and things that make you want to go back to your old habits. You might need to construct a completely new routine for awhile, until the edge wears off a bit.

, The physical and mental pain of addiction withdrawal is real, and you'll likely start telling yourself it's okay to take up the habit again. Don't listen to the voice telling you to start back up and don't give up on yourself when it feels hard. Every bit of pain will be worth it in the end.


Common rationalizations include the idea that ""it's a free country"" or ""we all have to die sometime."" Resist taking on this defeatist attitude.
Go back to your list of reasons for quitting to remember why you're doing this. Think about why quitting is more important than staying addicted.
Visit support groups and your therapist each time you feel in danger of relapsing.

, Everyone slips up from time to time. That doesn't mean you should give in and return to your addictive habits in a full-blown relapse. If you have a slip up, go back over what happened and determine what changes you can make if it happens again. Then get back on your feet and start again.


Don't let guilt and shame take over if you slip up. You're trying your best, and all you can do is keep at it.

, Do something nice for yourself when you meet the goals you've made, no matter how small. Kicking an addiction is incredibly tough work, and you deserve to be rewarded.

Purchase a pack of blank, or unscented, incense sticks.,
Find your favorite essential oils, mixing and matching if desired.,
In a small, shallow dish, mix 20 drops of your essential oils for each stick you're making.,
Place your sticks in the shallow dish and turn to coat.,
Turn and gently press the sticks in the oil until it is all absorbed.,
Place the sticks incense end up in a mug to dry overnight.,
Alternatively, mix your scents with  Di-propylene Glycol (DPG) and soak overnight in test-tubes for an extra-strength stick.",How to Make Incense Sticks1," You can purchase these online, or at some specialty shops. They may be marketed as either blank or unscented, and are usually exceptionally cheap -- under $3-4 for an entire pack.

The thick, gummy-like coating on the outside is essential to absorb the scent. Don't just try to use a regular old bamboo stick!;
, Essential oils, often sold in the health section of many large supermarkets, are strongly concentrated liquid scents that can soak into the incense sticks. You can use just one for a stronger flavor, or buy a few to mix and match. Some common scents for incense include:


Wood Scents: Sandalwood, pine, cedar, juniper, pinion pine


Herbal Scents: Sage, thyme, lemongrass, rosemary, star anise


Floral Scents: Lavender, iris, rose, saffron, hibiscus


Other: Orange flower, cinnamon, calamus root, frankincense, vanilla, myrrh, If you only want one at a time, 20 drops will do, otherwise, you should generally stick to batches of no more than 4-5 at a time. If you want to do 5 sticks at once, you would need 100 drops of essential oil, or roughly 4ml.




If you're mixing scents, start with only a few drops at a time until you get a combination you enjoy. There are very few combinations that will smell ""bad,"" but you should still experiment to find what you like best.


, If the sticks don't fit, transfer your essential oils to a sheet of aluminum foil, partially folded into a V to ensure none leaks out. Make sure all the sides of the stick soak up the essential oils.



, This shouldn't take long, but you may need to move things around a bit to be sure it is all coated. When the oil has disappeared from the pan, you can move on.




, The sticks need roughly 12-15 hours to dry out before they can be burned. However, as they dry the sticks will emit a wonderful smell as well, meaning they will ""work"" for a day even if you can't burn them yet!




, This chemical sounds crazy, but it is easily purchased online in the same stores where blank sticks are sold. Still using 20 drops per stick, mix it with DPG in a long, thin tube, enough that at least 3




A ""Refresher Oil Base"" can be used in place of DPG, as they both thin out and spread your fragrance.

Determine which scents you want to mix into your incense, taking 1-2 tablespoons of each.,
Keep track of how much of each scent you use, writing notes if you plan to make incense often.,
Using a mortar and pestle, mix and grind all of your chosen scents together.,
Let the powder sit for a few hours to help the scents blend.,
Determine how much makko you need to add by taking a percentage of your dry ingredients.,
Multiply the amount of spices by your desired makko percentage to know of much to add.,
Set aside a small portion of your mixture.,
Using a pipette or other dropper, slowly add warm distilled water to your incense and mix to a paste.,
Knead the dough under your hand for several minutes.,
Pinch off a 1-2 inch chunk of dough and roll it out into a long, skinny rectangle.,
Place an uncoated incense stick on the dough, then roll the whole thing up so the dough coats the last 3/4s of the stick.,
Place the sticks on a small board lined with wax paper to dry, rotating them once or twice a day.,
After 4-5 days, when the dough holds its shape and is dry to the touch, you're ready to burn.",How to Make Incense Sticks2," To start, try using only 2-3 different scents, then adding more as you get more comfortable. While making incense is not hard, there is some trial and error with the mixing, as different scents require more or less water and makko (your combustible binding agent) later on. You can buy the following scents whole or powdered, but know that pre-powdered scents are far easier to work with:


Herbs and Spices: Cassia, juniper leaves, lemongrass, lavender, sage, thyme, rosemary, orange powder, patchouli


Resins and Tree Gums: Balsam, acacia, amber, copal, hibiscus, myrrh, burgundy pitch, 


Dried Woods: Juniper, pine, pinyon, cedar, sandalwood, agarwood, The amount of water and the binding agent you use depends on the amount of powdered ingredients you use, so make sure you keep track of everything now. In general, 1-2 tablespoons for each ingredient is fine, but you can always scale up if need be.Incense recipes are usually described in ""parts,"" like a mixed drink. So, if the recipe calls for ""2 parts sandalwood, 1 part rosemary,"" you could do 2 tablespoons sandalwood, 1 tb rosemary, 2 cups sandalwood, 1 cup rosemary, etc.


, If you're using fresh ingredients, instead of pre-powdered, you want to get everything into as into as fine a powder as you can. Herb grinders can help, but avoid electric coffee grinders -- the heat they produce can release some of the scent compounds from your ingredients. When grinding up, remember to:Grind up the wood first, as it is hardest and most difficult to get fine. If you're really struggling, break the ""no electric grinder rule,"" as the wood is robust enough it won't loose much scent.

Freeze and gums or resins for 30 minutes before grinding. When frozen, resins get hard and much easier to smash into pieces., Once the individual ingredients are combined, mix together and everything together one last time. Then let it all sit. While this isn't strictly necessary, it will lead to a more cohesive, even smell to your incense.
, Makko, a combustible, gummy substance, needs to be a certain percentage of the total mixture in order to burn well. Unfortunately, this is where some trial and error comes in, as different scents require different amounts of makko to burn well:

If you only use herbs and spices, you will only need 10-25% makko.

If you use resins, you will need significantly more makko -- anywhere from 40-80% depending on how many parts resin were added. All resin mixes need 80%.


, So, if you have 10 tablespoons of powder, with a little resin in it, you would add 4 tablespoons of makko (10∗40%=4tablespoons{\displaystyle 10*40\%=4tablespoons}). You can make this simple calculation with any amount of powder and makko.

You can always add more makko, but it is hard to take it out. Start on the lower end of the estimated if you are unsure., Take out roughly 10% of your mixture and set it aside. This will be to re-thicken the incense if you accidentally add too much water in the next step, helping you prevent a ruined batch.
, You want a Play-doh sort of texture, as the makko absorbs the water and forms a clay. It should hold its shape, but still be malleable. Add 3-5 drops of water, mix it in, and then add more until to forms a wet, but not slimy, ball.  When you have the perfect texture, the mixture will be squeezed and still hold its form, without dry-looking cracks.

If you add too much water, pour what you can out of the bowl and use your remaining powder to dry things out a bit., Kneading just requires constant pressure. Use the heel of your hand to press the ""dough"" into the counter, flattening the disc lightly. Then fold the disk over, forming another thicker ball of dough, and press it again. Keep doing this, rotating the dough every now and then to mix up the area you are kneading, for several minutes.For professional incense, let the dough sit under a damp towel overnight after you're done kneading. The next morning, spritz a bit more water on, knead again, then proceed., Use your palms to roll the chunk into a long rope, like you were making a clay snake, about the size of 3/4 of your incense sticks. Then use your fingers to flatten the dough ""snake"" down. It should be thin, only a few millimeters thick, when done.

If you aren't using incense sticks, you can leave the rolled up incense as the ""snakes."" Use a knife to cut the edges and let them dry as they are, without a stick to hold them together.


, You'll need completely blank bamboo sticks, which can be bought for cheap online. Then you simply use your fingers to roll the incense dough around the stick, letting it completely coat the outside bamboo stick.It should be a little less thick than a standard pencil.


, To speed things up even more, place the whole board in a paper bag and tie it shut. Make sure you rotate the incense to ensure it all dries out evenly.
, Once the incense doesn't droop and is no longer malleable, you're ready to use it! If you live in a more humid environment, it will take closer to five days. However, it might take only 1-2 days in a drier climate.

The more makko and water you needed to use, the longer they will likely take to dry."

Keep track of your experiments, noting how each one burns.,
Try a few sandalwood-heavy recipes for a ""classic"" incense smell.,
Try out a vanilla-based incense.,
Try a few woody concoctions as well.,
Try a ""Christmas Incense"" recipe.,
Get a little romantic with this passionate incense recipe.",How to Make Incense Sticks3," When making your own incense, the ration of makko and water to scent takes some time to get right. To make sure you always learn your lessons, write down the ratios you use as you test out the following recipes, or your own:

If you have a hard time lighting the incense, you likely need more makko next time.

If all you smell is the makko, or the sticks burn very quickly, add less makko next time., Sandalwood is one of the most common and beloved incense scents. The following ratios should help you get these classic smells burning quickly:

2 parts sandalwood, 1 part frankincense, 1 part mastic, 1 part lemongrass

2 part sandalwood, 1 part cassia, 1 part clove

2 part sandalwood, 1 part galangal, 1 part myrrh, 1/2 part cinnamon, 1/2 part borneol


, The following recipe can be easily adapted as well. Try it with some clove or cinnamon for a spiced taste, or mix it in with wood scents like cedar for a rustic incense:

1 part palo santo wood, 1 part tolu balsam, 1 part storax bark, 1/4 part vanilla bean (powdered), This recipe goes will with pine in place of cedar as well, and a bit of myrrh can be added too to increase the old-world incense feel of the mixture:

2 parts cedar, 1 part vetiver, 1 part lavender flowers, 1/2 part benzoin, handful of dried rose petals


, This recipe can be adapted wonderfully with some cinnamon chips or cloves as well, and mixes nicely with vanilla as well. While it calls for fresh pine needs and leaves, powders and dried leaves work as well, though they might not be as strong:

1 part pine needles, 1/2 part hemlock needles, 1/2 part sassafras powder, 1/2 part cedar leaf (Thuja occidentalis), 1/4 part whole cloves


, The herbal, floral, and strong notes of lavender combine to make an in-the-mood scent that few can resist. 60% of the time, it works every time.

1 part ground lavender flowers, 1 part ground rosemary leaves, 1/2 part ground rose petals, 4 parts red sandalwood powder"

Use a smudge stick.,
Make your own smudge stick.,
Use incense sticks and an incense burner.,
Light an incense stick with a match or lighter.,
Beware of low quality incense sticks.,
Use an incense match.",How to Use Incense1," Despite the disconcerting name, smudge sticks are perhaps the classiest type of incense. The most common type of smudge stick is made by simply tying white sage into a tight bundle. Juniper, cedar, and other botanicals can also be used. You can acquire smudge sticks – or just the herbs to make them yourself with a bit of string - from aromatherapy shops or herb stores.Smudge sticks are associated primarily with Native American cleansing practices, and may provide a feeling of more comfortable or more positive energy.
Light a smudge stick at the un-tied end and allow the whole end to begin to burn. “Smudge” the stick against a dish to quell any flames and allow it to smolder. Leave the stick on its side in something that cannot light on fire, such as an ashtray or ceramic dish. Make sure there is plenty of space around the burning smudge stick.;
, Tightly bundle sage branches together before they’re dried, so that the tied end is roughly equal in diameter to a nickel. Use branches that are slightly shorter than the length of your hand. You can tie the bundle in more than one location, adding a few ties a finger width apart to keep the bundle tight. Allow the bundle to dry by hanging it upside down in the sunlight. Trim the ends of the branches once the bundle has dried so that you’re left with a tight bunch of sage about the width or your palm., Incense sticks are the most widely available form of incense, and are also very easy to use. If you wish to use incense sticks, seek out a local supplier who makes their own and ensure they use high quality, non-toxic ingredients. Once you find a source that uses only safe ingredients, get an incense burner to ensure that the incense can safely burn and drop ash into a receptacle that will allow simple disposal.Stick incense burners widely vary in décor, but usually feature trays with a groove for catching ash and a curved up end with a hole, in which you place the incense stick.

, Allow the stick to burn for a few moments and blow it out. A small, dull ember may remain. A steady stream of aromatic stick should be flowing from the end of the stick. If the stream stops or is not constant, relight the stick and allow it to burn for a bit longer before blowing it out. If the ember is very bright or extends down the stick more and a few millimeters, press the burning end of the stick against the incense holder to reduce the size of the ember.

, There are many varieties of incense sticks, and two different methods of production. Dipped sticks are thin wooden sticks with a combustible coating – usually charcoal or wood pulp – that are then dipped in essential oils or synthetic fragrances and dried. Hand rolled sticks are made in a slightly different way, but the end product is very similar. Packaging for both types is not required to list all of the ingredients, which may include toxic glues or low-quality wood.Concerns about the quality of the ingredients used to make manufactured incense sticks dictate that they are likely not the safest form of incense.
The lack of mandatory labeling of the ingredients in incense makes it hard to determine what incense sticks are safe to use. Since you can't assume a product is safe, only use incense stick with packaging that explicitly states that the product is non-toxic.

, Incense matches are extremely easy to use. They are essentially miniature incense sticks that come on cardboard matches and are sold in matchbooks. The quality of ingredients used in incense matches, again, is often unspecified.If you do wish to use an incense match, strike the match away from you, hold it vertically, and allow it to burn about a quarter of an inch down. Blow the match out, and set it in an inflammable receptacle, such as an ashtray or small dish. Prop the match against something inflammable within the dish, as this will help the match burn more steadily.

"
Use an incense cone.,
Find a safe incense holder or box.,
Add sand or rice to the bottom surface of an incense holder.,
Light the tip of the inverted cone.,
Keep cones dry.",How to Use Incense2," Incense cones are becoming increasingly more popular, and offer a similar, but slightly different experience to that derived from using an incense stick. Look for incense cones made using Makko powder – derived naturally from a special type of neutral-smelling and slowly burning wood – and essential oils.Cones can emit variable amounts of aroma based on the amount of fragrance used in making the cone. This will allow you to choose a level of aroma, including either very subtle or very potent, that you prefer.

, Since incense cones burn all the way down, the holder in which you place them must be inflammable, as embers will touch it directly as the cone burns to the end. Boxes and dishes of various materials are available, including elaborate works of stone and porcelain. Even wood boxes can be used, as long as brass inserts contain the actual cone and the residue and ash that is produced as the cone burns. If you use a simple ceramic dish, you may want to place a quarter or other metal disc beneath the cone, as the bottom of the cone can become extremely hot.

, Though it is not a necessary step, adding a smooth layer of sand to the bottom of your holder upon which you can place an incense cone will allow air to better access the cone. Further, this additional layer will reduce the amount of heat that the holder itself is exposed to, which may help certain material from aging or even cracking. , You can use a lighter or match. Allow about a dozen seconds to pass before putting out the cone’s flame. Waiting will allow the cone to fully light and produce an ember that will continue to burn once the flame is extinguished. There should be a continual stream of smoke emanating from the tip of the cone. Allow the cone to burn as long as you wish. You can put it out and relight it later if it does not burn all the way., The main reason that a cone may quit burning is a lack of oxygen. If you’re using an incense box and the incense keeps going out, try removing the lid. If oxygen proves not to be the issue, the cone may have still be damp from production or it may have been exposed to moisture. Dry the cone out by placing it somewhere you know the air is dry. For regular storage, keep cones in a cool, dry location out of direct sunlight."

Indent a path for an incense trail in white chaff ash.,
Fill the indentation with pre-mixed incense, Makko powder, or Sandalwood powder.,
Light the trail with an incense-lighting stick or match.,
Allow the trail to cool once it has fully burned.",How to Use Incense3," Fill an incense bowl with white chaff ash, and tap the bowl lightly to settle the ash. Make an indentation in the ash that is one continual line. You can make a “U” shape, a spiral, or anything else that comes to mind, as long as the indentation is a single continual line. Most importantly, the indentation should be about half an inch deep and half an inch wide.You can get white chaff ash from some stores that sell incense or online.
You can use a koh press to make an indentation, which are designed for this purpose, and were originally used to create elaborate incense trails that also doubled as a method for keeping time.

, Sandalwood powder will burn and provide an aroma of its own. Makko powder has a more neutral aroma, and you can either sprinkle loose incense on top of a burning Makko powder trail or pre-mix incense of your choice with Makko powder before filling the indentation.Slightly press the trail down once you’ve filled the indentation with the desired aromatic material.

, You can get wood stick designed to light incense, or simply use a match. Lay either at one end of the trail and leave it there to allow the trail to light. If you used plain Makko powder to fill the indentation and make your trail, sprinkle loose incense on the trail once it is bright orange or red., Remove the spent trail with a spoon and discard it, making sure it is fully extinguished. Any ash that has not been mixed with burnt material from the trail can be re-used."

The incense material can be smooth and fine, or it can be grainy and coarse. The aroma, which is usually strong, includes both the scent of the incense and the scent of the burning wooden core.;
, These incense sticks are made from pure incense material and have no core inside. They have a lighter aroma, making them perfect for small spaces, such as bedrooms and offices. Because they have no core, their smell is simpler with no underlying notes of burning wood.

, Incense holders, also known as censers, come in many different shapes and sizes. What you use to hold your incense depends on the type of incense you are using: cored or solid. You can purchase a special holder designed to hold incense sticks, our you can make your own using the supplies you have on hand.


If you have a cored incense stick, consider using an incense ""boat,"" which is a long, thin piece of wood, metal, or ceramic that has a tiny hole at one end. The incense boat usually has a groove down the center, which is used to catch any falling pieces of ash.
If you have a solid incense stick, do not use a wooden holder. Solid incense sticks burn all the way down, so using anything made from a flammable material as a censer is dangerous. Instead, consider filling a bowl or cup with grain, rice, salt, or sand, and sticking the incense stick inside.If you wish to use a censer, then look for one that is made of ceramic or stone.
Consider purchasing a shaped censer. These incense holders often come in many different shapes, such as elephants, lotus flowers, leaves, or bowls. They are usually made out of ceramic (which makes them suitable for both cored and solid incense sticks) and have a tiny hole at the top.

, You can make a simple incense holder using a bowl and something grainy, or you can make your own out of clay. Here are some ideas:


Make a shaped censer using clay. Take a piece of natural, air dry stone clay and roll it out flat. Cut it into a shape you like using a craft knife or a cookie cutter. You can either leave it flat, or turn the edges up towards you to give it more of a bowl shape. Take your incense stick and poke a hole into the clay. Take the stick out and let the clay dry before using it as a censer.
Make an incense holder using a bowl or bucket. Choose a container that is wide enough so that it can catch any falling ash from your incense stick. Fill the container with grain, rice, salt, or sand.

, Because incense sticks release a lot of smoke, you will need to burn your stick in a well-ventilated room. At the same time, however, keep your burning incense away from open windows or doors, where there is a lot of draft. Make sure that there is nothing flammable near your incense, such as curtains or drapes., You can use a match or a lighter. Hold the flame to the stick until the stick ignites.

, If it does, look at the tip of the incense stick. If you can see a glowing ember, then the incense stick is burning properly. If you do not see anything, and the tip looks ashy, then you will need to relight the stick.

, You should be able to see a glowing ember on the tip of your incense stick and a tendril of smoke; you should not see a flame. After about 30 seconds, you should be able to smell the incense.This means that your incense is burning properly. If you do not see anything and the tip looks ashy, then you have completely extinguished the incense. Re-light the stick. This time, cup your hand and hold it behind the flame as you blow it out.

, If you are using a cored incense stick, then place the wooden end unto the holder. If you are using a solid incense stick, then it does not matter which end you place into the holder. Most censers will hold the stick up vertically or at a slight angle. If your censer holds your stick at a slight angle, make sure that the tip of your incense stick is still over the censer. If the tip extends beyond the censer, trim the incense stick down or place the censer down on a heat-resistant try.


If you are using a bowl or bucket filled with grain, rice, salt, or sand, then gently push the bottom of the stick into the grain, rice, salt, or sand until the stick is able to stand up on its own. You can stand the stick straight up or angle it slightly. If you choose to angle the stick, make sure that the tip is still within the perimeter of the container. This way, once you light the stick, any ash will fall directly into the container, and not onto your table or floor.

, Most incense sticks will burn for 20 to 30 minutes, depending on the size and thickness.

, Like with all flames, do not leave burning incense unattended. If you need to leave the room, extinguish the incense by dipping the tip in water or pressing it against a heat-resistant surface. Make sure that the incense holder is on a heat-resistant surface, and out of reach of any curtains, drapes, children, and pets.

, Burning incense during meditation can not only help relax your mind, but it can also help give you a sense of focus.

, Because incense produces a lot of fragrant smoke, it is possible to use this as an air freshener. Keep in mind, however, that incense will only mask odors, and that to eliminate a bad smell completely, you will have to get rid of the source (be it the trash, dirty dishes, dirty litter, and so forth).

, You can use incense to help you focus, increase motivation, ease headaches, and reduce depression. Burning incense may also help you relax and feel less stressed., Incense fills a room with fragrant smoke, which you breathe in. Studies have shown that breathing this smoke daily may lead to lung cancer., The smoke from extensive incense use may deteriorate the air quality in your home, and contribute to issues such as: asthma, headaches, and other respiratory issues. It may also irritate the eyes, nose, lungs, and throat."

White sage has been traditionally burned by the indigenous peoples of the American Southwest, but other varieties of sage may suit your purposes.
You should be able to find dried sage in small, independent herb shops; at some grocery stores, health stores, and farmers markets; in head shops, smoke shops, or anywhere that incense is sold. You may find a more diverse selection if you search the Internet for ""sage bundles"".
Sage is a ceremonial, sacred product: your intention in burning it matters, the cultivation of the sage matters, and the intention of the seller matters. These subtle energies may pass from the people into the sage, and from the sage into the space that you are purifying. Be conscious about where you are getting your sage.;
, Sage grows naturally, in the form of various subspecies, throughout the Americas, Asia, and the Mediterranean. Read about the varieties that grow near you, and consult a botanical field guide to identify the plant in the wild.Use sustainable wild-crafting practices. Never pull wild sage up by the root, and do not harvest the entire patch. Let the sage continue to grow for years to come. Leave enough of the plant that it can sustain itself.
Take the tallest, most mature stems, and leave the rest. Be careful not to shake away too many of the seeds and flowers. Use scissors or a knife to trim the stem as close to the ground as possible.Ask for permission before harvesting sage on private property, or within the bounds of a state park. In some areas, you can purchase a cutting or wild-crafting permit for a small fee. Depending where you live, you may be able to find sage growing around your neighborhood.

, If you keep an herb garden, you may want to cultivate your own sage plant to ensure a steady and sustainable supply.


You can scatter or bury seeds from an existing sage plant in your garden. Water them consistently, make sure that they have space to grow, and be patient.
You should be able to buy sage seeds or a sage plant at a local nursery.
Whether you transplant a living sage bush or grow your own from seed, make sure that you give the plant plenty of time to establish itself in your garden. Be patient. Do not pick stems from the sage bush until you are absolutely sure that it won't kill the plant.

, This should take about a week, depending on the weather. Gather the sage in a bundle, tie it tightly, and hang it up in a dry space so that it will dry evenly.


If you hang your sage outside, remember to bring it inside or cover it at night. If dew or moisture seep into your sage bundle overnight, this will undermine the drying process.
When the sage is sufficiently dried, it should crackle gently when squeezed.
Do not dry your sage in an oven or microwave--this will toast the essential oil out of the bundle, speeding up the deterioration of the plant and muting the purifying effect of burning it.

, Decide what you are trying to accomplish by burning this sage. The practice of burning sage is ancient, rich, and steeped in cultural tradition.


The power of intent is integral here. If you burn sage with the intention to cleanse your home of negative energy, then it is incredibly more likely to do so. Any effect of the plant must be rooted in your mind.
Perhaps you want to cleanse your home of negative energy. Perhaps you wish to interact with an ancient herbal tradition and rekindle the ancient rites. Perhaps you simply want to burn incense and spruce up your home with a pleasing scent.

, Many of the benefits are spiritual and psychological--but there is a physical component.


On a spiritual level: Many people use sage burning and smudging to connect with ancestral tradition. It is a common belief that the strong scent of sage can purge the negative energy from a room, a home, and a heart.
On a psychological level: The act of burning sage can mark a beginning, a resolution, a turning-over of a new leaf. When you accept the time-honored ritual and put your faith in the power of burnt sage, you can purge yourself of negativity and find true peace of mind.
On a physical level: Sage releases negative ions into the air when it is burned, and research suggests that exposure to negative ions may correlate to lower rates of depression.The strength of this correlation is still unclear, but know that sage at least has not been shown to have any negative effect.

, Lay out a ceramic dish, a bowl, an incense tray, a shell, or any other vessel that will catch the ash. Fill the vessel with clean sand or rich earth.


Choose a vessel that holds significance to you. This can be nearly anything: your favorite coffee mug, a piece of your grandmother's china, an ivory bowl from your journey to India; any personal relic that will make the ceremony more meaningful to you.
Some Native American tribes have traditionally burned sage in cleaned-out abalone shells, which represent the element of water.If you want to pay homage to the ancient rites, consider buying a large abalone half-shell or hollowing out one of your own.
Avoid using wood, paper, rubber, or anything flammable. Keep water on hand so that you can extinguish the burning sage if the flame grows out of hand.

, This will give the sage smoke--along with any negative energy--a way to leave your home.Open a window or a door in any room where you plan to burn sage. You want the smoke to cleanse, but you do not want it to linger.
Consider turning on a fan if you want the smoke to dissipate more quickly. You may not like the pungent smell, or the smoke may irritate your sinuses.

, Use a candle, a match, or a lighter to set the sage ablaze. Let the sage burn for a few seconds, and then blow out the fire; let the embers smoke.


Dry sage will catch fire very quickly. Be careful.
Make sure that the sage has burned enough that the embers will continue to smoke. If the smoke ceases before you are done with your ritual, you can carefully light the sage again.
You are ready to spread the smoke.

, Consider saying a prayer of cleansing. Burning sage is the spiritual equivalent of opening up all of your windows and letting light shine into the soul; dedicate your act to this light.


For example, say: ""I cleanse this room of any impurities, negativity, or anything that does not suit or support the people that live here.""If you are preparing a room for a newborn child, say: ""I purge this room of all ghosts and darkness. I dedicate this room to life, and to love, and to light, and to all that is good.""

, Walk around each room wafting smoke into every corner; let smoke trace the walls, the windows, and the ceiling; let smoke curl and coil and roll back upon itself within the space. Imagine negative energy flowing away from the edges of the smoke; out of your home; out of your life.


Concentrate on gateway areas: windows, doors, closets, hallways. Use your intuition. If you pay close attention to your space, you may notice that some areas are more in need of cleansing than others.
Consider focusing on busy areas--work spaces, kitchens, entryways. If you have a pet, consider saging their space, but do not disturb them with the smoke.
Moderation is key. Do not fill the area too thickly with smoke, or your gentle cleansing may become a choking nightmare.
Try not to inhale the smoke directly; this may harm your lungs.
This process may set off your smoke alarm, if you own one. Either moderate your smoke-spreading, avoid rooms with smoke detectors, or remove the batteries from the smoke detector before burning your sage.

, Pungent sage is known for its yang (male) aspect, and incense may lend a complementary yin (female) energy.


Experiment with-bell ringing and hand-clapping in between burning sage and lighting incense; this may potentiate the spiritual cleansing effect.

, If you can burn sage at least once a week, you may notice that the practice imbues your home with light and calm.


You do not necessarily need to perform a full smudging ceremony each time that you burn sage--depending on how strictly you wish to adhere to the traditional rituals. Consider burning sage casually, as you would burn incense.
Consider burning sage to acknowledge significant changes in your home: a new member of the family, a new pet, a new job, a new passion. The practice of burning sage can be whatever you want it to be. The important thing is that you believe that the sage can help you make your life more meaningful.

Unearth the Square Root.,
Remove your Emotional Baggage.,
Cure old wounds.,
Awaken the Power Within.,
Practice Acts of Random Kindness.",How to Overcome Addiction in 60 Days," Family dysfunction is the common denominator, or square root of all addictive behavior, and until it is brought to the forefront and confronted nothing will change.


Uncover your family dysfunction. Some examples are:

Physical abuse
Sexual abuse
Verbal abuse
Alcoholic parent
Controlling parent
Inadequate parenting


Confront the parent or parents responsible for the dysfunction. The thought of confronting the person that is responsible for your emotional trauma is one the most frightening situations you will face. However, it is also the most liberating and empowering thing you'll ever do! Confronting the person does not at all mean that you should verbally attack them for your misfortunes. On the contrary, you are not doing this for them; you are doing it for you. The confrontation is not meant to be an attack, but it is rather a chance for you to set the record straight and drop the emotional baggage that you've been toting around.;
, To fully free yourself from their emotional stronghold, it will be necessary to find forgiveness in your heart for a family member that has committed an atrocity against you. Forgive! Forgiveness is not reconciliation. There is a drastic difference between the two. Reconciliation would mean that you have accepted and submit to their behavior and have agreed to try to continue the relationship under those circumstances. Forgiveness means that you merely give up or cease the resentment of the offender.

, Without question, partaking in habitual behavior not only causes you pain but, it inflicts pain on the people around you as well. However, do not allow what you have done in the past or what others have done to you, to cause you to live in fear of what the future holds. The past is the past, it is over, and living in it does not serve anyone well. Live in the present moment, be kind to yourself, and learn to love yourself. How can you love someone else if you don't love yourself? The answer is you can't. It isn't a big secret that you're feeling shame and guilt for what you've done. Remember, people do not have defects of character, are not full of shortcomings, and are certainly not powerless! On the contrary, we are all the same, we are all connected, and we all have the same power to change.

, Whether you want to admit it or not, all of the pain you have been through concerning your habitual behavior is a spiritual lesson. And until you view it as such, it will continue to cause you suffering and unhappiness. Every dark cloud does have a silver lining, and if you look hard enough you'll find one in this habitual situation too. However, to find that silver lining you must ask the right questions:


What can you learn from your addiction?
How can you grow from it?

, Happiness is a state of mind. Individuals that are suffering from addictive behavior are not happy. Ironically, in an attempt to find happiness, they chose a vehicle to mask their emotional pain through the use of alcohol, illicit drugs, and various other compulsions. However, happiness is never found on the outside in material possessions or in the abuse of substances and compulsions! True life happiness can only be found in one place, and that place is within! Happiness is not found in the practice of outward ideals or in other people. To the contrary, it is actually the small acts of random kindness that opens the heart and fuels the principle of unconditional love!

Find a private place to write.,
Verbalize your journal.",How to Manage Addiction with Journaling4," There are multiple different types of journaling that you can do. The type of journaling you choose to do will be based on personal preference, your recovery process, and where you are in your recovery.

Note a change in tardiness or attendance.,
Recognize inconsistent performance.,
Experience overreactions to criticism.,
Notice a withdrawal from responsibility.",How to Identify Substance Abuse in the Work Place1," Drug and alcohol addicts have been shown to miss 10 days of work for each day missed by other employees. Often the first signal that something is wrong is frequent tardiness (especially after lunch) and absence from work.Try keeping a log or making a notation on your calendar.;
, One of the problems with drug use and addiction is that it creates an unpredictable pendulum of functionality. One day, an individual may perform their job well. Another day, they may not be able to. Overall, a person suffering from substance abuse and addiction will make more mistakes than one who is sober. Keep an eye out for inconsistent performance, as well as a propensity for errors.For example, let’s say that most days an employee can deliver a great presentation, but once in a while, they seem overly forgetful, clumsy, and unable to perform.
Make a note of this. Record the date and a few details, but aim to keep your record objective.

, Individuals suffering from substance abuse tend to be emotionally sensitive and extremely defensive. Notice how an individual responds to normal criticism. If they seem to overreact, or perhaps even become paranoid, there may be a problem.Let’s say you approach an employee with some basic notes about their work, such as some changes you’d like them to make to an email. If they become noticeably angry, blow up, or storm away, this could be a negative sign.
This is especially true if this is different from how they responded previously, and if this kind of behavior occurs several times.
Once again, objectively record the date and some details of this type of encounter.

, Individuals suffering from substance abuse (especially at the later stages) will try to withdrawal from any and all activities that do not involve drugs/drinking. Notice if an individual begins to shirk responsibility, fails to take on new tasks, or otherwise lets their normal tasks slide.Notice if you need to continually remind an employee to do simple tasks, such as send out a weekly newsletter.
Notice if other employees seem to be taking on tasks normally handled by the employee in question, such as communicating with clients or leading meetings.

Notice mood swings or attitude changes.,
Make note of their withdrawal from social contacts.,
Recognize defensive attitudes concerning the subject of addiction.,
Look carefully at an individual’s eyes.,
Take note of unsteadiness.,
Record the frequency of small injuries or accidents.",How to Identify Substance Abuse in the Work Place2," In addition to what drugs and alcohol can do to your body, they also wreak havoc on your emotions. Take note of any mood swings (becoming angry or sad out of nowhere) or attitude changes (such as becoming suddenly manic). If these happen very frequently, there may be a problem.If an employee comes to work with an angry attitude, but shifts into a extremely upbeat mood (like the flip of a switch), take note of this.
Note any major mood changes when the employee returns from lunch.
If an employee can go from laughing to crying, or cheerful to upset with very little stimulus, make note of this as well.

, In the throws of addiction, an individual will begin to cut ties with those around them. Whether these are work contacts, social acquaintances, or both, notice when an individual seems to be growing distant from those around them and withdrawing from the social world.Notice their absence at social functions and work parties.
Notice when they no longer stay in touch with clients or co-workers.

, When a person is experiencing addiction, they are doing constant mental gymnastics to justify their behaviors to themselves. As such, they are particularly on edge and defensive about the subject of addiction (even when the addict in question is not themselves). Watch out of these defensive attitudes; they could be a bad sign.If the subject of addiction causes them to sweat, grow tense, or become angry, this can be a sign of defensiveness.

, The way a person’s eyes look can sometimes signal intoxication. Bloodshot eyes, glassy/unfocused eyes, large or constricted pupils, and severe bags under the eyes can all be indicative of intoxication or frequent drug use.Crying, illness, or certain medications can also affect the appearance of someone’s eyes.

, Both intoxication and withdrawal can cause noticeable “unsteadiness” in a person. If an individual is shaking, trembling, or sweating, they may be experiencing drug or alcohol withdrawal. If they are unable to walk straight or appear clumsy, an individual may be intoxicated by alcohol, opiates, or other depressant drugs., While experiencing addiction and frequent intoxication, individuals are prone to accidents and injuries. They are more likely to break things, and to visit the hospital. If you suspect substance abuse in someone you work with, take note of how often accidents and injuries occur.Notice if a co-worker commonly has bandages, or complains of illness.
Notice if they visit the doctor/hospital several times in one month, or once a month for several months in a row.
Any number of health problems can lead to doctor/hospital visits, so do your best to respect the individual’s privacy.

Speak to someone in HR.",How to Identify Substance Abuse in the Work Place3," Sometimes suspicions are just that. However, making accusations or spreading gossip can seriously damage a person’s reputation (even if the information is proven untrue).


Unless you have witnessed several of the above symptoms, you may want to keep your suspicions to yourself.
There are many reasons why someone’s eyes could be red, or why they have been keeping to themselves.
Even if you are 100% sure of an individual’s drugs use, gossiping is not a productive way to handle your concerns.

, If you believe an employee or co-worker is using drugs or alcohol, you must take notice of their behavior and document all signs. Anytime you notice one or more of the above symptoms, note the date, a few details, and any consequences (such as a lost client or hospital visit). Aim to keep your notations as objective as possible.You may write, “11/1 – late for work,” or “11/6 – poor presentational skills, shabby appearance.”

, The first active step you should take is to simply talk to the person. Make sure this comes from a place of empathy. Whether you are a co-worker or an authority, approaching this person with threats of punishment will not work. Be ready for them to become defensive, or even try to manipulate the situation.


Ask them to come to a private space where you can talk, possibly even outside of work.
You could say, “I think something is going on with you, and I hope we can talk about it.”
You could say, “I’m worried about you. I think you have a problem with drugs/alcohol, and I’d like to help you, if I can.”
If they deny it, you may want to offer some “proof” from your documentation.
For instance, you might say, “In September, you were late for work 12 times and in October, it was 8 times. In October, you visited the doctor twice. Also, you seem shaky all the time and you look like you’ve lost weight. If it isn’t drugs/alcohol, can you share what is going on?”

, If you feel certain that your co-worker has a problem, it may be time to discuss this with your boss. You will want to collect and organize your log of signs and symptoms to present as much information as you can.


Ideally, you will have already tried to speak to the person directly.
Make an appointment to speak to your boss privately.
You may say, “I believe Tabatha has a drug and alcohol problem. I have been noticing symptoms for some time now, and I believe she needs help.”

, Another option is to speak to someone in your company’s Human Relations department. An HR representative should be able to outline a strategy that aligns with your company’s policies. Once again, you should bring along any data you have compiled.


You can say, ""I think a co-worker has an alcohol addiction. I was hoping I could speak to you about the right way to proceed.""

",How to Reduce the Risk of Breast Cancer Naturally," Overweight women are significantly more likely to develop breast cancer, and, when they do, they are also significantly more likely to die. The relationship between body weight and breast cancer rates become even stronger in post-menopausal women.;
, To reap the maximum benefits, exercise strenuously for a minimum of 45 to 60 minutes at least 5 days every week. In addition to aerobic exercise, strength training is important and should be done at least twice each week.

, Drinking as little as 2 glasses of alcohol per day can increase your risk of developing breast cancer by more than 20 percent.

, If you must use HRT, do so at the lowest possible dose and discontinue use as soon as you can.

, Research has shown that oral contraceptives increase your risk of breast cancer, and that risk continues for up to 10 years after you stop taking them.

, This lowers your estrogen levels, which in turn, lowers your breast cancer risk.

, If you do smoke, quit. If you are frequently around someone who smokes, encourage them to quit. Second hand smoke can increase your risk of developing breast cancer, particularly if you are frequently exposed after you have gone through menopause.

, Vitamin D deficiencies have been correlated with an increased breast cancer risk, so it is important to make sure that your body has a sufficient amount of vitamin D. During your next physical, ask your doctor to order a test to determine your vitamin D serum level. If it is low, you can increase it by increasing sun exposure, taking a supplement, or eating foods rich in vitamin D like salmon, mackerel, and catfish.

, You can do this by installing blackout shades in the bedroom. If you use a nightlight, use a red or low-wattage bulb. If you can, avoid turning on the light when you go to the bathroom. If you must use a light, using a lower wattage will decrease the risk.

, HCAs are chemicals that form on meats cooked at extremely high temperatures. They are most often found on meats that have been grilled, barbecued, smoked, or blackened. If you must eat meat that has been prepared this way, choose leaner cuts, use a meat thermometer to avoid overcooking, and use a lower temperature when grilling. Additionally, applying an herb marinade to the meat can reduce HCA levels.

Decide whether or not you get jealous of other’s achievements.,
Determine whether or not you compare yourself to others.,
Think about whether or not you only do things to make others happy.,
Figure out whether or not your self-worth comes from others.,
Determine whether or not you are a competitive person.",How to Know if You're Addicted to Praise1," One way to figure out if you are addicted to praise is to see if other people’s achievements cause you to become jealous. This can be jealousy when other people get recognized for something they did, or when someone gets praised for something similar to things you do.Be honest with yourself about your jealousy. Do you get upset, angry, or sad when someone else gets praise?
For example, you might feel jealous or upset that someone in your company got a promotion, even if you were not passed over for the same position, because the person received the elevation in status instead of you. You may also feel angry that someone's project at work got an award or special recognition from a superior.;
, If you are addicted to praise, you may compare yourself to others. This may happen if someone else gets acknowledged for something. After the person gets acknowledged, you may view anything that person in light of what you do.Do you compare your success to someone else’s? Think about how you feel when someone else is successful for something you also excel at.
Do you compare the praise someone else gets to the praise you get? Keep note of how often you view the praise you get in relation to that received by others.
You may focus on the wording, trying to decide if there are real ways to distinguish if your praise is better than the other person's praise. If you run a blog, you might compare statistics of your blog with someone else's. You will feel good if they are better, but feel lousy if they are worse.

, People who seek praise may refrain from doing things they want. Instead, they may only do things to please others and get praise.Do you only do things to please those around you? This might be dressing how others like, writing songs, music, or stories that others want to see, or ignoring your own ideas in favor of ideas that you know others might like instead.
For example, although you want to make Mexican food, you may make Italian instead because you know you will be praised for the lasagna more than the tacos. At work, despite wanting to do a campaign about sexism, you instead go with a light-hearted campaign to please the people around you.

, If you are addicted to praise, you may find yourself unhappy with what you have done until someone tells you it is good. You go seeking others’ approval to feel successful and good about yourself.Look at your behavior. When you finish a project, an activity, or even a meal, do you feel accomplished? Are you happy with the results?
Do you need someone to tell you that you did a good job before you can feel happy about what you have done?
For example, you may always ask people what they think of what you have done before you make up your own mind about what you have done. You ask your boss or your coworker what they think about your project before you determine it is good. If they don't like it, you don't like it. If you write a story, you send it to your writing group before you decide if it's good. If they like it, you like it, too.

, Sometimes, people who are addicted to praise are extremely competitive. This stems from needing to receive the praise over someone else.Do you feel the constant need to be better than someone else? Do you try to be the best so you can get the praise?
Do you dislike sharing responsibility or achievements with people? Do you hate sharing praise with others?
For example, you may always need to be the best at something. This means your goal is always to have the best project, make the best meal, or play the best piece of music so you get the most praise.

"
Consider whether or not you ever question praise.,
Examine your friends.,
Think about the rewards given while you were growing up.,
Decide whether or not you dislike criticism.,
Talk to family and friends.",How to Know if You're Addicted to Praise2," Someone who is addicted to praise generally doesn’t notice if he or she receives too much praise. If you are addicted to praise, you always want praise and can never get enough of it. Everything you do may be so you can get praise.It may help to ask yourself questions. Do you ever feel you’ve received too much praise? Or do you always want more?
Do you start to question the amount of praise you get? Do you feel suspicious that someone is just flattering you and not being honest? If you feel uncomfortable sometimes if you receive too much praise, you may not be as addicted as you believed.

, People who are addicted to praise keep people around them who feed their addiction. These friends might constantly feed a person’s ego, showering him with praise all day every day.Think about your friends. Do your friends continuously talk about how great you are? Do they refuse to tell you the truth about your life choices in favor or praising you?
Will your friends tell you the truth if you ask them? Do you ever ask your friends for the truth?
Do you find yourself going to your friends, seeking praise and reassurance?

, Many times, people who are addicted to praise were rewarded profusely during their childhood. These people often were given incentives for doing chores, getting good grades, eating their vegetables, behaving correctly, or participating in sports.Ask yourself: Did your parents reward you with positive things, like money, treats, gold stars, or presents, if you did well?
Did you get better rewards the better you performed?

, People who are addicted to praise often hate being criticized. This extends to constructive criticism or helpful feedback. Receiving any response that is not praise causes distress.Do you get angry, depressed, or upset if someone responds with anything less than praise?
Do you feel like a failure if you receive constructive criticism?
Do you get defensive easily when you receive feedback?

, Talk to your family and friends about your concerns. Ask them if they think you have a praise addiction. Tell them to be honest with you, and listen to them, even if they criticize you.


If you are uncomfortable asking, pay attention to your interactions with your family and friends. Do they always give you compliments? Do they ever disagree with you? Do they just shower you with empty praise?
See a therapist if you believe this might be a problem. A therapist might be able to help you fine tune your problem, discover the root, and deal with it.

Face your addiction.,
Focus on your progress.,
Find your intrinsic motivation.,
Trust yourself.",How to Know if You're Addicted to Praise3," The first step to getting over any addiction is admitting that you have one. Admit to yourself that you find validation in praise. Then recognize that this is problematic and that you will not find happiness this way.This may not be easy for you. You may not realize you are addicted to praise, or may not be ready to admit it. By facing your addiction, you can start to get over it.

, Instead of constantly seeking praise for what you’ve done, focus on the progress you make. Ignore whether you did a good or bad job. Instead, find satisfaction from making progress on your projects.This means setting goals for yourself. The goal is not to get praise or to do the best. The goal is completion of tasks. What do you want to accomplish?
For example, if you are trying to learn how to knit, instead of focusing on knitting a sweater everyone will love and praise you for, focus on completing a task. Finish the sweater and find satisfaction in completing it.

, One of the problems with being addicted to praise and positive reward systems is that people develop extrinsic motivation, meaning they only do things because they are getting rewarded. For a praise addict, this reward is more praise. Instead of worrying about the rewards, focus on why you doing a task. Find your motivation from within.For example, if you are a musician, you may only play to have others tell you how good you are. If you’ve never made it professionally and people don’t recognize your talent or praise you, you may give up. Instead of focusing on the extrinsic motivation, play music because it’s what you love. Find the motivation in yourself to keep playing. You probably didn’t start playing music to receive praise, so you should continue playing for enjoyment instead of the praise of others.

, One way to help your praise addiction is to trust yourself, your own abilities, and your own opinions. If someone criticizes you or gives you negative feedback, remember that he or she is not the expert or the person in the right. The criticizer is just one person with an opinion. You can value the criticizer's opinion and use it, or you can ignore it and trust yourself.


Even if you use the criticizer's opinion, use it because you trust yourself to make a reasonable decision about the validity of the other person’s opinion."
"
Ask for honest feedback.,
Stop seeking praise.,
Praise others.,
Refrain from giving yourself too much praise.",How to Know if You're Addicted to Praise4," Instead of surrounding yourself with people who give you blanket praise, find people who are honest with you. Ask them for honest feedback on your projects, work, or hobbies.Honest feedback and constructive criticism helps you become better at what you do. You can’t grow if you are surrounded by people who give you empty praise.

, One way to help you get over your praise addiction is to stop trying to get people to praise you. Most praise addicts have become adept at receiving praise without asking for it directly. Break yourself of this indirect or direct praise seeking habit.Don’t ask people how you did, how they like something you did, or even mention things you have done to others. Stop going to others for validation in your accomplishments.
You may need to avoid talking to certain people, like your friends who always give you praise.
You may want to spend a weekend focusing on yourself and staying away from others to eliminate your need for praise.

, Since praise addicts feel so much envy and jealousy, start trying to break those feelings by praising others when they deserve it. When someone you know succeeds, instead of feeling jealous, celebrate it.Celebrating someone else’s accomplishments can help you replace negative thought patterns with positive ones.

, Every accomplishment you finish does not need praise. Some things, like going to work or doing the dishes, should be normal behavior. Normal behavior shouldn’t be praised since it’s what you should be doing as part of your everyday life.Save praise for things that are above and beyond. Only give yourself praise when something extraordinary is accomplished.

Look for asymmetry.,
Check the border of your moles.,
Examine the color of your moles.,
Measure the diameter or your moles.,
Notice if any of your moles evolve.",How to Recognize Melanoma1," Symmetry means evenness or sameness. Melanomas will most likely be asymmetrical, meaning that the surface of the mole isn’t even. While having an asymmetrical mole doesn’t mean that you have a melanoma, you should get it checked because it’s a risk factor.Imagine a line down the center of your mole.
Compare the two sides of the mole. Consider the size of each half, the shape of the edges, the color, and how raised each side is.
If the two sides of the mole appear to match, then it’s symmetrical. If they don’t match up, then your mole is asymmetrical.;
, The border is the edge of the moles, which is where the colored part of the mole meets the rest of your skin. Melanomas usually have uneven borders, unlike benign moles, which have smooth borders.Uneven borders can include vague borders, which means that the melanoma edges won’t be clearly defined.

A smooth border does not mean that it will look like a perfect circle; rather, a smooth border will not have a jagged edge or be misshapen.
Melanoma borders may be notched or scalloped., A benign mole will have a consistent color, while a melanoma may have more than one color. For example, a melanoma could be a mixture of tan, brown and black. In some cases, a melanoma will take on shades of red, white, or blue., Benign moles are usually smaller in size than melanomas. Typical melanomas will be larger than a pencil eraser, which is about ¼ inch (6 millimeters).

Don’t dismiss a suspicious mole just because it is small. In the early stages, a melanoma can be small.If a mole grows at all, even if it’s still small, get it checked by your doctor.
Have your doctor check any moles larger than ¼ inch (6 millimeters), regardless of whether or not it has other signs of melanoma., Watch for changes to your mole, including size, color, shape, and becoming raised. Any other issues, such as itching or bleeding, are also a concern.If the mole or blemish grows rapidly in size, have it checked out immediately by your doctor, don’t wait."
"
Check if the mole is elevated.,
Feel if the mole is firm.,
Notice if the mole grows.",How to Recognize Melanoma2," Nodular melanomas, which make up about 20% of cases, don’t follow the ABCDE rule. Luckily, they do have common features that help you identify them, such as being elevated. Check for moles that feel like a bump. Compared to other moles, they will feel raised., Benign moles usually feel like the rest of your skin, so a mole that is hard is questionable. A nodular melanoma will be firm to the touch.Use your finger to check the firmness of your moles. Check with your doctor if a mole feels hard.

, Any mole growth is suspicious, even if it’s your only symptom. If you have rapid mole growth, then you need to make an appointment with the doctor. Nodular melanomas grow quickly, so they need to be addressed as soon as possible."
"
Check for moles that look different.,
Notice new moles or lesions.,
Determine if moles or lesions are symptomatic.",How to Recognize Melanoma3," The ugly duckling method is especially useful for people who have a lot of moles, particularly if some of those moles are benign irregular moles. Because melanomas look different from regular moles, compare all of your moles to each other. Any mole that looks different from the rest is suspicious and needs to be checked.Consider the size and shape of your moles to see if one is bigger or smaller. The suspicious mole should stand out in appearance from the others.
Look at the color of your moles to check for an odd one. For example, if all of your moles are dark brown, but a light brown mole has appeared, then get that one checked out.
A suspicious mole may have more than one color and up to three, brown, light brown and purplish.

, Anytime you get a new mole or lesion, have it checked out. Sometimes a new mole is benign, but it’s also a risk factor for melanomas.

New moles or lesions are more questionable if you don’t have many moles. People with few moles are less likely to develop a new one that is benign.
New moles can be more questionable in elderly people., Symptomatic moles have issues that are atypical of normal moles, such as bleeding, itching, or hurting. If you have one mole that starts to show symptoms, make an appointment to get it checked."
"
Notice if a sore doesn’t heal.,
Look for moles with color that spreads out from the mole.,
Check for redness and swelling around the mole.,
Notice tender, itchy, or painful moles.,
Check for changes in the surface of the mole.",How to Recognize Melanoma4," If a sore or pimple isn’t improving or continues to reappear in the same location, then it’s time to see a doctor. Your melanoma may look like a regular pimple or damaged skin, but you’ll notice that it doesn’t respond to typical treatment products., Melanomas sometimes look like the color is bleeding out from the mole into the other skin. For example, a red mole may have a pink area around it, or a dark brown mole may be surrounded by light brown skin.Also look for a purplish blue color in the blemish or mole., You may notice that one or more of your moles looks puffy or irritated, similar to a bug bite. This swelling is a symptom of a melanoma, so you should get that mole checked.

The swelling could be minute rather than a lump, so don’t dismiss a slightly raised area.
The redness could be pink rather than a dark red., A melanoma will feel different from a normal mole. Use your fingers to feel your moles and the area around them to see if they feel sore or hurt. If a mole begins to itch, make a note of it. Keep track of how often it itches. If you notice the issue continuing for a few days, make an appointment with your doctor., The skin over your mole may undergo changes, even if the size and color stay the same. Your skin may feel scaly or develop a bump. You may also notice oozing or bleeding on your mole."

Recognise the main abdominal symptoms.,
Be aware of feeling bloated.,
Consider if you have difficulty swallowing.,
Act if you have chronic nausea.,
Consider more general cancer symptoms.",How to Recognize Stomach Cancer1," Your stomach is part of your upper digestive system and it helps to process the nutrients in the food that you eat. After leaving the stomach, food goes into your small intestine, and then into your large intestine.The main potential symptoms of stomach cancer can be divided into those which directly affect your abdomen, and those which are more general.The abdominal symptoms which typically present earliest include heartburn and indigestion. Heartburn (or dyspepsia), a burning sensation in the chest and upper abdomen, results from regurgitation of acid into the esophagus.
A tumor in the stomach will often lead to improper breakdown of food in the stomach, which, in turn, can lead to burping and other symptoms of indigestion.
Just because you experience these symptoms doesn’t mean you have cancer, but if you experience them frequently, speak to a doctor.;
, Stomach cancer can cause abdominal swelling, which can cause frequent bloating. You may feel bloated after eating, and might feel unusually full even after eating only a small amount of food. Feeling bloated can be one of the early symptoms of stomach cancer.

Stomach pain, and pain in your sternum (breast bone) can be associated with stomach causes.If you find yourself frequently feeling full and bloated, and are experiencing some of the other early symptoms, visit your doctor., If you are having difficulty swallowing, it is possible that this is being caused by a tumor at the junction of your esophagus and stomach.A tumor here can obstruct food, causing dysphagia (difficulty swallowing).
, In stomach cancer cases, obstructions may exist at the junction of the stomach and the intestine, blocking the passage of food. This could indicate a tumor at the junction of the stomach and intestine. The most obvious symptom that this is occurring will be chronic nausea and even vomiting.Vomit in rare cases may be in streaked with blood. If you are vomiting and you see blood, make an appointment to see a doctor immediately., You may experience more general symptoms that are not specifically related to your stomach, but can nevertheless indicate a problem and may suggest a more aggressive or progressive cancer growth. Be sure to check your lymph nodes. Enlarged lymph nodes are a symptom of a number of illnesses. In the case of (stomach) cancer, cancer cells will travel from the stomach (or wherever the tumor is located) through the lymph ducts, to the left axillary lymph nodes. This then causes swelling.

Look out for signs of cachexia (decrease in muscle mass). Cancer cells will increase your basal metabolic rate, which will then result in a wasting of muscle.
Loss of blood from the cancer can result in anemia, which may cause paleness and weakness.
People with cancer may have chronic fatigue, a feeling of lethargy, or trouble staying alert."
"
Note increasing abdominal pain or discomfort.,
Evaluate your appetite.,
Checks for lumps and swelling in your stomach.,
Look for symptoms in your stool and changes in bowel patterns.",How to Recognize Stomach Cancer2," Pain or discomfort in the abdomen or stomach will intensify as a cancer progresses and a tumor grows. The pain associated with stomach cancer will generally increase in intensity over time, and will not subside with medication.Stomach tumors can compress surrounding structures, while ulcerative cancer can erode the stomach's membranes. Both of these two things can cause stomach pain.

, Cancer cells secrete substances that diminish the body's hunger signals. This, combined with a tumor tricking your stomach into feeling full, can lead to a distinct loss of appetite.As a result, as cancer progresses, a patient can suffer severe weight loss. If you think you are losing your appetite and losing weight for no reason, keep a record of your weight loss and talk to your doctor., Over time more fluid will build up in your stomach and you may begin to notice lumps and swelling in your stomach.In cancer of the stomach, patients may feel a hard, irregular lump in the abdomen. This lump will move with breathing, and may fall forward when you bend over.

A developed cancer may cause a hard mass in the left-upper abdomen in the area of the stomach., When stomach cancer reaches more advanced stages, it can cause continuous bleeding, which is lost as excrement. This will result in bloody or black stools. Check for blood in your stools after going to the bathroom. Look to see if they are very dark, and black like tar.If you experience constipation or diarrhea, this can be a symptom of stomach cancer.Always be completely open when discussing any symptoms in your waste with a doctor.

"
"
Consider your age, gender and ethnicity.,
Evaluate your lifestyle.,
Understand your personal and family medical history.,
Talk to your doctor.",How to Recognize Stomach Cancer3," Some potential risk factors are to do with the healthiness of your lifestyle, but there are some things that you cannot influence or change. There is a significant increase in the rates of stomach cancer of those over 50, and most of those diagnosed are between 60 and 80 years old. Stomach cancer is also more common in men than in women.

In the US, stomach cancer is more common in Hispanic Americans, African Americans, and Asian/Pacific Islanders than it is in non-Hispanic white Americans.
People who live in Japan, China, Southern and Eastern Europe, and South and Central America are more likely to get stomach cancer than people who live elsewhere., There are significant potential risks associated with your lifestyle and diet. Smoking and drinking alcohol increase the risk of stomach cancer by introducing harmful substances into the body. A diet low in fiber increases the risk of stomach cancer by lengthening the body's exposure time to the carcinogens present in food. Long-term consumption of salted, dried, and smoked food items with high levels of nitrates also elevates your risk.It is thought that being overweight or obese may be a cause of cancers of the cardia (the upper part of the stomach).
If you work in the coal, metal, or rubber industry, your risk of stomach cancer may be higher. Workers in these fields are exposed to more carcinogens than workers in other industries., Keep a close record of your personal medical history, and be aware of previous illnesses and treatments you may have had that could increase your chance of later developing stomach cancer. Be especially vigilant if you have a history of Helicobacter pylori infections, chronic gastritis, atrophic gastritis, pernicious anemia, or gastric polyps, as all of these conditions predispose you to stomach cancer.Stomach cancers are more likely to develop in those who have previously had part of their stomach removed in surgery.
Stomach cancer runs in families, so find out about your family medical history. However, keep in mind that adopting lifestyle changes, such as following a healthier diet, can help to reduce your risk.
If you have a close relative who was diagnosed with stomach cancer, you are at a greater risk than someone who has no family history of stomach cancer., If you are unsure of, or worried about, your risk of developing stomach cancer, get in touch with your doctor. A doctor can help you evaluate your existing risk, as well as give you advice on modifying your lifestyle to help you lower your risk in the future. An early diagnosis can make a big difference to a prognosis, so act quickly if you are concerned."

Pay attention to blood in your stool.,
Notice changes in your bowel movements.,
Be aware of abdominal pain and bloating.,
Notice changes in your appetite.,
Determine whether you are uncharacteristically fatigued.,
Know if you are at risk for colon cancer.,
Get regular screenings.",How to Recognize Colon Cancer Symptoms," If you have ongoing rectal bleeding that doesn't seem to be a result of hemorrhoids or a tear, it's a good idea to go to the doctor and get checked out.Blood in the stool is a common symptom of colon cancer.;
, If you are experiencing persistent diarrhea and constipation, that's something to look into. Blood in stools, which may cause the stool to darken is a big warning sign to colon issues. People with colon cancer may also have long, pencil-shaped stools. The feeling of not being able to completely empty your bowels has also been reported.Pay attention to patterns you notice with your bowel movements. If things seem to feel different - you experience rectal cramping, you don't have bowel movements with the same regularity, and your stools look different - make an appointment with your doctor.
These symptoms do not necessarily indicate that you have colon cancer. Similar symptoms are experienced by people with irritable bowel syndrome and a host of other medical ailments.

, These symptoms go along with the uncomfortable changes you might experience in your bowel movements. If you have pain in your abdominal region as well as bloating that doesn't seem to have another cause, see your doctor.Pelvic pain is also experienced by people experiencing the later stages of colon cancer.
Again, these symptoms are shared by many other illnesses, so having them doesn't necessarily indicate you have colon cancer. Still, it's a good idea to get them checked out.

, People with colon cancer may experience a loss of appetite, along with unexplained weight loss. If you're losing the desire to eat full meals and don't enjoy foods you used to eat, colon cancer may be the culprit. Pay attention to changes in your weight, especially if it seems to slide steadily down without effort on your part.

, This is a common symptoms of many types of cancer, colon cancer included. If you feel deeply tired and weak in conjunction with the other colon cancer symptoms, see your doctor right away., Age is the leading factor when it comes to risk, as the majority of people who get colon cancer are over the age of fifty. However, there are several other factors that can play a part.They include:


Being African American. African Americans are at greater risk than other races.
Having a personal history of colon cancer or polyps.
Having an inherited syndrome that can lead to colon cancer, such as familial adenomatous polyposis and hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (Lynch syndrome).
Leading a sedentary lifestyle. Getting more exercise can help reduce your risk.
Eating a low-fiber, high fat diet. Changing your diet to include more fruits and vegetables and less fat and meat can help reduce your risk.
Having diabetes or obesity can increase your risk.
Smoking and drinking alcohol can increase your risk.

, More than 95% of colorectal cancers come from adenocarcinoma polyps. These cancers start in cells that form mucus glands, which lubricate the colon and rectum. Carcinoid tumors, gastrointestinal stromal tumors and lymphomas also cause 5% of colon cancers. The best way to prevent colon cancer is to undergo regular screening tests after the age of 50 to determine whether cancerous or precancerous growths are present. The doctor will perform one or more of the following procedures to determine whether you have colon cancer:


A fecal occult blood test (FOBT), to check for hidden blood in the stools.
A sigmoidoscopy, in which a lighted instrument called a sygmoidoscope is used to check for polyps and growths in the rectum and lower colon.
A colonoscopy, in which a colonoscope is used to examine the entire colon for cancerous or precancerous growths, which are removed and biopsied if found.
A virtual colonoscopy or double contrast barium enema (DCBE), which are different types of x-rays that show polyps and growths on the colon.

Consider your number of sexual partners.One of the biggest risk factors for HPV related cancers is your number of sexual partners and, in particular, high risk sexual partners.,
Practice safe sex.Since sexual intercourse (and skin-to-skin contact of the genitals) is the way in which HPV is passed from one person to another, safe sexual practices is key as a way to reduce your risk of developing HPV related cancer.,
Quit smoking.Smoking is a risk factor for many cancers, including HPV related cancers.,
Note that oral contraceptive use can put you at higher risk.Oral contraceptives (birth control pills) have been linked to a higher risk for developing HPV related cancer.,
Treat any other sexually transmitted infections.If you have any other STIs, such as chlamydia or gonorrhoea, your risk of becoming infected with HPV goes up.,
Be aware of other risk factors for HPV related cancers.For reasons that are incompletely understood by the medical community, the more full-term pregnancies you have, the higher your risk of cervical cancer.,
Optimize your overall health.Maintaining a healthy weight, eating a healthy diet high in fruits and vegetables, and decreasing overall stress have all been correlated to better health and to a reduced risk of developing cancer, including HPV related cancers.",How to Reduce HPV Related Cancer Risks1," This is because you must have one of the specific cancer-predisposing strains of HPV, which is a sexually transmitted infection, in order to (down the road) develop an HPV related cancer.


The more sexual partners you have in your life, the greater your chance of contracting one of the cancer-predisposing strains of HPV.
Also, the more sexual partners that the person you are having sex with has had, the ""higher risk"" they are as a partner because they then carry a heightened risk of being infected themselves.;
, Your best bet is to always use a condom, to reduce the amount of genital contact and bodily fluids exchanged between you and your partner.


Note that men who have sex with men are at higher risk. This is a risk factor to be aware of; however, it is one that cannot be changed as you cannot change your sexuality.
People who have other health problems leading to a compromised immune system (such as those with HIV/AIDS) are also at higher risk.

, Therefore, if you can quit smoking, you will effectively reduce your risk. If you are interested in quitting smoking and would like support, book an appointment with your family doctor.


Your family doctor can offer you nicotine replacement options to help to tame your cravings as you quit smoking.
Your doctor may also offer you medications (such as Wellbutrin or Bupropion) that can be helpful in the process of quitting smoking.

, However, preventing unwanted pregnancies is key, so the benefits of taking birth control pills for you may very well outweigh the cons. Another option to consider, however, is getting an IUD (intrauterine device) inserted, as an IUD actually reduces your risk of HPV related factors (it seems to have a protective effect, for reasons that are not yet fully understood by the medical community).


In terms of IUDs, you can either opt for the Mirena IUD (which is hormone based), or the copper IUD (which is not hormone-based). Your doctor can go over each of these options with you in detail, if you are interested.
If you do opt for standard birth control pills, your risk for developing HPV related cancers goes back to normal 10 years after stopping the pills. Therefore, taking the pills for a short time in your younger years may not lead to problems down the road.

, This is because your immune system is busy handling other infections, and thus less able to prevent HPV.


Ask your doctor for regular STI testing, and treat any infections that are picked up immediately.
This will optimize your sexual health and reduce your risk of HPV and subsequent HPV related cancers.

, This may be related to the fact that women with more pregnancies are more likely to have had unprotected sexual intercourse (thus increasing their chances of contracting HPV); it has also been hypothesized to be related to the hormones during pregnancy, which may possibly increase your risk of cervical cancer.


Another risk factor for HPV related cancers is DES (Diethylstilbestrol).
This is a hormonal drug that used to be given in hopes of preventing miscarriage; it is no longer prescribed by physicians due to the risk.

, Prioritize your overall health and wellbeing, and you will reap the benefits down the road.

Receive regular Pap screening starting at age 21.In order to reduce your risk of HPV related cancer (in this case, cervical cancer, which is caused by HPV), it is important to see your family doctor for regular Pap tests beginning at the age of 21, and every 3 years thereafter (more frequently if an abnormality is detected).,
Know what to expect when you go for a Pap test.When you receive a Pap test, a speculum (a plastic or metal device) is inserted into your vagina.,
Follow up with any concerning results as directed by your physician.If your Pap test does come back with concerning or suspicious results, you may need to have another Pap test in the near future.",How to Reduce HPV Related Cancer Risks2," The purpose of the Pap test is to take a sample of cells from around your cervix, which will subsequently be examined under the microscope to look for any abnormalities that could be indicative of or concerning for cancer.


A new test that is becoming available is something called ""HPV co-testing.""
HPV co-testing may be done when you get your Pap test. What it does is it looks specifically for the presence of the HPV virus (as opposed to simply looking for abnormal cells that may be cancerous or precancerous).
Because the HPV co-testing option is relatively new, there are no definitive guidelines around it yet.
If you receive HPV co-testing with your Pap test, you may be able to prolong your screening interval from every 3 years to every 5 years.
Note that women over the age of 65 no longer need to be screened, unless they fall into a ""high risk"" category.
Note also that women who have received a total hysterectomy (who have had their uterus removed) no longer need to receive Pap tests.

, The speculum is then opened so that your doctor can centre it around your cervix, and a sample of cells is then taken from your cervix.


The cell sample will be sent into the lab for formal analysis under the microscope.
When your doctor hears back about your results, he or she will let you know whether they are normal, or whether any further investigations or repeat testing are needed.
Note that it is best to plan your Pap test for a time when you are not on your period. Having your period may cloud the results, and you may need to come back in for a repeat test, so it is best to simply avoid doing it while on your period altogether.

, If your results are highly suspicious, or if you get two abnormal results in a row, your doctor may proceed to something called ""colposcopy,"" which is where an instrument is used to directly visualize your cervix to get a more clear picture of what is going on.


Being diligent around going for Pap tests and any follow up tests as needed will play a huge role in reducing your risk of HPV related cancers.
Prevention and early detection are key, as most HPV related cancers can be effectively treated and oftentimes cured if caught early enough.

See if you are eligible to receive the HPV vaccine.The HPV vaccine is relatively new and is currently available to women under the age of 26, and to men who fall into ""high risk"" categories.,
Understand what the HPV vaccine protects you against.,
Choose between Gardasil and Cervarix.There are currently two HPV vaccines available - Gardasil and Cervarix.,
Continue with regular Pap tests even if you have been vaccinated.Because the vaccine is relatively new and medical researchers do not yet have enough data to determine exactly how effective it is, it is recommended to continue with Pap tests as per usual even if you have been vaccinated.",How to Reduce HPV Related Cancer Risks3," It is ideal to receive the vaccine at age 11 or 12 (this is the age group for which it is generally recommended). This is to ensure that the vaccine is administered well before the onset of sexual activity, as this is what makes it most effective.


Note, however, that it is better to get it even after you have had sex as it still diminishes your risk, just not as much as if you had received it earlier.
Note that the HPV vaccine cannot cure HPV that is already present, nor can it cure lesions of the cervix that may be precursors for cervical cancer (or lesions elsewhere that may be precursors for HPV related cancer).

, In addition to cervical cancer, women can also get vulvar cancer, anal cancer, and oral cancer all related to HPV. The vaccine (particularly if received early enough in life) works to protect you against all of these HPV related cancers.


For men, it can protect against penile cancer, anal cancer, and oral cancer.
Men can get the vaccine if they have sex with men, or have compromised immune systems (such as those with organ transplants or HIV/AIDS), and if they are under the age of 26.

, Gardasil covers against 4 strains of HPV - namely, strains 6, 11, 16, and 18. In this way, it is protective against the strains of HPV that predispose you to cervical cancer (and to other HPV related cancers), as well as being protective against the strains of HPV that cause genital warts, which is an added bonus of this vaccine. Cervarix is the other vaccine option. It covers for HPV strains 16 and 18, so it is protective against HPV related cancers (particularly cervical cancer) but not against genital warts.


Both Gardasil and Cervarix require 3 vaccines in total.
The second shot is received 1-2 months after the first, and the third shot is received 6 months after the first.
All three shots must be received for the vaccine to have optimum efficacy.

, With time and as more evidence around the vaccine's effectiveness becomes available, Pap test screening recommendations may be reduced for women who have been vaccinated. However, there have been no alterations to the screening guidelines to date.

"
"
Know which HPV related cancers men are at risk for.Although HPV related cancers are most commonly thought of in association to women (as cervical cancer in women is by far the most prevalent HPV related cancer), men can be affected as well.,
Get immunized if you are at higher risk.The Gardasil vaccine is currently recommended for men who have sex with men, and for men whose immune systems are otherwise compromised (such as those with HIV/AIDS, organ transplants, or other severe autoimmune conditions).,
See a physician if you notice any suspicious signs or symptoms.For men and women alike, if you notice any unusual lumps or bumps around your anal area, your oral area, or (for men) on your penis, it is important to have these looked at by a doctor.",How to Reduce HPV Related Cancer Risks4," The HPV related cancers that may affect men include penile cancer, anal cancer, and oral cancer.

, The vaccine is not currently recommended for men in general, due to the overall low risk of men getting HPV related cancers, so current guidelines suggest it only for higher risk groups.

, This way, you can rule out the possibility of cancer (or have your doctor diagnose it and treat it in the earliest stage possible, while it is still curable).

Get a diagnosis from the doctor.",How to Recognize Skin Cancer," Make it easier for you to examine your body for any spots, moles, or bumps by standing in front of a large full body mirror. Do this in a room with good light. If you have access to a full body mirror that is on a stand, this would work best.You may also want to have a small hand mirror close by to make it easier for you to examine specific areas on your body.
You can also ask someone to help you examine your body up close, such as a partner or a family member.;
, When you examine your body, look for spots, moles, or bumps that could be cancerous. Moles are often brown or black in color and may appear as one or in a cluster. Spots and bumps may appear red, brown, or black.


Check for any spots or bumps that are new on your body as well as spots, moles, or bumps that you have had for a long time.
You may have birthmarks on your body that are at risk of becoming cancerous, so they should also be checked.

, Stand in front of the mirror with your arms raised at your sides. You can be naked or wear underwear. Look at your chest and stomach for any spots, moles, or bumps. Bend your elbows and check your forearms. Then, lift your arms and examine your underarms and armpits. Make sure you also check your wrists, fingers, and palms.You should also examine your face, neck and scalp. Make sure you look at the front and the back of your neck. Use the small hand mirror to examine your scalp, parting your hair as you do so.

, Stand in front of the mirror with your back to it and look over your shoulder. Examine your lower back as well as your butt. Then, sit down on a chair and check the front and back of your legs. Look at the tops of your feet.You should also lift up your feet and check the soles of your feet. Look at each toe as well as between each toe.

, Start by examining the spot for any shades of brown or black. Some cancerous spots will have patches of pink, red, white, or blue. They are usually not the same color all over.You may also notice a mole or birthmark where one part is not the same color as the other part.

, Look at the border of the spot to see if they appear irregular, ragged, blurred, or notched. Notice if the spot is ¼ inch across or larger, about the size of the pencil eraser. The shape of the spot may also change over time, becoming larger., The spot may be irritated or swollen, or become more so over time. It may also painful or tender to the touch.You should also take note if the spot starts to ooze, bleed, or becomes scaly.
Sometimes, cancerous spots become red or tender beyond the border of the mole or birthmark.

, Notice if you develop a spot that does not heal or scab over. The spot may also appear different in size, color, and texture than other spots on your body, such as a mole or birthmark., Different skin cancers appear in different areas and have different appearances. For instance:Basal cell carcinoma usually occurs on areas of the skin exposed to the sun, like the neck or face. It appears as a pearly or waxy bump, or a flat flesh-colored or brown scar-like lesion.
Squamous cell carcinoma also occurs on areas of the skin exposed to the sun, such as the ears, face, and hands. It appears as a firm, red nodule or a flat lesion with a scaly, crusted surface.
Melanoma can develop anywhere on the body. Signs include a large brown spot with darker speckles; a mole that changes in color or size; a small lesion with irregular borders and areas of red, white, blue, or blue-black; and dark lesions on your palms, finger tips, the soles of your feet, or toes.

, If you are concerned about certain spots on your body, make an appointment with your doctor. The doctor can then examine the spots more closely. They will look for moles, birthmarks, or spots that could be cancerous.You will need to remove your clothing so the doctor can do the physical exam of your entire body, from head to toe.

, The doctor may do a biopsy on any suspicious spots, moles, or bumps. They will take a small sample of the spot and bring it to a lab for testing.The biopsy will allow the doctor to determine if cancerous cells are present, and if so, what type of cancer is present.

, If the doctor confirms you have skin cancer, they will do more tests to determine the stage of the cancer. The doctor will then recommend treatment based on the stage of the cancer.The main form of treatment for skin cancer is surgery to remove the cancerous spot or spots. In some cases where the cancer covers a wide area of your skin, you may also need radiotherapy or chemotherapy.

Avoid radiation exposure, especially while young.,
Don't become iodine deficient.,
Get a blood test for gene mutations.,
See your doctor for regular thyroid screenings.,
Be especially cautious if you're a female of childbearing age.,
Get surgery for low-risk thyroid cancer.,
Have radioactive iodine therapy if the cancer has spread.,
Consider radiation therapy for recurrent thyroid tumors.",How to Prevent Thyroid Cancer," The best known primary risk factor for developing thyroid cancer is excessive exposure to radiation, particularly during childhood.The cells of the thyroid gland (and most other glands) are very sensitive to x-rays and other forms of radiation, and easily destroyed or mutated if exposed to it. The growing and immature glandular tissue of children is even more susceptible to radiation.


X-rays and CT scans should be minimized in children and only used if absolutely needed to diagnose a threatening condition or disease.
When x-rays or other radiological studies are necessary, the lowest dose of radiation that still provides a clear picture should always be used.
Other sources of radiation to be aware of include living near nuclear power plants (within 10 miles) and very frequently flying at high altitudes in commercial airplanes.;
, Iodine deficiency isn't very common in most developed countries because the mineral is typically added to table salt, but deficiency can and does lead to an increased risk of thyroid cancer in other less developed regions of the world.The regions most at risk are places inland without much access to fresh fish and/or shellfish, which contain lots of iodine.


The thyroid gland needs a steady supply of iodine to function properly and make it's hormones, such as thyroxine.
Iodine deficiency causes the thyroid gland to swell initially (known as goiter), but chronic (long-term) deficiency promotes nodules and increases the risk of cancer.
If you avoid common table salt due to hypertension (chronically high blood pressure), then make sure to eat fish / shellfish regularly or take an iodine supplement.

, Another major risk factor for developing thyroid cancer is having a gene mutation that causes familial medullary thyroid cancer (MTC).A blood test can be performed at your doctor's office to look for the inherited mutation on the RET gene. If it's found, the most common recommendation is to remove the thyroid gland completely, which effectively prevents the possibility of cancer starting.


Removing the thyroid in children who carry the mutated gene likely prevents aggressive cancer that carries a high risk of being fatal.
People who have the gene mutation have a greater than 90% chance of developing thyroid cancer.If one parent has the gene mutation, their children have a 50% chance of inheriting it.
Once MTC is discovered within a family, all the other family members (especially children) should be tested for the mutated RET gene.
Mutations in the RET gene can also trigger papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), which is a little different than MTC.

, Since thyroid cancer is relatively slow growing, there's often time to catch it in its very early stages. Most cases of thyroid cancer are found when people see their doctors because of neck lumps or nodules that they notice.Even still, the good news is that about 90% of thyroid nodules are benign growths and not cancerous, so treatment is not needed.Many cases of thyroid cancer can be found early due to advances in technology, such as more sensitive forms of of x-ray, ultrasound, MRI and CT scans.
Some cancer doctors (oncologists) recommend self-exams at least twice yearly and medical screening exams once yearly.
Take a look at the front of your neck in a mirror and try to notice any swelling or lumpiness. Feel your neck above your larynx (which is made of cartilage) for any hard nodules or lumps.

, You can't ""prevent"" your gender or age, but be aware that women are 3x more likely than men to develop thyroid cancer and about 65% of cases occur during childbearing years (20-45 years).If you are in this demographic, then you should be a little more vigilant with self-exams and getting your yearly screening for thyroid cancer (as well as breast and cervical cancers).


Aside from nodules or a swollen neck, other potential signs and symptoms of thyroid cancer include: changes to your voice (increasing hoarseness), difficulty swallowing, neck / throat pain, swollen lymph nodes, sudden weight gain or loss, feeling too hot or cold while indoors.If imaging (ultrasound, CT scan, PET scan) suggests thyroid cancer, your doctor may suggest taking a biopsy (tissue sample) of the gland through a long thin needle to examine under a microscope and make sure.

, The vast majority of people with low-risk thyroid cancer (meaning it hasn't spread beyond the gland) can be cured by surgically removing it.Removing the entire gland is called a thyroidectomy, whereas a lobectomy refers to removing the section which has the cancer growing in it.


Depending on the size and extent of the cancer, surgeons can use several different techniques which are much less invasive than they used to be — so the risks are fewer and the recovery is quicker.
As noted above, surgical removal is also used as a preventative strategy if there's evidence of a gene mutation or hereditary condition that significantly increases the likelihood of thyroid cancer.
Removing any enlarged lymph nodes in your neck is commonly done along with thyroidectomy.
If you have your thyroid removed, you'll need to take medication (Levothroid, Synthroid) for the rest of your life to compensate for the lack of thyroid hormones being made in your body.

, If your thyroid cancer is considered higher risk, meaning it's likely spread (metastasized) beyond the boundaries of the gland, then your doctor will likely recommend radioactive iodine therapy after a thyroidectomy.Radioactive iodine is absorbed by both normal and cancerous thyroid cells, which destroys them and prevents the cancer coming back.


Typically, just 1-2 two doses of radioactive iodine (given as a liquid or a pill) are needed to destroy all remaining thyroid tissue.
Some types of thyroid cancer cells (such as medullary thyroid and anaplastic thyroid carcinomas) don't absorb radioactive iodine well, so the therapy is not recommended.
Side effects are fairly common and usually include: nausea, dry mouth / eyes, reduced sense of smell and neck / chest pain.

, Despite surgery and radioactive iodine, some stubborn and aggressive forms of thyroid cancer return and need to be dealt with by other methods. Radiation therapy is an option for recurrent thyroid tumors and involves using a machine that aims high-energy beams at precise points on your neck / thyroid area.Radiation therapy is usually administered a few minutes at a time, 5 days a week, for approximately 5-6 weeks.
There is a ""catch-22"" with radiation therapy for cancer. Although it kills cells (both cancerous and normal types), it also increases the risk of mutation in surviving cells, which can lead to new types of cancer.
Although chemotherapy is rarely used to treat thyroid cancer, it's sometimes combined with radiation therapy to treat patients with metastasis — when the cancer spreads from the thyroid to other parts of the body, such as lung or bone."

Stop smoking.,
Reduce alcohol intake radically.,
Lose weight.,
Limit red meat and poultry with skin on.,
Limit processed meats.",How to Prevent Pancreatic Cancer1," The best way to prevent pancreatic cancer is to reduce the risk factors that you have control over. One of the most important controllable risk factors is smoking. Smokers are twice as likely to get pancreatic cancer as those who do not. Research suggests this is because the cancerous elements from cigarettes enter your blood, which damages the pancreas.Quit smoking to help lower your risk of pancreatic cancer. If you don't already smoke, you should not start. You can quit smoking through many different methods, such as:


Use support groups. You can find a Nicotine Anonymous group or other support groups in your area through the American Lung Association. You can also find telephone-based support groups.Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), such as patches, nasal spray, gum, lozenges, and inhalers. These are not safe for pregnant women or those with heart disease.
Prescription medications, which will be prescribed by your doctor. These include Bupropion (Zyban) and Varenicline (Chantix).;
, A high alcohol intake can increase your risk for pancreatic cancer. Furthermore, cirrhosis, which can be caused by alcohol abuse, has been linked with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer.It is very important that you limit your daily alcohol consumption. If you don't drink, don't start, and alcohol should not be an everyday occurrence. Dietary guidelines suggest that you should have no more than one drink per day if you are female and no more than two drinks per day if you are male.


Limit the amount that you drink per week to avoid liver and pancreas damage., One of the risk factors of pancreatic cancer is obesity. You can start losing weight through exercise and a healthy meal plan. Ask your doctor for an exercise plan and food menu that will work for your particular situation.The suggested recommendation for exercise from the American Heart Association is 150 minutes of moderate or 75 minutes of intense exercise per week. This should be spread out over a few days., Preliminary research shows that too much red meat may be linked with a higher risk of pancreatic cancer, especially in men.Limit red meats in your diet, having them once or twice a week. Instead of red meat, eat more fish and skinless poultry.


If you have a higher risk of pancreatic cancer because of family history, you may want to limit it to once every few weeks or cut it out entirely.Always take the skin off your poultry because it has high levels of fat.
Eat more nutrient rich fish, such as cod, salmon, tuna, and haddock. These foods have omega-3 fatty acids, which are essential to your health., The consumption of processed meats has been shown to increase your risk of pancreatic cancer. Processed meats are any meats that have been changed to extend its shelf-life, such as smoking, curing, adding excessive salts or preservatives. To lower possible risk of pancreatic cancer, limit or eliminate your intake of processed meats, such as sausage, bacon, hot dogs, salami, beef jerky, and ham.If you want to eat these kinds of foods, look for all natural, uncured meats without preservatives, such as nitrates.

Have a physical exam.,
Get blood drawn.,
Get an abdominal ultrasound.,
Get an endoscopic ultrasound.,
Have a computed tomography (CT) scan.",How to Prevent Pancreatic Cancer2," When you go in for a physical exam, especially if you have a family history of pancreatic cancer or are having symptoms you cannot explain he or she will check for indications of pancreatic cancer. Take a serious warning from non-specific symptoms, such as: unexplained tiredness, nagging abdominal or middle back pains, especially with nausea, bloating, loss of appetite, and significant, unexplained weight loss. There are other physical symptoms, such as masses/tumors or fluid buildup in your abdomenal cavity (ascites), which may be caused by gallbladder or liver inflammation (perhaps cirrhosis) and is possibly from pancreatic cancer spreading:Examining the whites of your eyes and your skin for jaundice (commonly called ""yellow jaundice"") may reveal yellowing of these areas due to bile (elevated bilirubin in blood count).
If you have jaundice, it may be because of a tumor at the head of your pancreas that has blocked the bile duct or merely a gallstone. It is necessary to ascertain the cause/kind of obstruction of the bile duct. If here is a tumor in the head of the pancreas, then to open the flow of bile they may put in a stent, and if so, it may later become clogged, so watch for a return of your jaundice.

If that tumor is cancerous, they might also be able to remove the tumor (Whipple procedure, major surgery), or it may not be operable, as when it has spread to the liver, abdominal/peritoneal lining, lymph-system/-nodes, or has encased crucial nerves and/or blood vessels near the pancreas.


Checking around your collarbone or around the neck region the doctor may find swollen lymph nodes, which can be from various causes or because of pancreatic cancer spreading through them.

, If your doctor is unsure about the cause of your symptoms, this will call for taking blood to check your levels. The blood can be checked for proper liver chemicals, including ammonia, tumor markers (typically CA19-9), and to measure pancreatic hormones.Blood tests will help to find or rule out other causes of your symptoms as well.

, If the doctor is unclear about the cause of abdominal pain, or if you want a less expensive test first, and may perform an abdominal ultrasound to look for anything unusual that might indicate whether your pain is caused by a pancreatic cancer or other tumor in the abdomen. The abdominal ultrasound uses a wand shaped emitter-receiver across your abdomen, which bounces inaudible sound waves off your organs to create an image that must be interpreted by experts.Your doctor will be able to detect any obvious/larger tumors that may be present in your pancreas or abdomen.

, A more precise test for pancreatic cancer is an endoscopic ultrasound. For this test, you will be placed under sedation. Then, an endoscope with an ultrasound probe on the end is threaded down your nose or mouth, through the esophagus and stomach, into the duodenum, upper area of your small intestine.


This puts the scope in close proximity to the pancreas, so the images will be detailed.

, CT-/cat-scans, which are cross-sectional x-rays, will show a detailed picture of the pancreas and surrounding organs. It will help show whether your pancreas contains a cancerous tumor and whether it has spread to other organs in your body.It will also help decide whether surgery is your best option, or you are not eligible.
Before your CT, you may have to sip several ounces of oral contrast over about 45 minutes, which is a liquid that will help your organs (esophagus, stomach, intestines) show up better on the scan. And, you may be given an intravenous (IV) iodine/contrast to make blood vessels stand out clearly.
Your doctor may also perform a CT-guided needle-/or laparoscopic- (microsurgical) biopsy if a tumor is visible on your scans in order to help see whether it in cancerous or not.

"
Watch for early symptoms.,
Look for risk factors.,
See your doctor.",How to Prevent Pancreatic Cancer3," Pancreatic cancer usually develops for a long time before causing distressing enough symptoms to cause one to seek medical help. One may be blessed to have severe enough digestive issues (such as a bile duct blockage) to lead to early enough detection to be surgically operable in an early stage, before stage III or IV. Once they start to develop, there are some common early non-specific symptoms that occur. These include:


Fatigue, unexplained tiredness
Pain in the abdomen or middle of the back
Bloating, possibly repeated diarrhea
Nausea, or chronic indigestion (possibly vomiting)
Rapid changes in blood sugar levels
Diabetes or sudden onset of diabetes
Loss of appetite
Weight loss
Blood clots in later stages
If there is jaundice with bile insufficiency because of a duct blockage:

Yellowing skin and/or of the whites of your eyes
Orange or brownish urine
Light colored stool, such as chalky-gray or white (brown stool is normal)
Smelly, greasy, floating stool



, There are certain factors that put you more at risk for pancreatic cancer than others. These risk factors include: The risk factors for pancreatic cancer include:


Being over 50, most are over 65
Smoking
Your ethnic background, because African-Americans are at a higher risk
Past history of chronic pancreatitis or chronic inflammation of the pancreas
Family history of this cancer, especially two or more close relatives, as well as breast, ovarian, or prostate cancer in the family
Obesity, poor diet choices
Diabetic persons who develop diabetes over age 50 have eight times the usual risk of developing pancreatic adenocarcinoma within three years, after which the relative risk declines.Excessive consumption of red or processed meat
History of heavy alcohol use or alcoholism
Environmental or workplace exposure to certain pesticides, dyes, and chemicals

, If you notice any symptoms of pancreatic cancer, you should see your doctor. Many of these symptoms may be a sign of other health problems as well, so talk to your doctor about what else your symptoms mean. You should also see your doctor if you are at a high risk of pancreatic cancer due to the risk factors or family history to make sure you are doing well.


Any preventative methods will not ensure that you won't get pancreatic cancer. They will just help you lower your chances.

You should use about one ounce of sunscreen over your child’s body.;
, SPF stands for Sun Protection Factor. This determines how long it will take your child’s skin to start burning. For example, if your child’s skin will reddens after 20 minutes in the sun, it will take 30 times longer with SPF 15, or about five hours.You should also look for sunscreen or sunblock labeled ""broad-spectrum."" This indicates that it protects from both UVA and UVB rays.


Use a sunscreen that is at least SPF 30 for child skin cancer prevention.
It’s important to remember that there is no sunscreen that blocks out 100% of the sun’s UV rays.

, It’s important that the sunscreen settles into the skin and provides a protective coating. Put sunscreen on your child about 30 minutes before he goes out., The sun shines UV rays even on cloudy days. Even when the sky is not clear, the rays can give your child a burn. It’s important to wear sunscreen on these days as well., If your children are going to be outside in the sun, be sure to reapply sunscreen at least every two hours or more if possible.If your child is swimming or sweating, sunscreen should be reapplied frequently as well. Put on more sunscreen if your child has toweled off.

, Babies have sensitive skin that does not handle sunscreen. You should not use sunscreen on an infant; however, experts feel that you can apply a small amount of baby-safe sunblock (with titanium dioxide or zinc oxide) on small areas such as the face or hands or feet, if exposure is unavoidable. If sun exposure is unavoidable, the child should be covered up properly.

, Babies in this age range can handle sunscreen. The sunscreen should be SPF 30 or higher. Apply a generous layer of sunscreen to the baby’s skin 30 minutes before he is exposed to the sun.Choose sunscreen and sunblocks made specifically for babies.
If your baby sweats a lot or is in the water, reapply the sunscreen every two hours.
These are simply suggested recommendations and should not be substituted for pediatric advice. Always follow the advice from your child’s doctor.

, The insect repellant can make the sunscreen less effective, and the sunscreen can make the insect repellant more toxic.Sunscreen should be applied generously at least every two hours, while insect repellant should be used no more frequently than two to six hours.Sunscreen must be applied to the face, while it is best to avoid applying insect repellant to your face., Ensure that your child is covered up when exposed to the sun for long periods. Even while at the beach, you should have your child wear a t-shirt while out of the water. Consider a one-piece swimsuit for girls and/or a rash guard or swim shirt for girls and boys. You can also encourage your child to take cover under an umbrella or shaded area.

, Make a habit of having your child wear a hat when outdoors to avoid skin cancer risks. A hat with a brim that covers the face and neck is ideal. If you are consistent, your child will adjust to wearing a hat outside when it is sunny. Choose a hat with a brim that’s at least three inches all the way around., Just as adults should protect their eyes from the sun, children should too. Again, if consistent, children should not have a problem wearing sunglasses on sunny days. Choose sunglasses that protect from UVA and UVB rays. The sunglasses should fit snugly on your child’s face., The sun’s rays are harshest during the hours of 10:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. Keep your child out of the sun during these hours if possible. If exposure during these hours is unavoidable, limit the time that your child is outside. Also be sure to protect your child’s skin with sunscreen and clothing.

, Infants under six months old have skin that contains little melanin or skin pigmentation. Their skin is sensitive and can’t handle sunscreen. As a result, infants should be kept out of the sun. If they need to be outside, they should be covered adequately.Limit walks with your infant to before 10:00 a.m. or after 4:00 p.m. Your infant should sit in a stroller with a sun protective cover over her.
These are simply suggested recommendations and should not be substituted for pediatric advice. Always follow the advice from your child’s doctor.

, Teens and pre-teens may want to lay out in the sun to get a tan. Some teens might also want to visit a tanning bed. These activities should be avoided. Extra and deliberate exposure to the sun can make skin more susceptible to the risk of skin cancer., Some medications make skin more sensitive to light and UV rays. If your child is taking a medication such as antibiotics or ibuprofen, you should help your child take extra care in the sun. Ideally, your child would avoid sun exposure altogether., Explain to your children how they should be careful in the sun. When you are taking precautions by putting the sunblock on your child, or the hat, explain why.For example, you can say, ""Here, put your hat on. You have to protect your skin from the sun."" At first, your child may ask you why, and you can explain that the sun is very hot and it can damage the skin. Don't explain it in a manner that scares your child. Just explain it in a nonchalant way. If your precautions become second nature to you, they will become second nature to your child.
At some point, your child will be reminding you to put on your sunblock. Your teaching should eventually cause your children to start taking precautions for themselves without you prompting them. They can also feel confident to remind other children.

, If you are going to require your children to wear sunscreen and cover up their skin, you should do the same thing. Wear sunscreen, avoid the sun at peak exposure times, and cover up your skin. Your children will more likely to cooperate if they see the whole family taking care in the sun., Certain people are more prone to developing skin cancer, depending on genetics, environment, and skin tone. The following are some factors that might increase your risk of skin cancer:Family history of skin cancer
Increased sun exposure
Living in areas with higher intensity of sunlight, including areas such as the Caribbean, northern Australia, and Florida
Previously sunburned skin
High level of body moles
Fair skin or very light skin
Inherited diseases
Exposure to high levels of pollution
Children who are exposed to cigarette smoke

, Recognize that fair-skinned children are more likely to burn in the sun if unprotected, but this doesn’t mean that darker-skinned children should not be protected in the sun. Take precautions with all children., The skin is the largest organ in our bodies. It functions to protect our vital organs and bodies from harmful pathogens and trauma. The skin works to protect our bodies from too much of the sun's harmful rays. It also stores fat as well as moisture. However, with so much exposure to harmful elements, injury can occur without protecting our skin, especially from the sun's ultraviolet (UV) rays.

, There are several different types of skin cancer. Only a medical professional can correctly diagnose and treat the different types of cancer.Here are several types of skin cancer:


Actinic keratosis: Symptoms include red bumps and tan crusts. These are not skin cancer, but skin cancer can develop from them.Squamous cell: Occurs due to uncontrolled cells in squamous layer of the skin. Usual presentation includes a dark spot that may be elevated frequently the lower lip, face and outer ear, as well as other sun exposed areas, scaly red patches, or a sore that doesn't heal.Basal cell: Symptoms are due to the presence of a localized red bump due to overproduction of cells in the basal layer of the skin.They may also look like a red, scaly patch or a sore that doesn't heal
Melanoma: Melanomas are the most dangerous forms of skin cancer, and can even be fatal. It is becoming more common in young adults. They may develop without warning or near a mole or dark spot on the skin, so it is important to be aware of the color, size, and location of moles on your child's body.Pay attention to the following guidelines (known as ABCDE) when examining at a mole or dark spot on the skin:Asymmetry: the area should be symmetric, or the same on both sides. If it is not, however, this could be a warning sign for malignancy.
Borders: borders should be well defined.
Color: the area should be the same color throughout its surface. Malignant moles are often black, red, or white or multicolored.
Diameter: the diameter of the area should be less than 6 mm, or roughly the size of a cap of a pen cap.
Elevation: any elevation of the skin can be a warning sign.



, Become familiar with your child's freckles and moles. If you notice changes in the color or diameter of some markings or new symptoms like itching or bleeding, visit a dermatologist. Any evolving or irregularity of the freckles or moles should not be ignored. This skin specialist will check out the area thoroughly. This doctor will also do annual mole checks on patients with a large number of moles or who are prone to sunburn or skin cancer.


Only a medical professional can diagnose and treat skin disorders and possible skin cancers., Treatment includes excision and biopsy of the area in question. This means that the doctor will excise, or cut out, the affected area (or will sometimes take a shaving of the lesion) and run a biopsy, or examination, to determine to determine if it is skin cancer, and the type and severity of it. Depending on the severity of the diagnosis, other treatments include: Electrosurgery
Cryotherapy
Laser therapy
Radiation
Photodynamic therapy
Topical medications
More surgery to remove the entire cancer and an area of surrounding skin

Be very cautious with industrial chemicals.,
Keep your immune system strong.,

Examine your skin often.,
Know when to see a doctor.",How to Prevent Squamous Cell Skin Cancer," The best way to lower your risk of all skin cancers is to avoid excessive exposure to intense mid-day sunshine, especially during summer months.Start by seeking some shade whenever you can, particularly if you're near water and susceptible to lots of reflection of the sun's rays. Look for shade trees and coverings to sit under. Bring an umbrella or a tarp to the beach.


Seeking shade between the hours of 10am and 4pm is important because that's when the sun is most intense.
Learn the shadow rule: if your shadow is shorter than your height, then the sun’s rays are most intense. The longer your shadow, the less UV radiation from the sun.;
, In addition to finding or creating some shade while outdoors, wearing long garments is another effective way of protecting yourself from the sun's potentially harmful radiation.Wear loose-fitting (comfortable) long-sleeved shirts and pants to cover up as much skin as possible.


Choose light-colored and tightly woven fabrics that you can't see through, because UV radiation can penetrate loosely woven material.
Tightly woven cottons and linens are good choices because they are also breathable.
Avoid wearing dark-colored clothes made of synthetic fibers — they'll be too hot while under the sun.

, While you're covering up with clothes, don't forget to wear a hat so your head, face and neck are also protected from the sun. Broad-brimmed hats are good choices because they provide more protection than baseball caps or visors.If you wear a baseball cap, remember that your ears and neck will be exposed and risk sunburn.


Light-colored cotton hats are effective at blocking the sun's rays without making your head too hot, as are tightly-woven straw varieties.
Special protective hats made with neck flaps attached are an excellent idea if going to the beach or pool, especially for children.
Consider tying children's hats on underneath their chins so they don't come off as easily.

, Another very common recommendation for preventing sunburn and reducing the risk of all types of skin cancer, including squamous cell, is applying sunscreen to exposed skin. Use a sunscreen (and lip balm) that has broad-spectrum protection and sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30.Apply a generous amount of sunscreen lotion or cream to all exposed areas of skin, particularly your ears, nose, neck, shoulders, forearms and hands.
Reapply sunscreen every two hours or immediately after coming out of the water, even if you use water-resistant varieties.
Remember that sunscreen won't protect you from all UV radiation, so don’t use it to be able to stay out in the sun for long periods of time.Seeking shade and covering up with clothing or towels is still important even if you use sunscreen.

, In addition to sunshine, a secondary source of UV radiation for some people is from tanning beds. There seems to be lots of confusion as to the safety of tanning beds and what frequencies pose the most threat; however, official medical recommendations from the American Cancer Society are to avoid tanning beds because they emit UV rays that can cause long-term skin damage and contribute to skin cancer.Tanning beds mostly emit UVA radiation, and studies have shown that spending time in a tanning bed increases the risk of both squamous cell carcinomas and basal cell carcinoma.
Some people claim that the benefits of producing vitamin D from lying in tanning beds outweigh the risk of skin cancer, but you should talk to your doctor about the pros and cons.
If vitamin D deficiency is your main concern, then consider taking supplements instead of using tanning beds.

, Another piece of protective wear essential if you're spending lots of time outdoors in the sun is sunglasses. Choose a pair that has large lenses and protect 100% against both UVA and UVB radiation from the sun.Large lenses and frames protect both your eyes and part of your face. Wrap-around styles keep the sun from penetrating from the sides.


For children, make sure their sunglasses fit properly and use neoprene connectors to fasten the glasses around their heads (over top their hats).
UVA is the most common type of sunlight on the earth’s surface, whereas most UVB rays are absorbed by the ozone layer and don't make it to the surface.
UVB is more damaging to skin than UVA, although certain UVB frequencies trigger the production of vitamin D in human skin, which is essential for health. Still, UVB radiation is more harmful to the skin, and is a major risk factor for squamous cell carcinoma.

, UV radiation is not the only thing that can cause skin diseases such as squamous cell cancer — exposure to toxic or poisonous compounds (such as arsenic) also increases the cancer risk.Arsenic doesn't have to come in contact with the skin, as ingesting it also increases the risk of skin cancers.


It's possible to be exposed to arsenic from well water, pesticides, herbicides, insecticides and some medicines (arsenic may have some medicinal value in tiny amounts).
People who work in mining and smelting are at greater risk of arsenic exposure.

, Another compound that should be avoided because it increases the risk of squamous cell skin cancer is coal tar, which is found in medicinal shampoos and creams meant for treating psoriasis and head lice.Coal tar is a byproduct of coal processing that's a potential carcinogen despite its medicinal uses.


Coal tar products can relieve dryness, redness, flaking and itching of skin, but at the cost of increasing cancer risk.
Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is a popular coal-tar derived painkiller that should be avoided if you have a history of skin cancer.

, Other industrial compounds can also raise your risk of squamous cell carcinoma — either by getting them directly on your skin or by inhaling their fumes.Examples include asbestos, benzene, silica, certain mineral oils and paint solvents. If you need to handle these compounds, always wear gloves and a breathing mask with the appropriate filter attached.


People who work in the manufacturing, mining, forestry and automobile repair industries are at greater risk of exposure to these chemicals.
Try to use natural cleaning products to clean your home, such as white vinegar, lemon juice and salt water to reduce your exposure to harmful industrial chemicals.

, Another method of helping to prevent skin cancer (and most other diseases) is to maintain a strong immune system.A strong immune system is able to detect and combat cancerous cells, as well as quickly repair skin damage.


People at greater risk of squamous cell carcinoma due to weakened immunity are those with lymphoma, leukemia or AIDS, as well as chemotherapy and organ transplant patients. Chronic corticosteroid use can also weaken your immune system.
Getting lots of sleep, keeping well hydrated, reducing stress levels and exercising on a regular basis are all associated with keeping your immune system strong.

, Eating certain foods rich in antioxidants (vitamins A, C and E, beta-carotene and zinc) may help protect against developing skin cancer.Antioxidants help prevent damage from free radicals, so they have anti-cancer properties. Whole foods that contain folic acid (vitamin B9), omega-3 fatty acids and lots of protein may also contribute to skin health.


Focus on eating more fresh fish, beans, carrots, chard, pumpkin (including its seeds), cabbage, broccoli and citrus fruits. Eat veggies raw if you can because they are more nutritious.
Research on animals suggest soy and flaxseed may also help fight cancer and help prevent the spread of skin cancer to other parts of the body.Other plant compounds that may protect your skin from sun damage include:Apigenin — found in broccoli, celery, onions, tomatoes, apples, cherries, grapes and tea leaves.
Curcumin — found in turmeric spice.
Resveratrol — found in grapes, pistachios and peanuts.
Quercetin — found in apples and onions.



, Although most people know that smoking cigarettes increases the likelihood of lung cancer, you may not know that it also significantly increases the risk of developing squamous cell carcinoma in the mouth and throat.As such, stop smoking and chewing tobacco products to help prevent various cancers.


If you can't stop ""cold turkey,"" consider using a nicotine patch or gum for a short period of time to wean yourself off.
Coal tar is one of the main cancerous compounds in cigarettes, although there are many other toxic chemicals too.

, Examining your skin frequently while undressed may not prevent the start of squamous cell carcinoma, but it can be helpful for getting early treatment and stopping its progression.Check your skin often for new growths or changes in existing moles, freckles and birthmarks.Signs of squamous cell cancer can include any of the following:A firm, red nodule
A flat sore with scaly crust
A new sore on an old scar
A rough patch on your lip that becomes an ulcer
A red sore or rough patch inside your mouth
A red or wart-like sore near your anus or genitals



, After thoroughly checking your skin in a mirror while unclothed, if you notice any new growths (scabs or sores), changes in existing moles, or freckles or birthmarks that don't fade away within a few weeks or so, you should make an appointment with your family physician, who might refer you to a dermatologist (skin specialist) for a detailed examination.Catching skin cancer early is the key to successful treatment.


If you have a history of severe sunburns or are light-skin colored with lots of freckles, you should be especially cautious about any unusual marks on your skin.
People with red hair and green eyes are more at risk of developing skin cancers.

Talk to your oncologist.,
Contact your insurance company.,
Prepare for your scalp hypothermia treatment by enlisting family and friends to switch out cold caps during 30 minute intervals.",How to Prevent Hair Loss After Chemotherapy," Many doctors are skeptical about the effectiveness of scalp hypothermia, so you may need to find an oncologist with knowledge and/or experience with this treatment to prevent hair loss.


Doctors only recommend scalp hypothermia for patients with cancers that do not threaten to spread to the brain.;
,


Since scalp hypothermia is a relatively new treatment for preventing hair loss in the United States, many insurance companies may not cover the costs of purchasing the caps and the freezers used to chill them. A typical treatment session may require the use of 15 caps or more. The caps are used during 30 minute intervals while the patient is undergoing a chemotherapy treatment session.

, The nursing staff can also be helpful during these treatment sessions.


Using the cold caps before, during and after chemotherapy improves a patient's odds of preventing hair loss. Adding scalp hypothermia will also extend the time you spend in the hospital during chemotherapy sessions.

Stop smoking tobacco products.,
Limit your exposure to secondhand smoke.,
Have your home tested for radon.,
Avoid exposure to carcinogens at the workplace.,
Exercise on a regular basis.,
Consume a higher amount of fruits and vegetables.,
Reduce your exposure to outdoor air pollution as much as possible.,
Seek treatment for lung diseases independent of lung cancer.",How to Prevent Lung Cancer," Cigarette and tobacco smoke contains harmful substances known as carcinogens that can damage the cells lining your lungs. Over time, smoking can lead to the development and multiplication of abnormal cells and increase your risk for lung cancer.Contact your healthcare provider for help with smoking cessation programs if you experience difficulty with quitting smoking. Your physician may prescribe medications that can help you quit smoking, suggest that you join a smoking cessation support group, or recommend nicotine patches and gums that can help you kick your habit.;
, Non-smokers exposed to secondhand smoke inhale the same carcinogens and cancer-causing substances as actual smokers. Avoid spending time around people who smoke, and avoid spending time at venues such as bars and restaurants that allow smoking.

, Radon is a radioactive gas released during the natural decay process of elements such as uranium, thorium, and radium -- all of which are commonly found in rocks and soil. When inhaled, the radioactive particles in radon can damage the cells lining your lungs and increase the risk for lung cancer. Purchase a radon-testing kit for your home, or contact a local radon-detection specialist who can inspect your home for signs of radon., Substances and chemicals such as asbestos, formaldehyde, benzene, and arsenic are all types of carcinogens that have been found to cause lung cancer. If you spend time working with carcinogens, follow the necessary precautions to lower your exposure to these substances. Wear protective gear such as a face mask, goggles, pants, long-sleeved shirts, and jackets.

, Exercise improves overall lung function by increasing blood flow to the lungs and helping eliminate waste from your body, including toxins from cigarette smoke, carcinogens, and other free radicals that increase your risk for lung cancer. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that adults engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activities per week (brisk walking, swimming, cycling), and strength-training exercises at least twice per week that work some or all of your major muscle groups.

, Natural whole foods such as fruits and vegetables are packed with vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that can help prevent lung cancer by strengthening your immune system. Lower your intake of processed foods and foods high in fat and sugar, and consume more fruits and vegetables. Increasing your intake of other natural whole foods such as nuts, seeds, legumes, sources of lean protein, and healthy fats can also help reduce your risk for lung cancer., Long-term exposure to air pollution from motor vehicles, factories, and other sources have been shown to increase the risk for lung cancer. If possible, avoid walking or running next to busy roads, and spend less time outdoors in environments with heavy air pollution.

, Lung diseases such as tuberculosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease can increase your risk for lung cancer. If you suffer from these types of lung diseases, work with your healthcare provider to have these diseases treated as soon as possible in an effort to prevent the development of lung cancer."

Avoiding cigarettes is crucial, not only to prevent liver cancer, but smoking cigarettes negatively affects your whole body as well.Try to quit smoking by reducing your cigarette consumption a little bit every day or by using cessation aids like nicotine patches.
If you have trouble quitting smoking, contact your doctor for more support.
If you don't smoke, stay away from people who do. Second-hand smoke is bad for you and can lead to increased risk of liver cancer as well.;
, Over time, drinking large quantities of alcohol can lead to cirrhosis, or scarring, of the liver which can contribute to liver cancer. Try to avoid drinking too much, specifically over long periods of time. Binge drinking (having more than five drinks in one sitting) is especially damaging to your liver. Consider completely eliminating alcohol to minimize the impact it may have on your liver.To maintain your health, women can drink up to one drink per day and men can drink up to two drinks per day.One drink is considered 12 fluid ounces of beer, 5 fluid ounces of wine, or 1.5 fluid ounces of distilled spirits.
Don't get drunk just because your peers persuade you into drinking. And don’t drink if you are underage.

, Certain drugs can increase your risk of liver cancer. Your liver metabolizes any drug you ingest, so exposing your liver to potentially harmful drugs over long periods of time could lead to developing liver cancer.One such risk factor is taking anabolic steroids like Anadrol, Oxandrin, or Winstrol.
This also includes male hormones like testosterone.

, Exposure to certain chemicals greatly increases your risk of cancer, especially in the liver. One of the main functions of the liver is to metabolize drugs and detoxify chemicals. So if you are exposed to cancer-causing chemicals, they will go straight to your liver.Things to avoid include arsenic and aflatoxin (a rare type of mold).
Some research has indicated that exposure to triclosan (an ingredient in many detergents and soaps) may cause liver fibrosis and liver cancer.If you have reason to believe that you’ve been exposed to any of these elements, contact your doctor immediately.

, A big risk factor for liver cancer is having a fatty liver, which is caused by being overweight or obese – especially if you carry most of your weight around your midsection. Obesity can also lead to type 2 diabetes, which is associated with an increased risk of liver cancer.If you are overweight, try putting yourself on a diet and exercise plan that will allow you to shed some of the extra weight.Focus on eating healthy and aim for 30 minutes of exercise every day, even if it is just taking your dog for a walk.
Talk to your doctor about what kind of diet and exercise plan is right for your body.

, In order to promote liver health, you need to maintain a well-balanced diet on a regular basis. You should avoid fatty, fried foods and be sure to get plenty of fresh veggies. To protect your liver, your diet should include the following:Raw plant food, especially raw vegetables
Fresh fruit, but in small quantities
Cooked vegetables (excluding starchy potatoes)
Protein from seafood, poultry, lean red meat, eggs, and/or legumes

, In July 1992, blood and organs began to be screened for infections and contamination. But if you received a blood transfusion or an organ donation before this date, you are at risk for disease – including liver cancer.Contact your doctor for health screening immediately if you had such an operation before 1992.

, Since about 80% of people around the world who suffer from liver cancer also have either hepatitis B or hepatitis C, it is important to understand this correlation and what you can do to prevent infection.Chronic hepatitis infections can result in cirrhosis of the liver, which may lead to liver cancer over time.

, The best way to protect yourself from contracting hepatitis B is by getting yourself vaccinated against this infection. The vaccine usually takes several months, as you have to get several injections spaced out weeks apart. You should be able to get a hepatitis B vaccination at any general practitioner or health clinic.Unfortunately, there is no vaccination for hepatitis C so you need to be cautious and use preventative measures.

, People that have Hepatitis C are at high risk of liver disease including liver cancer. Testing for Hepatitis C is recommended if you were born between 1945 and 1965, or ever used injectable drugs.It is likewise recommended if you used medication for a blood clotting disorder before 1987 or had a blood transfusion or an organ transplant before July 1992.
Those who are on long-term hemodialysis or you are infected with HIV may be especially susceptible, and should also be tested.

, Hepatitis B and C can both be spread through sexual intercourse, so you should always practice safe sex. This means using a condom unless you are certain about your partner’s sexual health. If you have multiple sex partners, you should always use a condom.Remember that sexually transmitted infections are incredibly common these days. Every time you have sex without a condom, you put yourself at risk for contracting something.

, Hepatitis B and C can also be spread through sharing needles. These diseases are transmitted through the blood, and a shared needle means shared blood. Make sure you steer clear of intravenous drug use as this is a huge risk factor for hepatitis, liver cancer, and multitudes of other ailments. If you must use needles (for example, if you are a diabetic who must take daily injections of insulin), make sure you use a new needle each time and never share them with another person.

, Getting tattooed or pierced can be very exciting, but make sure you choose a clean, professional setting with properly trained staff. Infections and diseases can be spread through improper hygiene of the shop or unclean equipment. The needles used for piercing and the needles that go inside the tattoo machine should always be brand new, opened in front of you, from sterile packaging.

Limit your exposure to radiation.,
Protect yourself from carcinogenic chemicals.,
Check for a history of certain conditions.",How to Prevent Stomach Cancer1," There are a number of factors that can put you at risk of stomach cancer. Some are not within your control, while others you can avoid. The risk factors that you have no control over include:


A family history of stomach cancer.
A genetic predisposition to stomach cancer.
Inherited genetic conditions, such as hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC), familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), Lynch syndrome, Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, or BRCA gene mutations.
Having type A blood, though the exact reason for this risk is unknown.;
, There are certain situations where you may have been exposed to ionized radiation. This can increase your risk of stomach cancer, especially if the exposure was prolonged or happened numerous times. If you can control your exposure to any radiation, do so. Situations where you may have been exposed to radiation include:


Radioisotope radiation for thyroid cancer.
External beam radiation for Hodgkin disease.
Being in locations where an atomic bomb has gone off., There are certain jobs that can increase your risk for stomach cancer. Cancer can be caused by working with many different harmful chemicals, such as asbestos, cadmium, radon, benzene, arsenic, vinyl chloride, beryllium, chromium, and nickel compounds.The amount of risk depends on the level of exposure, the amount of time exposed, and the strength of the carcinogen you are exposed to. These jobs include:


The rubber industry.
Construction.
Woodworking.
Mining.
Painting.
Pesticide work.
The chemical industry.
The dye industry., There are certain conditions, situations, and viruses that may make you more susceptible to stomach cancer. If you have a history of these, you may want to talk to your doctor about the likelihood of stomach cancer. These conditions include:


Previous bacterial infection from the Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) bacteria, which causes inflammation, ulcers, and pre-cancerous changes in the stomach.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which is also a risk factor for cancer of the esophagus.
Pernicious anemia, a decrease in the number of red blood cells that occurs when Vitamin B12 cannot be absorbed.
Chronic atrophic gastritis, which is when the lining of your stomach becomes inflamed.
Other stomach conditions, including intestinal metaplasia and gastric epithelial dysplasia. Metaplasia is the change in cell morphology to a more dysplastic (abnormal) form, which is potentially reversible. Dysplasia is the spread of an abnormal cell type and it is usually due to the cancerous properties of a cell.
History of stomach surgeries such as a partial gastrectomy, which of the removal of part of the stomach.

Learn that there is no one way to prevent stomach cancer.,
Fight obesity.,
Exercise more.,
Stay away from salted products.,
Eat more fruits and vegetables.,
Avoid processed meats.,
Stop smoking.",How to Prevent Stomach Cancer2," There is no way to 100% prevent stomach cancer. However, the best route to take to prevent stomach cancer is to control the risk factors you can change and keep a check on those that you can’t.


This means you should discuss any past conditions with your doctor and see what he says about ways to prevent additional damage., Obesity can increase the risk of cancer developing in the cardia area of your stomach. However, obesity is a risk factor that you can control in most situations. Obesity occurs when your weight a great deal over what is healthy for your body to handle. You can use diet, exercise, and lifestyle changes to start losing weight.


Start out small at first. You will not be able to lose the weight overnight., In order to lose weight and increase your general health, you should increase your physical activity every week. According to the American Cancer Society guidelines, you should work out moderately for 150 minutes a week or for 75 minutes if you do intense exercise.


Break this time up and aim for 30 minutes of moderate intensity exercise on five days of every week.
You can add all different kinds of exercise, including walking, running, aerobics, team sports, yoga, weight lifting, tai chi, or any other activity that you enjoy., Salt and salty foods are probable risk factors for gastric cancer. The recent decline in cases of stomach cancer has been partially attributed to the modern refrigeration practices replacing the mass use of salting and pickling to preserve food. However, there are still plenty of foods available that are salted. In order to prevent stomach cancer, you should avoid eating these foods.


These foods include beef jerky, cured ham, and other salted meats and fish.
You should also avoid pickled foods as well, which have a very large salt content as well., A change in diet can help you prevent stomach cancer. A diet rich in fruits and vegetables has been shown to lower your risk of stomach cancer. Your goal should be a variety of fresh fruit and vegetables which total at least 2 ½ cups, or five servings, of each a day.


Citrus fruits, such as lemons, oranges, and grapefruits, can be especially helpful in lowering the risk.Vegetables should constitute about 50 to 60% of your meals.

, Processed meats are smoked and typically have nitrates and nitrites in them. Nitrates and nitrites react to certain amino acids and create cancerous cells, which have been linked to stomach cancer.


To avoid the possibility of stomach cancer, find lunch meats, sausages, hot dogs, and other meats without nitrates and nitrites in them.Instead, eat fresh fish and poultry.
You should limit your red meats, but if you do eat them, make sure they are grass fed and lean red meats.The World Health Organization has listed certain meats as potential carcinogens, including sausages, bacon, ham, beef jerky, corned beef, and other smoked, salted, and fermented meat products. They have also concluded that there is a positive association between processed meats and stomach cancer., Smokers have double the risk of developing stomach cancer than non-smokers and about 18% of stomach cancer cases are attributed to smoking.Smoking can cause cancer to the section of the stomach closest to the esophagus. It is also responsible for many other types of cancers, accounting for one third of all cancer related deaths in the United States alone. It can be very hard to stop smoking, but there are many aids to help you. You can try nicotine replacement, shots, medication, support groups, or many other options to help you quit.Try using the START acronym to begin your goal of quitting smoking.

S=Set a stop date.

Talk to your doctor.",How to Prevent Stomach Cancer3," The most common type of stomach cancer is adenocarcinomas, which is when the cancer attacks the lining, or mucosal layer, of the stomach. This accounts for about 95% of all cases of stomach cancer.


More rare forms of cancer include lymphomas, which also affect the lining of the stomach. These account for about 4% of the cases of stomach cancer.
The most rare forms of stomach cancer are gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) and carcinoid tumors. , Stomach cancer, in its early stages, doesn’t typically have symptoms. However, more advanced cases of stomach cancer will start to produce symptoms. If you think you may be at risk for stomach cancer, there are some symptoms you can look for. These symptoms include:


Bloated feelings after you eat.
Feeling full after eating only minimal amounts of food.
Heartburn or indigestion.
Nausea., If you experience any of the symptoms of stomach cancer, you may want to see your doctor to see if that is what is going on or some other condition. If you are at high risk of stomach cancer and experience the symptoms, you should definitely see a doctor as soon as you can.


If your family has a history of stomach cancer, you may want to keep a check on the condition of your stomach, even if you don’t have symptoms.

Sit down and remain calm for a few minutes.,
Use your fingers to find your pulse.,
Push your fingers against the artery until you feel a strong pulsation.,
Count each beat or pulsation to find your rate per minute.",How to Know if You Have a Healthy Heart Rate1," Your heart rate fluctuates based on your activity. Even standing can elevate heart rate. So before you measure your heart rate, you need to allow yourself to “relax.”A good way to find out your resting heart rate is to measure it immediately after waking up in the morning.
Do not measure your heart rate after exercise as it can remain elevated and you won’t be able to get an accurate reading. Also, being stressed, anxious or upset can elevate your heart rate.
Do not measure your heart rate after drinking caffeine or in a hot, humid environment as these might temporarily increase your heart rate.;
, Use the tips of your middle and ring fingers to press down on (or palpate) the radial pulse on the inside of your wrist or on the side of your neck (your carotid artery)., It might take you a moment to feel the pulsation and you might need to move your fingers around to find it.

, Count the number of beats in 30 seconds and multiply by two or in 10 seconds and multiply by six to get your heart rate per minute.


For example, if you counted 32 beats in 30 seconds, multiply that by two to get your resting heart rate of 64. Or, if you counted 10 beats in 10 seconds, multiply 10 by six to get a resting heart rate of 60.
If your rhythm is irregular, count for a full minute. As you begin counting, start the first pulse felt as zero and the second pulse as one.
Repeat the measure a few times to get a more accurate reading.

Be aware of any chest discomfort or pain.,
Take note of any upper body pain.,
Expect mild symptoms at first.,
Assess whether the pain is related to angina - if the person who may be having a heart attack has a history of that condition.,
Look for any stomach pain, nausea or vomiting.,
Call your local emergency number if you suspect a heart attack.",How to Know if You've Had a Heart Attack1," According to a survey done by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 92% of people recognized that chest pain was a symptom of a heart attack but only 27% were aware of all the symptoms and knew when to call their local emergency number.Although chest pain is a common and classic symptom, you may initially believe you are suffering from bad epigastric pain or heartburn.


Chest pain from a heart attack feels like someone is squeezing your chest or an elephant is sitting on your chest - it cannot be relieved with antacids.
However, in a study by the Journal of the American Medical Association, researchers found that 31% of men and 42% of women did not experience chest pain which is commonly associated with a heart attack.Diabetic patients are also at risk for less classic symptoms of a heart attack.;
, Pain from a heart attack can spread beyond the chest to the upper shoulders, arms, back, neck, teeth or jaw. In fact, you might not experience pain in your chest at all.A chronic toothache or upper back pain can be the early signs of a heart attack.

, Most heart attacks begin with mild symptoms described below. However, do not be tempted to “tough it out.” Instead, if the symptoms do not disappear within five minutes, call your local emergency number for immediate medical treatment., Ask if their angina disappear rapidly with treatment - some people with coronary artery disease suffer from angina, or pain in the chest with exertion. This occurs when their heart muscle cannot get enough oxygen to support their current activity. A person suffering from angina may have medication to help open the arteries in the heart and eliminate the pain. If the angina does not disappear rapidly with rest or treatment, it can be a signal of an imminent heart attack., Pain from a heart attack can be experienced in the stomach. It may feel like heartburn but it is not relieved at all with antacids. You may also experience nausea and vomiting without chest pain or other signs of gastrointestinal flu., Do not do anything else first. Do not delay in getting medical help - your best chance of a strong recovery with minimal damage to the heart muscle is by getting medical treatment within one hour of symptoms occurring.


Do not start aspirin therapy on your own - your emergency operator, emergency personnel, or emergency room doctor will determine if taking an aspirin is right for you."
"
Assess if your resting heart rate is between the normal range.,
Assess if your heart rate is higher than 80 beats per minute.,
Assess if your resting heart rate is lower than 60.",How to Know if You Have a Healthy Heart Rate2," The normal resting heart rate for an adult is between 60 and 100 beats per minute (and for a child 70 – 100 beats per minute). However, a recent study indicated that a heart rate above 80 is one risk factor for obesity and diabetes.If your resting heart rate is between 60 and 80 beats per minute, it is likely to be categorized as healthy or normal.

, If it is, you might have a higher risk of cardiac disease and you should consult your doctor immediately.


A high resting heart rate means your heart needs to work harder to maintain a steady beat at rest. A high resting heart rate is considered a risk factor for ischemic cardiac disease, obesity and diabetes.A 10-year clinical study found that adults whose resting heart rate increased from 70 to 85 beats per minute were 90% more likely to have died during the study than those whose rate remained below 70.If your resting heart rate is high, take actions to lower it (see next section). A heart rate over 100 beats per minute is known as tachycardia.
Some medications (such as thyroid medication and stimulants like Adderall and Ritalin) can raise your heart rate. Discuss with your doctor if you are concerned that the medications you are currently taking have increased your heart rate.Environmental temperature and humidity can also temporarily increase your heart rate because your heart needs to work a little harder in these conditions. This does not mean your heart rate is high in normal conditions.
Other causes of tachycardia include fever, hypotension, anemia, smoking, drinking too much alcohol or caffeine, electrolyte imbalance, hypothyroidism, and more., Having your rate be below 60 beats per minute doesn’t usually mean you have a medical problem. People who are very athletic or in good physical shape can have a resting heart rate as low as 40 beats per minute.Some people have low heart rate by nature and there is nothing abnormal or unhealthy about this. Low heart rate is medically known as bradycardia.
Some medications (such as beta blockers, sedatives, opioids, and many more) can slow down your heart rate.Ask your doctor if any of your medications cause low heart rate.
Consult your doctor and ask if you need to take action due to low resting heart rate.

"
"
Exercise regularly.,
Lose weight.,
Reduce your stress level.,
Avoid smoking cigarettes or using other tobacco products.",How to Know if You Have a Healthy Heart Rate3," Regular exercise helps gradually slow down your resting heart rate. As your cardiovascular system strengthens so does your heart and in return it needs to work less to maintain circulation.You should get at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity every week.Also, add regular strength training exercises to your weekly schedule to strengthen your muscles.
Always consult your doctor before starting a new exercise program.

, Obesity is another risk factor for heart disease — the larger your body size is the harder your heart must work to supply oxygen-rich blood throughout your body. Thus, losing weight can help slow down an elevated heart rate.


In order to lose weight, you need to eat fewer calories than your body consumes, without entering starvation mode (you should consume no less than 1,050 – 1,200 calories). When this negative calories balance occurs, your body is forced to burn stored fat for energy.
If you burn 500 calories (or are have a negative balance of 500 calories) a day, you will burn 3,500 calories a week, which equals to one pound of fat. Maintaining this balance for 10 weeks would equal to 10 pounds of fat.Add regular aerobic and strength training exercise to your weekly schedule to burn calories. The amount of calories you burn during an exercise depends on your age, gender and weight. Use an exercise calorie counter to assess how many calories you burn per exercise.Consume a healthy, low-fat diet consisting of vegetables, fruits, lean meats, seafood, whole grains and low-fat milk products.
Use a basal metabolic rate calculator and food calorie counter to analyze how many calories per day you need and to count the calories in your diet., Stress stimulates the sympathetic nervous system and can increase your resting heart rate. Relaxation exercises, such as meditation, yoga and tai chi, and other stress-lowering techniques help lower your heart rate over time. Add these to your weekly schedule to promote healthy heart rate.


Try different relaxation techniques, such as autogenic relaxation, progressive muscle relaxation, visualization, and/or deep breathing, and pick one that fits your lifestyle and schedule the best.Sign up for yoga or tai chi classes at your local gym or do them at home using DVDs, books or free youtube videos.
Hypnosis, meditation and massage can also help clear your mind and help your body relax.

, Smoking can increase your resting heart rate and is associated with other health risks, such as cancer.Talk with your doctor about quitting smoking. There are several options available, such as nicotine replacement therapy, so you don't have go ""cold turkey.""Make a plan and let your family and friends know about it. This will help you stay on track and give you the support you need.
Consider joining an online or in-person support group.

Look for atypical symptoms if the sufferer is a woman.Women may experience other atypical or uncommon signs of a heart attack more frequently than men.,
Be aware of unexpected shortness of breath.,
Watch for lightheadedness, anxiety and sweating.,
Be aware of extreme heart pounding.",How to Know if You've Had a Heart Attack2," Some of these include:


Sudden onset of weakness
Body aches
Overall feeling of illness sometimes described as having the “flu”
Sleep disturbances

, Shortness of breath is a symptom of a heart attack that can occur before chest pain. You will feel as if you can’t get enough oxygen into your lungs, or as if you just finished running a race., Symptoms of a heart attack can include feeling anxious for no apparent reason. You may experience lightheadedness or cold sweats without chest pain or other symptoms., Is your heart pounding in your chest? If your heart feels like it is pounding in your chest, or as though it is racing or you feel palpitations, or it feels as if the rhythm has changed, this is an atypical or uncommon sign of a heart attack."
"
Understand that there are different types of risk factors for heart disease.,
Understand the risk factors for developing heart disease that you cannot change - these are factors that cannot be changed and should be considered when assessing your overall risk of a heart attack.,
Understand the risk factors for developing heart disease that you can change.,
Lower your risk of heart attack by striving to stay active every day - go for a brisk walk for 15 minutes after lunch and dinner.",How to Know if You've Had a Heart Attack3," There are factors you can change by making changes to your lifestyle choices and there are some that you cannot. When you are aware that the choices that you make increases or decreases your risk of heart disease and of a heart attack, you make better choices.

, Risk Factors you cannot change include:Age: Men over 45 and women over 55 have a higher risk of heart attack.
Family history: If your close blood relatives have had an early heart attack you may be at a higher risk.
History of autoimmune disease: If you have a history of an autoimmune disease such as rheumatoid arthritis or Lupus, you are at higher risk of having a heart attack.
Pre-eclampsia: this is a condition in pregnancy

, These risk factors can be lessened by changing your lifestyle - for instance by eliminating negative behaviors or adopting positive ones. These risk factors include: Smoking: smoking is an independent risk factor for sudden cardiac death in people who suffer from coronary artery disease. Smoking cigarettes increases the risk of developing coronary artery disease.
High blood pressure
Physical inactivity
Diabetes
Obesity
High cholesterol
Stress and illegal drug use, Eat a healthy diet low in salt, trans-fats and carbohydrates, high in healthy unsaturated fats and proteins.


Stop smoking.
It is important to follow your doctor’s recommendations for treatment and medication if you are at risk of a heart attack, or if you are recovering from one.

Expect immediate attention in the Emergency Room.,
Expect an ECG.,
Expect blood testing.,
Prepare for cardiac catheterization.,
Expect a stress test after the event is over.",How to Know if You've Had a Heart Attack4," A heart attack is life-threatening and also can respond well to immediate and early treatment protocols. If you or a friend are in the ER with a potential heart attack you will receive immediate attention.

, An electrocardiogram is a test that measures the electrical activity of the heart. This will show the doctor how much muscle may be injured or if you are in the middle of having a heart attack. An injured muscle will not conduct electricity the way that an uninjured muscle will. The electrical activity from the heart is transmitted through electrodes placed on your chest and printed on paper for evaluation., When the heart muscle is injured during a heart attack there are specific chemicals released into the bloodstream. Troponin is one chemical that remains in the blood for up to two weeks - giving your doctor a reasonable method of diagnosing whether you recently had a heart attack which might have gone un-diagnosed., Your doctor may perform a cardiac catheterization to find out more information about the condition of your heart. During the procedure, a catheter is inserted into a blood vessel and into your heart.It is often inserted through an artery in the groin area,and is a relatively risk-free procedure.During a cardiac catheterization, your doctor may:X-ray your heart using a contrast dye. This can help your doctor see if there are any narrow or blocked arteries.
Check the pressure in the chambers of your heart.
Take blood samples, which can be used to measure the oxygen content in your heart chambers.
Perform a biopsy.
Check your heart's ability to pump efficiently.

, In the weeks following a heart attack you may undergo a stress test to evaluate how the blood vessels in your heart respond to exercise. You’ll be on a treadmill and hooked up to an electrocardiogram machine which measures the electrical activity in the heart. This will help your doctor determine long-term treatment for your condition.

Ask your doctor how big your heart is.,
Determine the strength with which your heart pumps.,
Observe the pumping action of the heart.,
Examine the valves of your heart.,
Look for heart defects.,
Ask your doctor why you need an echocardiogram.,
Ask your doctor what type of echocardiogram you will have.,
Watch the monitor to determine what techniques the doctor uses.",How to Interpret Echocardiograms," If your heart is enlarged or the walls of your heart have become thicker, this can be in indication of several problems. For example, the doctor will likely measure the thickness of the wall of the left ventricle (the major pumping chamber of the heart). If it is thicker than 1.5 cm, this is considered abnormal. This or other thickened heart walls could indicate several problems including:High blood pressure
Weak heart valves
Damaged valves;
, These measures can indicate whether your heart is pumping enough blood to supply your body with the oxygen it needs. If not, you are at risk for heart failure. There are two measurements the doctor may discuss with you:Left ventricular ejection fraction. This is the percentage of blood that is expelled from the heart during a heartbeat. A left ventricular ejection fraction of 60% is considered normal.
Cardiac output. This is the volume of blood that the heart pumps per minute. At rest the average adult's heart pumps 4.8 to 6.4 liters of blood per minute.

, If parts of the wall of the heart are not pumping strongly, this can help the doctor pinpoint areas that have been damaged. This can occur due to tissue damage from a prior heart attack or coronary artery disease. Your doctor will be looking for several things:Hyperkinesis. This occurs when the heart or parts of the walls of the heart contract too much.
Hypokinesis. This occurs when the contractions are too weak.
Akinesis. This occurs when the tissue does not contract.
Dyskinesis. This occurs when the wall of the heart bulges out when it should be contracting.

, You will likely be able to see the valves as gray lines that open and close with each beat of the heart enabling blood to pass between the chambers. Possible problems that you may see could be:A valve does not close tightly and it lets blood flow backwards through it.
A valve does not open all the way so it restricts blood flow.

, You may be able to observe structural problems such as:


Openings between chambers that should not be there
Passages between the heart and blood vessels
Heart defects that are developing a fetus

, An echocardiogram can help diagnose several conditions. Your doctor may perform an echocardiogram if they think you may have:Heart murmurs
Heart valve problems
Atrial fibrillation
An infection of the valves
Fluid around the heart
Blood clots
Thickening of the walls of the heart
Congenital heart disease
High blood pressure in your lungs (pulmonary hypertension)

, There are several types of echocardiograms and the doctor will choose which one to do based on what information they want to have.A transthoracic echocardiogram. This is a noninvasive procedure that does not hurt. The doctor puts gel on your chest and then moves a handheld machine called a transducer against your chest. The transducer projects ultrasound through your body. A computer reads the sound waves and produces pictures. This test can detect valve problems and enable the doctor to examine the thickness of the walls of the heart.
A transesophageal echocardiogram. During this test, the doctor will put a tube with a transducer on it down your throat. This lets the doctor get pictures from a different angle than the transthoracic echocardiogram. You will get medication to help you relax and numb your throat.
A stress echocardiogram. During this test, the ultrasound images will be produced while you exercise on a treadmill, ride a stationary bike, or receive medication to make your heart beat faster. This test can find problems that happen when your heart is under stress including conditions where your heart does not receive enough blood.

, There are several different techniques the doctor may use. They enable the doctor to make different measurements.M-Mode. This technique generates a outlines showing the heart’s size, the chambers, and the thickness of the walls of the heart.
A doppler echocardiogram. During this test, the machine measures the sound waves that are reflected off of the cells in your blood and uses this information to determine how your blood is flowing through your heart. The doctor can measure how fast the blood is flowing through your heart and in what direction it is traveling. This is useful for determining whether your heart is pumping enough blood and if you have any valve problems.
Color doppler. During this method the computer highlights areas where the blood is flowing in a particular direction. This is helpful for detecting blood that is not flowing the correct direction.
Two-dimensional echocardiography. This method produces a two-dimensional image of the heart as it beats. This is used to investigate the structures and valves of the heart.
Three-dimensional echocardiography. This produces a much more detailed image which has depth instead of just length and width. It is often used to plan treatments.

Don't sit or stand for too long.,
Position your body to aid circulation.,
Start an exercise routine.,
Wear comfortable shoes.,
Wear compression hose.,
Stop using tobacco products.",How to Improve Leg Circulation1," It's important to move around during the day to get the blood flowing through your legs. Sitting or standing for long periods of time allows the blood to collect instead of flowing, and is detrimental to your health over time. If you find you've been in the same position for an hour or more, move around for a few minutes before resuming your position.


If you work in an office and are required to sit for your job, get up and take breaks every hour and a half or so. Even if all you do is walk to the bathroom and back to your desk, you're moving your legs, which helps circulation.
You could also look into getting a stand-up desk, which allows you to stand instead of sitting while you work.;
, Do you tend to cross your legs when you sit? That common position cuts off the circulation to your legs, making it more difficult for blood to get to your leg tissue to keep it healthy. Make a habit of sitting in a position that's better for blood circulation.


Sit with your legs spaced slightly apart and your feet on the floor. Remember to get up from time to time so you aren't in this position for too long.
You can also slightly elevate your legs to help your circulation. Put your feet up on a stool 6 to 12 inches (15.2 to 30.5 cm) above the ground.







, If you can work some exercise into your schedule, your circulation will certainly benefit. Any exercises that employ the legs will help your circulation. Try power walking, running, biking, swimming, hiking, and other exercises you enjoy that get your feet moving.


Exercise daily for maximum benefits. Even a 1/2-hour walk will improve the health of your legs.
If you're looking for a low-impact exercise, try yoga.Many yoga poses engage your legs and stimulate the circulatory system.







, Wearing high heels, pointy-toed shoes, or other tight shoes can impede blood flow from your legs to your heart. When you're focused on improving leg circulation, it's important to wear comfortable, low-heeled shoes with plenty of cushioning.


Wear tennis shoes or loafers that give your feet room to breathe.
Go for dress shoes with rounded or almond-shaped toes instead of pointy toes. Choose wedges instead of heels if you want extra height.

, These are similar to panty hose, and they're specifically designed to stabilize the leg tissues and help blood circulate more easily. You can pick them up at the drugstore or see your doctor about ordering hose specially fitted for your legs and your individual needs.

, Smoking can actually lead to peripheral artery disease, a condition in which the arteries in the legs harden and can no longer circulate blood. If you have poor circulation, stopping smoking and use of other tobacco products is an important way to regain leg health."

Evaluate the results with your doctor.,
Look at the pH number.,
Check bicarbonate, or HCO3, numbers.,
Examine the PaCO2 number.,
Inspect the PaO2 number.,
Notice oxygen saturation.",How to Interpret Blood Gas Results1," The best way to interpret your blood results is by talking to your doctor. They understand the information and results better than anyone. Making an assessment on your own can lead to misdiagnosis or complications from self-treatment. Ask your doctor any questions you may have about individual or total levels and what they may indicate.Have your doctor go through each series of numbers individually, explaining what they test for and what your specific results may mean.
Ask your doctor to compare previous results with the new ones to better judge where you are physically.;
, This measures the number of hydrogen ions in your blood, which may indicate conditions such as COPD, asthma, pregnancy, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), lung disease, liver disease, or drug use.The normal range for pH values are between 7.35 to 7.45.If the pH level is below 7.38, then you may have more acidic blood from conditions such as airway obstruction, COPD, asthma, sleep disordered breathing, or neuromuscular impairment.If the pH level is above 7.45, you may have a alkalosis, which could indicate stimulation of the central nervous system, lung disease, severe anemia, drug use, or pregnancy.

, Your kidneys produce bicarbonate and help maintain a normal pH. The normal level for bicarbonate is between 22 to 26 milliEquivalents Per Liter (mEq/L).A disruption of your bicarbonate levels may indicate conditions such as respiratory failure, anorexia, and liver failure.An HCO3 level is below 24 mEq/L indicates metabolic acidosis. It may be the result of conditions including diarrhea, liver failure and kidney disease.
An HCO3 level above 26 mEq/L indicates metabolic alkalosis. This may be the result of dehydration, vomiting, and anorexia.

, Partial pressure of carbon dioxide, or PaCO2, measures the carbon dioxide in your blood. The normal level for PaCO2 is between 38 and 45 mmHg.Disrupted levels may indicate shock, kidney failure, or chronic vomitingRespiratory alkalosis is present if the PaCO2 number is below 35 mmHg. This means there is too little carbon dioxide in the blood. It can signal kidney failure, shock, diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperventilation, pain, or anxiety.Respiratory acidosis is present if the PaCO2 number is above 45 mmHg. This means that there is too much carbon dioxide in the blood. This can be a sign of chronic vomiting, low blood potassium, COPD, or pneumonia.

, Partial pressure of oxygen, or PaO2, measures how well oxygen can flow from your lungs into your blood. The normal level is between 75 to 100 mmHg.Higher or lower levels may indicate conditions such as anemia, carbon monoxide poisoning, or sickle cell disease., How well your hemoglobin carries oxygen to your red blood cells is called oxygen saturation. The normal levels are between 94 and 100%.Lower saturation rates may indicate the following:Anemia
Asthma
Congenital heart defects
COPD or emphysema
Strained abdominal muscles
Collapsed lung
Pulmonary edema or embolism
Sleep apnea

Eat foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids.,
Add nuts to your diet.,
Eat more berries.,
Consume colorful vegetables.,
Eat more avocado.,
Consume foods high in resveratrol.,
Avoid eating foods that contain trans-fatty acids.",How to Improve Daily Heart Function1," Try to eat fish twice a week or look for daily a supplement containing 0.3 and 0.5 grams of EPA and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids can protect your heart muscle by reducing inflammation in the body.They may also reduce your triglyceride levels, blood pressure, blood clotting time, and irregular heartbeats. While you can purchase omega-3 fatty acid supplements in liquid gel cap form, there are many fish that are high in omega-3s. Opt for wild-caught fish and avoid farm-raised fish which are high in antibiotics, pesticides and other chemicals harmful to your health.Fish high in omega-3s include:


Salmon
Lake trout
Herring
Sardines
Tuna;
, Nuts contain omega-3 fatty acids, fiber, vitamin E, plant sterols, and arginine, an amino acid that can help relax blood vessels and reduce blood pressure. All of these can protect the heart and the FDA says that eating 1 ounce of some nuts daily can reduce your risk of heart disease.Fiber and plant sterols help lower your cholesterol, make you feel full on less, and may reduce your risk of diabetes, while vitamin E can prevent plaque buildup in the arteries. Try adding just a handful of walnuts or almonds to your meals. Eat either 1.5 ounces of nuts or 2 tablespoons of nut butter to get the health benefits.


Since nuts are high in calories, eat small amounts of them and stop eating chips or soda to balance out the extra calories.

, Try to eat 100 grams or around a cup of berries a day.Berries, like strawberries and blueberries, are high in phytonutrients that help to protect the heart.Studies show that eating berries every day can improve platelet function and ""good"" HDL cholesterol while reducing blood pressure. Each of these changes help to protect the heart from cardiovascular disease and improve heart function. Berries are also high in antioxidants known as polyphenols. Polyphenols are naturally found in plants and research suggests that they protect the body against cancers and cardiovascular diseases.You can also eat dark chocolate, tea, and red wine, which are also high in polyphenols.

, Eat 1 to 2 cups of red, yellow and orange vegetables, which are high in carotenoids and flavonoids.These protect against cardiovascular disease and improve heart function by preventing oxidation of cholesterol in the arteries.Oxidized cholesterol increases the formation of plaque in the arteries which can lead to heart disease.While you can take beta-carotene or astaxanthin supplements to get carotenoids, there are several vegetables that naturally contain high levels of carotenoids, such as:Pumpkins
Carrots
Winter squash
Plantains
Collard greens
Tomatoes
Red peppers
Broccoli
Brussels sprouts
Kale
Spinach
Oranges
Peas

, Try to eat avocado every day, but limit yourself to 1/4 of an avocado, since they're high in calories. Try cubing them into salads, spreading them on sandwiches, or use them in place of butter. Avocados are known as one of nature's superfoods because they're high in monosaturated fats that lower your LDL or ""bad"" cholesterol, as well as polyunsaturated fats which, in moderation, are good for the heart. They also have anti-inflammatory properties.Inflammation increases the risk of atherosclerosis and hardening of the arteries. These can cause high blood pressure and congestive heart failure.

, Try drinking 1 to 2 cups of wine or grape juice or eat 2 cups of grapes or raisins.Resveratrol is a natural polyphenol that reduces the ""stickiness"" of blood platelets, which can prevent plaque buildup, reduce blood pressure, and improve heart function.While you can take resveratrol supplements, it's also found in a variety of foods, including:


Red and black grapes
Red and black raisins
Red wine (talk with your doctor about how much you can safely drink for health benefits)

, Trans fats will increase your “bad” cholesterol (LDL) and lower your “good” cholesterol (HDL). They're produced industrially to reduce the potential for spoilage and give food a longer shelf life. High cholesterol levels increase your risk of high blood pressure which increases the work of the heart. These will increase the risk of congestive heart failure and poor heart function.Foods high in trans fats include:


Deep fat fried food (like fried chicken, french fries, and doughnuts)
Baked goods (especially those containing shortening, like pastries)
Fried snacks (like chips or popcorn popped in oil)
Refrigerated dough (like canned cookie, biscuit, or pizza doughs)
Creamers (like non-dairy coffee creamers)
Margarine

Try birch bark tea.,
Take gingko supplements.,
Drink cayenne pepper tea.,
Take fish oil supplements.",How to Improve Leg Circulation2," This herb is said to help stimulate the circulatory system. It can be taken as a supplement, but it's also great as a tea, especially brewed with a little ginger. Incorporate a cup into your daily routine., Gingko has long been used for a number of medicinal purposes, and there is evidence that it can help to open up the blood vessels and improve circulation.A dosage of 120-240 mg per day of ginkgo leaf extract is recommended. Divide it into two or three doses., This spicy pepper is said to help open blood vessels and improve circulation. You can sprinkle it over your food or stir it into some tea with honey. Consuming some cayenne pepper every day should improve your circulation over time.

, Fish oil contains omega 3 fatty acids, which are essential for a healthy lipid profile. Having a high level of ""good"" cholesterol improves circulation.Fish oil supplements come in pill gel capsule form and are usually made from mackerel, tuna, cod liver, salmon, or herring.

Eat less salt.,
Maintain a healthy body weight.",How to Improve Leg Circulation3," Salt causes your body to retain water and swell, which can put pressure on the veins and lead to poor circulation. Try halving your salt intake and avoiding sprinkling extra salt on your food after it has been prepared.


Do most of your own cooking, rather than eating out. You never know how much salt restaurants are putting in their food, and it's usually more than you think.
Avoid salty snack foods, fast food, and microwaveable dinners and snacks.
Drink plenty of water to flush the salt from your body. You need 2 or so liters a day to stay fully hydrated.

, An important part of keeping your legs and feet healthy and improving circulation is maintaining a healthy body weight. Having extra weight places stress on your circulatory system. Follow a balanced diet and work with your doctor to reach a weight that is right for your body type.


Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and lean meats.
Make sure you're getting a good amount of fiber through legumes, nuts, oatmeal, and other fiber-rich foods.

Talk with your doctor about getting treatment for poor circulation.",How to Improve Leg Circulation4," If lifestyle changes and healthy habits don't seem to be working, you may have a more serious health problem called peripheral artery disease. Talk with your doctor about whether this could be the case, and what treatment options are available to you.Peripheral artery disease occurs when plaque builds up in the arteries and prevents blood from circulating from the feet and legs to the heart. It leads to leg pain and other symptoms of poor circulation.Peripheral artery disease is generally treated with medication to combat leg pain, lower blood pressure and reduce cholesterol.
Peripheral artery disease is also sometimes treated with heart surgery.

If you are taking any of the following medications or drugs, recognize that they may disrupt your blood gas results:Blood thinners, including aspirin
Illicit drugs
Tobacco or secondhand smoke
Tetracycline (antibiotics)Steroids

, The amount of oxygen in the air decreases with elevation, which can also affect your blood gas results. If you live at altitudes of 3,000 feet (900 meters) or higher, factor this in your test.Ask your doctor to correlate your partial pressure of oxygen with your location or factor that a healthy level of saturation is 80-90% between 10,000 – 15,000 feet.Respiratory alkalosis is commonly associated with people going to mountainous areas. Hyperventilation is especially likely when ascent is too rapid and there hasn’t been enough time to acclimate., Medical conditions ranging from liver failure to a simple fever can affect your blood gas results. Consider these as you review your test or discuss it with your doctor. The following conditions may disrupt normal blood gas levels:Fever
Hyperventilation
Prior drug overdose
Head or neck injury
Respiratory disorders such as asthma and COPD
Congestive heart failure
Kidney failureDiabetes
Blood disorders such as hemophilia

, If you’ve had previous blood gas tests, review the results from them. This can give you an idea of any discrepancies that may indicate a new condition or improvement of another. Remember to discuss these results with your doctor, too."

Recognize the benefits of regular exercise.,
Warm up with dynamic stretches.,
Do aerobic (cardiovascular) exercise.,
Strength (resistance) train.",How to Improve Daily Heart Function2," Since your heart is a muscle, it needs exercise. Sedentary behavior, like sitting all day, is the top risk factor for heart disease.Do a combination of stretching, aerobic exercise, and strength training to strengthen your heart and cardiovascular system. Exercise improves circulation and helps your body use oxygen more efficiently.Exercise can also improve your sleep and reduce stress, both of which are important for heart health.

, Many people think they should begin their workout with static stretches, or stretches that lengthen your muscles while they stand in place, but this can actually cause injury and impede performance. Instead, you want to focus on dynamic, or active stretches, that put your muscles through their full range of motion and mimic the exercise you will be doing. For instance, if you are going to jog or run, warm up by walking and with dynamic stretches like high kicks, walking lunges, and butt kicks.


Proper stretching will lead to better physical fitness, increase mental and physical relaxation, and reduce muscle soreness., Aerobic exercise is highly recommended for heart health because it breaks up stored fatty acids, providing more fuel for heart muscle.It increases energy release and helps the heart function more efficiently by strengthening your heart and lungs. It will also lower blood pressure. You may want to exercise every other day to develop the exercise habit. Then, work up to exercising for 30 minutes five days a week (for a total of 150 minutes each week).Any exercise that increases your heart rate and leaves you slightly out of breath is increasing the work of the heart muscle and improving function. Aerobic exercises that help improve your daily heart function include:Walking
Jogging
Rowing
Swimming
Tennis
Golf
Cross country skiing
Skating
Biking
Jump roping
Low-impact aerobic classes

, Strength train every other day to give your muscles a chance to rest between sessions. You can strength train by lifting weights, which will contract your muscles, help you gain strength, and improve your balance and coordination. Research is starting to suggest that strength training is an important part of heart health for these reasons.The American Heart Association recommends strength training because it:Increases strength in bones, muscles and connective tissue.
Lowers the risk of injury.
Improves muscle tone which burns more calories, making it easier to maintain a normal weight.
Improves the quality of life.
Lowers blood pressure, reducing the amount of oxygen and blood needed to maintain cell health and lowering the overall risk of disease.

Try stress-reducing techniques.,
Quit smoking.,
Laugh.,
Sleep seven to nine hours at night.,
Consider reducing your alcohol intake.,
Check your blood pressure on a regular basis.",How to Improve Daily Heart Function3," You can try yoga, listen to calming music, meditate, exercise, or talk to friends to reduce daily stress. Stress can damage your heart function and increase the inflammatory response in your body.It can also affect behaviors that impact your arteries and heart function. For example, many people turn to alcohol, smoking, overeating, and don't have much time for rest or exercise when stressed. This leads to high blood pressure, arterial wall damage and obesity that can all damage your heart function.Try a variety of stress-reducing techniques until you find one that relaxes you. You might also try deep-breathing exercises, massage, hypnosis, or tai chi., Talk with your doctor about a smoking cessation program that will work with your lifestyle. Or, at least try to reduce smoking, since it contains thousands of chemicals that can seriously damage your heart. Smoking reduces heart function by increasing blood pressure, reducing exercise tolerance and increasing the likelihood that the blood will clot. Nicotine, the addictive compound in cigarettes, is known to increase heart rate and blood pressure.You should also take care to avoid secondhand smoke, which can also damage your heart.Stay in open outdoor areas, upwind from friends and relatives who like to smoke.

, Laughing can also reduce stress, which improves heart function. Researchers found that the old saying “laughter is the best medicine” holds some truth. They found that people with heart disease were 40 percent less likely to laugh compared to other people of the same age without heart disease.Make it a point to find the things in life that give you joy and make you laugh every day. You might try:Watching a funny movie or television show
Reading comedy books
Laughing about the funny things your pet does
Spending time around people that make you laugh

, Sleeping less than six hours a night or more than nine can increase your risk of heart disease and death. But, sleeping seven to nine hours each night leaves you feeling rested and refreshed. More importantly, it helps reduce your stress level and allows your body plenty of time to relax and unwind.Lack of sleep can increase your blood pressure, irritability, instability, and decrease your energy level., Talk with your doctor about whether you should reduce or stop drinking alcohol. If there are no reasons why you shouldn't be able to drink, then one or two drinks should be safe. But, if you or someone in your family has a history of alcoholism, hypertriglyceridemia, pancreatitis, liver disease, heart failure or uncontrolled hypertension, then you should not drink alcohol. Each of these conditions will damage your heart function.Review your alcohol intake with your doctor every year to discuss the benefits and risks.

, You should have your blood pressure measured annually if it has been within normal limits, since blood pressure is an indicator of heart function. High blood pressure is one of the primary health conditions that damages the function of your heart.If it's high, you'll need to follow the treatment plan prescribed by your doctor. There are also several lifestyle changes you could make, including:Keeping your weight within normal limits.
Drinking at least eight 8-ounce glasses of water to avoid dehydration.
Cutting back on the amount of caffeine you drink daily.
Getting involved in a supportive community.

Walk regularly.,
Exercise whenever you can.,
Get a massage.,
Put your feet up.",How to Improve Blood Circulation1," Going for walks after meals can help increase circulation and aid your digestive system in doing its job. Walking at least 30 minutes each day is recommended.;
, Anything that aids in general fitness should boost your circulation. When you work out, try both:


Cardiovascular training. Swimming, biking, running, playing sports, etc. Aerobic activity will improve heart and blood vessel function.
Strength training. Strength training (lifting weights) will help you build muscle, which in turn increases the effectiveness of cardiovascular and lymph circulation.
Every hour, get up and try 3 to 5 minutes' worth of stretching or small exercise. This is especially handy if you're at a desk all day and barely get a chance to walk around. Try doing little arm circles, touching your hands to your toes, kicking out your feet, or performing small, slow jumping jacks (enough to get your heart rate up).

, Massage, like exercise, increases local circulation by stimulating blood flow in the soft tissue. Many studies point to the overall effectiveness of massage in stimulating healing.Read this article on how to deskercise, or exercise while sitting at your desk. It should help improve circulation if you can't find the time to do proper exercises.

, Elevating your legs is a great way to increase your circulation and relax at the same time. It also reduces the chance of varicose veins, which are caused by high blood pressure or simply standing for extended periods of time.

Discuss the cause of your low WBC count with your doctor.,
Ask if they recommend medication.,
Consult a registered dietitian.,
Discuss natural remedies with your doctor or specialist.",How to Increase White Blood Cells1," A low WBC count can result from a wide variety of medical conditions. You doctor will have to administer tests in order to better understand your situation if the cause isn’t obvious, such as a viral infection, autoimmune disease, HIV/AIDS, cancer or cancer treatment, or a prescription medication.Understanding why your WBC count is low will help you and your doctor come up with specific solutions.  ;
, There are several medications available that stimulate WBC production. All medications have benefits and risks, so be sure to ask your doctor about potential side effects.Ask your doctor, “Are there prescription medications that would be beneficial for my situation? What are my options with the lowest associated risks? Should I try dietary changes or natural remedies before taking medication?”
Risks and side effects of medications that stimulate WBC production can include allergic reactions, low fever, bone pain, discomfort at the injection site, weakness, diarrhea, and flu-like symptoms., A registered dietitian will help you create a meal plan customized for your specific needs. If you’re undergoing chemotherapy or other treatment for a chronic medical condition, talk to your treatment center about seeing their dietitian. You can also ask your primary doctor or specialist caregiver for a referral.Your personalized meal plan might include modifications to your daily recommended nutrients, like adding more protein than normally recommended to your diet. Your dietitian can also help you with recipes, safe food handling, and consult about adding supplements.
Tell your dietitian about your eating habits and any difficulty you have maintaining proper nutrition, such as loss of appetite, nausea or vomiting, and diarrhea. They can recommend foods and supplements that can help you get the nutrients your body needs to produce blood cells.

, Acupuncture has been shown to increase WBC production and promote bone marrow repair during chemotherapy.Sauna bathing also stimulates the immune system, particularly in athletes.Talk to your doctor before trying natural remedies, especially if you’re receiving chemotherapy or other treatment for a chronic medical condition.

Be aware that medications can lead to heartburn.",How to Know if You Have Heartburn," The most common symptom of heartburn is a burning feeling inside your throat and chest that occurs after eating. Heartburn is also known as acid reflux for a reason; stomach acid comes back up your esophagus when it doesn't close properly, causing the burning sensation., Heartburn may occur a few minutes to a few hours after eating. It may last for just a few seconds, or it can last for hours, sometimes coming and going during that time. Also, if you already have heartburn, it can get worse after you eat., Lying down or bending after eating can lead to or increase heartburn. Because acid reflux happens when the sphincter at the lower end of esophagus lets acid up into your esophagus, gravity can work against you when you're lying down. It can help the acid flow back into your esophagus more easily.

, You may only get this symptom if your heartburn is severe. Sometimes, the acid travels all the way up to the back of your throat, and you may taste the acid or feel a burning sensation back there.This symptom may cause you to cough. You may also find it difficult to swallow for a few minutes., Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a more frequent, severe form of acid reflux. However, you can still have the disease without the feeling of heartburn. Symptoms of GERD without heartburn include hoarseness when you wake up, pain in the chest (not burning), and the feeling that you have something stuck in the back of your throat., Pain from a heart attack generally feels like squeezing or tightening in the chest. Oftentimes, you may have jaw or back pain in addition to pain in your chest. You may also feel it in your arms. It can feel different from heartburn pain, which usually moves up into your chest and burns.However, acid reflux can be a sign of a heart attack, so if you're ever unsure, you should go to the emergency room.Other symptoms of heart attacks include breaking out in a cold sweat, not being able to breath properly, feeling very tired, feeling dizzy or lightheaded, and having jaw and arm pain., You may have been diagnosed with asthma as an adult if you have frequent coughing after meals or shortness of breath. However, sometimes acid reflux looks much like asthma. The main way you can tell that it is actually acid reflux is if you mostly have asthma attacks at night or if you often have them when you lie down. Ask your doctor if your asthma could really be acid reflux, or talk to her if you think acid reflux may be making your asthma worse., Because GERD affects these systems, sometimes it is misdiagnosed as laryngitis. It can also exhibit as a long-term cough or sore throat. If these problems are chronic for you, ask your doctor about the possibility of it being GERD instead., If you are having severe chest pain, you should call an ambulance or go to the emergency room whether you think it's acid reflux or not. It could be a heart attack instead of acid reflux., If you have shortness of breath, are dizzy, or break out in a cold sweat, go to the emergency room or call an ambulance. You should have your heart checked out to make sure it's ok., Having heartburn regularly or having chronic night symptoms is a sign of GERD. It can also lead to complications, such as food sticking in the bottom of your esophagus. Additionally, if you don't control the symptoms, you can be at higher risk for other diseases, such as esophageal complications or esophageal cancer.Treatment includes over the counter medications and antacids as well as proton pump inhibitors. It is important to talk to your doctor about your symptoms because there are very effective medications available that can relieve you of discomfort.

, Additionally, see a doctor if you are vomiting blood or if you feel like food is getting stuck in your esophagus. These could be signs that your acid reflux has developed complications. Other serious symptoms include feeling like you're choking or unexplained weight loss. , Excess fat can increase pressure on your stomach. The added pressure within the stomach can in turn cause the stomach to push acid towards the esophagus., During pregnancy, the hormone progesterone is released into the bloodstream. This hormone helps you uterus walls to stretch by relaxing them. However, it can also relax your esophageal sphincter, causing acid reflux. Moreover, as the baby grows in size, it can put additional pressure on the stomach., Smoking can also affect the sphincter at the bottom of your esophagus, weakening it. In turn, you have an increased risk for acid reflux., For instance, spicy foods and fatty foods can both increase your chances of heartburn. Acidic foods, such as oranges, lemons, and grapefruit, can also cause you problems. You may also see increased heartburn with chocolate, peppermint, and onions. In beverages, alcohol and caffeinated drinks are ones that can cause heartburn., The most common type of drugs in this category are NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs). They can both cause heartburn and make it worse if you already have it."

Understand what the term ""heart block"" refers to.,
Recognize the symptoms of a heart block.,
Identify a first degree heart block.,
Know what causes a second degree heart block.,
Recognize Mobitz type I.,
Know how to identify a Mobitz type 2 block.,
Understand what a third degree heart block involves.",How to Identify Heart Blocks1," The term heart block refers to an AV block or an atrio-ventricular block. This is when there is some obstacle blocking electrical signals between the upper and lower chambers of the heart.


There are three degrees of AV block according to severity - first degree, second degree and third degree. Second degree heart blocks have two subtypes.;
, First degree heart block usually does not produce any symptoms. Second and third degree heart blocks may also be asymptomatic. However, when the condition persists for a long time, heart failure may occur.


Dizziness and fainting may occur due to a temporary interruption in the blood supply to the brain. In complete heart block, ventricles beat very slowly which may lead to heart failure.
In this case, you may experience fatigue, coughing, shortness of breath, chest pain, leg swelling etc. These symptoms indicate serious illness and require prompt medical attention.

, A first degree heart block occurs when the electrical signals passing between the atria and the ventricles (the upper and lower chambers of the heart) become slower than normal. A first degree heart block can be identified on on an ECG by a longer, flatter line between the P and R waves.Causes of first degree heart block include drugs (such as beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, digoxin and amiodarone), heart attack (or myocardial infarction), age-related degeneration of conduction system, electrolyte imbalance (particularly potassium), increased parasympathetic activity etc.
First degree heart blocks are usually asymptomatic and do not require treatment.

, A second degree heart block occurs when the electrical signals passing between the atria and the ventricles slow down significantly, and some of the signals never even reach the ventricles.


When electrical signals do not reach the ventricles, the ventricles fail to contract. This prevents blood from being pumped around the body, to the lungs and other important organs.
The are two subtypes of second degree heart blocks - Mobitz type I and Mobitz type II.

, With a Mobitz type 1 heart block, the electrical signals moving from the atria to the ventricles become progressively slower with each heartbeat, until the heart eventually skips a beat.


Mobitz type 1 is identified on an ECG as follows: As the electrical signals slow, a line appears between the P and QRS waves. This line is known as a PR interval. These lines get progressively longer until the heart skips a beat, at which point there is no QRS wave following the next P wave.The causes of a Mobitz type 1 block are the same as for a first degree block. Sufferers of a type 1 heart block may experience a little dizziness but they usually won't require treatment. This type of block is less severe than a Mobitz type 2 block.

, In a Mobitz type 2 block some of the electrical signals passing from the atria to the ventricles are blocked, resulting in a skipped heart beat. Unlike with Mobitz type 1, the pattern of blocked electrical signals is unpredictable.


Mobitz type 2 is identified on an ECG as follows: At first, the ECG will appear normal, as the QRS wave follows the P wave at regular intervals. However, once an electrical signal fails to pass into the ventricles, the QRS wave will disappear completely.Common causes of this type of heart block are heart attack, heart surgery and age-related degeneration of the conduction system. Mobitz type 2 is more serious than Mobitz type 1, and in some cases a temporary pacemaker will be required if the patient develops significant bradycardia (heart rate below 60 beats/min).

, In a third degree heart block, all of the electrical signals passing between the atria and ventricles are blocked. When this happens, it is referred to as a complete heart block or a complete AV block.


In order for the ventricles to continue contracting and pumping blood around the body, the heart has a special back-up system of electrical signals which kicks into action in case of blockages. However, this back-up system operates at a slower pace, which means the contraction of the ventricles isn't in sync with the contraction of the atria.
This lack of co-ordination makes a third degree heart block easier to identify on an ECG, as it interferes with the normal pattern. The P waves and QRS waves are not coordinated as they normally are, and the P waves show up at more frequent intervals.A third degree heart block is the most serious type of heart block and requires emergency treatment. If left untreated, it could lead to sudden cardiac arrest. The treatment for a third degree block involves the insertion of a permanent pacemaker.
A pacemaker is a battery powered device which is attached to the chest. The device is connected to the heart by wires. The device discharges rhythmic electrical signals to excite the ventricular muscles, causing them to contract.

Eat healthy foods and avoid unhealthy foods.,
Drink right.,
Try taking a hot bath or doing other heat treatments.,
Quit smoking, if applicable.,
Find healthy outlets for your stress.",How to Improve Blood Circulation2," Eat fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats (found in fish oil, olive oil, nuts, and seeds). Stay away from overly processed foods, foods with excessive sugar or salt, and foods with unhealthy fats (saturated and trans fats)., Drink enough water during the day so that your organs don't have to fight to produce energy and perform their daily functions. You don't have to drink liters upon liters a day, but you should drink water when you're thirsty. Try drinking some warm water, as cold water is known to close up your veins.


Cut out the caffeine. If you can't live without it, at least minimize your intake. For instance, if you usually have two cups of coffee in the morning, have one instead. Or if you buy your coffee from a cafe somewhere, try switching to decaf or taking your coffee down one size.
Cut out alcohol and other sugary drinks from your diet. Sodas and overly sweet drinks do not improve your circulation and have especially deleterious health effects.

, Draw up a nice warm bath (with or without Epsom salts, which are healing mineral salts) and relax for 20 to 30 minutes. Fill up hot water bottles, cover if necessary to avoid burns, and place on extremities to boost blood flow.

, Not only is smoking bad for your health, it also affects your circulation. Nicotine usage is among the leading causes of circulation problems.

, Over time, stress can have negative effects on the body's circulation. Find manageable, healthy ways to relieve stress, such as regular exercise, meditation techniques, and psychotherapy, among others.

Mix up the color and kind of vegetables you eat in order to provide your body with the nutrients it needs to produce blood cells.Eat leafy greens, like kale and spinach, as well as orange vegetables, like carrots. Be sure to talk to your doctor about any dietary restrictions due to medications like blood thinners., Protein provides your body with the amino acids necessary for WBC production. Choose lean proteins, like seafood, skinless poultry, lentils, and beans.Consume between 0.8 and 1 gram of protein per kilogram of your body weight daily. If you weigh 130 pounds (about 59 kg), you should consume a minimum of 47 grams (about 1.7 ounces).Avoid processed or deli meats.
If you’re undergoing cancer treatment, you’ll likely need more protein than recommended. Ask your registered dietitian how much daily protein you should eat., Multivitamin supplements can be helpful if you’re having trouble eating during medical treatment. If you’re undergoing any treatments, it’s essential to get a recommendation from your specialist or dietitian.Some vitamins and minerals can be harmful during cancer therapy or interfere with chemotherapy or radiation.
Selenium and zinc can help your body produce more white blood cells.Consult your doctor before taking any vitamins or supplements.

, You should drink at least 64 fluid ounces (1.9 L) of water every day. Water is essential to the function and production of cells.You may need to drink extra water if you’re vomiting, experiencing diarrhea, or not eating much. If you’re undergoing chemotherapy or radiation treatment, talk to your dietitian about goals for water intake.  

, While your immune system is compromised, it's important that you take time to rest. If you overwork yourself, it can cause your condition to worsen. Instead, plan breaks into your day, say ""no"" to unnecessary activities, and ask for help when you need it.

Remember that it's okay to ask for help.
Don't say yes to things that aren't important to you. Spend your limited energy on your priorities. When asked to do something you don't want to, say, ""I'm sorry, I have another commitment,"" or ""That sounds wonderful. I wish I could participate, but it's just not a good time for me right now.""

, While it may seem difficult to get the sleep you need while you're worried about your health, it's essential that you get a good night's sleep every night. Too little sleep can further reduce your white blood cells, worsening your condition.Set a bedtime and discuss it with those who live with you.
Follow a calming sleep routine. For example, get ready for bed earlier, take a warm bath, lower the temperature of your home, lower the lights, and do a calming activity such as reading or knitting.

Wash well after using the bathroom, shaking hands, and touching door knobs and other commonly handled surfaces. Always wash well before handling or preparing food.Avoid touching or cleaning things like litter boxes, bird cages, and fish tanks., It's important that you stay clean to avoid infection, so make sure that you regularly bathe and wash up if you get dirty. Depending on your day, you may need to wash yourself more than once.

After your bath or shower, put on clean clothes. You may want to wear your favorite pair of pajamas or sweats all of the time, but these can become soiled.

, Cat litter is teeming with bacteria, as well as the parasite toxoplasma. Toxoplasma can cause an infection in those with a low white blood cell count, further weakening your immune system. If you have a cat, ask someone else to clean its litter box.Say, ""I know it's unpleasant, but could you please clean the cat's litter box? I can't risk an infection.""

, Soil, standing water, and dirty animals both harbor germs and bacteria, which can set back your recovery. If you are receiving get well plants or flower arrangements, ask someone else to change out the water or tend to them. If you have a pet, take care when you interact with it. Have it groomed if it goes outside, and wash up after petting it.

Don't do any gardening or activities that involve you coming in contact with dirt or soil.

, Hot tubs are home to a lot of bacteria, but the big concern is that the heat and bubbles from the hot tub combine to make the bacteria more dangerous. Bacteria can become part of the mist that forms over the hot water, making it easy to inhale the infectious agents. If you have low white blood cells, you can easily succumb to an infection from hot tub bacteria., Crowds are an invitation for germs. Stay away from shopping malls, theaters, restaurants, and anywhere that people congregate. When your white blood cells are low, you are more likely to contract an infection, which will further take a toll on your body., A low WBC count makes getting scrapes or cuts especially hazardous. With a weakened immune system, these can easily turn into major infections. Avoid dangerous activities and make small daily adjustments to avoid minor injuries.Take special care when brushing teeth to avoid bleeding gums.
Ask someone to cut vegetables or meat for you when preparing food.
Use an electric shaver instead of a razor to avoid cutting or nicking yourself while shaving.

, In the past, patients with low WBC counts were told to avoid raw fruits and vegetables, but this is no longer advised. However, you should carefully wash any fruits and veggies before eating, especially those that don’t have a thick skin or peel.Oranges, bananas, and melons are examples of fruits that are peeled before eating.
Use a clean veggie scrubber and cool running water to wash your produce.
Even if a salad package is marked pre-washed, use a colander to rinse its contents under running water.

, Make sure your refrigerator temperature is below 40 degrees Fahrenheit (4.4 degrees Celsius). Don’t let foods that should be refrigerated sit out for more than an hour. Avoid foods that are past their expiration date or appear slimy or moldy.Always thaw frozen meat in the refrigerator.

, Always avoid undercooked or raw eggs, meat, fish, and poultry. When cooking these items, use a thermometer to check for doneness.Cook red meat to 160 degrees Fahrenheit (71 degrees Celsius) and poultry to 180 degrees Fahrenheit (82 degrees Celsius).
Cook eggs until both yolks and whites are solid and not runny at all. Consider using pasteurized egg whites, and make sure egg-containing products, like mayonnaise or eggnog, are pasteurized.

Understand what an ECG does.,
Know how to prepare for an ECG.,
Learn what the ECG involves.,
Understand that there are no risks involved in getting an ECG.,
Wait for the results.",How to Identify Heart Blocks2," An electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) tests electrical activity within the heart. The results of the test are interpreted through line tracings on a piece of paper, which contain a series of spikes and dips known as waves. Aside from detecting heart blocks, an ECG can also be used to:


Identify the cause of chest pain and angina
Identify the presence of heart disease
Identify whether the chambers of the heart are hypertrophied
Check whether certain medications are working
Check whether pacemakers are working.

, Certain medications can interfere with the results of an ECG, therefore it's important to tell your doctor in advance about any prescription or non-prescription medications you are currently taking. You doctor will let you know if you need to stop taking these medications before the ECG or not.


You will need to remove all jewelry before the ECG, especially from the neck and wrists. Men usually need to take their shirt off before an ECG, women will usually be allowed to remain in their bra or vest.
If you have any other concerns about how to prepare for your ECG, speak to your doctor. They should be able to answer any questions you might have.

, When it's time for the ECG, you will be asked to lie on a bed or table. A number of small electrodes will then be attached to areas around your body, like your arms, legs and chest.


Before the electrodes are put in place, your skin will need to be cleaned and possibly shaved to ensure a clean, smooth surface for the electrodes. A paste may be used to attach the electrodes.
A number of wires will connect the electrodes on your body to the ECG machine. This machine traces the electrical activity of your heart onto a piece of paper.
You will be asked to lie very still for the duration of the procedure, which is usually only 5 to 10 minutes. You will also need to refrain from talking and potentially hold your breath., An ECG is a completely safe procedure, and there are no prohibitive factors to getting one. No electricity is passed between the electrodes and your body throughout the procedure, so you are not in danger of getting an electric shock.


The only slight discomfort you might feel during the procedure is if the electrodes feel cold against your skin, and pull or pinch the skin slightly as they are being removed.

, Following the ECG, your doctor will assess the results of the test by examining the pattern of spikes and dips on the paper, which represent the heart's electrical activity.


Depending on the results, your doctor will be able to identify the presence of a heart block (or other cardiac issues) and advise you on the recommended course of treatment, if any.

Look for symptoms of a heart attack.,
Identify symptoms of a blocked artery in the kidney.,
See your doctor if you experience any of these symptoms.,
Remain still and do no activity if medical care is not available right away.",How to Identify Symptoms of Clogged Arteries1," Specific symptoms can signal the beginning of a heart attack, during which oxygen-rich blood does not feed the heart muscle. If the heart does not get enough oxygen-rich blood, part of it can die. The amount of damage to the heart muscle can be reduced when you are treated with medications at a hospital within one hour of experiencing the symptoms. The symptoms include:Chest pain or pressure
Chest heaviness or tightness
Sweating or ""cold"" sweats
Feeling of fullness or indigestion
Nausea and/or vomiting
Lightheadedness
Dizziness
Extreme weakness
Anxiety
Rapid pulse or irregular heart rhythm
Shortness of breath
Pain radiating down the arm
Pain described mostly commonly as squeezing or tightness of the chest, but not sharp pain
Note that in women, elderly, and those with diabetes, heart attacks often don't have many of the common symptoms and can even present as other symptoms altogether. Fatigue is common.;
, These can be different than the symptoms of a blocked artery elsewhere. Suspect a blocked artery in the kidney if you experience: high blood pressure that is difficult to control, fatigue, nausea, loss of appetite, itching skin, or difficulty with concentration.If the artery is completely blocked, you may experience fever, nausea, vomiting, and steady aching pain in the lower back or abdomen.
If the blockage is from small blockages that lodge in the renal artery, you may also have similar blockages in other areas of your body, such as in your fingers, legs, brain or intestines.

, While you may not be totally sure that you have a blocked artery, it's better to be safe than sorry. Contact your doctor and describe your symptoms her. Your doctor will either tell you to come into her office or to go to your closest emergency room.

, Rest quietly until medical care arrives. By remaining very still you will reduce the oxygen needs and workload of the heart muscle.


If you think you are having a heart attack, chew 325 mg of full-strength aspirin once you have contacted emergency services. If you only have baby aspirin, take four 81 mg pills. Chewing before swallowing will help the aspirin work faster.

Get physically active.",How to Identify Hypertension Causes," One of the most common causes of hypertension is a strong family history.This genetic component to hypertension is not something you can change, but something you should be aware of.


If you're trying to identify your own personal causes for hypertension, start with your family members. Get in contact with your parents, siblings, grandparents or aunts and uncles.
Talk to them about their health history and specifically ask if anyone has issues with high blood pressure.
If so, ask when they were diagnosed with hypertension, how long they've had it and how they're being treated for it.
If one or more of you close family members (parents, siblings and grandparents) had hypertension, you also have an increased genetic risk for this disease as well.
Your age, race, and gender can also be factors in developing hypertension. African Americans and women over 65 are more likely to have hypertension.;
, Although you cannot change your family history, you can manage your weight. Those who are overweight or obese have a significantly higher risk for having hypertension.In fact, obesity accounts for at least 25% of hypertension.Many times, with weight loss alone, hypertension can be put into remission or resolved completely.
Get on the scale and take note of your current weight. Either have your physician calculate your BMI or ideal body weight or input your height and weight into an online calculator.
If your BMI is indicating that you are overweight or obese, it may be beneficial for you to lose weight. Talk to your doctor about safe and appropriate weight loss techniques.

, Some of your lifestyle choices may also be causes of hypertension. Smoking, being physically inactive, and excessive alcohol consumption in particular, are two significant risk factors for hypertension.There are several reasons why smoking causes hypertension. For one, this behavior damages your heart and blood vessels. It can make your blood vessels less flexible which can increase your blood pressure.
In addition, the nicotine in cigarettes is a stimulant and raises your blood pressure and the carbon monoxide decreases the oxygen content of your blood.
A lack of physical activity can lead to weight gain which causes hypertension. In addition, a lack of activity can increase your resting heart rate which increases the workload on your heart and your overall blood pressure.
More than three drinks in one sitting can temporarily raise your blood pressure, and regular binge drinking can cause a long-term increase., Stress is an unavoidable part of life, and there are many things that cause stress you cannot control. You can, however, control how you deal with stress — research shows that those who cope with stress by reacting with hostility or by operating with an extreme sense of urgency are more likely to develop hypertension.If you react to stress by becoming hostile and aggressive or by entering into a heightened ""emergency mode,"" you may need to take steps to learn new ways to cope.


Positive ways to cope with stress include exercising, mindful meditation, and deep breathing. Your doctor may be able to recommend a mental healthcare professional who can help you modify your reaction to stress.
You may need to reduce stress-causing factors in your life, such as changing jobs or asking for more help from friends and family.
In addition, many people cope with stress in inappropriate ways. Eating more (especially high calorie comfort foods), drinking alcohol or smoking are common stress-relief methods. They're not only unhealthy but also cause an increase in your blood pressure.

, There are two different types of hypertension. Primary hypertension has no identifiable cause, but develops slowly over the years. Secondary hypertension is caused by another health condition.Some people that have hypertension also have another underlying health issues that's actually causing their blood pressure to be elevated.
Secondary hypertension tends to appear suddenly and will go away once the underlying condition is resolved.
Health problems associated with secondary hypertension include: obstructive sleep apnea, kidney diseases, abnormal lipids, diabetes, thyroid problems, adrenal gland tumors, congenital defects, certain medications and illegal drug use.
If you have any of these health issues, talk to your doctor about your risk for developing secondary hypertension.

, One of the biggest causes and risk factors for developing hypertension is your diet. Your sodium intake, in particular, can be to blame for your elevated blood pressure.A diet that is high in sodium or salt can increase your blood pressure. The increase in sodium causes your body to retain extra fluid. As this extra fluid is pumped through your heart, it increases your heart's workload.
Over time, this can not only damage your heart, but also keep your blood pressure elevated.
Those of African descent must be particularly conscious of their sodium intake. There may be a genetic predisposition to excrete less sodium through urine, which may predispose you to hypertension.
To see if your diet is high in sodium, consider keeping a food journal and tracking your sodium intake. Your diet is high in sodium if you're eating more than 2,500 mg daily.

, A healthy and well balanced diet will provide your body with enough essential nutrients — like potassium. If your diet is lacking in these nutrients, especially potassium, it can also cause hypertension.Potassium counterbalances the sodium in your diet and body. When you don't get enough potassium in your diet, your body will have higher levels of sodium which can increase your blood pressure.
Potassium is found in a wide range of foods. Consider keeping a food journal that tracks nutrient intakes. That way, you can see at the end of each day if you're consuming adequate amounts of potassium.

, Similar to potassium, Vitamin D also plays an important role in how your body manages your blood pressure. Since Vitamin D is a common deficiency, this may be part of the cause of high blood pressure.Vitamin D is hard to get from foods, and most people do not stay out in the sun long enough to produce adequate amounts.
When you do not have enough Vitamin D in your body, this affects the way your kidneys are able to manage your blood pressure. Over time, this can lead to high blood pressure.
The only way to tell if you're getting adequate Vitamin D is by a blood test. This will let you know if you're deficient in this essential vitamin.

, One particular beverage that can be a cause for hypertension is alcohol. If you drink on a regular basis, this could be increasing your risk for this chronic disease.Alcohol affects many organ systems in your body. In particular, it can damage your heart - especially if you've been drinking for a while.
When your heart is damaged, it needs to work harder to pump blood through your body. This is what will increase your blood pressure.
Take note of how many alcoholic beverages you have each day or throughout the week. One shot, 4 oz of wine or 8 oz of beer count as one alcoholic beverage.

, Once you've identified some of the causes of high blood pressure, begin working on changing your lifestyle and diet so that you can reduce your overall risk.


Reducing your sodium intake is one of the best and easiest ways to reduce your risk for high blood pressure.
Most health professionals recommend that you keep your total sodium levels under 2,500 mg per day; however, newer recommendations say that 1,500 – 2,000 mg should be your limit.Tracking your foods in a food journal can help you see how much sodium you consume daily and which foods you eat are the highest in sodium.
In particular, you should stay away from foods like: pizza, frozen meals, fast foods, fried foods, canned foods (especially soups) and processed meat.

, As mentioned, to help counteract the sodium in your diet, you need to make sure you're eating enough potassium. Try increasing the amount of potassium-rich foods that you eat during the day.


Fruits, vegetables, dairy products, and whole grains contain potassium. Try to include several servings of these during the day.
Include 1 cup of vegetables, 1/2 cup of fruit, 2 oz of whole grains or 1 cup of dairy foods per serving.The following foods are exceptionally high in potassium: potatoes, dairy foods, tomatoes, kidney beans, dried fruit, bananas, avocados, fish, and acorn squash., Although diet modifications are important, it would be more beneficial for you to lose weight. If you are overweight or obese, even losing a little weight can make a big difference on your blood pressure.Even losing just 5 – 10 pounds can help drop your blood pressure by a few points almost immediately.
To see if you need to lose weight, check your BMI or your ideal body weight. If these measures indicate that you are above your target weight, aim for weight loss.
It's typically recommended to try to lose about 1-2 pounds per week. This is safe and sustainable weight loss., Even if you lose weight and change your diet, if you continue with destructive lifestyle choices, your blood pressure will still be elevated. Stop smoking and decrease your alcohol consumption to help decrease your risk for hypertension.If you currently smoke, you need to quit. Try to quit cold turkey since this removes those harmful toxins from your body immediately.
If you're having trouble quitting, consider talking to your doctor about prescription medication or referring you to a smoking cessation program.
In addition to giving up smoking, cut down on your alcohol consumption. Women shouldn't have more than one drink daily and men should limit themselves to two drinks or less per day.

, Exercising regularly will help you decrease your blood pressure and reduce your overall risk. Start adding in regular aerobic and strength training to your routine each week.Health professionals recommend that you participate in at least 150 minutes of aerobic activity each week.
Aim for moderate-intensity activities like: hiking, jogging, walking, swimming, biking, taking an aerobics class, or using the elliptical.
Moderate-intensity means that your heart rate is at 50 – 70% of your max heart rate the entire time you are exercising. Your estimated max heart rate is 220 - your age. So, if you are 42, your max heart rate is about 178 beats per minute (220 - 42 = 178).
Also include one to two days of strength training each week. Aim to work each major muscle group and your workouts should total at least 20 minutes.
Include weight training exercises like: weightlifting, plyometrics, pilates or yoga.

Know what is meant by the term ""arrhythmia"".,
Recognize the potential symptoms of arrhythmia.,
Understand the possible causes of arrhythmia.,
Be aware of the risk factors.",How to Identify Heart Arrhythmias1," Electrical impulses in the heart direct the heart beat. The normal heartbeat is about 60 to 100 beats per minute (about 100,000 beats a day). When the electrical impulses are disturbed and do not work properly, it causes heart rhythm problems.


The heart can beat too fast (tachycardia) or too slow (bradycardia) or it can beat irregularly (atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation), these abnormalities in the normal rhythm of the heartbeat are known as heart or cardiac arrhythmias.
This condition can be harmless if palpitations occur occasionally, but there are instances that the signs and symptoms persist for a long period of time that cause discomforts to an individual and could be life threatening.;
, A heart arrhythmia may not demonstrate any symptoms. The health care provider can only discover an abnormality in the heart beat upon performing physical examinations. The doctor will take the pulse, listen to the heart and perform certain diagnostic exams to detect abnormalities in the heart rhythm. If symptoms develop in heart arrhythmia it may include:


Palpitations or irregular heartbeat. This occurs as a result of the disturbance in the electrical impulses of the heart.
Shortness or difficulty in breathing. Disturbance in the electrical impulses of the heart affects its pumping action, therefore, unable to supply blood to the vital organs such as the lungs. Without sufficient blood, the lungs cannot perform its function well.
Chest pain. Because the heart is not pumping enough blood to the vital organs, pain receptors near the heart sends signal to the brain and a burning, sharp or heavy feeling in your chest are felt.
Dizziness, mental confusion, lightheadedness and fainting spells. Because the heart is not pumping enough blood to the vital organs such as the brain, the level of consciousness of the person is altered.

, A fast or slow heartbeat does not necessarily indicate an abnormality in the heart rhythm. The heart rhythm can be affected by anxiety, activity and medications. Heart arrhythmias can be caused by:


Heart disorders. Endocarditis, myocarditis and rheumatic fever can damage the heart and its valves that affects the proper functioning of the heart.
Fluid imbalance. Dehydration or depletion of potassium or other electrolytes may trigger the development of cardiac arrhythmia.
Certain medications. Some drugs including digitalis, stimulants, and diuretics, as well as overdoses of cocaine, marijuana or antidepressants can lead to cardiac arrhythmia.
Heart attack. This medical condition causes injury to the heart.
Healing process. Surgery involving the chest and heart can affect the rhythm of the heart as it undertakes healing.
Thyroid gland disorders

, The risk factors for arrhythmia include:


Advancing age
Excess consumption of caffeine or alcohol
High blood pressure
Kidney disease
Smoking
Stress

Keep your fingers away from the cold sore(s).,
Wash your hands frequently.,
Take medications to speed the healing process.",How to Prevent a Cold Sore from Spreading1," The herpes virus can spread to your fingers and cause a type of infection known as herpes whitlow. To prevent this, do not touch the cold sore with a bare finger, suck on your finger while you have a cold sore, or otherwise put your fingers into contact with the cold sore.Even if your cold sore is painful, resist the temptation to pick at it. Instead, take an over-the-counter pain reliever such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen, or use a topical pain-relieving cream containing lidocaine or benzocaine.;
, Even if you take care not to touch your cold sore, you might touch it without realizing that you did. Washing your hands frequently will help keep the virus from spreading to other areas., Since the herpes virus is most contagious when cold sores appear, if you can make them go away, then you reduce the chances of spreading the virus elsewhere on your body.


Ask your doctor about what antiviral drugs (such as Acyclovir, Valacyclovir, Famciclovir, and Penciclovir) you can take to make the cold sores disappear sooner.
Some antivirals are in pill form, while others are creams. For severe cases there are also injections.
You can also take an over-the-counter cream (containing Docosanol) to shorten your cold sore outbreak.If you use an antiviral cream, apply it to the cold sore while wearing a disposable glove and/or use a cotton swab. This will keep you from touching the cold sore and potentially spreading the virus."

Expect cardiac (heart) imaging and blood tests to find clogged arteries.,
Expect kidney function testing to determine of your renal arteries are blocked.,
Get evaluated for Peripheral Artery Disease.",How to Identify Symptoms of Clogged Arteries2," Your physician will likely order blood tests to evaluate for the presence of certain sugars, cholesterol, calcium, fats and proteins in the blood that can raise the risk of atherosclerosis or clogged arteries.The doctor may also order electrical studies of the heart using electrocardiogram to record electrical signals indicating if you have had a heart attack in the past or having one presently.
Your doctor may also request imaging studies including echocardiogram, Computed Tomography (CT), and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to evaluate how the heart is working, see blocked passages in the heart, and visualize any calcium deposits which may be contributing to narrowing or clogging of the heart arteries.A stress test may also be conducted. This will allow the doctor to measure blood flow to the heart muscle under stress conditions., Your physician may order a serum creatinine, glomerular filtration rate, and blood urea nitrogen test to evaluate your kidney function. These are all different tests on your urine. An ultrasound and CT scan may also be used to visualize blocked arteries or calcium deposits., Peripheral Artery Disease is a circulatory disease, in which your arteries are narrowed. This narrowing of the arteries reduces circulation to the limbs.One of the simplest tests is to have your physician evaluate the two different pulses in your feet during a routine physical examination. You have a higher risk of having this disease if you are:Under 50 years of age, have diabetes and at least one of the following: smoking, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels.
Over 50 years of age and have diabetes
Fifty years or older and have been a smoker
Are at 70 years or older
Have one or more of these symptoms: foot or toe pain at rest that disturbs sleep, a wound on the skin of the foot or leg that is slow to heal (longer than 8 weeks), and fatigue, heaviness, or tiredness of the leg, calf, or buttock muscles which happens with activity and goes away with rest.

Understand the causes behind clogged arteries.,
Eat a healthy diet rich in healthy saturated fats and low in sugar, fructose, and carbohydrates.,
Stop smoking.,
Keep your weight within normal weight range.,
Get regular exercise for 30 minutes every day.,
Try to reduce the stress.,
Talk to your doctor about medication.",How to Identify Symptoms of Clogged Arteries3," While many people believe the fatty substance that blocks arteries is caused by an excess of cholesterol, this explanation is much simpler than the complexities of the different sizes of cholesterol molecules. Cholesterol is required by the body to make vitamins, hormones and other chemical transmitters. Researchers have discovered that while certain cholesterol molecules are dangerous to your heart and developing clogged arteries, it is sugar and carbohydrates which set up an inflammatory response in the body that is a significant precursor to atherosclerosis.While you might be steering clear of saturated fats to reduce your cholesterol level and risk of atherosclerosis and clogged arteries, you will have been making a significant mistake. Eating healthy saturated fats has not been scientifically linked with heart disease and clogged arteries. However, diets high in fructose, sugar-filled low-fat food options, and whole grain wheat have been linked to dyslipidemia creating clogged arteries. Fructose can be found in beverages, fruits, jelly, jams and other pre-sweetened food., Carbohydrates are metabolized into sugars in the body and will also increase the inflammatory response. Large amounts of sugar, fructose, and carbohydrates will increase your risk of developing diabetes. Diabetes increases your risk of clogged arteries.


This includes only drinking a moderate amount of alcohol.

, The exact toxic components in tobacco which trigger atherosclerosis and clogged arteries is not known, but researchers do know that smoking is a primary risk for inflammation, thrombosis and the oxidation of low-density lipoproteins, all of which contribute to clogged arteries., Increased weight increases your risk of diabetes. Diabetes, in turn, increases your risk of clogged arteries.

, A lack of physical exercise is one of the factors that predict 90% of the risk of heart attacks in men and 94% of the risk in women.Heart disease and heart attacks are just two of the results of clogged arteries.

, Another contributing factor may be your levels of stress. Just remember to relax and take breaks that will help you to unwind. While taking your blood pressure won't tell you how bad you cholesterol is, it can most definitely be an indicator in whether or not you should be concerned.

, Your doctor may prescribe a drug called a statin to reduce the buildup of plaque in your arteries.They cause your body to stop producing cholesterol in the hope that it will instead absorb the existing cholesterol that is built up in you arteries.Statins are not for everyone, but if you have diabetes, already have heart disease, have high levels of cholesterol (190 mg/dL or higher LDL cholesterol), or a high 10-year risk of heart attack, your doctor may recommend you try it.Statins include atorvastatin (Lipitor), fluvastatin (Lescol), lovastatin (Altoprev), pitavastatin (Livalo), pravastatin (Pravachol), rosuvastatin (Crestor) and simvastatin (Zocor)."

Get an electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG).,
Wear a Holter monitor.,
Use a transtelephonic monitor (or event recorder).,
Undergo treadmill testing (Exercise Stress Test or Stress Test).,
Agree to a tilt-table test.,
Try electrophysiologic testing - (EP study).,
Undergo an esophageal electrophysiologic procedure.,
Go for a transthoracic echocardiography (TTE).,
Get an echocardiogram.",How to Identify Heart Arrhythmias2," This painless procedure is the standard clinical tool for diagnosing arrhythmias. It is done by placing small patches or stickers across the chest area and electrodes on each arms and legs. The combinations of the electrodes shows different tracings of the heart’s electrical activity and it is recorded on a paper or in the computer.


After the procedure, the ECG result will show three major waves. The first wave is the P wave, it records the activity of the atria. The second and the largest wave is the QRS wave, it records the electrical activity of the ventricles. And the third wave is the T wave, it records the heart’s return to its resting state.
The doctor will interpret the ECG result by studying the shape and sizes of the waves, the time interval of the waves and the heartbeat and regularity. By measuring time intervals on the ECG, the doctor can determine how long the electrical wave takes to pass through the heart and understand whether the electrical activity is normal or slow, fast or irregular.
By measuring the amount of electrical activity passing through the heart muscle, a cardiologist can detect if there are disturbances in the parts of the heart. It can identify enlargement and overfunctioning of the heart.

, This is a small, portable ECG recorder that continuously documents the electrical activity of the heart for the given measurement period. The health care provider attaches the electrodes to the chest and it is connected to a portable, battery operated recorder that can run for 24 to 48 hours.


During the procedure, the patient tested is allowed to perform his normal activities. The patient is then advised to keep a diary where he can document his activities and the symptoms experienced while under the procedure. The importance of the diary is it assists the health care provider to compare the activities and symptoms to the recorded electrical signals of the heart.
After the given measurement period, the computer instantly analyzes the records and detects heart rhythm disturbances that occurred during the procedure.

, This is recommended if the symptoms of cardiac arrhythmias occur rapidly or irregularly. The small recorder used in the patient's home for a month or two.


The individual tested for the presence of cardiac arrhythmias is advised to turn on the device and attach the recorder with bracelets, finger clips or patches under the arm when he experiences symptoms of the condition.
The heart rate and rhythm during the symptom attack will be recorded and stored in the event monitor. If possible, the ECG will be immediately transmitted to the cardiologist to be analyzed.

, This test is performed in people with arrhythmias where the cause is suspected to be aggravated by exercise. It is important to know what specific exercise will worsen the condition of arrhythmia, so it can be avoided.


During the test the person is hooked into an equipment to monitor the heart activities. The person is then directed to walk slowly in place on a treadmill and as the procedure goes on, the speed of the treadmill is gradually increased and it is tilted to produce the effect of going up a small hill.
The person may be asked to breathe into a tube for couple of minutes. The test can be stop anytime if needed. After the procedure, the patient is then allowed to sit or lie down to monitor his heart and blood pressure.
While on the treadmill, the person’s heart rate and rhythm is being monitored. The presence of a health care provider is necessary during the test to aid when unexpected scenario happens.

, Fainting spells or syncope is one of the symptoms of cardiac arrhythmia. If this happens repeatedly, a tilt-table test is recommended to indicate the heart rate and blood pressure when the person changes positions from lying to standing.


An intravenous line is inserted aseptically as a precaution in case medication is needed if the cause of syncope is detected during the test. The medication can help prevent the recurrence of syncope.
The test is normal if the average blood pressure stays stable as the table tilts upward and the heart rate increases by a normal amount.

, Temporary electrode catheters are inserted through peripheral veins or arteries into the atria, ventricles or both, and are positioned along the conduction system of the heart under local anesthetic.


The test records cardiac electrical signals and monitors the range of electrical impulses during each beat which helps locate the heart block. This test also shows where tachycardia originates.
The ability to electrically stimulate the heart at programmed rates and persuade precisely timed premature beats lets a doctor evaluate electrical properties of the electrical conduction of the heart. It also triggers dormant tachycardia or bradycardia.

, A thin, soft and flexible plastic tube is inserted into the nostril and placed in the esophagus. The esophagus is located near the atria so it can give a more accurate ECG reading.


An electrical stimulator can be used to make the heart beat faster and will restart arrhythmia.
During the procedure, certain medications can be tested to identify which is the most effective drug to treat certain types of tachycardia.

, This is a non invasive and painless test that uses ultrasound waves to provide images of the heart’s size, structure and motion that could lead to arrhythmia.


The technician asks the patient to turn on his left side and a gel is applied to the chest and the transducer is moved over the chest.

, This test uses ultrasound waves to show the heart’s structure and movement while beating. It is a simple and painless test that provides valuable information and images about a heart with an arrhythmia.

Keep in mind the risk of spreading the cold sore virus to others at all times.,
Wash your hands frequently.,
Do not share certain items with others.,
Do not kiss anyone.,
Do not engage in oral sex.,
Take medications to speed the healing process.",How to Prevent a Cold Sore from Spreading2," While the virus is most contagious when it causes painful cold sores to appear, it lies dormant in the body of an infected person at all times. This means that you can transmit the virus to others even if no cold sores are visible on your body., Even if you take care not to touch your cold sore, you might touch it without realizing that you did. Washing your hands frequently will help keep the virus from spreading to other people., If you have a cold sore, you should not share with other people things like eating utensils, razors, towels, drinks, toothbrushes, lip balms, and other items that may come in contact with the cold sore or saliva. This includes secondary contact, as when your hand touches the cold sore and then the item., The herpes virus can pass from your cold sore to another person through kissing, so to be safe you should refrain from kissing someone while you have a visible cold sore., Engaging in oral sex while you have a cold sore can spread the herpes virus that causes cold sores (HSV-1) to the genitals.Oral sex can also cause the herpes virus that causes genital herpes (HSV-2) to spread from an infected person to the lips., Since the herpes virus is most contagious when cold sores appear, if you can make them go away, then you reduce the chances of spreading the virus to another person.

Sit down if you begin to feel dizzy.,
Be aware if you feel really tired without any real reason to feel that way.,
Tell someone if you start feeling confused.,
Go to the hospital if you feel extensive chest pain.,
Know the difference between AF and a stroke.",How to Identify Atrial Fibrillation1," When your heart starts beating quickly, as it does when you have atrial fibrillation, the rest of your body gets less blood supply because your heart is beating less efficiently. When your body’s blood supply slows down, oxygen levels in your blood decrease, which will make you feel like you can’t catch your breath.You may experience this feeling of breathlessness when you are climbing the stairs, exercising, or simply just walking.;
, Having palpitations means that you feel like your heart is pounding or fluttering. When you experience atrial fibrillation, you may feel like your heart is trying to beat out of your chest., One symptom of AF is a feeling of dizziness. If you experience this, sit down right away. When your heart beats to quickly, the rest of your body can have a hard time keeping up. You might suddenly start feeling light-headed or nauseous, as well as dizzy.If you get too lightheaded, you might faint, so its important to sit down when you start feeling this way.

, When your heart is working overtime, as it is when you have atrial fibrillation, you will get tired more easily. When AF occurs, your heart’s ventricles don’t fill up as fast, causing you to feel tired or fatigued.

, When your heart beats irregularly, your blood flow gets messed up. This means that your brain will be receiving less blood than it is used to. Because of the lack of oxygen to the brain, you may feel confused or disoriented., Chest pain generally only develops as AF progresses. Some people describe this kind of pain as squeezing or pressure that builds up around your heart. You might also feel really full, even if you haven’t eaten anything. You’ll feel pain when you are exerting effort or straining in some way. This pain is created by the heart not getting enough blood due to its irregular heartbeat.


If you feel chest pain, go to the hospital because this could mean you are going to have, or are having, a heart attack.

, AF and stroke both have similar symptoms but are very different conditions. Atrial fibrillation is an irregular heartbeat, while strokes are caused by a blood clot forming somewhere in your body that is stopping the circulation of blood. The way to tell the difference between the two is to check for an irregular heartbeat by checking your pulse--if your heartbeat is irregular, you have AF.


However, AF can lead to stroke, so it is important to get AF treated as soon as it is diagnosed.

Monitor your energy levels.,
Look for fainting.,
Keep an eye out for dizziness.,
Stay conscious of chest pain.,
Be aware of stomach pain.",How to Identify Cardiac Arrest Warning Signs when Working Out1," Working out can be tiring, and if you’re working out for a longer period of time, you’re likely to feel some degree of healthy exhaustion. But if you’re working out and feel totally fatigued or suddenly drained of energy, and cannot recover even after sitting down for a brief time, this could indicate a health problem, including heart disease. See your doctor for an evaluation as soon as possible., Fainting — also known as syncope or blackouts — is a condition characterized by a temporary and unwanted loss of consciousness. If you’re working out one minute then suddenly wake up on the ground the next, you’ve fainted. Contact emergency services for immediate evaluation.Several other conditions could produce fainting spells, so don't immediately assume you are on the verge of cardiac arrest.For instance, if you are diabetic or have arrhythmia, you might experience fainting. Even standing up too quickly can, in some cases, induce fainting. Whatever the reason, fainting warrants a visit to your doctor.
You might feel short of breath just before you faint.

, Dizziness is the feeling that you are spinning or unstable. Some people describe dizziness as the feeling that their head is spinning. This can be another warning sign of cardiac arrest, though it can indicate many other underlying health issues as well. See your doctor as soon as possible.Dizziness might also be a product of your workout. Working out too hard, or working out in the sun, could produce dizziness.
Sit down for five to 10 minutes and drink some water if you feel dizzy while working out. Ease back into your workout slowly or call it quits for the day.
Milder forms of dizziness like feeling lightheaded or woozy are also potential precursors to cardiac arrest.

, Pain in the chest — especially pain over the left side of the chest where the heart is located — is a warning sign that there may be a problem with your heart. Rest if you feel any chest pain not associated with whatever exercise you’re engaged in and see your doctor for evaluation., Nausea and vomiting sometimes precede cardiac arrest. If you feel queasy or actually throw up when working out, this is another sign that you need to see your doctor. Nausea and vomiting could be a sign of many different conditions, but it can sometimes occur before cardiac arrest. "

Knowing these can help you and your doctor identify the cause of your lightheadedness and the best way to rid yourself of it.If you are over the age of 65 years, you are more likely to have a medical condition or take medications that causes lightheadedness.Medications including drugs to lower blood pressure or pain, prevent seizures, sedatives and tranquilizers can cause lightheadedness.If you’ve experienced past episodes of lightheadedness, you're more likely to get them in the future.;
, Lightheadedness is often easily treated through self-care, but if you experience unexplained, recurring, or severe lightheadedness, see your doctor. This will help rule out more serious conditions and find the best way to get rid of your lightheadedness.If you have unexplained, quick onset, and severe lightheadedness accompanied by the symptoms such as head injury, severe headache, a very stiff neck, blurred vision, sudden hearing loss, trouble speaking, leg or arm weakness, and chest pain or rapid slow heart rate, call 911 or go to the nearest emergency room to rule out a serious condition.Your doctor will ask you questions about the symptoms of lightheadedness you have as well as about any medical conditions you have and medications you take. Keep a log of the times you feel lightheaded to share with your doctor. Your doctor may order tests or an MRI to pinpoint the cause of your lightheadedness.If your doctor doesn’t find a cause and your lightheadedness continues, your doctor will discuss possible medications you can take or self-care measures you can use to make your symptoms manageable., Depending on the results of your doctor’s visit and possible tests, your doctor will prescribe treatment to manage your lightheadedness. Your doctor may prescribe medications or suggest managing your lightheadedness with self-care.


If your lightheadedness is cause by an inner ear conditions, your doctor may prescribe balance retraining exercises, which is also called vestibular rehabilitation. You may also get a prescription for meclizine (Antivert), diazepam (Valium), or dimenhydrinate (Dramamine) to help immediately alleviate nausea and lightheadedness.If you have Meniere's disease, which causes the sensation of spinning, your doctor may prescribe a diuretic and dietary changes, such as a low-sodium diet, to minimize how much fluid your body is retaining.If you have lightheadedness because of vestibular migraine, your doctor may help you figure out what triggers your attacks, such as diet, stress, sleep and exercise. Your doctor may also prescribe to help prevent attacks or relieve nausea.If you suffer from an anxiety disorders, your doctor may prescribe medications and psychotherapy that may relieve your anxiety and dizziness.If you have anemia, or low iron levels, your doctor may suggest self-care through dietary changes.If you have hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, your doctor may suggest self-care through eating regular, healthy meals and carrying a snack.Heart conditions such as abnormal heart rhythm, or arrhythmia, may decrease your blood volume causing orthostatic hypotension, or low pressure when you stand up from lying or sitting down.Your doctor may suggest the self-care treatment sitting down and allowing your circulation to stabilize when this happens.Some medications, including anti-seizure drugs, sedatives, and tranquilizers can also cause lightheadedness and your doctor may re-evaluation your use of these treatments if they’re causing your lightheadedness., No matter the cause of your lightheadedness, stop what you're doing and rest for a couple of minutes. This will help your circulation and brain adjust.Continuing to move or moving suddenly can make your lightheadedness worse, and may cause you to lose your balance.If you are not laying down and are able, consider putting your head on or between your knees. This will also help stabilize your blood flow and stop your lightheadedness., Making sure that you are getting enough oxygen can help relieve lightheadedness. Taking deep, steady breaths will help to get your body vital oxygen, but also calm you down.Try breathing to a count to help you focus on stabilizing your oxygen levels and pulse. For example, you can inhale for a count of four and exhale for a count of four. Choose a count that suits you best.Breathing slowly and deeply will help decrease an elevated heart rate, which also can make you feel lightheaded., Both low blood sugar and low iron levels can cause you to feel lightheaded. Making sure that you are eating healthy and regular meals can help you avoid feeling lightheaded.Natural, whole foods including lean proteins, fruits and vegetables, and legumes will help you maintain normal blood sugar throughout the day, making you less likely to have a spell of lightheadedness.
If you often suffer from lightheadedness because of low blood sugar, consider carrying a snack like a granola bar or an apple with you to combat any symptoms that might flare up.
If you have low iron levels, incorporate more iron-rich foods into your diet to maintain safe levels of iron and help decrease the likelihood of lightheadedness. Examples of iron-rich foods are red and organ meats such as beef and liver, spinach, and dried beans.In some cases, not having enough sodium in your diet can cause lightheadedness. Dissolve a teaspoon of salt into a glass of water and this may help regulate your circulation and relieve your lightheadedness., Consuming enough liquids every day can keep you from feeling lightheaded. In hot weather, staying hydrated will also help you from overheating.You should drink at least 10 glasses of liquid a day to prevent dehydration. Drink 2 US quarts (2,000 ml) or 2 liters of cool liquids every 2 to 4 hours to relieve dehydration and overheating.Water is the best way to stay hydrated, but you can also drink other liquids such as tea, fruit juice, sports beverages, or non-caffeinated soda.Hyperthermia, or overheating, and dehydration can make you feel lightheaded. Resting in a cool place and drinking water or a sports drink (Gatorade, Powerade, others) will usually help ease the dizzy feeling.Remove as many clothes as possible to keep yourself cool and from losing any more fluids., Certain stimulants including caffeine, alcohol, tobacco, illegal drugs, affect your circulation and increase your pulse. Avoiding these substances will help you prevent lightheadedness or keep it from getting worse., If you are experiencing frequent episodes of lightheadedness, especially unexplained lightheadedness, avoid driving a car or operating other heavy machinery.In addition, you may need rest to help relieve your symptoms of lightheadedness. Arranging for friends, family, or colleagues to help you with transportation and other activities while you’re experiencing lightheadedness can ensure that you don’t seriously injure yourself or someone else.Keeping your home well lit and free of hazards that might cause you to trip or fall will also help you avoid serious injury."

Prevent the spread of HSV.",How to Treat Cold Sores on Lips," Some OTC cold sore medications can shorten the duration of cold sores, although they're only effective if you apply them at the first signs of an outbreak. As soon as you notice tingling, apply an ointment containing docosanol. Other ointments may also contain benzocaine or lidocaine to relieve the pain, reduce cold sore symptoms, and protect your skin. They may contain alcohol that dries out the blisters, promoting healing.Realize that OTC cold sore ointments might be expensive and only shorten the duration a little (a few hours to a day).;
, Wet a clean cloth, wring it out, and place it over the outbreak area. Or, you can fill a compress bag with ice cubes and place it over the area. Hold the cloth or compress bag in place for up to 20 minutes. A cool compress can reduce redness and help healing.If you use the wet cloth, it can remove skin crusting common with cold sores.To avoid damaging skin tissue, never apply ice directly to your skin. Always make sure there is a cloth in between your skin and the ice.

, Cold sores may dry out your lips and mouth, so apply a sun block or lip balm that contains zinc oxide. These can protect the area from further damage. If you notice the area is dry, you can apply a moisturizing cream.Avoid using lip or skin products with sunblock if your doctor prescribes you to take topical acyclovir, an HSV treatment., Treatments to try to try include:Propolis: Apply this synthetic beeswax which is available as an ointment (3%). It may reduce the severity and duration of your cold sores.
Topical zinc: Some studies suggest that applying zinc oxide cream can help reduce the duration of an outbreak. However, more research is needed., Contact your doctor if you have any condition that lowers your ability to fight infections (like HIV, autoimmune disease, or are getting chemotherapy), your symptoms are severe and don't go away after two weeks, or you have blisters or sores near your eyes.Your doctor may prescribe antivirals if the outbreak is severe, painful, or you're at risk for spreading HSV. Antivirals include:


Acyclovir
Valacyclovir
Famciclovir
Penciclovir

, Before you notice cold sores (fluid-filled blisters), you may have tingling, burning, or itching around your mouth and lips. The area may also swell and appear red. About 24 to 48 hours later, small blisters may appear on the edge of the lips, combine, and burst, leaving open sores that crust over and heal on their own.Cold sores usually heal within one to three weeks depending on whether it is your first occurrence. However, cold sores can last up to 6 weeks.Your first occurrence of cold sores may be accompanied by a fever, headache, painful gums and sore throat. Following outbreaks usually happen at the same spot but aren't usually as severe.

, Cold sores are caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV), a common worldwide virus that is contagious. There are two types of HSV. HSV-1 causes cold sores or fever blisters around the mouth and HSV-2 usually causes genital herpes (although HSV-1 can also cause genital herpes). HSV-1 is spread through skin to skin contact like kissing or through sharing utensils or glasses. It is common and up to 90% of American adults have been exposed to it, although not all people who have the virus show symptoms.After the first infection, the virus lies inactive. However, HSV-1 can be reactivated, leading to further outbreaks of cold sores.

, Usually, HSV-1 is not dangerous. However, if you have a weakened immune system (because of HIV/AIDS, burns, anti-rejection therapy for transplants, chemotherapy) you are at a higher risk for serious complications. These complications include HSV-1 spreading to other skin areas, eye infection leading to blindness, and organ complications. Pay attention to triggers that can reactivate the virus. These include:Fever
Common cold
Stress
Sun exposure
Hormonal changes (such as those related to menstrual cycles)
Fatigue

If you have a condition that lowers your ability to fight infection, get medical attention if you think you have an HSV infection.



, HSV is very contagious and while HSV-1 is usually associated with mouth sores, it can cause genital warts. To prevent the spread of HSV, you should:Avoid kissing people with visible cold sores
Avoid sharing personal items (like towels, lip balm, or hygiene products)
Avoid sharing utensils or glasses
Keep your hands clean by washing your hands frequently
Be careful touching your eyes and genitals
Avoid performing oral sex

Try using aloe vera.,
Apply lemon balm essential oil.Several studies have shown that lemon balm can reduce the redness and swelling of cold sores, and can speed healing.,
Apply peppermint oil.Although studies are still patchy, peppermint oil has shown signs of stopping the herpes virus from reproducing in controlled lab situations.,
Apply tea tree oil.,
Apply a lip balm.,
Brew a tea.,
Apply aloe vera oil directly.,
Apply a cream or ointment.,

Do not apply essential oils to open sores.,
Talk to your doctor.,
Use caution when applying essential oils to children.,
Use caution when using essential oils while pregnant or breastfeeding.",How to Treat Cold Sores with Essential Oils," There is evidence that aloe vera can help fight infection, reduce inflammation, and promote the healing of cold sores.Aloe vera contains glycoproteins, which speed the healing process by stopping pain and inflammation, and polysaccharides, which stimulate skin growth and repair. They are also full of amino acids and B1, B2, B6 and C vitamins.You can buy aloe vera essential oil, cream, lip balm, or juice. You can also grow an aloe vera plant, snip off pieces of it as needed, and apply the gel directly.;
, It may even reduce the chance of recurrence. Lemon balm does not affect cold sore pain or scabbing.Lemon balm oil is also known as Melissa oil, from the latin name Melissa Officinalus.

, Studies have not yet shown that it helps treat cold sores in humans. Do not apply peppermint oil to the face of a small child, as it could cause life-threatening respiratory issues., Tea tree oil has been found anti-inflammatory and active against certain strains of the herpes virus. Use as a gel, or apply mixed with a carrier oil. Do not swallow tea tree oil, and discontinue use if you show signs of an allergic reaction such as rash or swelling., You can buy a lip balm infused with peppermint oil (menthol), lemon balm, tea tree oil, or aloe vera. To avoid spreading your sores, use a cotton swab to apply your lip balm. Do not share your lip balm with anyone, even when you do not have an active cold sore.


Prevent cold sores by wearing lip balm with SPF., Lemon balm, and peppermint oil can be extracted by boiling. Boil a cup of water on the stove. Add 2 to 4 teaspoons of crushed peppermint leaf or lemon balm herb and let it boil for 10 to 15 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and let it cool, then strain out the plant matter. Apply tea with cotton balls to the sores throughout the day.You can also brew a diluted version for drinking.
Drinking tea tree oil tea is not recommended., Apply aloe vera essential oil or aloe vera gel directly to your cold sore. Aloe vera is mild and should not cause irritation. Use several times a day, as needed. Do not apply to an open wound. Dilute peppermint oil and lemon balm oil with neutral oil or water before applying to skin.Peppermint oil and tea tree oil can cause a rash when applied directly to the skin. Discontinue use if a rash appears., Buy a commercial cream or ointment containing lemon balm, peppermint oil, or aloe vera, and follow directions. Frequency of use will depend on the concentration of essential oil. Lemon balm is most frequently taken as a cream, while peppermint oil is more commonly found in lip balms, and aloe vera is usually taken as a gel.

, Most essential oils can be mixed with a neutral oil, such as coconut or vegetable oil, and applied to the skin. Mix 3-6 drops of essential oil per ounce of carrier oil. Apply to lips, but remember to apply with a disposable swab to avoid spreading your virus., Even aloe vera can cause an irritation when applied to open sores. Do not apply essential oils if they are causing a rash, burning, or irritation. You may be allergic, or you may be applying too potent a concentration of oil. Dilute lemon balm and peppermint oil before applying to skin., If you haven't received your diagnosis, visit a doctor to confirm that you are experiencing Herpes Simplex 1 cold sores. You may want to talk about prescription medications and over the counter salves that can help with cold sores. Talk to your doctor about the essential oils you are using to treat your sores, and ask about possible interferences.


Essential oils can interfere with a number of medications, including those used for diabetes, sedatives, thyroid issues, blood pressure, and HIV.

, Do not great cold sores in children with peppermint oil. Aloe gel may be used on the skin, but should not be taken orally. Lemon balm may be used topically on children. Speak to your child's doctor about appropriate dosages., Peppermint oil is likely safe for pregnant people, and may relieve nausea if drunk as a tea. Pregnant or breastfeeding women should not take lemon balm. Aloe may be used on the skin, but should not be taken orally."

Hold your hand out with your palm facing up.,
Press your fingers down on your wrist.,
Troubleshoot if you can’t find your pulse.,
Count your pulse beats.",How to Identify Atrial Fibrillation2," You should hold out your non dominant hand. For example, if you are right-handed, you would hold out your left hand. Place the index and middle finger or your dominant hand on the wrist of your outstretched hand, right below the base of your thumb., You will have to apply a bit of pressure to feel your pulse. Start out gently and gradually apply more pressure until you can feel your pulse. It should feel like a gentle, rhythmic pressure under your fingers.

, If you are having a hard time finding your pulse, move your fingers around to a different spot near to where you started and press down. Keep trying different spots until you find your pulse.You should keep your fingers in the area that is on the left side of your wrist when your palm is facing up.

, To figure out if your pulse is regular or not, look at your watch or begin a timer. You will have to count the number of pulse beats you feel during one minute of time. If you have atrial fibrillation, you will count more than 100 pulses during that minute. Your pulse will also be irregular, meaning that you won’t be able to predict when the next beat will come.


An average, healthy adult will have between 60 and 100 heart beats per minute (BPM). Kids ages 6 to 15 will have between 70 to 100 heart beats per minute."

Be aware that different heart diseases can cause AF.,
Know that lung diseases can sometimes affect the way your heart beats.,
Understand that an overly active thyroid can cause AF.,
Be aware that some lifestyle choices can cause your heart to beat abnormally.",How to Identify Atrial Fibrillation3," If you are suffering from a cardiovascular disease (a disease related to your heart or blood vessels), you may develop atrial fibrillation. A lot of heart diseases can affect how electricity flows through your heart. The change in electricity then changes how your heart beats. Heart diseases that can do this include:


Hypertension, coronary artery disease, heart valve disease, pericarditis and heart diseases that you’ve had since birth (these are known as congenital heart diseases).

, Because your respiratory system (your lungs) and cardiovascular system (your heart) are so intertwined, a problem with your lungs can create a problem with your heart. Chronic bronchitis and emphysema are two of the diseases that can affect your heart beat., Your thyroid gland creates hormones that control growth and metabolism. When you have an overactive thyroid (which is called hyperthyroidism), it can affect your nervous system, which controls the movement of electricity through your body. When your electricity gets abnormal, your heartbeat can also become abnormal., Consuming alcohol and caffeine can have an effect on how your heart beats. Caffeine in particular can cause your heartbeat to speed up (an issue called tachycardia) and that can spur on a bout of AF. Stress can also play a factor in bringing on atrial fibrillation. Stress, like caffeine, can speed up your heart, sending it spiraling into an abnormal beat.

"
"
Take anti-arrhythmic drugs to keep your heartbeat regular.,
Treat the health conditions that caused the AF.,
Eat heart healthy foods.,
Try to exercise everyday after you have gotten the O.K.,
Reduce or stop your consumption of substances that can lead to an unhealthy heart.",How to Identify Atrial Fibrillation4," Depending on the kind of anti-arrhythmic drugs you take, they may do one of several things. Some medications shorten the action potential of your heart, some lengthen the action potential, and some decrease the sympathetic activity of your heart.


The action potential of the heart refers to the electrical changes that each heart cell goes through when your heart beats.Decreasing the sympathetic activity of your heart means that the medications slows your heart down so that it is not beating very fast and irregularly., If you have one of the conditions listed in the section of this article that discusses risk factors, you should talk to your doctor about treating that condition. When the condition is treated, your AF will most likely go away.


For example, if you have hyperthyroidism (an overactive thyroid), you would most likely take a dose of radioactive iodine that treats hyperthyroidism. After that, your heartbeat would go back to normal., If you want to help your heart stay healthy, it is important to eat foods that give your heart the strength is needs to keep beating away. Some of the best heart healthy foods include:


Salmon, flaxseed, oatmeal, black beans, almonds, walnuts, tuna, tofu, brown rice, blueberries, carrots, spinach, and broccoli.For more information on eating a heart healthy diet, click here.


, by your doctor. When you have been seen by a doctor and he or she has determined that you have no underlying heart issues, you should try to work out everyday to keep your heart healthy. While it can be hard to fit exercise into your schedule, it can really help your heart if you manage to exercise for at least 30 minutes everyday. Exercising helps your heart to get strong and healthy. Exercise in ways that make you happy--be it intensely gardening, rock climbing, or wind surfing. (Of course you can also walk, run, swim, or bike if you prefer activities like that instead).

, In particularly, caffeine, tobacco, and excessive amounts of alcohol can all give your heart a hard time. Quit smoking and reduce your intake of caffeine and alcohol--if not cut them out of your diet entirely.

Undergo a preparticipation physical evaluation (PPE) if you are a young athlete.,
Know your family history.,
Consider your medical history.,
Identify any harmful habits.",How to Identify Cardiac Arrest Warning Signs when Working Out2," This evaluation is done to identify any conditions that may predispose you to injury or illness and clear you for safe participation in sports. The evaluation will include questions about any symptoms and your family history as well as check for a heart murmur or symptoms of Marfan syndrome (an inherited condition that may lead to heart problems).You should have a PPE before engaging in a sport or exercise. Clearance to participate will depend on the results of the evaluation and may also depend on the type of sport or even the position you play.
Keep in mind sudden cardiac arrest is very rare among young athletes and is more common in middle-age., If someone in your family had early onset heart disease, experienced cardiac arrest, or suffered from another heart condition, you are at greater risk of experiencing cardiac arrest. If you are unsure of your family’s history, ask relatives about your family’s health. For instance, you might ask a family member, “Did anyone in our family have any heart conditions?”Your doctor will ask you about your family history during your appointment regarding your potential cardiac arrest symptoms.

, There are many medical conditions that are closely correlated with cardiac arrest. For instance, if you have diabetes, high blood pressure (hypertension), or high blood cholesterol, you’re at elevated risk for cardiac arrest.Additionally, if you have had a heart attack or a previous episode of cardiac arrest, you are at elevated risk of experiencing cardiac arrest.
Other heart conditions like cardiomyopathy (a type of inherited heart disease), arrhythmia (an irregular heartbeat), and congenital heart defects also increase your odds for cardiac arrest.

, Apart from inherited conditions, lifestyle-related health complications — obesity, a sedentary lifestyle, use of illegal drugs, and drinking excessively (more than one to two drinks per day) — also make you more likely to experience cardiac arrest when working out."

Contact your doctor.,
Get an electrocardiogram (ECG).,
Receive echocardiography.,
Have your doctor administer a multiple gated acquisition (MUGA) test.,
Try a cardiac MRI.,
Talk to your doctor about cardiac catheterization.",How to Identify Cardiac Arrest Warning Signs when Working Out3," If you experience any of the warning signs of cardiac arrest, they may or may not be actually indicative of cardiac troubles. Many of them are common side effects of overly-strenuous physical activity. But if you experience any of these symptoms repeatedly, or if you have a history of heart problems (either personally or in your family), contact your doctor.It is also essential that you are evaluated by your doctor if you are planning to return to exercising after a long period of inactivity.


Once you’ve shared your symptoms and risk factors with your doctor, the two of you can begin developing a treatment plan that includes a workout regimen appropriate for you. You can (and should) still exercise, but you may need to modify the exercises or avoid high-impact activities (such as sprinting).
Remember that cardiac arrest caused by exercise is rare, and people who exercise are far less likely to develop heart disease or experience cardiac arrest than those who do not., An ECG is a noninvasive test that measures the electrical activity in your heart. During the examination, a doctor will attach up to 12 electrodes to your arms, legs, and chest. Your heart’s activity can be monitored through these electrodes.Your doctor will be able to interpret the ECG to determine if you have a heart disorder or cardiac issue that puts you at risk for cardiac arrest when working out., Echocardiography (or “echo”) is another noninvasive test that your doctor might use to find out more about the function of your heart. The echo is an ultrasound of your heart and can help your doctor check the size of your heart as well as look for any abnormalities in the muscle and blood flow.A variation of the echo that could be especially helpful to you — as someone who works out — is the stress echo. In this variation, you have an echo done, then undergo a cardiac stress test. A cardiac stress test is basically an examination of the heart before, during, and after a brief period of exercise like riding a stationary bike or running on a treadmill. Afterwards they will perform another echo to see how your heart responded to the activity.
Cardiac stress tests combined with echocardiography can help you determine how worried you should be about cardiac arrest when working out.

, A MUGA test involves the injection of a small amount of radioactive material into your heart. Doctors then use a special camera to track the radioactive material through your body to determine how well your heart is pumping blood.As in echocardiography, you may be asked to work out during your MUGA test in order to help your physician determine how well your heart responds to stress., A cardiac MRI is similar to the MUGA test. Both allow doctors to image your heart and better understand its operation. But the MRI uses magnets and radio waves rather than radiation to obtain detailed images of your heart.In some cases, you might get a saline solution injected into your arm. The solution is used to track the flow of blood through your body.
Since the MRI uses powerful magnets to image your heart, you should leave jewelry at home.
If you have a pacemaker or other implanted device, you might be unable to get an MRI.

, Cardiac catheterization is a procedure in which a long thin tube (a catheter) is inserted into your neck, arm, or upper thigh, then threaded through your body and into your heart. As is the case of MRIs and MUGA tests, you might be injected with a dye or trackable solute to aid in the imaging of your heart.If, in the course of cardiac catheterization, your doctor finds arterial blockages, they might insert a stent in order to keep the artery open and thereby reduce your odds of cardiac arrest when working out."

Reduce your exposure to cold sore triggers.Though the virus works differently from person to person, there are common triggers known to cause herpes outbreaks.,
Improve your overall health.The healthier your body is as a whole, the better it will be able to suppress the virus, thus reducing the frequency of outbreaks.",How to Tell if You Have a Cold Sore," Up to 60% of Americans have HSVI-1 by adolescence, and 85% by the time they reached their 60s.In Britain about seven in 10 people have it, but only one in five are aware of it. This is because some people carry the infection, but don’t have any symptoms., The symptoms of a cold sore are consistent, but the first outbreak is different. At that time, you'll see symptoms that you won't experience again during later outbreaks. These one-time symptoms include:Fever
Painful or eroded gums if the cold sore is in the mouth
Sore throat
Headache
Swollen lymph glands
Muscle aches

, After your first outbreak has passed, you'll be able to predict when cold sores are going to appear by looking for early indicators. The area where the sore will appear will suddenly feel tingly and itchy. You may also experience some numbness in the area.This stage, also called the prodromal stage, is experienced by 46% to 60% of people who have cold sores.Other early symptoms include inflammation, redness, hypersensitivity or soreness in the exact area the blisters will appear.

, When a cold sore is first appearing, it can look like the start of a pimple. It will be sore — possibly painful. This area will be red and raised; the skin surrounding the raised area will also be red. You may also notice several small blisters that develop together, then merge as other blisters fill in the area between them.Cold sores can vary in size, ranging from 2 – 3 mm to 7 mm.

, The raised areas take on the appearance of a blister. As the body fights the HSV-1 virus, white blood cells rush to the area and the blister fills with clear fluid containing the virus.Because cold sores are filled with infectious fluid, you should never pick at them. If you get the virus on your hands, you can spread it around to other people or get it in your eyes, or spread it to your genitals., This is the third and most painful stage in the development of a cold sore. The area will be moist, with a red area around the open sore. This period, when the blister leaks fluid, is the most contagious.Make sure to wash your hands regularly if you touch your face to prevent spreading the infection. It will take up to three days for the cold sore to move to its next stage., After the blister has burst, a crust will form over the top of the blister, followed by a protective scab. As the sore heals, the scab may crack open and bleed. You may also experience itching and pain during this stage.Avoid touching the sore, as you can slow down the healing process by reopening the wound.

, You remain contagious until the scab falls off naturally to reveal intact, healthy skin. In this final healing stage when the scab falls off, the skin beneath it will be dry and a little flaky. The area may also be a little swollen and red.From the start of tingling and itching until the scab comes off can take between 8 and 12 days.


Be careful not to share glasses or utensils with anybody until the cold sore has healed completely. Do not kiss anyone or place your cold sores into contact with others in any way.
Keep your hands off your face as best you can, as infectious fluid can be transferred to you skin. This, in turn, can spread infection to others, or spread it to other parts of your own body.

, Canker sores and mucositis can be mistaken for cold sores, but aren't caused by the herpes virus.


Canker sores appear inside the mouth, often near where the cheeks/lips meet the gums. People who wear braces can get them where the braces rub against the cheeks. Doctors believe they can have many causes: injury, certain toothpastes, food sensitivities, stress, allergies, and inflammatory or immune disorders.Mucositis is the term used to describe the sores that appear in the mouth and esophagus during chemotherapy. Chemotherapy kills rapidly dividing cancer cells. But it can't distinguish cancer from the cells in the mouth, which also divide rapidly. The resulting open sores are extremely painful., Without exception, the virus remains permanently in the body once it's been introduced. The virus can stay dormant, without activity, for years — in fact, most people who have herpes don't even know they have it.Regardless, the virus continues to live inside the body and will reappear when conditions are right.If your infection causes you to break out with cold sores, you will continue to get cold sores for the rest of your life.


Don’t panic, though! Cold sores are a manageable symptom that don’t have to interfere with your life.

, Docosanol (also known as Abreva) is an FDA approved medication for the treatment of cold sores. Its active ingredients are benzyl alcohol and light mineral oil, and it can reduce the duration of the outbreak to just a couple days. For the best results, begin use as soon as you notice the tingling and itching that suggests an oncoming outbreak. However, you can still begin use after the blister has already appeared., Some people may only get cold sores sporadically throughout their lifetime, while others may be plagued by frequent outbreaks. If frequent outbreaks are becoming a hassle for you, you may benefit from antiviral medication to prevent them. Talk to your doctor about the possibility of getting a prescription for acyclovir (Zovirax), valacyclovir, famciclovir, or Denavir., There may not be a cure, but there are many treatments that will reduce the pain from the blisters. FDA-approved pain relievers for external use include benzyl alcohol, dibucaine, dyclonine, juniper tar, lidocaine, menthol, phenol, tetracaine and benzocaine.You can also apply an ice pack to the cold sore to ease pain and discomfort. Be sure to protect the skin from direct contact with ice by using a washcloth or rag as a barrier., Coconut oil has potent antiviral properties. One of its key components is lauric acid, which contains a molecule called ""monocaprin."" In laboratory testing with monocaprin, researchers found it highly effective against HSV-1.Begin using the coconut oil as soon as you notice the cold sore developing.
Apply it with a Q-tip instead of your finger, as you don't want to touch a cold sore and spread the infection around.

, Herpes simplex viruses need an amino acid called ""arginine"" to multiply or grow. ""Lysine"" is an amino acid that counteracts the reproductive effects of arginine. Lysine is available both as a topical product (ointments) and as an oral supplement (pills).Use these products daily while you have an outbreak.


You can also make your own topical lysine application at home. Crush a lysine pill and mix it with a small amount of coconut oil. Apply the paste directly to the blister.
This way you can attack the cold sore both with a pill and with an external treatment.

, Cold sores are very contagious and can be spread even in the early stages of an outbreak, before a blister develops. The virus can spread from person to person through shared utensils, razors, and towels or through kissing. Oral sex can also spread herpes. HSV-1 can spread to the genital area, and HSV-2 can spread to the lips., The herpes virus uses the amino acid arginine to grow and replicate. When you take in a lot of arginine through your food, your body is more vulnerable to attacks from the virus. As a result, you will have more frequent cold sore outbreaks. Avoid the following arginine-rich foods:Chocolate
Nuts
Peanuts
Seeds
Cereal grains

, Even when you're not having an outbreak, it's a good idea to take a daily lysine supplement to prevent future outbreaks. 1 – 3 grams of lysine supplement may reduce the number and severity of herpes outbreaks.You can also make a point to work foods that naturally contain large amounts of lysine into your regular diet:


Fish
Chicken
Beef
Lamb
Milk
Cheese
Beans.

, By reducing these triggers (if you can), you may experience fewer outbreaks:


Viral fever
Hormonal changes, such as menstrual periods or pregnancy
Changes in your immune system, like severe burns, chemotherapy, or anti-rejection drugs after organ transplantsStress
Fatigue
Exposure to sun and wind

,


Eat a healthy diet with foods rich in lysine.
Reduce your intake of arginine-rich foods.
Sleep at least 8 hours each night.
Exercise each day to help reduce stress levels.
Take vitamin supplements to reduce your risk of developing a viral fever.
Wear protection on your lips when you're out in the sun.

Make sure your lip balm contains SPF 15 or higher as well.


Even during the winter, the sun can trigger an outbreak. Be sure to wear sunblock all year round.
Tanning beds can also trigger outbreaks. If you're sensitive to the sun, you'll also be sensitive to the UV light used in tanning beds.;
, Your immune system can suffer if you aren't getting adequate nutrition. When you aren't watching what you eat, you're more likely to have a cold sore outbreak. Focus on eating a healthy, balanced diet that includes plenty of produce, protein and whole grains.Increase the amount and variety of raw vegetables and fruit that you eat. In particular, consume broccoli, brussel sprouts and cabbage. These vegetables are high in indole-3-carbinol (I3C), which may interfere with the growth of the herpes virus.
Decrease the amount of processed meat products, saturated animal fats, white and refined sugars, artificial sweeteners, white flour, alcohol and caffeine that you consume. All of these are known to increase the frequency of cold sores.
Avoid foods that have a high amount of arginine. Arginine is an amino acid that serves as a building block for cold sores. Foods high in arginine include chocolate, nuts, seeds, oats, beer and most protein shakes.

, When your body is overtaxed, your immune system suffers and the virus is more likely to make itself known. Many people have outbreaks when they're feeling generally run down and stressed out. Take the following measures to keep yourself well rested and calm:Get plenty of sleep. Pulling all-nighters and rushing around all day takes a toll. Do your best to adhere to a sleep schedule that allows you to get seven to eight hours of sleep, so you feel well-rested.
Exercise regularly. Exercising is a good stress reliever that can help you calm down during anxious times. It also tires you out in a healthy way so you can sleep better at night.

, Getting the flu or a cold is a common trigger for cold sores. The winter months can be particularly trying, so pay special attention to your habits when the weather turns cold and illnesses start getting passed around.


The best way to keep yourself from getting sick is by washing your hands regularly using soap and warm water. Take special care when you spend time in a public setting, such as the subway or train station.
As soon as you start feeling a cold coming on, make sure you're well hydrated and try to get some rest. Avoid staying up to late and drinking alcohol. Sometimes you can stop a cold from taking hold if you catch it soon enough., Menstruation can be a trigger for some women, so it's important to anticipate the problem and head it off each month. As your period approaches, make sure you're getting plenty of sleep, eating well, and staying hydrated. These actions will help to reduce your other menstrual symptoms as well.

, The herpes virus can live on your toothbrush, so it's important to change it often. When you develop a cold sore, throw your toothbrush away. When the cold sore goes away, change your toothbrush again. This will prevent you from getting a second outbreak after the first one goes away.

Know when cold sores are most contagious.,
Be careful who you kiss and have sex with.,
Don't share food and beverages.,
Practice good hygiene.,
Reduce your stress levels.,
Avoid too much sun exposure.,
Increase your intake of lysine.,
Supplement with vitamin C. Although there is very little quality research investigating the effects on HSV specifically, it is clear that the vitamin has anti-viral and immune boosting properties, both of which are helpful for preventing cold sores.Vitamin C, also called ascorbic acid, increase the production and activity of specialized white blood cells, which seek out and destroy viruses and other pathogens.,
Consider other immune boosting supplements.,
Ask your doctor about taking antiviral medications.",How to Prevent Cold Sores," Until a person is experiencing an outbreak, it is difficult to know if the virus is being shed — this is known as ""asymptomatic shedding.""On the whole, a person is most contagious (viral shedding is at its highest) when blisters are present. Cold sores pass through different stages. Initially, they cause an itching, burning or tingling sensation for a day or so. Then small, hard, painful spots appear, which quickly turn into erupting blisters. The fluid-filled blisters then break, oozing an yellowish liquid before crusting over. The scabs then flake off and the skin returns to normal.

Cold sores persist for seven to 10 days and rarely leave scars.;
, The herpes simplex virus (HSV) is typically spread from person to person contact, either by kissing or close contact with the genitals (oral sex).The most contagious period is when active and erupting blister-like sores are present, either near the lips or genitalia. Once the cold sores have dried and crusted over (which typically takes a few days), the risk of contagion is significantly reduced. However, keep in mind that HSV can spread without the presence of a cold sore of any kind, because it can infect saliva and other body fluids.


Ask all potential partners about their HSV status before being intimate with them. If unsure, avoid kissing any skin abnormalities and don't exchange fluids.
Cold sores on the mouth are mainly caused by the oral (type 1) herpes virus, but they can also be caused by contact with the genital (type 2) herpes virus.
A healthy immune response usually combats it and prevents infection. Thus, people with weakened immunity are at higher risk of HSV infection and complications., Normally, HSV lives within nerves (ganglions) near the spinal cord, then it eventually gets triggered and travels within smaller peripheral nerves to the surface of the skin (around the mouth or genitalia), where it erupts and causes the formation of a sore. However, as noted above, HSV can also live in saliva and blood at certain stages and under certain circumstances.As such, reduce the risk of infected saliva exposure by not sharing food or beverages with anyone, regardless if they appear to have cold sores or not. In particular, refrain from sharing forks, spoons and straws.


For an infection to occur, HSV typically needs a way into tissue so it can access nerve fibers, which essentially act as ""highways"" for the virus. Thus, small cuts or abrasions around your mouth, on your lips and/or on your sex organs will increase the risk of infection. However, an infection can occur even without a cut.
Avoid sharing lip balms, lipstick and facial creams with other people also, as it's theoretically possible for HSV to survive on or in these mediums for short periods of time.

, It's rare to catch HSV and cold sores from contaminated surfaces, such as toilet seats or countertops, or other mediums like towels and washcloths, but it can occur.The herpes virus isn't well adapted to living outside the body, so it quickly dies when airborne or on surfaces — which is contrast to viruses that cause the common cold. However, you could easily get infected saliva or other body fluids directly on your hands from another person and then inadvertently rub your mouth or eyes, so washing your hands after touching people is a still good protective strategy.


Disinfect your hands by washing them with regular soap and water.
Cold sores pass through different stages. Initially, they cause an itching, burning or tingling sensation for a day or so. Then small, hard, painful spots appear, which quickly turn into erupting blisters. The fluid-filled blisters then break, oozing an yellowish liquid before crusting over. The scabs then flake off and the skin returns to normal.
Cold sores persist for 7-10 days and rarely leave scars.

, The exact reasons how or why HSV goes from its dormant stage within the spinal nerve ganglions to becoming active and spreading to the surface of the skin is not known, but stress certainly plays a factor.It's likely that stress weakens the immune system, allowing HSV to take advantage of the opportunity to spread and proliferate itself. Therefore, reducing the stress from your work and personal life is a good strategy to prevent cold sore outbreaks.


Natural and effective stress-relieving practices include meditation, yoga, tai chi and deep breathing exercises.
In addition to emotional stress caused by financial and/or relationship issues, your immune system is also negatively impacted by physiological stressors, such as dealing with other chronic or acute infections, poor nutrition, and exposure to toxins (such as alcohol or cigarette smoke).
Work on keeping all types of stress in check through healthy lifestyle choices: nutritious diet, adequate sleep (at least 8 hours nightly) and some daily exercise.

, Another trigger to activate HSV from its dormant stage is excessive ultraviolet radiation from the sun, especially if coupled with lots of windAlthough exposure to the sun in moderation tends to be healthy for the skin and immune system (primarily due to vitamin D production), too much UV radiation damages skin cells and seems to trigger the ever-opportunistic HSV to make an appearance. As such, don't overdo it at the beach, especially on windy days, and always apply a sunscreen of SPF 15 or higher.


Although sunburn in general can trigger the formation of cold sores around the mouth, make a special effort to protect your lips and mouth from UV radiation exposure. Use a zinc oxide cream or balm on your lips when outside and keep them well moisturized.
Colds sores have a tendency to reoccur in the same places during each outbreak, which can happen on a monthly basis (related to menstruation for some women) or once or twice a year., Lysine is an essential amino acid that has many benefits to human health, including anti-viral behavior. In essence, the anti-viral actions of lysine involve blocking the activity of arginine, which promotes HSV replication. Some scientific studies suggest that supplementing with lysine on a regular basis may help prevent outbreaks of cold sores and genital herpes.From scientific research, it appears that taking lysine is more effective for preventing HSV outbreaks than it is for reducing the severity or duration of outbreaks.


Not every study has shown positive results for using lysine as a preventive supplement for cold sores. Be aware that much supporting evidence is anecdotal, or not supported by scientific study.
Lysine is available in pill form and as a cream. If using pills, a typical preventive dose is at least 1,000 mg daily.Lysine rich foods that are relatively low in arginine include most fish, chicken, beef, dairy products, green beans, and most fruits and veggies (except for peas).

, Vitamin C is also necessary for the production of collagen, the compound needed to repair skin and allow it to stretch. Perhaps not coincidentally, lysine is also involved in collagen production, so maybe weakened and unrepaired skin cells around the mouth contribute to triggering HSV and cold sores — just a theory.


Recommendations for cold sore prevention range from 1,000-3,000 mg of vitamin C daily, in 2-3 divided doses. Taking more than 1,000 mg at a time may trigger diarrhea.
Rich sources of vitamin C include citrus fruits, kiwis, strawberries, tomatoes and broccoli.
Eating too much acidic fruit can cause canker sores on the inside of your mouth — don't confuse these with cold sores, which almost always appear outside the mouth.

, When trying to combat any infection, true prevention depends on a healthy and strong immune response. Your immune system is comprised of specialized cells that search and destroy harmful viruses and other potential pathogens, but when the system is weakened or compromised, then outbreaks and infections are more common. As such, focusing on ways to boost your immune system is a logical approach to naturally preventing cold sores. In addition to vitamin C, other immune boosting supplements include vitamins A and D, zinc, selenium, echinacea and olive leaf extract.Vitamin A reduces the risk of infection by maintaining moist mucosal membranes and by influencing specialized white blood cells of the immune system.
Vitamin D3 is produced in your skin in response to intense summer sunshine. Thus, D3 is a good choice of supplement during winter months.
Olive leaf extract is a strong anti-viral and may work synergistically with vitamin C.

, Although there are many over-the-counter medicines (in pill form or creams) that claim to be helpful in reducing the symptoms of cold sores, there are none that have proven to prevent outbreaks. However, some prescription anti-viral medications can help treat the symptoms and potentially prevent outbreaks.Commonly prescribed anti-virals include acyclovir (Xerese, Zovirax), valacyclovir (Valtrex), famciclovir (Famvir) and penciclovir (Denavir).If you have frequent outbreaks, your doctor may recommend taking an anti-viral drug daily for a few months as a trial. But in most cases, anti-viral drugs are taken as soon as the characteristic tingle or itchiness is felt, which acts to prevent the blisters from appearing or at least minimize their duration.


Keep in mind that the vast majority of HSV infected people do not have enough cold sore outbreaks to justify taking a daily anti-viral.
Common side effects from taking anti-virals include: skin rash, stomach upset, diarrhea, tiredness, joint pain, headache and dizziness.

Apply shampoos with more care when dealing with an infant.",How to Treat Seborrheic Dermatitis1," This is more for when applying dandruff shampoo treatment on the scalp.The over-the-counter treatments for seborrheic dermatitis in shampoos should include one of the following: coal tar, ketoconazole, salicylic acid, selenium sulfide, or zinc pyrithione.
Wash the scalp daily with the chosen product and warm (not hot) water so the skin is not damaged.
Continue this for a couple of weeks. If the condition hasn't improved, gotten worse, or you are otherwise concerned about the situation then you need to consult your doctor.
Most therapeutic shampoos should be left on a minimum of five to 10 minutes before rinsing.
Gently clean your eyelids by washing them each night with baby shampoo and wipe away scales with a cotton swab. Warm or hot compresses also may help to loosen the scales.
This is usually the step to take for infants with ""cradle cap"" irritation.;
, The dandruff shampoo treatment may be very specific, but you can still look for several qualities in products for other areas of your body.Look for antifungal treatments, creams that fight rash, itching, and inflammation.
Get skin moisturizing creams and gels. Find ones that are oil based (not water based) so they actually trap in moisture.
Treat the affected area to regular washing with the cream/gel a couple of times per day.
Continue this regular washing for a week or so. If there is no marked improvement, worsening of the condition, or you are worried about the condition then you should consult your doctor.
For treating the chest, medicated shampoos may be used. Triamcinolone 0.1% lotion can be applied twice a day until clear and then use once or twice a week.

, There are a number of natural remedies that are unverified by scientific research but are considered helpful by some based on anecdotal evidence, or personal experience. You can add these products to your shampoos and creams.You can try adding tea tree oil to your shampoo. Adding 10 to 12 drops could add some anti-fungal and astringent properties to the treatment. But there are studies suggesting that this substance has a high risk of inducing allergic reactions.
Taking fish oil supplements can help reduce inflammation and accelerate processing of other vitamins which help with skin healing.

, Infants' skin and scalp may be more easily irritated by some products. Consult a pediatrician if you are unsure of what to use.Use a bland shampoo such as Johnson’s Baby Shampoo. Leave it on for two to three minutes while gently scrubbing the baby's scalp with soft brush to remove scale and crust. Rinse thoroughly. Repeat this two to three times per week.
Don't move on to dandruff shampoos or other lotions without consulting a pediatrician.
Apply a topical steroid lotion of low potency to the areas on the scalp, such as hydrocortisone lotion 1% twice a day for two weeks.
To treat more extensive cradle cap, or in the milder cases in which medicated shampoo was not successful, treatment involves the removal of some of the scale prior to use of the medicated shampoo. Apply peanut or olive oil to the scalp at bedtime overnight to loosen scales, and then shampoo in the morning with one of the medicated shampoos.
If none of these techniques work or you want to try other products then you must consult a pediatrician.

Look for dry, reddish, itchy skin.,
Identify what kind of eczema your infant has.,
See a doctor.",How to Treat Infant Eczema Naturally1," Most likely eczema — in its various forms — will appear on your baby’s face, elbows, behind the knees, and on the hands and feet. Like most irritated skin, eczema will only worsen if scratched. In infants, eczema usually begins around the age of six to twelve weeks. The acute form generally lasts about one to two months and is followed by the chronic form noticeable by its big splotches of red, irritated skin.;
, There are six predominant types of eczema. If you can properly identify the type of eczema your child has, you’ll be able to better treat their condition. Some forms are the product of allergens like eggs, milk, soy, wheat, peanuts, fish, dust mites, pet dander, or mold spores. Other infants with eczema might simply have a genetic predisposition towards skin conditions.Atopic dermatitis: This is what is most commonly referred to as eczema, and it is common in infants. It is a reddish rash that can be itchy. It is usually chronic, or long-lasting. Allergic contact dermatitis: This form is often caused by contact with allergens such as nickle, topical antibiotics, poison ivy or poison oak and causes a red, itchy reaction at the site of contact. It does not spread.
Contact eczema: This is similar to allergic contact dermatitis, but it caused by an irritant. It does not spread once it has appeared on the skin.Dyshidrotic eczema: This type of dermatitis appears on the hands and the soles of the feet with moderate sized, clear blisters that are itchy and tend to burn.
Nummular eczema: This skin condition produces round, coin-shaped patches that are common on the arms, the back, the buttocks, and the lower legs.
Seborrheic eczema: This eczema type causes oily, yellowish, and scaly patches of skin to appear on the scalp, face, neck and chest.This type is common in infants.

, In most scenarios, you’ll want to visit a doctor to get a diagnosis and to learn about treatment plans. Some cases of eczema are so mild that you may simply overlook them. In other cases, eczema can be a major irritant and seriously painful to your infant. In these cases, visit your doctor immediately. Remember that eczema can lead to pain, infection and even scarring if left untreated.See a doctor right away if your baby has signs of infected skin (increased redness, swelling, drainage of pus, warmth of the skin, fever, or is very irritable). Also to see your doctor if the eczema isn’t getting better or is getting worse, or your baby is very uncomfortable or unable to sleep due to their eczema.Doctors prescribe anti-inflammatory medications, like topical steroids or topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs), to treat inflammation. Oral antihistamines may be recommended to help with itching and to help your baby sleep at night. Occasionally, oral anti-inflammatory agents are needed to treat the most severe cases.In most other cases, your doctor will prescribe soothing baths and moisturizers designed to combat eczema.

Know the signs.,
Use an over the counter topical treatment.,
Consider an oral antiviral.,
Soothe the pain.,
Use something cold to ease irritation.,
Consider natural remedies.",How to Stop a Cold Sore from Growing1," If you have experienced a cold sore before, you may be able to get a sense for when an outbreak is going to occur. You may experience itching, burning, or tingling around your lips about a day before the cold sore appears.If you believe you are about to get a cold sore, you can begin treatment right away and potentially shorten the duration of the outbreak. You can also make sure you don't accidentally spread the virus to anyone by refraining from contact.


Outbreaks commonly occur when you experience a great deal of stress, are overly tired and fatigued, or when you have a viral infection or fever (cold sores are also known as ""fever blisters"").;
, There are a number of antiviral creams that you can get over the counter without a prescription to tackle cold sores. These are designed to speed up the healing time for the sore, they will not actually get rid of the herpes simplex virus nor will they prevent you suffering from future outbreaks. They will generally only be effective if you apply them soon after the sores appear.


The antiviral creams to look out for include acyclovir, penciclovir, and docosanol.In a study penciclovir was reported to have the highest antiviral effectiveness.You will need to apply these creams for four or five days, and up to five times each day.When you apply the cream be sure to use a cotton swab or wear a disposable rubber glove so you don't contaminate your hands., For many of these creams, there are alternatives in pill form. You can take these orally if you prefer that to a topical cream. Oral medications may be more effective than topical creams.They will certainly not require to touch the sores in any way, which can help limit their spread. If you are uncertain, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice.

, As well as the antiviral treatments, you can consider taking some painkilling medicine to ease the pain and lessen the irritation the sores are causing you. If you find yourself battling to avoid itching or scratching the cold sores, try using a non-antiviral cream to lessen the irritation. These will not treat the cold sores or make them heal faster on their own. Ask for pharmacist for a recommendation.Regular painkillers such as ibuprofen and paracetamol can be taken to ease the pain of sores., Applying something cold to the area where you have a sore can also help to relieve the pain and irritation. Lightly hold an ice cube against a sore, or place a cool damp cloth on your face.A cool compress can reduce redness and encourage the sore to heal.Try placing a cool towel on the sores three times day, each time for twenty minutes., Although natural remedies are unreliable compared to medications, there are a number of things which have been reported as helping tackle cold sores. One of these is L lysine, an amino acid that you can buy as a supplement and as a cream. Modest application to the cold sore may help. Alternatively, propolis, sometimes called synthetic beeswax, is thought to shorten the duration of a cold sore outbreak if applied to the relevant area early and frequently.


A cream of rhubarb and sage has been cited as a homemade alternative to acyclovir cream.
Stress has been linked to cold sore outbreaks, so lowering your levels of stress could help."

Limit stress in your life.",How to Treat Eczema," Topical treatments, such as creams, are the first thing you should try when it comes to treating eczema. Corticosteroid creams can help reduce itching resulting from eczema. In a clinical study, 80% of respondents reported that their eczema or dermatitis responded well to hydrocortisone. Ask your doctor if you should use a corticosteroid cream or an ointment to treat eczema.Your doctor may prescribe a corticosteroid cream or you can try an over-the-counter product, such as a 1% hydrocortisone cream.
If using an over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream, use it two to three times per day for seven days. If you fail to see improvement or an abatement of itching in seven days, discontinue use and call your doctor.Ask your doctor if you need prescription steroids. They are much stronger and more effective than 1% hydrocortisone.
If you are not improving with prescription topical steroids, your doctor may recommend systemic corticosteroids
Although the dosage of steroids in over-the-counter products is small, use the product only as directed on the package or by your doctor. Overuse of corticosteroids can cause side effects including but not limited to thinning of the skin, redness, lightening of the skin and acne.;
, Because eczema causes itching, you are at risk of a bacterial skin infection if you scratch and damage the itchy skin. Your doctor may recommend you take antibiotics to treat the infection.Always take antibiotics as instructed by your doctor and complete the treatment regimen even if the infections seems to have subsided.

, These creams help control itching and reduce eczema flare ups; however, these prescription-only creams should only be used when other medications have failed due to side effects.Calcineurin inhibitors include tacrolimus (Protopic) and pimecrolimus (Elidel)

, Phototherapy uses natural sunlight or artificial ultraviolet (UV) radiation to suppress overactive immune system and reduce inflammation in the skin. As a result, it helps relieve rash and itching.The most common type of phototherapy used for eczema is called narrow band UVB and overall is a very safe and effective treatment.


Because long-term phototherapy has harmful effects (including skin aging and risk of cancer), consult your doctor before using light therapy.Phototherapy is not the same as visiting a tanning bed — it can only be administered in a doctor's office.
If your child has atopic dermatitis, narrowband UVB is considered safe. Talk to your doctor about this treatment.

, Bathing in a diluted-bleach water helps reduce bacterial infections on your skin. Try bleach baths two to three times a week for a few weeks to see if it helps relieve your symptoms.Add 1/2 cup of bleach (use household bleach and not concentrated bleach) to a bathtub filled water. Soak just the affected skin (not in the face) for 10 minutes. Rinse with warm water and moisturize.
Another option is to try an oatmeal bath. The ingredient in oats has anti-inflammatory and anti-itching properties that can be very soothing for your skin.

, Hold an ice pack over your eczema-prone areas to help relieve the itching. You can also use a clean, wet washcloth soaked in cold water.Cold compress also helps protect the skin and may prevent you from scratching the itchy skin.

, You may feel tempted to scratch the itchy skin, but try to avoid this as much as you can. Scratching can damage the skin and cause a bacterial infection.Keep your fingernails short to help keep your skin damage to a minimum.
You may also want to wear gloves during the night to prevent yourself from scratching while sleeping.
You may also want to wrap your skin to prevent yourself from scratching. Cover the eczema-prone areas of skin in bandages or gauze when you sleep.

, Eczema flare ups can be triggered by different things that are not the same for everyone. Thus, it is important you learn to recognize the factors (such as clothing materials, chemicals, or foods) that trigger your eczema.


Keep a diary and write down the products you use and foods you eat. When you experience a flare-up, it is easier to track the possible causes.
Try eliminating one product at a time to see which may trigger your eczema.

, Some materials may irritate your skin and worsen or trigger your eczema. Keep track of your symptoms and if you recognize a material that triggers your eczema, stop using it.Avoid scratchy materials, such as wool, and tight-fitting clothes that can irritate your skin and trigger an episode. Opt for light and breathable materials, such as cotton, silk and bamboo.
Be sure to wash new clothes before wearing them for the first time to soften the fabric and wash off any possible irritants.
However, some detergents may also trigger an episode by leaving a slight residue on your clothes. Before throwing away your favorite outfit, try using a natural washing powder or a different detergent and see if that makes a difference.

, Some cosmeceuticals and personal hygiene products contain ingredients that can trigger eczema. You may need to choose non-irritating lotions, creams, soaps and makeups that are hypoallergenic and/or without added perfumes.


Use the product for a few weeks to see if it triggers your eczema. If it does, switch the product.
Avoid products containing sodium lauryl sulfate and parabens. These are common irritants that can dry the skin and trigger a flare-up.

, Some foods or added ingredients in foods can also trigger your eczema, though this is very rare. Also, you may want to keep a food diary that will help you identify the foods that trigger your condition.


If you are unsure whether a food triggers your episode, eat it for a few days to see if you experience a flare-up. Then eliminate the product from your diet and see if your eczema clears up. Do the same for all foods that you believe may be triggering the conditions.Try eliminating milk and gluten, which are common dietary triggers for eczema., To keep your skin moist and prevent dryness, use a moisturizer at least twice a day. Creams and ointments help retain the skin’s natural moisture and reduce dryness and itching resulting from eczema.Use creams and ointments over lotions — lotions contain a lot of water, while creams and ointments have a higher oil content and are better at repairing the skin barrier and retaining moisture.
Apply moisturizers after bathing or showering to trap in moisture to your skin.

Reintroduce the items one-by-one into your diet and see if any trigger eczema flare-ups.;
, People suffering from eczema often have issues with dairy. Dairy products, specifically cow’s milk and cheeses, are composed of large protein molecules that are tough on digestion. They’re also highly acidic foods, and consuming too much acid can aggravate eczema. If you can’t live without milk, some people find raw goat’s milk to be a tasty and healthy substitute for pasteurized milks. Raw goat’s milk is full of healthy enzymes and bacteria that aid the intestinal tract. , High-glycemic grains cause insulin levels to spike quickly, and the sugar rush can lead to a hormonal imbalance. Common grains that are considered high-glycemic are corn chips, cake, pie, processed cereal, white rice and white flour. People suffering from a gluten allergy are three times more likely to have symptoms of eczema. If you already know you have celiac disease, be sure to avoid gluten, as this might trigger your eczema.

Though uncooked oatmeal works fine, colloidal oatmeal is a finely ground oatmeal made specifically for baths. , Emollients are creams, oils, lotions and gels that help prevent water loss in the skin. Though some emollients may leave the skin feeling a bit greasy, they are crucial in keeping the skin moisturized and flexible. Creams and ointments are generally the best types of emollients. Cream feels a bit lighter on the skin, while ointments are a bit heavier. Try using ointments at night if you don’t want your skin to look shiny during the day. "

Additionally, hot weather can lead to oily skin and acne, tempting you to use harsher cleansers. Sticking with gentler cleansers for sensitive skin may in fact improve your skin more so than using harsher soaps that cause further irritation and redness.
Cold weather and harsh winds can cause dryness and irritation. Dry skin can cause feelings of tightness and itchiness and lotions may provide some relief. Be sure to invest in natural fragrance-free lotions to prevent any adverse reactions, while still moisturizing your skin.

, Sensitive skin can be quite dry and can become irritated by harsh soaps. If the products contain a fragrance, this can further contribute towards irritation. If you've noticed that the fancy smelling soaps leave your skin feeling funny, your skin is probably too sensitive for them, and investing in some gentle, fragrance-free soaps and washes may prove useful.

, Sensitive skin usually does not react well to shaving or certain shaving products. Often it will turn blotchy, (large red marks), feel itchy or come up in a rash. This is a result of breaking the barrier your skin provides between the underlying layers of skin and the outside world.


Shaving can cause small breaks in your skin that allow chemicals to penetrate deeper, causing more problems to sensitive skin. If this happens then you should invest in a hair removal product that is designed for sensitive skin.

, Most people with sensitive skin have reactions to a wide variety of products that may extend beyond redness and dryness.


Some of these products will cause an immediate reaction, but some may only cause irritation after being exposed to sunlight.If your skin feels like it’s burning after only a few minutes in the sun, you may be reacting to your sunscreen and not actually getting sunburned that quickly.

Apply corticosteroids.,
Use synthetic vitamin D. This vitamin slows the growth of skin cells and is usually applied in topical form.,
Use methotrexate pills.,
Take ciclosporin.,
Apply retinoid creams.,
Take a biologic agent.,
Use light therapy.",How to Treat Psoriasis on Your Face1," Once you have been diagnosed, your doctor will present a treatment plan. This plan is likely to include a topical corticosteroid, which you will need to apply directly to the areas of psoriasis.Low-potency corticosteroids reduce redness and swelling.
Some side effects of corticosteroid use can include: rash, bruising, skin tearing, and enlarged blood vessels. Discontinue use and contact your doctor if you experience these problems.;
, However, this treatment can irritate the skin, so it should be used sparingly and with caution.In many cases, vitamin D will be combined in a cream with corticosteroids.

, In addition to topical medication, your doctor may prescribe an oral medication, especially if your psoriasis is severe. For instance, your doctor may prescribe methotrexate. This is an anti-inflammatory medication that is taken either in pill form or in an injection, although most patients take it weekly in tablet form.Discuss the medications your doctor wants to use, including possible side effects, and be sure that your doctor is an experienced dermatologist before agreeing to this type of treatment.Be sure that you are only using these medications for short periods of time. Otherwise, the side effects can be severe., This is a drug that suppresses the immune system and stops the inflammation associated with psoriasis. It is usually taken daily in pill form. In order to get the benefits from this medication, it may need to be taken for several months, up to several years.Your blood pressure and kidney function should be monitored while you are on this medication.

, Retinoids are derived from vitamin A and are used for a variety of skin conditions. They are applied directly to the skin in order to remove scales and ease inflammation. One common type of retinoid that is used for facial psoriasis is acitretin.This medication should not be taken if you are pregnant or breast feeding.

, These medications are made from natural materials, such as plants or microorganisms, and are sometimes known as biological response modifiers or targeted therapies. They interact with specific parts of the immune system, stopping it from attacking the skin and causing inflammation. Some common biologic agents that are prescribed for facial psoriasis include:Infliximab (Remicade)
Etanercept (Enbrel)
Adalimumab (Humira)
Ustekinumab (Stelara)
Secukinumb (Cosentxy)

, In addition to medication, your doctor may suggest that you undergo photo therapy, or ultraviolet light therapy, to treat your psoriasis. Psoriasis often responds well to brief daily exposure to light. Your doctor will instruct you about the light therapy that is needed, as exposure to too much light can make your psoriasis worse.Do not use light therapy if you have photo-sensitivity or sun damage on your face.

Take an oat bath.",How to Get Rid of a Rash Between Your Legs," Wear cotton and natural fibers throughout the day. Your underwear should be 100% cotton. When you exercise, wear a synthetic material (like nylon or polyester) that wicks away moisture and dries quickly.Your clothing should always feel comfortable.


Try not to wear materials that are coarse, scratchy, or trap moisture (like wool or leather).;
, The clothing around your legs should be loose enough to let your skin stay dry and breathe. Your clothing shouldn't feel tight or like it's pinching your skin. Clothing that is too tight will rub against your skin, causing chafing. Most rashes between the legs are caused by chafing.


Chafing normally happens along the inner thighs, groin, underarms, under the belly, and at the nipples.
If chafing isn't treated, it can become inflamed and infected., Always keep moisture off of your skin, especially after you've taken a bath or shower. Take a clean cotton towel and gently dab at your skin. Rubbing could irritate the rash. You could also use a hair dryer on the lowest setting to completely dry the rash area. Avoid using high heat which can aggravate the rash.It's important to keep the area dry and free of sweat. This is because sweat is high in minerals that can make your skin rash even worse.

, Most rashes caused by chafing can be treated at home without medical intervention. But, if your rash doesn't improve within 4 to 5 days or gets worse, call your doctor for an appointment. This is especially important if you suspect your rash is infected (if you have fever, pain, swelling, or pus around the rash).Removing friction from the rash, keeping it clean, and lubricating the area should give you some relief within a day or two. If you're not starting to feel better by this time, talk with your doctor.

, Your doctor will do a physical examination to see if your rash shows lesions. If your doctor thinks you have a bacterial infection, your doctor will probably order a culture. This test will tell your doctor what strain of bacteria or fungus is causing your infection and what treatment is needed. Your doctor may prescribe one or more of the following:Topical antifungals (if caused by yeast)
Oral antifungals (if the topical antifungals don't treat the rash)
Oral antibiotics (if caused by bacteria)
Topical antibiotics (if caused by bacteria)

, Since the area will be sensitive and could be sweaty, it's important to wash the area with a mild, unscented soap. Wash and rinse using warm or cool water, making sure to completely rinse off the soap. Extra residual soap could irritate your skin even more.Consider using a plant-based oil soap. Look for a soap made from a vegetable oil (like olive, palm, or soy), vegetable glycerin, or plant butters (like coconut or shea).
Be sure to bathe immediately after sweating a lot. This prevents moisture from becoming trapped in the rash area.

, Once your skin is clean and dried, you can lightly apply a powder to prevent moisture from accumulating between your skin. Choose an unscented baby powder, but check to see if it contains talcum powder (which you should only use in small amounts). If the baby powder you use contains talcum powder, use it sparingly. Some studies have linked talc to an increased risk of ovarian cancer in women.Avoid applying cornstarch since bacteria and fungi can actually feed off of it, causing skin infection., Keep your legs moisturized so they don't chafe against each other. Use a natural lubricant like almond oil, castor oil, lanolin, or calendula oil. Make sure your skin is clean and dry before you apply the lubricant. Consider placing clean gauze over the rash to protect the skin.Apply lubricant at least twice a day or more often if you notice the rash is still rubbing on your clothing or skin.

, While lubricating your skin is important, you can also apply herbal essential oils that have healing properties. You can also add medicinal honey for its antibacterial and antifungal properties.To use the herbs, add 1 to 2 drops of any of the following oils to 4 tablespoons of your lubricant:


Calendula oil: the oil from this flower can heal skin wounds and acts as an anti-inflammatory.St John’s wort: is usually used to treat depression and anxiety, but it is traditionally used to heal skin irritation.Children or women who are pregnant or nursing shouldn't use St John's wort.Arnica oil: More studies are needed to understand the healing properties of this herbal oil that's made from flowerheads.Children or women who are pregnant or nursing shouldn't use arnica oil.Yarrow oil: this essential oil from the yarrow plant has anti-inflammatory properties and supports healing.Neem oil: has anti-inflammatory and wound healing properties. It's also been used with success in children with burns., Since your skin is already sensitive, you should determine if the herbal oil mixture will cause an allergic reaction. Dip a cotton ball in your mixture and dab a small amount on the inside of your elbow.Place a bandage over it and wait 10 to 15 minutes. If you don't notice a reaction (like a rash, stinging, or itching), you can safely use the mixture throughout the day. Try to apply it at least 3 or 4 times to ensure that the rash is always being treated.


These herbal mixtures should not be used in children under 5 years old.

, Pour 1 to 2 cups of rolled, steel cut oats into a nylon knee-high stocking. Knot the stocking so that no oats can spill out and tie it to the bathtub's tap. Run lukewarm water so that the water runs through the oats as it fills the tub. Soak for 15 to 20 minutes and pat your skin dry. Do this once a day.A soothing bath is especially helpful if the area of chafing is large.

Recognize the symptoms of DLE.,
Be aware that other medical conditions that can look like Discoid Lupus.,
See your doctor right away to get a diagnosis.",How to Diagnose Discoid Lupus1," People with DLE will sometimes report a mild itching or occasional pain in because of DLE, but many patients have no itching, pain or other sensation associated with their lesions.Symptoms of DLE often occur in areas of the body that are exposed to the sun, but 50% are found in areas of the scalp. The face and neck are other common sites. Physical symptoms of discoid lupus include:red, scaly, discrete, erythematous, slightly infiltrated raised lesions, or plaques, above and/or below the neck, often coin-shaped and with thickened skin or scalesplugged hair follicles that may result in hair losschanges in skin color, often losing pigment (lighter) in the center and hyperpigmentation (darker) on the outsidelesions may slowly expand, atrophy, scar and present with telangiectasia, a dilation of the capillaries beneath the skin. This causes the lesions to look spidery.photosensitivity is also commonly experienced.;
, During the process of diagnosis the physician will rule out other medical conditions that often look like DLE. These conditions include but are not limited to skin lesions associated with:Syphilis
Actinic Keratosis
Complications of Sarcoidosis
Lichen Planus
Plaque Psoriasis

, If you have suspect that you might have DLE, make an appointment with your doctor or an immunologist right away. In most cases the diagnosis of discoid lupus erythematosus is based on clinical findings, or what the physician sees during the physical examination. In some cases a histopathology report may be helpful in ruling out other skin conditions.


DLE can also occur as part of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). In fact, it affects 25 percent of people with SLE, and approximately 10-15 percent of patient with DLE will develop SLE. The more widespread the DLE the more likely SLE symptoms are to co-exist. Your doctor may also screen you for SLE during your exam by ordering blood and urine samples to be analyzed in a lab.Patients with DLE have negative or low ANA titers and rarely have Anti-Ro Antibodies.

Notice what causes symptoms.,
Determine the onset of symptoms.,
Determine if you have a break in your skin.,
Notice the site of reaction.,
Consult a dermatologist.",How to Know if You Have Sensitive Skin2," Irritant contact dermatitis is an inflammatory reaction that occurs in response to various physical and chemical stimuli.Allergic dermatitis is an immune-mediated reaction to foreign objects. Although the symptoms of each kind of reaction can be similar, understanding what kind of reaction you have will help you to deal with your sensitive skin.Irritant contact dermatitis is often caused by exposure to the following irritants:water (prolonged exposure, like dishwashing)detergents, like soap
solvents, such as acetone (found in nail polish remover)
oxidizing agents, like bleach
acids
alkalis, like ammonia or sodium hydroxide
metal tools
wood
fiberglass
plant parts, like thorns and spines
paper
dust or soil


Allergic contact dermatitis is often caused by exposure to the following allergens:perfumes
latex
plant products, including leaves (example: poison ivy)
glues and cements
plastics
nickel
hair dyes
soaps and detergents
cosmetics



, Understanding how long it takes for a reaction to develop will help you to distinguish between irritant and contact dermatitis. Some reactions can take minutes to hours to develop, while other symptoms may appear days after exposure.


Irritant contact dermatitis causes symptoms within minutes to hours of contact with the inciting agent.Allergic dermatitis is a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction that is T cell mediated. This means that the onset of symptoms is often later compared to irritant contact dermatitis. Symptoms typically appear several hours after exposure to an allergen., A break in your skin could include a cut, burn, or removal of a layer of skin, for example by ripping off an adhesive bandage.


Irritant contact dermatitis often involves disruption in the endothelial layer that protects your body from the outside world.Allergic contact dermatitis does not require a break in the skin to elicit a response; however, a break may still be present.

, Although some areas of skin may be more or less sensitive than others, some symptoms of sensitive skin can be directly localized to the area of contact, while others can spread.


Irritant contact dermatitis is most often localized predominantly to the site of contact or injury. For example, if you have a reaction to adhesive in a band-aid, you may might see a band-aid-shaped rash if you have irritant contact dermatitis.
Because allergic dermatitis involves influx of immune cells, the localization of the reaction can extend beyond the borders of the initial injury. This is not always the case, but transfer of the allergen to adjacent sites can cause patchiness. For example, in the case of a reaction to a band-aid, you may notice that a rash spreads past the borders of the band-aid site. This could indicate an allergic reaction.

, A dermatologist is a medical professional who specializes in skin conditions. There are many medical conditions that affect the skin and a dermatologist can help you rule out any serious problems.The following is a list of other possible causes of what appears to be sensitive skin:


Bedbugs
Basal cell carcinoma
Chemical peel
Acne
Atopic dermatitis
Dry skin
Psoriasis
Eczema
Scabies
Infection

Identify products that adversely affect your skin.,
Do a patch test with new products.,
Avoid products that cause irritation.,
Try topical remedies.",How to Know if You Have Sensitive Skin3," If you are currently using multiple skincare products and are experiencing problems, stop using all of them. Avoiding applying anything to your skin should help clear up any problems associated with application of these products within a few days.


Try reintroducing each product, including creams, lotions, and makeup, one at a time. Give it a couple days before adding in a new product.
Look for changes in your skin each time you re-introduce a new product (mentioned above).

, Whenever you want to try out a new cream, lotion, or makeup product, do a patch test first. Patch testing involves applying a small amount of the new product to a small patch of skin.


Try patch testing on the inside of your wrist or forearm. Some areas of skin are more sensitive than others. For example, the underside of your forearm is more sensitive than the topside of your arm.
Apply a small amount of product to your skin and don’t wash it off. Leave creams, lotions, and makeup on for 24 to 48 hours. When testing cleansers or soaps, wash thoroughly, rinse, and then pat dry as you would with typical use.
Look for signs of irritation, such as redness, itching, or rash. These signs would indicate that your skin is too sensitive for these products.

, Recognize common ingredients in products that cause adverse reactions with your skin. Some chemical compounds are more likely to cause problems (see above) and you may notice that several products that cause problems contain these same ingredients.


For example, you may notice that your skin reacts to a variety of scented products, like lotions or perfumes. If this is the case, you may be sensitive to this particular scent or scented products in general. As a rule of thumb, people with sensitive skin should avoid using any scented products as they contain more ingredients that have the potential to cause reactions.

, Lotions with or without corticosteroids, such as hydrocortisone cream, can help reduce symptoms associated with sensitive skin. These can be particularly helpful to reduce itching and pain and may reduce redness associated with allergic contact dermatitis.


Some studies have shown benefit of using topical corticosteroids with irritant contact dermatitis, but these studies are controversial. No randomized trials of corticosteroid use with irritant contact dermatitis exist, but a few small observational studies show no effect or slight improvements.It is possible to have both irritant and allergic contact dermatitis simultaneously. Therefore, using corticosteroids, which do improve the symptoms of allergic contact dermatitis may be useful.Lotions help to keep the skin moisturized and reduce water loss. Studies have shown reductions in scaling, dryness, redness, and itchiness with daily moisturizer use. "

Use moisturizer.,
Apply aloe vera.,
Take fish oil supplements.,
Apply Oregon grape cream.",How to Treat Psoriasis on Your Face2," It can help facial psoriasis quite a bit to keep the affected areas moisturized. Keeping the affected areas moisturized will make your skin feel better and keep scaling under control.Using the right type of moisturizer is important. Use a medicated moisturizers made to treat psoriasis or over-the-counter moisturizers that do not have chemicals, fragrances, and dyes that could irritate your skin.If you wish to wash your face, use a gentle non-soap cleanser. This will help to avoid further irritation., Aloe vera is a plant that is known to reduce redness, scaling, itching, and inflammation. It can be used several times a day on psoriasis and can be used indefinitely without side effects.You can even grow an aloe vera plant yourself and use the gel that is located on the inside of the leaves directly on your skin.

, Fish oil contains Omega-3 fatty acids, which are great for the skin. They may reduce the inflammation that is associated with psoriasis, however results from studies are mixed.Take 3 grams or less of fish oil daily. This is generally recognized as safe and beneficial.

, Oregon grape is also known as barberry and Mahonia aquifolium. In topical applications, Oregon grape has been proven to reduce inflammation and ease the symptoms of psoriasis.A 10% Oregon grape extract cream has been used successfully in research for psoriasis treatments."

Consider your risk for drug induced lupus erythematosus.,
Know your family history.,
Keep in mind that lupus is more common among certain demographics.",How to Diagnose Discoid Lupus2," Drug induced lupus erythematous can be triggered by certain drugs that cause lupus like symptoms in people who do not have SLE. This form of the condition is temporary and will usually resolve within several days or weeks of discontinuing the medication. Talk to your doctor right away if you suspect that your medication may be causing your lupus symptoms. Although many drugs may cause lupus erythematous, the three drugs that most commonly cause this condition are:Hydralazine
Procainamide
Isoniazid

, Many people with lupus report that they also have a family member with lupus or another of the autoimmune disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis.If possible, learn about your family history before you visit your doctor. Information about the health histories of you family members may help your doctor to make a diagnosis.

, In addition to other risk factors you might consider, gender and race also play a role in who gets lupus. Lupus seems to be much more common in women than in men. It is also more common among African Americans and people between the ages of 20 and 40.Your doctor may consider these factors when attempting to diagnose your condition.

Stay out of the sun.,
Talk to your doctor about topical corticosteroid creams.,
Ask your doctor about oral medications.",How to Diagnose Discoid Lupus3," DLE symptoms may be made worse by exposure to the sun or other UV light exposure, so avoid spending time outside when the sun is out. Limit your sun exposure to time of the day when sunlight is not as intense, such as in the early morning or early evening.Use sunblock and clothing to shield from ultraviolet light.
Do not use tanning beds and don’t sit next to the window at work.
Be careful around water, snow and sand surfaces that reflect ultraviolet rays.

, Topical corticosteroid creams are often used to treat DLE. Your physician will most likely start you with a high dose that you need to apply twice daily and then switch you to a lower maintenance dose. The change in dosage is thought to help prevent negative side effects of the drug, such as atrophy and red marks on the skin.Steroid injections may be useful to treat lesions which have become chronic and developed thick skin or which have not responded to topical steroids. Ask your doctor about this form of treatment as well., Antimalarial drugs are often prescribed as part of treatment for DLE. These medications are used either alone or in combination and include chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine and mepacrine.Other drugs that might also be considered, when antimalarial drugs, topical corticosteroids and intralesional steroids are not effective, are methotrexate, cyclosporin A, tacrolimus and azathrioprine.
The medication doses are determined on the lean body weight of the individual to reduce the potential for toxicity from the drugs.

Rub the inside of a banana peel on an itchy surface.,
Use an ice cube or a cool, wet compress.,
Find a distraction.,
Pull a very soft cloth gently over the site.",How to Stop Scratching Irritated Skin1," Short fingernails make it more difficult to scratch. If you prefer to your nails long, wear gloves to avoid scratching, especially at night.;
, The gate control theory of pain suggests that applying pressure and stimulation to another area can distract you from the itch and actually alleviate some of the pain.Snap a rubber band on your wrist when you feel the urge to scratch. Some people press an X into their skin near an itchy spot such as a mosquito bite. These are both examples of the gate control theory of pain at work to stop you from scratching.

, Compounds in the peel are known to decrease the itch., A melting ice cube on an itchy patch of skin can provide cooling relief. A cold, damp washcloth can also sooth the site.Take a clean washcloth and wet it in cold water. Wring out most of the water, leaving the cloth damp but not dripping. Gently apply the cloth to your itchy spot and allow it to rest there as it provides some relief.
Applying a slice of cucumber or a cotton ball soaked in apple cider vinegar also has the same cooling effect.

, Getting your mind off the itch is sometimes all you need. Mothers of children with eczema well know the benefit of having toys, video games, TV, physical activity, and even tickling as a way to keep their kids from scratching.Squeeze a stress ball instead. If you like working with your fingers, try knitting or crocheting when you feel the urge to scratch. Keeping your hands busy is a good way to prevent scratching.

, Use a soft clean cloth to gently caress the itchy skin without irritating the site.You can also cover the area with a nonstick bandage instead of a soft cloth.

Avoid high-intensity exercises.,
Talk to your dermatologist.,
Break up your routine.,
Slow down.",How to Exercise with Rosacea1," High-intensity exercise can be a great way to stay fit, but it can also trigger your rosacea. Luckily, a lot of exercises that keep you fit are lower intensity, such as swimming, walking, yoga, and low-impact cardio routines. The goal is to avoid over-exerting yourself and fatiguing your muscles.Avoid anaerobic activities, such as weight-lifting, that fatigue your muscles.
Swimming can be a good aerobic exercise option, and the water in swimming pools may be good for your skin.
Walking typically is a good exercise as well, just make sure you're keeping your walking to a low or moderate intensity. You shouldn't get out of breath and you should be able to carry on a conversation while walking.;
, Your dermatologist may be able to give you some tips on exercises to try, or products to use that can help you avoid rosacea flare-ups while exercising. Your doctor also may be able to write you a prescription.Make sure you tell your doctor exactly what activities you've attempted that have caused flare-ups and aggravated your condition. You also want to detail the conditions under which you were working out at the time.
Your doctor also may have suggestions about other things you can do to lessen the risk of flare-ups when you exercise with rosacea, or other therapies you could try.

, Even at a low or moderate intensity, working out for a long period of time can cause you to get too over-heated, which could result in flare-ups. You can prevent this by working out for short bursts of time periodically throughout the day.For example, if you normally walk for an hour, but it causes flare ups, you might go on four 15-minute walks over the course of the day.
Keeping the length of time you exercise to between 10 and 20 minutes typically presents the least risk that exercise will aggravate your symptoms.

, When your heart rate increases and you perspire more heavily, you increase the possibility of a rosacea flare-up. Figure out what you can do before you get to that point, and then don't go beyond that.This is going to differ from person to person, so you'll have to experiment a little before you can find the level that works for you. For example, if jogging aggravates your symptoms, maybe you should try walking instead. If walking still causes flare-ups, walk more slowly.
You may still be able to do exercises of the type typically done during interval training, such as push-ups or lunges, but instead of doing them quickly in short intervals, do them more slowly and deliberately for longer intervals (think two-minute intervals instead of 30-second or one-minute intervals).

Monitor the wound for signs of infection.,
Keep your skin healthy.",How to Treat Cellulitis," Cellulitis is a skin infection that usually occurs on the lower legs or shins. It is caused by the spread of a bacterial infection, usually streptococcus or staphylococcus. There are several risk factors that make it more likely for these bacteria to find an entry point into your skin.An injury in the the affected area. A cut, burn, or scrape breaks the skin and provides a way in for bacteria.
A skin condition like eczema, chicken pox, shingles, or patches of very dry skin. Since the outer layer of skin isn't intact, bacteria are more likely to enter the skin.
A compromised immune system. If you have HIV/AIDS, diabetes, kidney disease, or another condition that affects your immune system, you're more susceptible to getting a skin infection.
Lymphedema, a chronic swelling of the legs or arms. It can cause the skin to crack, leading to infection.
Obesity has been connected to an elevated risk of getting cellulitis.
If you have had cellulitis in the past, you are prone to develop it again.;
, Cellulitis is most often noticeable as a red, itchy rash that begins to spread in an area where your skin is damaged. If you notice a rash spreading near a cut, burn or area where the skin has been broken, especially if it's located on your lower legs, it may be cellulitis. Look for the following symptoms:


A red, itchy, warm rash that continues to spread and swell. The skin may look tight and stretched.
Pain, tenderness or soreness near the site of the infection.
Chills, fatigue and fever as the infection advances.

, If you notice symptoms of cellulitis, even if the rash hasn't spread very far, it's important to see a doctor right away. That's because if it's allowed to progress, cellulitis can lead to serious complications. Cellulitis may also be an indication that a deeper, more dangerous infection is spreading.When you visit the doctor, explain your symptoms and any signs of cellulitis that you've noticed.
In addition to conducting a physical examination, your physician may perform additional tests such as a complete blood count (CBC) or blood culture.

, MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) is becoming more common and it is contagious.Do not share any personal items, such as razors, towels, or clothing. Also, make sure that anyone who cares for your cellulitis wears gloves before touching you cellulitis and before touching anything that might be contaminated., Wash with regular body soap and water, and rinse. You can then wrap a cool, damp cloth around the cellulitis to make it more comfortable. You should still make a doctor's appointment, but washing will help keep the infection from spreading., Until your skin scabs over, you need to protect the open wound. Apply a bandage, and change it once daily. This will help keep you protected while your body is building up natural defenses.

, You don't want to spread additional bacteria to your vulnerable wound. You also don't want to risk transmitting bacteria to another open wound on your body. Make sure to wash your hands before and after you are treating your wound.

, If your wound is painful or swollen, simple acetaminophen or ibuprofen will reduce swelling and discomfort. Take only the recommended dose. Abandon this regimen when and if your doctor recommends a prescription.

, This is the most common treatment for cellulitis. Treatment depends on the severity of the infection and your health, but it usually includes a prescription for oral antibiotics that will kill the infection.Cellulitis should begin to retreat within a few days, and disappear altogether within seven to ten days.


Your doctor may advise you to take 500mg of cephalexin by mouth every six hours. If MRSA is suspected, then your doctor may prescribe Bactrim, Clindamycin, Doxycycline, or Minocycline. Bactrim is most often prescribed for MRSA.
Your physician will ask you to follow up within two to three days to report on the progress of the cellulitis. If it seems to be retreating, you'll need to take the full course of antibiotics (usually for 14 days) to ensure the infection is completely gone. Do not stop taking the antibiotics or skip doses because this can make it harder to treat the infection.
Your physician will prescribe oral antibiotics if you are healthy and your infection is limited to the skin, but if the infection seems to be deeper and you're experiencing other symptoms, oral antibiotics won't be fast-acting enough.

, In extreme cases, when the cellulitis has advanced deeper into the body, it may be necessary to receive treatment overnight in the hospital. Antibiotics will be administered intravenously or by injection to clear up the infection more quickly than if oral antibiotics were used., Cellulitis occurs most often when an open wound isn't properly dressed, leaving the skin open to bacterial infection. The best way to prevent this from happening is to take immediate measures to clean your wounds the second you get a scrape, cut or burn.


Wash the wound with soap and water. Continue washing it daily until it heals.If the wound is large or deep, bandage it with sterile gauze. Change the bandage daily until the wound has healed.

, Poor circulation may slow down your healing time, but elevating the area where you have cellulitis may help. For example, if you have cellulitis on your legs, then elevating them may help to improve blood flow and promote healing.Try placing your legs up on a couple of pillows while you are in bed.

, Check the wound every day when you remove the bandage to make sure it's healing properly. If it begins to swell, turn red or become itchy, you may need to seek medical treatment. If the wound seems to be draining, that's another sign that it might be infected, so make an appointment with your physician right away.

, Since cellulitis commonly affects people with skin disorders, taking good care of your skin is an important preventative measure. If your skin is sensitive or dry, or you have diabetes, eczema or another disorder that affects the skin, use the following techniques to keep your skin intact and prevent cellulitis from taking hold.


Moisturize your skin to keep it from flaking, and drink plenty of fluids to hydrate your body.Protect your feet by wearing socks and sturdy shoes.
Trim your toenails carefully so as not to accidentally cut your skin.
Treat athlete's foot promptly, so it doesn't turn into a more severe infection.Treat lymphedema to prevent your skin from cracking.
Avoid activities that lead to cuts and nicks on your legs and feet (hiking through brushy areas, gardening, and so on).

, There are conflicting views on just how much water, but try drink at least more than 6+ glasses a day. Water help to flush out toxins from your body and improve kidney function.


Some people find that they drink more if they use a straw or drink flavored water. Experiment with different things to find what works best.

, Take the steps, rather than the lift. Try to walk up at least 2-3 flights of steps or park a bit further away from your destination and take a brisk walk. Take a 10-minute walk each day with a friend or loved one and catch up with each other. Go to the gym.

, Every half hour or so, take a minute to stand up, pace, look out the window, or refill your water bottle. Not only will this improve your circulation, but it can prevent other problems such as blood clots.


This is important for thin people as well as heavier people. Don't let your weight fool you into thinking that your body is immortal.
If you have a mobility disability that makes this tricky, try shaking your limbs out a little, working your arms, and fidgeting. Do what is comfortable and reasonable to you.

, Use it every morning. Get into the shower, rub it onto the affected areas in a circular movement, and then have your shower. Make this process a part of your daily hygiene routine. It will take less than 3 minutes.


A good time to do this is while you wait for your hair conditioner to soak in.

, Get rid of anything uncomfortable with tight seams. Try wearing panties in a size up if you're concerned.

, Quitting smoking will give you more energy, cause you to smell better, aid circulation and breathing, and improve your health in many ways. Try using gum, nicotine patches, fidget toys, breathing exercises, and other helpful methods of relaxation as a substitute.

, Cut down on refined and processed foods, dairy, high fat products, or high sugar products. Eat food high in fibre. Eat less carbs and drink more water. Cut down on alcohol intake. You need not starve or deprive yourself from anything, just tweak your diet slightly and start making it a life-style. One of the biggest mistakes people make is to not eat at regular intervals during the day, so try to eat 5 to 6 times a day, even if it is just a banana or granola bar. It will also help to stabilise your blood sugar, which will reduce cravings.


Visualize filling at least 1/3 of your plate with fruits and vegetables. Pick your favorites so that you enjoy eating them.
Try incorporating fruits into desserts: strawberries with whipped cream and chocolate syrup, banana with chocolate, apple slices with caramel, blueberries on ice cream, et cetera. Find what you like.
Don't cut out fat and sugar altogether, because this is also bad for your body. Eat dessert. If your body is craving fat or salt, that means it needs it, and you should listen to it. Your body should not be a battleground.
If you are restricting food groups or calories too much, see a doctor. You may be in the early stages of an eating disorder. Catching it sooner will help prevent complications and death.

, You are not a plastic doll or an airbrushed model. Everyone's skin has its own character marks and quirks, and this just happens to be one of yours. Try not to stress too much about your body, and remember that no one is paying as much attention to it as you are. It is okay to have a little (or a lot of!) cellulite.

Check the weather forecast.,
Work out in well-ventilated indoor spaces.,
Cool yourself off.,
Move your workout to the pool.",How to Exercise with Rosacea2," Before exercising outside, even if you're just going for a brisk walk, you need to know what to expect. To avoid flare-ups, you'll want to move your exercise indoors on the hottest days.If you're exercising outside on a sunny day, make sure you always wear sunscreen, even if it's overcast. Getting a sunburn will aggravate your rosacea, so always keep your skin protected.
On warmer days, it's generally best to do any exercising outdoors either at dawn or at dusk, when the sun is lower on the horizon and not as hot.

, Air flow can help prevent rosacea flare-ups while you're exercising. If you're exercising indoors, choose open environments, or work out in front of a fan or an open window.You also want to make sure the room in which you are exercising is relatively cool. Turn the air conditioner down a few degrees to make the room cooler before you start exercising, or use a stationary fan.

, Keeping your skin cool can help prevent flare-ups even as your heart rate increases and your core temperature rises during exercise of moderate intensity. One way to do this is to make sure you're not exercising in direct sunlight.Draping a cool, damp towel around the back of your neck can help, as can keeping ice water in a spray bottle to spritz your face.
Munching on ice chips can help cool you down as well, but don't chew on ice while you're moving and be careful not to choke.
Keep an ice-cold water bottle with you at all times so you can sip on water as you exercise both to cool yourself off and to keep you hydrated.

, If there's a fitness club near you that has a pool, you might consider signing up for a water aerobics class. These low-impact classes will give you a good workout without getting you too overheated. You’ll be able to get your exercise while staying cool and comfortable.The resistance of the workout gives you a better workout than if you were doing the same movements on land, but at the same time the water also has a cooling effect on your skin.
The pH balance of the water in the pool also may have a positive impact on your skin.
Stay out of saunas or hot tubs as these will cause a flare-up of your condition.

"
"
Exercise regularly.,
Drink plenty of water.,
Avoid foods that cause inflammation.,
Avoid stimulants and diuretics.,
Identify other triggers in your diet.,
Moisturize your skin adequately.,
Talk to your dermatologist about medications and treatments.",How to Exercise with Rosacea3," If you engage in low to moderate intensity activity every day, your body will get used to that level of stress or physical exertion over time, making it less likely that the activity will aggravate your rosacea.You may have to deal with mild flare-ups initially, but maintaining a consistent level of physical activity will put less stress on your body ultimately.
In contrast, if you only exercise two or three times a week, there's a much greater chance that your symptoms will flare up, even if you're only engaging in low- to moderate-intensity activity.

, If you have rosacea, hydration is one of the most important things you can do to help prevent and control flare-ups. Hydration also is important if you're exercising, regardless of the intensity.Try to drink at least 2.2 liters of water a day if you’re a woman or 3 liters of water a day if you’re a man to stay well hydrated. You can use the urine test to determine if you're drinking enough water. If your urine is clear, that is a sign that you're well hydrated.
When you exercise, you lose water in the form of sweat. Weigh yourself before and after exercise to determine how much water weight you're losing. Drink a large glass of water (between 16 and 20 ounces) for each pound of fluid you lose during exercise.

, Foods that are common in the typical Western diet, such as pizza, salad dressings, and processed meats like sausage, contain inflammation-causing omega-6 fatty acids that increase the odds of a flare-up.Try to stay away from foods that are known to cause rosacea, such as dry fermented foods, spicy foods, vinegar, alcohol, fruits and vegetables, dairy, soy, liver, chocolate, cheese, and food high in histamines.
Replace these foods with foods that have more omega-3 fatty acids, such as grass-fed organic meat and dairy and wild fish.
Fish oil and flax oil reduce inflammation, but vegetable oils such as corn or sunflower oil promote inflammation. This means you should avoid fried foods that are cooked in these oils.

, Any stimulants or diuretics, such as caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol, can wreak havoc on your skin and cause flare-ups. Additionally, they can cause vascular dilation and inflammation of your skin.Diuretics cause dehydration, which can cause your skin to break out or rosacea symptoms to flare up, even if you are drinking plenty of water. Caffeine and alcohol have a diuretic effect.

, Rosacea is more than just a problem with your skin. Any allergies or sensitivities to certain types of food may cause inflammation that puts you at greater risk for flare-ups when you exercise.Some common triggers include yeast, alcohol and caffeine, dairy, sugar, processed foods, and trans fats.
Hot drinks such as cocoa, coffee, tea, and cider can trigger a flare-up.
Don't eliminate everything from your diet at once. Rather, start a food diary and eliminate one thing at a time so you can accurately gauge your body's reaction. If eliminating one type of food doesn't change anything and it's a food that you enjoy, you can introduce it back into your diet.

, Properly moisturizing your skin, especially when you have flare-ups, helps rebuild your skin's natural defenses and will make your skin less sensitive and uncomfortable for you.Stay away from chemical-based moisturizers and face washes, including moisturizers and face washes that contain alcohol. Choose products that are formulated for sensitive skin or prescribed medicated products.
Ask your dermatologist for their recommendations. They should be able to suggest good over-the-counter products that you can use without aggravating your rosacea.

, Your dermatologist may know of a prescription cream or lotion, as well as other medical treatments that could improve your skin and reduce your likelihood of flare-ups.If you're reluctant to try natural remedies, or if you've tried them and found they were relatively ineffective, you might want to try a prescription product to get some relief.
Tell your doctor exactly what you've tried or done in the past, as well as what specific activities triggered the flare-ups. This will help them identify the best possibilities for you to try.
It’s important that you work with your dermatologist to prevent flare-ups because the condition can worsen if it’s not properly treated.

Expose your skin slowly.,
Apply sunscreen.,
Go out into the sun at non-peak times.,
Wear protective gear.",How to Treat Sun Rash3," The easiest and simplest way to prevent a sun rash is to expose your skin to the sun slowly. The most common areas are the legs, arms, and chest, so take your time in the spring wearing these uncovered.Try exposing one area at a time instead of them all at once. Also try to limit the amount of time you spend in the sun at first to about 10 minutes.


For example, wear a short sleeve shirt with a high collar and long pants to begin with. You can also try shorts with a long sleeve shirt and a high neck. As long as only one new area is uncovered, you can help prevent sun rash., When you are in the sun, put sunscreen on the areas that are exposed to the sun. Make sure you look for a high SPF that protects against UVA and UVB rays, since both can cause sun rash.


Reapply the sunscreen about once every two hours., There are certain times of the day that are considered peak hours for sun exposure and strength. If you are prone to sun rash or want to avoid getting one, try to avoid being in the sun between the hours of 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. The sun is strongest during these times and you run a higher risk exposure., If you know you are prone to sun rash, you can protect yourself by wearing clothing or items that cover your skin completely. If you are going outside, even it is not hot, wear a light jacket or long sleeve shirt to cover your arms. Wear high-necked shirts to protect your chest and long pants to protect your legs.


Your face is also at risk, so wear a wide brimmed hat or headscarf to protect your skin."

Learn about Polymorphic Light Eruption (PMLE).,
Be aware of why sun rash develops.,
Recognize the symptoms of sun rash.,
Learn the causes of sun rash.,
See your doctor.",How to Treat Sun Rash4," PMLE is an itchy, red skin rash that develops when your skin is exposed to the sun. The term polymorphic indicates that the rash will look different when it develops on different people. This condition is most common in the spring, which is when your skin is exposed to stronger sunlight for the first time after winter.


Sun rash is more common in women than in men and it most often occurs in children and adults between 20 and 40 who live in Northern Europe or North America. This is due to the temperate climate in these areas., Sun rash is considered an allergic reaction, but not in the traditional sense. It generally develops because your immune system reacts to exposure to the combination of UV radiation and visible light. , The main symptom of sun rash is an itchy red rash that develops on the skin with small raised bumps or blisters. This can happen within 20 minutes of sun exposure, but it can also take a few hours. The rash will typically appear on your arms, your chest, or your legs. This is because these areas are generally covered more during the winter months and become desensitized to the sun.


Even if you treat the first instance of the rash, it may recur if you go back out into the sun. These recurrences are typically less severe than the first. , In addition to direct exposure to the sun, you can get a sun rash from exposure to the sun through a window or by exposure to fluorescent lighting. Another form of sun rash can occur as a reaction to chemicals or medications. These two conditions are called photoallergic dermatitis and drug-induced photosensitivity.Certain chemicals in soaps, perfumes, skin lotions, detergents, and makeup can react to sun exposure and cause a sun rash. This can easily be remedied if you stop using the product that causes the reaction.
There are many medications that may cause sun rash, including water pills, anti-convulsants, quinine, tetracycline antibiotics, NSAID painkillers such as Ibuprofen and Naproxen, and some anti-diabetes drugs.Contact your doctor if you suffer from sun rash because of medications you take.

, If you try home treatments and the rash doesn't go away within 24 hours, call your doctor. You may have a different kind of rash or there may be a larger, more complicated reason for your sun rash. If your sun rash gets worse after any home treatment, you should also see your doctor.


Your doctor will examine you and ask for your recent medical history. If the cause is in doubt, your doctor may take a small sample of your skin affected by the rash.
If it is just a skin rash, your doctor may recommend hydrocortisone cream, but he will likely suggest preventative methods with no medical treatment. "

Apply oatmeal.",How to Treat Skin Rash," Rashes can start for a variety of reasons, but most of them are easily treatable. The treatment of a particular rash will depend on the cause. First look at the way the rash is distributed.Where is it? When does it show up?


If the rash is at different points on your body, or has spread everywhere, it's more likely to be an allergy to something you've eaten, either a medication or food.
If a rash is only under your clothes, it could be either an allergic reaction to the material you're wearing or to heat. The cause of spot rashes is usually environmental.
If your rash is accompanied by other symptoms, including fever, nausea, chills, or pain, visit a doctor. It's likely there's an infection causing the rash that might be a sign of a food allergy that needs treated with medication.;
, The color and texture of the rash can tell you a little about what the likely cause might be, so you'll be able to treat it more effectively. Try to leave the rash alone as much as possible while you look, and avoid scratching or prodding at it too much. Rinse it with warm water and natural soap and dry the rash thoroughly. If it is red, itchy, and goes white when you press it, it might might be an allergic reaction, or contact dermatitis from some local irritant.
If a rash has a strange pattern, is scaly, or has an odor, it's likely a fungal infections.
If the rash follows a straight line away from a single red bump, it's probably insect bite.
If the rash is elevated and yellowish with a red base, and is quite painful to the touch, then it's infected and needs to be shown to a doctor.

, All rashes are caused by something. To treat the rash effectively, you need to try to determine the cause. Ask yourself the following questions to try to narrow down the causes:


Have you come into contact with any fabrics, chemicals, or animals that may have triggered a skin rash? Is the rash located in an area that gets particularly sweaty on your body? If your rash seems to worsen when you sweat, or in the middle of the day under your clothes, it's likely that the rash is caused by some environmental irritant, like a fabric or a product. Have you switched any soaps, fabric softeners, or used a new hygiene product recently? This could be the cause.
Have you eaten anything unusual recently, that may have caused an allergic reaction? Have you used any new cosmetic, cream, or medication? Some over-the-counter or prescription medications may also cause skin rashes. If your rash is accompanied by other symptoms, including swelling, difficulty breathing, or nausea, it might be a sign of an allergic reaction that needs treated immediately.Does the rash seem to come and go with no warning or signs at all? Some skin rashes may be caused by auto-immune disorders that are genetic. While these may be treated with over-the-counter options, the root cause of rash will need to be addressed by a doctor.

, Make an appointment to speak with a doctor regarding any unusual skin rashes, or rashes that don't heal quickly. Often, skin rashes are difficult to diagnose and many look very similar, making them difficult to treat on your own. Any rash that does not resolve within two weeks of topical treatment should be reported to a doctor.


Skin rashes can be caused by things as various as autoimmune disorders and plain old stress. Any rash that is extremely painful or won't heal with over-the-counter medication in about a week needs to be checked out by a doctor., Two major types of treatment approaches exist, which should be used based on the cause of the irritation. As always, consult with a doctor if you're not sure, to pursue a more appropriate treatment method.


Allergic reactions are a common cause of rashes, and need to be treated with antihistamines or corticosteroid treatments, either topical or oral. Look for topical products that contain diphenhydramine. Corticosteroids such as 1.5% to 1% hydrocortisone may be used twice daily for up to two weeks to treat allergies. Athlete's foot and other fungal infections need to be treated with anti-fungal medications. Products that contain miconazole or clotrimazole can be used daily for up to 3 months to resolve fungal infections.

, Many over-the-counter options are available, made specifically for treating skin rashes. Different kinds of topical creams, ointments, and lotions are available.


Ointments are oilier and take longer to absorb. They are best used on very dry skin.
Creams absorb more rapidly but also add moisture. These should be used on delicate areas where skin is thin such as skin folds, the groin, and on the face.
Lotions are the least moisturizing and the most quickly absorbed. Lotions are often preferred for use on the face as they are the least oily.

, If you think you might be allergic to a perfume, body powder, soap, shower gel, or other product, try switching to a non-allergenic brand. If you're irritated by some fabric or tight-fitting clothing, try changing your clothes more frequently and keeping yourself dry.


If a baby has diaper rash, allow them to go diaper-free for a while. Change the baby frequently and apply some cream to the rash. This provides the baby or toddler with a waterproof layer between their skin and the diaper.

, It's important to keep the area clean and dry. Use a gentle, natural soap and warm water to clean the rash. Don't soak the rash, but rinse it gently and allow it to dry quickly.


Keep your skin dry. If your skin is too sensitive to dry it with a towel, blot it gently and allow your skin to air dry. Most rashes are not dangerous, and will heal quickly after some gentle cleaning and basic care.
Wear loose-fitting clothes to make sure that the rash doesn't become re-irritated.

, Rashes itch, of course, but try to avoid scratching them. This can lead to secondary infection in otherwise simple rash. If you must, use only the pads of your fingers, but remember that scratching usually leads to more itching. It's best to distract yourself, because it will get better.


It's always important to wear loose-fitting natural fibers, and make sure your skin gets plenty of air-circulation. Don't cover rashes unless you're directed to do so by a doctor.

, If your rash is itching and burning a lot, a cool washcloth can do a lot to help control pain. Just take a clean washcloth or a paper towel and soak it in very cool water. Rest the cloth on the irritated area to help soothe the skin. Let the skin dry thoroughly before repeating the treatment.


If you use ice, don't leave the ice on for longer than 10-15 minutes. If your skin is numbed by burn or rash, it's possible to frostbite yourself with prolonged exposure to the ice. Be very careful if you use ice with your compares., Extra-virgin olive oil works as a skin moisturizer, helping to soothe dry or itchy skin. Olive oil is rich in antioxidants and Vitamin E, making it an excellent and natural remedy for itchy skin.


Turmeric powder has anti-inflammatory properties, and is sometimes added to olive oil to use as a skin treatment.
Coconut oil, castor oil, and cod liver oil are also commonly used as skin treatments.

, Some people like to use baking soda mixed with a little oil, like coconut or olive, to create a balm for itchy skin. Baking soda helps to dry out the skin, sometimes helping to relieve the burning and itching associated with a rash.


If you try this, rinse it off after a few minutes and keep the rash clean and dry. Dry skin is sometimes one of the conditions of lots of rashes, including eczema, and leaving baking soda on a rash for too long can make it worse.

, Oatmeal baths and compresses are common remedies for heat rashes, poison ivy rashes, chicken pox, and other types of mild rashes. Oatmeal helps to soothe skin and control the itchiness associated with rashes. To make an oatmeal remedy:


Grind oatmeal finely in a coffee grinder or food processor, then mix a cup into your bathwater. Agitate the water some to mix, and soak for 15-20 minutes.

, This will not only bring down inflammation but also aid in reducing pain.


Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can be purchased over the counter and are effective for pain due to minor sciatica.
Prescription-strength medications such as oral steroids are an effective option to treat chronic sciatic nerve damage.
Muscle relaxers can be taken to reduce muscle spasms and pain.

, Low impact exercise and stretching can help to heal the muscle and strengthen it against further damage.


Stretch the piriformis muscle — the muscle in the leg that runs parallel to the sciatic nerve — often to relieve tension on the nerve.
Participate regularly in low-impact exercise such as water aerobics. This will reduce tension on your joints while encouraging healthy muscle development.
Strengthen the muscles of the back and abdomen to create strong support for the sciatic nerve. Lower abdominal exercises, such as crunches, are a great way to fortify the midsection and to ease sciatic nerve discomfort.
Avoid siting or standing. This can compress the injured area even more, increasing pain. Instead, try going for walks or laying down.

Ask your doctor for a blood test to see if you're too low in vitamin B12 and other B vitamins. A lack of some B vitamins is linked to skin problems.;
, Dermatologists are skin specialists who can correctly diagnose skin problems and recommend a variety of treatments such as medicinal creams, acne medications, anti-inflammatories, micro-abrasion or laser therapy.


Your dermatologist will want to know if skin conditions are common among your family members because genetics play a role with many skin diseases, such as psoriasis.
Aside from sunburn, getting too much sun is a common trigger for many skin conditions, especially rosacea.Estheticians, herbalists, nutritionists, naturopaths and chiropractors may also be good sources of information regarding skin conditions and natural treatments, but it's best to see a medical doctor first.

, A doctor who specializes in diagnosing allergies is called an allergist. Allergic reactions range from mild to life-threatening, but they typically manifest quickly — within seconds to hours.A severe rash on the face that develops quickly is likely hives. If you experience breathing problems, nasal congestion or swelling of the lips and tongue, you need to call 911 or emergency services immediately, as this indicates anaphylaxis, a life-threatening emergency.
Food allergies are one of the most common allergies to affect the face.Common food allergies include nuts (peanuts), shellfish (shrimp), eggs, cow's milk, fish, wheat, and soy."

Remove and wash your clothes.,
Apply rubbing alcohol.,
Rinse the area with cool water.,
Completely clean the area.,
Don't scratch the rash.,
Cool off the exposed area.",How to Treat Poison Ivy and Poison Oak1," Take off your clothes and place them in a plastic garbage bag, if possible. Wash your clothes separately from anything else as soon as possible.;
, You can apply rubbing alcohol to your skin to dissolve the poison ivy or poison oak oils. Because the toxic oil from the plant seeps into your skin gradually, adding rubbing alcohol to the area will prevent the further spread. It won't provide immediate relief, but it will stem the spread. You can also use an over-the-counter cleanser like Tecnu or Zanfel.

, Never use warm or hot water, as this will open your pores and allow more of the toxins to sink in. If you're able, keep the affected area under cold running water for 10-15 minutes. If you're outdoors in the woods when you're exposed to poison ivy or poison oak, then you can rinse your body off in a running stream., Regardless of the location on your body, make sure that it was thoroughly rinsed with water. If you touched the area on your body at all or the poison affected your hands, scrub under your fingernails with a toothbrush in case any oil from the plants was deposited beneath them. Throw the toothbrush away after you're done.


Use a dish soap that is used for oil removal to rinse the area of your rash. Because the toxins have been transferred to your skin in the form of an oil, using an oil-obliterating dish soap may help to reduce the spread of the rash.
If you use a towel to dry yourself after washing the affected area, be sure to wash the towel with the rest of your exposed clothes immediately after use.

, Even though the rash is not contagious, you could break the skin and allow bacteria to enter the wound. Don't touch or pop any blisters that may form, even if they are weeping. If necessary, cut your nails short and cover the area to keep yourself from scratching it.

, Apply cold compresses or apply an icepack for 10 to 15 minutes. Make sure that you don't apply ice directly to your skin; always wrap your ice pack or compress in a towel before application. Also, allow the area to air dry instead of rubbing it with a towel if you get your rash wet.

Consider undergoing laser surgery.",How to Treat Rosacea1," If you think you have rosacea, you should make an appointment to be seen by your doctor. Your doctor can perform an evaluation, confirm whether you have rosacea, and suggest one or more ideal treatments for you based on your personal health.Rosacea is not a threat to your general health, so you do not need to be seen on an emergency basis if you think you have it.;
, Ask your healthcare provider to prescribe medications that can help treat rosacea. In most cases, your doctor will prescribe either topical or oral antibiotics that can treat affected areas by reducing inflammation. However, these typically are not a long term solution for rosacea, as they tend to cause unwanted side effects, such as diarrhea and abdominal pain.If you do not want to treat rosacea with prescribed antibiotics due to unwanted side effects, ask your doctor about other treatment options. You do not have to take any medication that your are uncomfortable with.

, If you have rosacea, your doctor or dermatologist may suggest that you apply brimonidine gel to minimize it. Brimonidine gel works by constricting blood vessels in the skin, thus minimizing the skin's redness. This redness is reduced for 12 hours after each application.The most common side effect connected with the use of brimonidine gel is a warming or flushing of the skin.
Talk to your doctor about possible drug interactions with brimonidine gel. For example, brimonidine gel can interact with medications that lower high blood pressure and prescription pain killers, such as oxycodone. Also, those that are pregnant or are allergic to any of the ingredients in brimonidine gel should not use it., Some forms of laser surgery, such as intense pulsed light (IPL) therapy, can help reduce the visibility of blood vessels in your face, while also enhancing your appearance. There may be a temporary increase in redness and you may need several treatments, but laser surgery can be an effective treatment for severe rosacea. Consult with your doctor or dermatologist about this option for your rosacea treatment.Laser surgery can be a very effective and long lasting treatment for rosacea. The elimination of redness can last up to several years.
Discuss the cost of this treatment with your doctor or dermatologist before having it done. It can be relatively expensive and insurance rarely covers it, so you will need to be prepared for the cost.

Remove the plant.",How to Treat Poison Sumac," Urushiol oil takes about 30 minutes to enter the skin.As soon as possible after you’ve come into contact with the plant, take a shower with soap and cool water. Even if you miss the 30-minute window, showering will remove the oil from your skin and prevent the poison sumac from spreading.


Avoid hot water, which will increase irritation.;
, If you can’t take preventive action within 30 minutes, you’ll need some anti-itch treatments to apply to your rash. (Be sure to wash your hands afterward!) Look for products that will soothe the rash while also working to dry it up. When possible, use products with natural ingredients. Some good choices are:



Calamine lotion: Using a cotton ball or piece of toilet paper, apply the calamine to the rash. Let it dry. Reapply as needed.

Witch hazel: Pour onto a cotton ball. Dab the entire rash. Resoak the cotton ball as it begins to dry. Reapply as needed.

Zinc oxide: Rub into the skin. Reapply as needed.

Tea tree oil: Apply in the same way you would use witch hazel. While it’s safe to apply to rashes and blisters, it will burn broken skin.Topical corticosteroids: These medications are available without a prescription in most pharmacies. Gels and creams are the least expensive options. If you develop poison sumac on your scalp, you will need a foam or mousse form. Apply once to twice daily to the rash., Soak a washcloth with cool water. Wring out the washcloth until it stops dripping. Place the washcloth on the rash. Repeat the process when the cloth starts to feel warm. Apply compresses whenever you feel itchy., Buy an oatmeal bath treatment at the local drug store. Less expensive remedies include adding one cup (0.23L) of baking soda or Epsom salts to your bath water. Any of these baths works with your anti-itch medication to dry out the rash.Bathe once per day until your symptoms start to subside.

, Poison sumac can’t spread from leaky blisters. However, scratching does make it worse. Bacteria living under your fingernails can get into the open sores and cause an infection.Rather than risking infection, apply your anti-itch treatments when you begin to feel itchy.

, Most cases of poison sumac clear up in a few weeks with proper home treatments. However, if the rash worsens, you could become very sick. See your doctor or nurse practitioner if:The itching keeps you up at night.
The rash shows no sign of improvement after about two weeks.
The rash spreads to your eyes, nose, mouth, or genitals.
You develop a fever of 100 degrees F (38 degrees C) or higher.
The blisters start to ooze yellow pus, which is a symptom of infection.
You experience pain in addition to itching.
You have trouble breathing.

, If your rash worsens, your doctor will give you a prescription. For severe itching, you might receive an oral corticosteroid, such as prednisone. If your rash becomes infected, you will receive antibiotics, such as penicillin or erythromycin.Tell your doctor if you are allergic to penicillin or any other form of prescription medication. Allergic reactions range form minor rashes to life-threatening anaphylaxis., Immediately after exposure, use a nailbrush, which is available at any drug store. Even if your hands didn’t touch the plant, scrub anyway. This will prevent the plant oils from being transferred to other parts of your body., Immediately wash everything you were wearing when you came in contact with the plant. Add detergent to remove the urushiol oil.Otherwise, the oil can linger on fabrics like cotton or shoe leather, increasing the risk of spreading the rash and triggering a relapse.

, If your dog or cat was with you during your encounter, give them a good bath with soap and lukewarm water as soon as possible. Plant oils can linger on their fur, increasing the risk of infection in humans. While dogs and cats can develop the poison sumac rash, it’s very rare., Keep away from all mucous membranes, such as your eyes, nose, mouth, and genitals. Mucous membranes are far more sensitive than the rest of your skin. Their thinness and moist texture allow them to absorb toxins, including urushiol oil, more easily.

, Poison sumac grows as a shrub or tree-like plant. Each branch consists of seven to 13 smooth leaves on a stem. The leaves appear orange in the spring and green in the summer. In the autumn, they can appear red, orange, or yellow. They sometimes sprout yellow-green flowers and/or whitish-green fruits.

, Regardless of the weather, if you have to be in an area near poison sumac plants, wear long-sleeve shirts, long jeans, and boots. Tuck your jeans into your boots to prevent contact with the ground. If you garden in areas where the plant grows, wear impermeable gardening gloves to protect your hands.Avoid leather, as it can actually absorb urushiol oil and transfer it to your skin., Poison sumac grows mainly in swampy areas but can live in any area that is wet and forested. The most common regions are the southeast and northern parts of the United States. However, climate change is causing the plant to move into new habitats like the Midwest., Removal of poison sumac takes lots of strength and patience. Experts recommend using a hoe or lawn mower to remove the plant—but only with highly protective, impenetrable clothing.If you’ve never dealt with poison sumac and find it growing in your garden or yard, your safest bet is to hire professional landscapers.

Treat sun poisoning.,
Identify photosensitivity.,
Diagnose solar urticaria.,
Apply a natural remedy to your sunburned face.,
Protect yourself from the sun.",How to Treat Severely Irritated Facial Skin2," Sun poisoning is another term for severe sunburn and can cause redness and blistering of the skin as well as dizziness, nausea, dehydration, headache, and pain. If you have sun poisoning, get out of the sun right away. Apply a cold compress to the area, take aspirin or acetaminophen (Tylenol) to reduce swelling and manage pain, and apply a cooling gel or ointment that contains aloe vera.Do not apply ice to the sunburn. You can use a compress soaked in ice water, or take a quick, cool shower or bath. Don't stay in the water too long, as this can cause your skin to try out further.Try a 1% over-the-counter cortisone cream for the first few days, which can reduce redness and swelling. Follow the instructions on the container and do not overuse, as this can cause thinning of the skin.
If your face swells due to sun poisoning or you have severe blistering, see your doctor immediately.

, Sometimes referred to as a sun allergy, people with photosensitivity burn particularly easily or have severe reactions to sun exposure. Just a few moments in the sun may cause a rash if you have this condition. Symptoms include a pink or red skin rash with blotchy blisters, scaly patches, raised spots, itching and burning. If you believe you have photosensitivity, see your doctor for treatment.Photosensitivity may be caused by certain medications (including sulfonamides, tetracycline, and thiazide diuretics); exposure to certain chemicals, fragrances, or plants; herbs (including St. John's wort); autoimmune diseases; or a metabolic disorder called porphyria.

, This rare condition occurs when the skin swells and develops hives when within minutes of exposure to natural sunlight or UV rays. The rash usually disappears very quickly, often within minutes, once the person gets out of the sun.Preventative care is the best way to treat solar urticaria. Minimize exposure to sun and keep your face protected with a broad-spectrum sunscreen and always wear a hat.

Oral antihistamines may reduce the reaction, but will not prevent it entirely.

, There are a variety of natural products in gel, lotion or cream form that can sooth, moisturize and help heal a sunburned face, such as aloe vera gel, vitamin E oil, lavender oil, cucumber-based cream, or a cold compress made from chilled chamomile tea.Make a facial mask from thick Greek yogurt — it cools, moisturizes and alkalizes damaged skin.

, The sun can feel great and offer many health benefits, such as triggering the production of vitamin D, but too much of it at a time will burn your skin and dry it out, resulting in redness, blistering, inflammation, tightness and sensitivity. Protecting yourself with an SPF 30 or higher will help prevent sunburn.


Wear a wide-brimmed hat when in the sun. T
Wear clothes made of a light-colored, breathable material.
Wearing large framed sunglasses may also help because they can cover a greater surface area of your face, as well as protecting your eyes. Make sure they are 100% UV protective.
Seek shade under a tree, umbrella, etc., if you're outside during a period of high UV radiation.

Avoid known triggers.,
Consider if you've been bitten by an insect.,
Use laundry detergent labeled “hypoallergenic.” Chemicals such as bleach and solvents can cause severe rashes also (typically called contact dermatitis).,
Apply medicated creams to your face.",How to Treat Severely Irritated Facial Skin3," If your dermatologist and allergist determine that your skin irritation is from a food allergy, then you'll likely have to avoid that type of food.No need to eat poison ivy or poison oak to get a reaction — merely rubbing up against them and then touching your face is enough to cause moderate to severe irritation. Avoid any chemicals, fragrances, or materials that have caused reactions in the past.


You may have to become more diligent at restaurants in terms of understanding their ingredients and methods of food preparation.

, The bites and venom from various insects can cause a severe skin reaction, especially bees, wasps, spiders, scorpions, fire ants and mosquitoes. Also consider if your bed or pillow is infested with bed bugs or mites.

, If your severe facial irritation developed overnight, then maybe your pillow is the culprit. Rewash your pillow, bedding and clothing with detergents that don't contain any known irritants.Washing bedding and clothes in baking soda powder is a safe, inexpensive alternative and won't irritate your skin.
Irritating chemicals are also found in cosmetics (sodium lauryl sulfate and parabens, for examples), shampoos and hair dyes.

, If your rash is due to an allergic reaction, you could opt for over-the-counter hydrocortisone creams (they reduce inflammation and pain) or more natural ones that contain calamine, vitamin E and/or oatmeal (they relieve itching and irritation).If your hives are caused by something other than allergies, you should talk to your doctor about the best and safest way to get relief.


One of the easiest, quickest and most economical ways to soothe a rash caused by hives, poison ivy or insect bites is to use a cold compress or wrap some ice in a towel.Taking oral antihistamines are available over-the-counter and will help reduce the inflammation and puffiness in your face if an allergic reaction is the culprit. Look for low- or non-sedating antihistamines and consult your doctor before use.If you have a severe rash, your doctor may prescribe prednisone, a corticosteroid that can be used for short-term treatment.

Keep tabs on your hormones.,
Keep your skin clean.,
Try not to pick at your pimples.,
Consider a prescription medication.,
Use a natural remedy on your acne.",How to Treat Severely Irritated Facial Skin4," Hormones, particularly testosterone, play a role in the body's oil production and when too much is produced it clogs skin pores and increases the chance of an acne break-out. Consult your family doctor or dermatologist to determine the best treatment for your skin.Women who go on birth control pills often solve their acne problems.Though unproven, there is a theory that milk, which contains components related to testosterone, can lead to acne., A good way to keep excess oil from clogging your pores is to wash it away. Washing also gets rid of dirt and bacteria, which can contribute to acne too. Wash twice daily, as well as after excessive sweating (such as if you've been working out). However, don't overdo it, because too much washing will trigger an over-production of oil to combat dry skin.Always use a moisturizer after cleaning and exfoliating your skin.


Creams and lotions containing benzoyl peroxide kill bacteria that cause acne.

, It may be very tempting to pick or squeeze your pimples in efforts to get rid of them quicker, but you're likely to make your face more inflamed, plus you risk permanently scarring your skin or causing infection. Let you dermatologist or experienced esthetician deal with your pimples, as they are the experts., If you have chronic and stubborn acne, your dermatologist may offer you a prescription antibiotic lotion such as clindamycin or erythromycin (or maybe oral antibiotics). Tretinoin (Retin-D) is a medication that helps prevent skin pores from getting clogged, whereas isotretinoin reduces the amount of oil produced.The best medical treatment for acne is often a combination of topical and oral medicines.
Always follow your doctor's directions when taking prescribed medications.

, Numerous natural herbal remedies exist that may help to combat severe acne such as green tea (anti-inflammatory and astringent), lavender oil, chamomile, tea tree oil (antiseptic), or apple cider vinegar.Make a honey and oat face mask. Honey is a good antiseptic, whereas oatmeal cleanses, moisturizes, soothes irritation and relieves itchiness.
Make a bentonite clay mask, which unclogs pores and relieves itchiness.

Apply aloe vera.",How to Treat Poison Ivy and Poison Oak2," Calamine lotion, capsaicin cream or hydrocortisone cream can provide some relief from itching. Don't do this immediately after contact with the plant (as rubbing the lotion could spread the oils), but after a few hours or days when the itching feeling begins. Capsaicin cream, usually sold in drugstores labeled for arthritis pain relief, burns a bit at first but suppresses itching for hours.

, Antihistamines are medications that treat for allergies, and since poison oak and ivy cause allergic reactions on contact, taking these drugs may offer minor relief. Antihistamines generally offer only mild relief from the symptoms of poison ivy, but if you take oral medications before bedtime, their combination of anti-itch and drowsiness-inducing effects can help you get some rest. Only take these orally, and do not apply the creams to your poison ivy as this can worsen your rash.

, Use an oatmeal bath product or an aluminum acetate soak. If you need a quick fix without running to the store, blend a cup of oatmeal in a food processor or blender and add it to your warm bathwater. Avoid using water that is very hot, especially right after being exposed to the poison as this will open your pores,, Crack acorns and boil them in water. Strain out the nuts, cool the liquid and apply it to your rash with a cotton pad. Although this method hasn't been studied, it has shown to reduce the itchy feelings of poison ivy rash.

, Make a paste consisting of 3 parts baking soda to 1 part water. Apply the paste to your rash to pull the fluid out of the blisters. Leave the baking soda paste to dry, and allow it to crack or flake off. Reapply this paste every few hours for the best results.

, Use buttermilk or yogurt to apply to your skin, unless you have a dairy allergy. When you apply buttermilk or yogurt to your rash, the proteins will draw out fluid from your blisters.

, Soak in your tea bath for 20 minutes to help reduce the itchiness and uncomfortable feeling. You can also brew very strong tea and dab it onto your rash with a cotton ball every few hours.

, Press a cold watermelon rind or banana peel against your rash. The watermelon rind acts as a cold compress, and the juice helps to dry out blisters. On the other hand, using a banana peel helps to cool and soothe the area.

, If you have a bit of leftover dark-brewed coffee, use a cotton pad to dab it onto your rash. You can also brew a fresh cup, but allow the coffee to cool in the fridge before applying it. Coffee contains chlorogenic acid, which is a natural anti-inflammatory.

, Among the many medical treatments apple cider vinegar can be used for, expediting the healing process of poison ivy exposure is one of them. Use a cotton pad to gently apply the vinegar to the area, or rinse it with a mixture of equal parts vinegar and water.

, Aloe vera is a cactus-like plant that excretes a cooling gel from its leaves. You can use a real aloe vera plant by snapping off leaves and applying the gel directly to your rash, or use a processed bottled form. If you buy a bottle from the store, make sure that it is at least 95% real aloe vera."

Learn to identify poison plants.,
Bathe your pets if they have been exposed to the plants.,
Bring preventative measures.,
Dress appropriately if you're going into an area where you think you may find poison ivy or poison oak.",How to Treat Poison Ivy and Poison Oak3," Avoid plants that have the following characteristics:



Poison ivy has 3 shiny green leaves and a red stem. It grows as a vine, typically along riverbanks or lake shores. It can also be found in woods or forests. As a common rule of thumb remember this simple rhyme: ""Leaves of three, leave it be.""


Poison oak grows as a shrub and has 3 leaves like poison ivy. Poison oak is typically found on the West Coast of the U.S.


Poison sumac is a woody shrub with 7 to 13 leaves arranged in pairs. It grows abundantly along the Mississippi River.


, Pets aren't sensitive to poison ivy or poison oak, but if the oils are trapped on their fur, then they could cause an allergic reaction in anyone who pets them. Use pet shampoo and wear rubber gloves while you're giving them a bath.

, If you are taking a hike or are camping in an area that grows poison ivy, bring extra bottles of cold water and rubbing alcohol. If you apply both of these immediately after coming in contact, you will greatly decrease the spread and pain associated with exposure.

, Wear long sleeved-shirts, long pants and socks. Make sure that you wear closed-toe shoes, and always bring a spare change of clothes just in case of an accident.

Do gentle facial cleaning.,
Minimize your stress.,
Conceal rosacea with a green-tinted makeup base.",How to Treat Rosacea2," Use a diary to keep track of your daily behaviors and diet so you can identify triggers that lead to rosacea flare-ups. Keeping a diary will allow you to steer clear of factors that cause rosacea, such as excess sun exposure and consumption of sugary foods.It may take a little while to figure out what is causing your flare-ups. Be patient and keep recording what you do every day until you can see a pattern emerge.

, Apply moisturizer and sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher to your face on a daily basis. These skin care products can help prevent triggers that lead to flare-ups, such as exposure to wind, sun, and hot temperatures. The biggest trigger of rosacea flare-ups is sunlight, so sunscreen is important to wear every day.You can also avoid sun exposure by wearing a hat and staying in the shade whenever possible.
When picking out a facial moisturizer and sunscreen, remember to avoid products that contain alcohol, perfumes, scents, or harsh irritants. You may need to buy a special product that is made for sensitive skin.

, When you have rosacea you need to be careful about what you put on your skin and how you treat it. When cleaning your skin, use products that don't have alcohol, perfumes, scents, and other harsh irritants. Skin care products that contain alcohol and other harsh irritants can worsen rosacea and can cause new flare-ups. Also, avoid using washcloths and other scrubbing products on your face when cleaning it. Just your fingertips and a gentle cleanser is enough.Typically, cleansers made for ""sensitive skin"" are more mild than general facial cleansers.

, Chronic stress has been found to worsen rosacea symptoms. To limit these, find new, healthy ways to manage stress, or eliminate stressors from your life. Some ways to limit stress include practicing deep breathing, exercising regularly, listening to soothing, calming music, and engaging in other activities and behaviors that help you relax.It can be hard to limit stress if you have a stressful job or family situation. Start small by taking a little bit of time for yourself every day to just breath and relax. Just a few minutes can really reduce your overall stress quite a bit.

, While makeup will not treat or reduce your rosacea, it will minimize its appearance. Use green-tinted makeup base to most effectively conceal the condition. The green color combines with red-colored skin, visually correcting your skin's color.Green-tinted makeup that is made for concealing rosacea should include sun protection and it should be oil free.

Increase your intake of anti-inflammatory foods.",How to Treat Rosacea3," Coffee and other sources of caffeine can dilate your blood vessels and worsen existing rosacea. The heat from many caffeinated beverages, such as coffee, can also cause rosacea flare-ups.


Ideally you would eliminate caffeinated drinks completely if you have rosacea. However, if you need to drink coffee or tea, try the cold versions. Iced coffee and iced tea is less likely to make rosacea flare up than the hot versions., Like caffeine, alcohol can dilate your blood vessels and increase your risk for rosacea flare-ups. Either stop drinking alcohol entirely or limit your intake to one or two drinks.If you are going to drink wine, drink white instead of red. Red white will have more of an impact on your rosacea.
If you are going to have a drink, consider adding a mixer to it to reduce the amount of alcohol you ingest.

, Spicy foods can cause you to get overheated and make your face red. This can cause your rosacea to flare up as well. Avoid spicy foods whenever possible and opt for the mild version of your favorite foods instead., The presence of inflammation in the body can trigger or worsen rosacea. However, eating healthy and nutritious foods can naturally help reduce inflammation. Foods that can help reduce inflammation include:Fresh fruits
Fresh vegetables
Whole grains
Beans
Fish
Healthy fats

It soothes the skin and reduces the urge to itch. Less itching means less skin irritation and reduced development of rash, too.


Put some ice cubes in a plastic bag or towel and hold it on the itchy skin for a few minutes. If you don't have ice, you can use a bag of frozen peas or beans. Be sure to always wrap your ice packs in a cotton towel or cloth to avoid direct contact of ice on your skin,
Do not hold it on the area for a prolonged period of time. With cold there is blood vessel constriction leading to reduced blood supply to the area that may cause tissue damage.
Dry the skin immediately after using cold compression because moisture often worsens itching and rash.;
, These are convenient, easy, often effective remedies to reduce itching. They are most effective when the main problem is general dryness like in cases of psoriasis, tinea, lichen planus, etc. Choose an oil based cream as it keeps moisture in the skin for extended periods of time.


Depending on need, you may apply the cream three to four times a day.
Do not buy creams which contain scent or dye. The chemical used in those kinds may worsen hypersensitive skin lesions., Aloe is a plant that has been used for many years for skin care. The gel of the aloe vera leaf reduces itching and helps to benefit many skin conditions like the common rash, eczema, and psoriasis.To extract the gel, break a leaf and cut it along its mid-length. Then squeeze the leaf with a spoon keeping it on a hard surface. Apply the gel directly on the skin and keep it for on an hour or so.You can also buy pharmaceutical topical creams or gels that use aloe vera gel in their content.

Mint contains menthol and rosmarinic acid, thyme contains thymol, and basil contains eugenol, all of which share the same powerful effects that can ease your symptoms. You can make your own replenishing skin wash of each one by adding some of the fresh leaves of any of these herbs to a cup of water and bringing it to a boil. When it cools, apply it to your affected skin using the aid of a cotton ball or swab, let sit for 5 to 10 minutes, and then wash off with warm water.

, There are many over the counter topical products for itching widely available. They primarily act by numbing the skin temporarily and hence reduce the urge to itch. Apply these lotions or creams several times a day as needed. There are usually no side effects because systemic absorption is negligible.


Topical lotions containing calamine, camphor, glycerol, menthol, thymol, phenol, chamomile, or olive oil all have soothing effects to reduce and inflammation calm the affected area.

, Antihistaminics are also available in topical form to be applied directly on the affected skin areas. Common, popular examples are Fenistil gel (Dimethindene) and Insect bite gel (Dimethindene + Zinc acetate). Topical creams or gels can be applied up to four times daily to sooth and calm the irritated skin.

, Steroids can be used topically to avoid all their systemic undesirable side effects when ingested. Applying the topical applicants on your affected skin can produce an immediate soothing effect, and reduce irritation and inflammation. Common examples are Dermovate (Clobetasol) and Elocon (Mometasone). Most are available as creams, ointments or lotions.


Certain varieties are available over-the-counter at your local pharmacy. For stronger topical agents, you'll likely need a prescription from your doctor.

, Your rash will likely get worse if your skin stays damp and hot. Such conditions breed bacteria and slow the healing process, making it itchier for a longer period of time. Here are a few things to keep in mind:


Having cool showers and baths are very helpful in case of rash that's spreading. Avoid using soaps and shower gels that can irritate your skin; substitute them with soaps made from natural moisturizing substances.
Always wear cotton clothes, especially those that are in direct contact with your irritated skin. Make sure that all your clothes are from fine cotton, not irritating artificial materials.
Avoid exposing your rash to hot water or very hot climates – this can irritate your skin more and worsen your condition, bringing about stronger urges to scratch your skin that can lead to tiny cuts that may develop secondary bacterial infections.

, Another kind of bath you can take that may be effective for your rash is the Epsom salt bath. It can soothe your rash by decreasing inflammation and calming your irritated skin. To make it doubly effective, add some natural oils such as olive or chamomile to help seal in moisture.


Make a bath by adding a cup of Epsom salts to your warm bath, stirring lightly, and adding a few drops of oil. Sit in it for about fifteen minutes three times every week.

, Colloidal oatmeal acts as a cleanser and moisturizer as well as a soothing and protective anti-inflammatory agent.It can be used in place of soaps which are alkaline and often irritating to your skin.


Take one cup of oatmeal and grind it in a blender or coffee grinder. You will have a fine powder of oatmeal.
Put a quarter cup of this oatmeal powder in a water filled bathtub. Stir the water with your hands to ensure even distribution of the powder.
Spend 15-20 minutes in the tub soaking your whole body. Get up and dry your skin with a soft towel.

, Baking soda can inhibit the itchy sensation and pain in your rash and sooth your skin. When it's mixed with water, an endothermic reaction gets created, releasing baking soda's antiseptic nature. Here are two ways to use it:Add 1/2 cup (4 ounces) of baking soda to a warm bath and relax in the water for 20-30 minutes. This is great for hard-to-reach rashes.
If you don’t have time for a bath, make a paste by adding baking soda to warm water at a ratio of 2:1. Mix and apply to your skin, leaving it on for 20 to 30 minutes. Then, wash it off with warm water and pat dry.

Do be careful not to use this remedy too often. Baking soda in excess can actually dry out your skin.



, Similar to the herbs discussed above, turmeric and ginger are thought to be powerful anti-inflammatory substances. When they're ingested, your entire body reaps the benefits from the inside-out.


Add them as spices to your dishes, drink them as teas, or mix one teaspoonful of each with one cup of cow's milk or coconut milk to be boiled, filtered, and then add honey or sugar as a sweetener to drink.

, These should be the first line of medication sought when treating any kind of itchy rash, as they are generally effective in blocking the H1 receptor that histamine needs to bind to to create your rash. Having an antihistamine in your system stops the initiation of the inflammation process, leading to a half in the inflammation process, decreasing pain, swelling and warmth sensations.


Non-sedative antihistaminic drugs are widely used and preferred over the sedative category to avoid the dizziness and drowsiness feeling as a side effect commonly experienced otherwise. Antihistamines are usually administrated as just one dose on a daily bases until the rash is gone.
Examples of the most commonly used drugs that are available OTC are Zyrtec (Cetrizine), Aerius (Desloratadine) and Claritin (Loratadine). They are available in both tablets and syrup forms (except Claritin, which is available in tablets only). Zyrtec is available in drops, too, which is often easier for young children.
Tab Chlorpheniramine 5mg, Diphenhydramine 10mg, Tab Promethazine 10 mg are examples of first generation antihistamines. Take one tab at night initially. Then increase the dose as necessary.
Tab Cetirizine 10mg, tab Fexofenadine 30/60/120/180mg, tab Levocetirizine 5mg, and tab Desloratadine 5mg are newer antihistamines which are take once at night.

, Non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs “NSAIDs” can also be taken to help decrease pain and inflammation. Common examples are Voltaren (Declofenac salt) and Brufen (Ibuprofen), available in various dosage forms as tablets, syrups, injections, suppositories, and topical forms.


They’re also very useful in reducing fever as they act by stopping the release of prostaglandin (one of the chemicals involved in the inflammation process) by inhibiting the enzymes COX-I and COX-II.
Talk to your doctor about how much is the appropriate dose for you. You can find various NSAIDs at your local pharmacy, and while those may be effective, stronger versions will only be available by prescription.

, Steroids are known for their ability to stop the inflammation process – however, they're not generally used in mild cases as they tend to come with a handful of side effects. However, with a prescription from a doctor and, of course, following his or her advice, they may be an effective method of treatment.


The most commonly used steroids are Urbason tablets or Predsol syrup (Prednisolone). These may also be recommended as immunosuppressant agents in the case of autoimmune skin diseases.
Tab Prednisolone 5 or 10mg may be taken for 5-7 days to suppress acute attacks of rash. Long term treatment must be avoided because these medications suppress natural steroid production and can make you dependent on the drug.

, Antibiotics are also prescribed in some cases where a bacterial disease is suspected, like in cases of insect bites. What's more, scratching the irritated skin can cause injury and secondary bacterial infection, making antibiotics useful. Talk to your doctor about this being a viable option for you.


Broad spectrum antibiotics such as Unasyn (Ampicillin + Sulbactam) or Cefdin (Cefdinir) are generally prescribed to fight common causative bacteria and are available in both tablets and syrup forms to suit many ages and conditions.
Follow the course of treatment as prescribed by your doctor and follow the doses to a T. Be sure to take the full course, too – if you don't, the infection could lie dormant in your system and spring back up in the future.

, This is an itchy rash caused by a trigger that leads to fluid leak from blood vessels under the skin surface. The rash develops suddenly with small raised white or pink areas (wheals) surrounded by a red area of skin (flares). The rash can appear at any site of the body and usually lasts less than 48 hours. There are several causes of acute urticaria:



Food allergy. Some people are allergic to particular foods like egg, milk, prawn, shrimp, tomato, chocolate, nut, brinjal, etc. Just sight or smell of these foods may provoke itching and rash in some susceptible individuals.

Insect bites and stings. A bee, wasp sting, or ant bite may cause development of rash and itching. It is usually localized and less severe.

Contact dermatitis. Some people develop hypersensitivity to particular chemicals like latex, cement, plastic, cosmetics, ointments, etc. Contact with these chemicals may provoke a rash.

Drug hypersensitivity. Rash can be the result of a side effect of the drug or an allergy to the drug. If it is a side effect then the rash will usually develop over a few days and is indolent in nature. The rash disappears as the drug is stopped. But if it is due to allergy, the rash will develop within minutes to hours of drug ingestion.

Viral infection. A simple cold or flu may cause urticaria in some people. These are non-specific and often the cause of urticaria is not found if the flu is very mild. These should be differentiated from infections causing specific patterns of rashes like chicken pox, measles, etc.

, Physical urticaria is less common than acute urticaria, but it's pretty easy to pinpoint once you put two and two together. With this condition, your rash develops as a result of heat, cold, exercise, or even vibration. If your rash doesn't seem to have a cause, experiment with these factors and see if your rash gets better.


As these physical events are difficult to avoid, susceptible people often suffer chronically, not realizing what is affecting their skin.

, This is a pruritic (itchy) disease of unknown origin that starts at an early age. The disease presents itself in many forms including food allergy, asthma, hay fever and eczematous skin disease. The eczema manifests as intense itchy skin with development of small vesicles on red, swollen skin. The vesicles break and fluid leaks out along with the formation of thin crust. Gradually the skin may become dry, rough and thickened. The skin lesions tend to have a relapsing and remitting course.


Some unique characteristics of atopic dermatitis are:Onset younger than 2 years
Itching at skin creases
Eczematous changes that vary with age
Chronic and relapsing course
Atopy (IgE sensitivity)
Personal history of asthma or hay fever or history of such diseases in first degree relatives.



, This is a rash characterized by intensely itchy, flat-topped, pink-purplish elevated areas of skin that commonly occur on the front of the wrists and lower back. Some lesions have a fine white network on their surfaces.


The lesions may occasionally appear inside the mouth, genitalia and nails.
The cause is unknown but viral hepatitis, gold, heavy metal, anti-TB drug, anti-malarial drug and thiazide diuretic may provoke the disease., Ringworm of the body is also known as tinea corporis. It is a fungal infection of the skin characterized by red, scaly, ring like lesions in the body that may be single or multiple. The ring grows outward with central clearance.


If your rash looks like this, visit your doctor immediately. This type of rash requires medical treatment.

, This is a chronic disease characterized by rapid turnover of skin (epidermis). In this condition, there is formation of reddish areas of skin elevation with silvery white scales. You will see pinhead sized bleeding points if the scales are removed.


The rash commonly occurs on the scalp, elbows, knees, lower back, skin creases and around umbilicus.
Some patients develop joint disease after a long period of time leaving psoriasis untreated.
The condition tends to have a relapsing and remitting course. Sunlight, infection, injury, emotion, and drugs can cause a flare up.

, This is a parasitic disease caused by a house mite known as Sarcoptes scabiei. The mite lives beneath the skin and lays eggs there. There it causes intense itching particularly at night and after a hot bath.


The rash appears as bumpy red areas that usually occur in and around the finger clefts, wrist, axillary folds, nipples and areola, umbilicus, belt lines, genitalia, buttock and inner aspect of thighs.
The characteristic sign is linear or curved skin burrows. However, it is not always seen.
The disease is contagious and spreads by skin contact. There may be more than one affected person in a family due to close contact.

Studies have suggested oatmeal as a potentially effective agent in restoring the protective barrier function of inflamed skin and reducing symptoms related to atopic dermatitis, i.e. eczema, owing to its fraction called avenanthramides., It is thought that chamomile can help reduce inflammation and itching. It can promote healing of the skin and prevent bacterial infections, too. In addition to the flower itself, chamomile is available as lotion or oil (to be added to a cool bath). In fact, studies comparing chamomile cream compared to standard steroid creams and plain moisturizers showed chamomile cream to be superior to both local applications.This is due largely in part to its most potent ingredient apigenin, the most bioactive constituent of the plant.


If you aren't looking to use a cream or lotion, here's how to use whole chamomile flowers to improve your skin:

Take a large bowl of water, add a few chamomile flowers, and boil it for a few minutes.
Let the water cool and then add some ice cubes.

Take 50 grams of bilberries in a steel container and add around 1 liter (0.3 US gal) of water to it. Warm the mixture and let it sit for an hour. This process will allow the mixture to become homogenous.
Boil the mixture for 20 minutes and let it cool to room temperature. Afterward, it will be ready to be used as a cleanser.
Using a cloth or cotton swab, clean the affected area with this mixture twice or thrice a day. You may use it for as long as your eczema persists as it works like a natural cleanser.

In a study conducted using bilberry extract (Bilberon 25), it was found that the cream outdid even steroid cream application in relieving itching owing to its high anthocyanin content., Some believe that almond leaves are very effective in the treatment of dermatitis and in preventing it from recurring. To reap its benefits, you'll need an almond paste. Here's how to make it:


Take 5-10 new almond leaves and crush them with water to prepare a smooth paste.

, Strengthening the immune system is one of the cornerstones to healing eczema. Apple cider vinegar is beneficial for eczema because of its immune boosting abilities due to the host of vitamins and minerals it contains. The anti-bacterial and anti-fungal properties are especially beneficial for combating dry skin and skin infections, relieving the skin from inflammation, itchiness, and dryness.If you have this all-purpose agent in your kitchen cupboards, here's how to try it:

Let it remain for 5-10 minutes and then clean that area with a damp cloth. This will give you relief from itching and inflammation.
Repeat this process daily for a few weeks to get relief from itching.

, Olive oil can be a very effective remedy for treating eczema. It contains high levels of Vitamin C that act as a good anti-oxidant.However, it's best to use refined olive oil for curing eczema. Look for ""refined"" or ""extra-virgin refined"" labels on the bottle.

Camphor tablets are widely available at most pharmacies, big-box stores, and on online.

, These two herbs are both well-known for their anti-inflammatory properties that may potentially reduce dermatitis and improve the general condition of your skin.The main downside is that turmeric might stain your skin and clothes. If you'd like to use this remedy, throw on an old t-shirt, first. Once that's done, here's how to make this anti-inflammatory paste:

Take 5-10 leaves of neem and grind them. Add them to your turmeric paste.
Apply this paste on the affected area. You should feel instant relief from eczematous itching and redness.
Remove the paste with a soft sponge or wash off under running water after 15 minutes. You may redo this as often as you wish for as long as the eczema persists.

, Magnesium is believed to have detoxifying qualities where it removes the harmful waste products from the body. This ensures that the skin is left with essential nutrients that are required for the healing process to take place.Here's how to prepare a magnesium bath:


Fill a bathtub 3/4 of the way up with warm water.
Add 1 cup of Epsom salt, ½ cup of sea salt, ½ teaspoon of vanilla extract and 15 drops of lavender mint to the bathing water.Mix the salts and extracts into the water to emulsify your magnesium bath. Do this regularly to cleanse your skin and help it heal.

, Some herbal soaps can also be used in the treatment of dermatitis. This includes lye soap that helps to ease itchy skin, dryness and acne when used daily. Also consider soaps that contain any of the above ingredients, like aloe or vitamin E.


Always use a mild cleanser, regardless of whatever soap you're using. And keep in mind that overwashing your skin can dry it out, too. Always balance washing with using moisturizing creams and lotions as well.

, What's more, when vitamin E oil is applied on the affected area it can provide instant relief from itching and inflammation, too.You can also try lotions and creams containing vitamin E that help in promoting the healing of inflamed skin.


Regular intake of vitamin E enriched foodstuffs like almonds can also help in preventing dermatitis from worsening. You can safely apply a vitamin E cream twice a day over the affected skin, consume 5 almonds, or have a supplement containing 15mg vitamin E each day for the same effect., Foods that are rich in gelatin are important for the skin and may help in the healing of dermatitis. Gelatin can help tighten loose skin, make it glow, and help it rebuild thanks to its protein content and amino acids. Examples are pure gelatin, of course, but also head cheese, bone broth, and ox tail.Bone broth can be prepared at home by boiling bones. This broth should be made from bones that are of high quality, like grass fed cows or pastured poultry. These could be the left over bones after roasting chicken, turkey and duck, or gotten from a butchery where you are assured of fresh meat or from local farmers who butcher animals in their farm.
Unfortunately, this doesn't mean Jell-O. Though Jell-O does have gelatin, it's mostly sugar. Instead, opt for pure powdered gelatin that you can add to any smoothie or dish without greatly changing the flavor.

, Fermented liver oil and cod liver oil can be used in treating dermatitis. They both help to reduce inflammation and enhance formation of healthy cells in the body. Cod liver oils, in particular, provide the body with fat-soluble vitamins A, E, D and K that help in rejuvenating the skin. This helps in dermatitis by clearing the inflammation on the skin.


However, be wary of taking too much. Studies have shown that the high vitamin A and retinol content of liver oil can lead to bone damage and osteoporosis.Before taking this supplement, talk to your doctor about an appropriate dosage.

, Dermatitis can also be healed by consuming foods that are rich in essential fatty acids. Essential fatty acids help the body in boosting the immune system, fighting inflammation, moisturizing and strengthening the cells in the skin.


Fish is the go-to example for most people when it comes to essential fatty acids. But for vegetarians, there are plenty of sources, too. Walnuts, soybeans, flaxseed, blackcurrant seed oil and hemp oil are full of these healthy fats, too."

Recognize symptoms of contact dermatitis.,
Wash the affected area.,
Avoid exposure to the cause.,
Use a barrier to protect yourself from irritants.,
Take an oral antihistamine.,
Apply moisturizer regularly.,
Alleviate symptoms with cool baths.,
Apply a topical corticosteroid cream for severe cases.,
See a dermatologist if symptoms persist.",How to Treat Dermatitis1," Contact dermatitis is one of the most common forms of dermatitis.This type of skin inflammation is caused by exposure to an allergen or irritant (such as poison ivy).Signs of contact dermatitis include a localized rash, red patches and bumps, and localized itching.More severe symptoms include blisters and swelling.Symptoms begin very shortly after exposure to the irritating substance.



Allergic contact dermatitis is a rash triggered even by brief contact with the allergen, and often takes up to two weeks after exposure to develop.This can be a well known cause such as poison ivy or any number of metals, fragrances, plants, or other materials that an individual can develop an allergy to.

Irritant contact dermatitis is dry, damaged skin caused by repeated rough exposure. This is commonly caused by washing hands too frequently, but harsh soaps, detergents, or other chemicals can also be at fault.;
, Use lots of warm water to remove any remaining irritants.Use small amounts of gentle, unscented soap to avoid further irritation. Do not scrub or rub too harshly: you do not want to break the skin or cause infection.

, Identifying and removing the cause of exposure should be your main priority. Cosmetics, perfumes, hair products, and metal jewelry are common causes of dermatitis, as are detergent, soap, or other household cleaning chemicals.If you don't know the exact cause of your dermatitis, avoid all harsh and scented products and metallic jewelry as much as possible or switch to gentler and fragrance-free alternatives.


If you are having trouble isolating the cause of your contact dermatitis, talk to your doctor about performing an allergy test. A patch test can help your doctor discern the specific substance that is irritating your skin and give you tips on how to avoid it in the future., If the cause of your dermatitis is a substance you work with or otherwise have trouble avoiding, a barrier can physically prevent the irritant from contacting your skin. Depending on the specific cause of your dermatitis, you can use different barriers such as:


Protective gloves or clothing
Barrier creams
Clear coats of nail polish (on metal jewelry)

, If itching is severe, an over-the-counter antihistamine such as Benadryl can both help you get to sleep and soothe the itching to prevent you scratching at night., Keep affected areas protected and moisturized to speed the healing process.Be sure that the moisturizers are fragrance-free, alcohol-free, and hypoallergenic so that they will not irritate your skin further.


When applying an ointment, cream, or lotion, smooth a large amount onto the skin in the direction hair grows. Do not rub it in; it is there to moisturize the outer skin and create a protective layer to prevent dehydration.
Switch to a different moisturizer if you find it irritates your skin further. Be on the lookout for more symptoms, especially if you do not yet know the cause of your contact dermatitis.
Try using calamine lotion to help soothe your skin., Painful, oozing lesions can be treated with lukewarm or cool (not hot) baths. This will not cure the dermatitis, but it can soothe your skin and make the symptoms easier to deal with.


Add baking soda or colloidal oatmeal to the bath to make it extra soothing and calming on the skin.If you do not have time for a cool bath, try cool, wet compresses instead. They can also work to alleviate symptoms and soothe affected areas. Apply them to your skin for 15-30 minutes at a time and repeat as needed.You can even use a large towel or cloth for larger areas and cover the damp cloth with a dry piece of clothing., If your condition does not improve with home remedies, a topical corticosteroid may reduce the inflammation. You can buy a hydrocortisone cream over the counter or see a doctor for prescription-strength alternatives (ointment, pills, or shots).


Do not use a corticosteroid on an infant under 2 years of age. Pregnant women should apply with caution and use low-strength creams.
Apply the ointment once a day, and do not continue for more than two weeks without doctor approval., Contact dermatitis can often be treated within one or two weeks using home remedies, over the counter treatments, and lifestyle changes. If you still have a severe rash after 2 weeks, consult a dermatologist. She may recommend phototherapy, immunosuppressants, or another treatment option.She might also be able to prescribe stronger corticosteroids to calm inflammation or antibiotics to treat skin infections that may have developed.You should also see your doctor if your dermatitis is affecting your sleeping, breathing, or work performance. Other indications that you should see a doctor include if you experience a great deal of pain or if you begin to develop infections or blisters on the affected area."

Use an oil-based moisturizer.,
Apply calamine lotion.,
Try Vitamin E lotion.",How to Soothe an Itchy Pregnancy Belly1," Moisturize your itchy belly by using an oil-based moisturizer. Oil-based moisturizers are ideal because they will absorb easily into your skin. You can find oil-based moisturizers at your local drugstore or in the beauty aisle.Do not use moisturizers that have added fragrance, as it can irritate your skin further. If you would like to add fragrance to the moisturizer, use lavender or frankincense essential oils. Put one to two drops of the essential oils into the moisturizer. They have a calming scent and can also help to reduce any swelling on your belly due to the itchiness.Do not use nutmeg, rosemary, basil, jasmine, clary sage, rose, or juniper as they are not recommended for use by pregnant women.;
, Calamine lotion contains zinc, iron oxides, and zinc carbonate, which can help to soothe itchy skin. Simply apply a small amount of calamine lotion to itchy areas on your belly several times a day.Calamine has been shown to be safe to use on the skin when pregnant; however, if you are concerned, you should speak to your doctor before using it on your belly.

Beware of sudden rashes.,
Check that the rash is localized.,
Note other swelling, blistering, burning, or tenderness.,
Focus on the affected area.,
Recall your activities.,
Get tested for allergies.,
Avoid allergenic and irritating products.,
Wear protective clothing.,
Keep clean.",How to Spot Contact Dermatitis Symptoms," Contact dermatitis usually shows up when you’ve been touched by a substance that triggers a reaction, like poison ivy or oak or latex gloves. The rash usually will crop up suddenly, within hours of contact. It may also last for two to four weeks.There are two basic kinds of contact dermatitis, allergic or irritant. Allergic dermatitis occurs when you have contact with an allergenic substance and it produces a delayed reaction. This may develop over a period of 48 to 96 hours, or it may take even longer, between seven and 10 days after the first exposure.
Allergenic contact dermatitis can also cause oozing blisters, intense itching, and sometimes swelling in the face, eyes, or genitals.
Irritant contact dermatitis occurs when skin comes into contact with an irritant, like a detergent or solvent. Skin damage may be permanent if the irritant is powerful, like acid or lye soap.
This kind of dermatitis may also cause mild swelling, itching, blisters, painful ulcers, or tight-feeling and cracked skin.
If you note a rash and think you may have come into contact with a plant like poison oak, ivy, or sumac, make sure you wash everything that may have been in contact with the plant with cold water. This includes clothing, gardening tools, sports equipment, and pets.;
, Contact dermatitis happens when a substance comes into contact with the skin – your reaction will therefore be limited more or less to where the substance touched you (so if you ran through poison oak with pants on but no shoes, your feet will react but your legs will be spared). If the rash is localized, try to determine if the source is in fact a foreign substance.Is the rash on your hands or face? Contact dermatitis most often affects these areas and rarely occurs on the scalp, palms of hands or soles of the feet.
Is the rash confined to the area that was exposed? A delayed reaction sometimes makes it look like a rash from contact dermatitis is spreading, but for the most part it should only occur where your skin was in contact with the irritant or allergen., Contact dermatitis may cause many other symptoms besides redness and a rash. Depending on the strength of the irritant or allergen, you may have pain, blistering, bumps, and severely dry and cracked skin. You may also show non-dermatological signs if the cause is an allergen, like burning lungs, eyes, or nasal passages.Dry skin with a glazed, parched aspect is often the first sign with irritants. Thickened skin and cracking can follow if contact continues for a longer period of time.
In very severe cases of exposure to an irritant, the skin may also exhibit burns or tissue death (necrosis).
Burning eyes, nose, and lungs can indicate allergic contact dermatitis, but can also point to an irritant in the air.

, Pay close attention to the area that is irritated and to anything around it. The culprit may be a substance you touched, triggering a reaction, or it might be a fabric, plastic, or metal item that is coming into contact with the skin. The rash’s location will often suggest a cause.If you’ve been handling an irritant like a mild solvent and develop a rash on your hands, for example, the solvent is probably the cause.
Were you walking outdoors and then got a rash on your legs? You might be dealing with contact dermatitis from poison ivy, poison oak, or poison sumac.
People sometimes develop dermatitis from allergies to fabrics, plastics, or metals. A plastic wristwatch band can cause a reaction, for instance.

, Try to remember your recent activities and what sorts of substances may have contacted the affected area of skin – think in terms of chemicals but also plant materials, fabrics, plastics or rubber, soaps, and sanitizers. Any of these materials may be responsible.Have you been outside on a nature trail, in a wooded lot, or in scrubby area? Keep in mind that you can easily touch poison ivy or a similar plant and not realize it, leading to allergic contact dermatitis. Affected areas for these rashes are often the feet, ankles, legs, or arms. The rash will usually appear linear where the plant has brushed across the skin or resin has been spread by scratching.
Have you handled cleaning products lately, like soaps, detergents, or solvents? These products can cause irritant contact dermatitis, as can rubber and latex and metals like nickel and gold.
Write things down, if it helps. Keep a notebook with all the activities and items that may have led to the reaction or list anything that might have touched your skin for two days before the rash appeared.

, The best and most accurate way to determine if your dermatitis is caused by an allergic reaction is through testing. Make an appointment with an allergy specialist. She can then perform a battery of tests to see whether you have allergies to the substances that most likely caused the rash.Skin prick test can test for reaction to as many as 40 different allergens. A diluted allergen is applied with a prick to your skin. Your skin is observed for 15 minutes. A wheal, irritation, redness or itching may indicate that you are allergic to a substance that was applied.
Another way to test for allergies is through a patch test. This means that you will have to wear patches containing a small amount of each substance for about 48 hours. If you react to a patch, it indicates you have an allergy.
The allergist can use patch testing to check fragrances, hair dyes, rubber, and other substances. It will also detect photoallergic reactions, which occur when a substance like shaving lotion or sunscreen reacts in sunlight to cause a skin reaction.

, Obviously, you should avoid contact with the substance that caused your dermatitis in the first place. This is not always so easy, however, especially if it’s a common chemical or something you have to work around daily. Use vigilance and proper protection.If avoidance is not possible, apply a barrier lotion such as IvyBlock, Work Shield, Zinc Oxide paste, or Desenex prior to potential exposure.
Check the labels on all products that you put on your skin for allergens or irritants, or contact the manufacturer directly. Substitute other products for ones that gives you contact dermatitis.
The allergen in poison ivy may remain active for months. It is crucial for exposed clothing, shoes, tools, camping equipment and pets to be washed thoroughly to avoid spreading the allergen.

, Clothing can form an effective physical barrier between your skin and irritants and help prevent repeat contact dermatitis or if you have had issues with photoallergic reactions to sunlight. Use basic protection: long pants, long-sleeved shirts, and boots can go a long way, whether against chemicals, plants, or other substances.Consider using gloves. Irritant contact dermatitis often affects the hands, so gloves are an easy way to reduce contact. Use cotton gloves if you have an allergy to latex or rubber. Take your gloves off periodically, too, as sweat can aggravate dermatitis symptoms.
Follow all safety instructions on protective equipment if you work with irritants.

, Be sure to wash thoroughly if you come into contact with an allergenic or irritating substance. Treat the area with cool water and soap for at least 25 seconds and then rinse again. Try to remove as much of the substance as you can, as fast as you can, in order to avoid a repeat reaction.Wash the area with Dial brand soap, GOOP (a grease removing agent), or Tecnu as these have been shown to be effective in binding to urushiol (the oil in plants that causes allergic reaction) for more thorough removal. Be sure to wash under the fingernails, too, especially if you have been scratching.
Consider an after-work cream, as well, if you can’t totally avoid contact with an irritating or allergenic substance. These are designed for use after work to calm your skin and reduce the frequency and severity of reactions.

Avoid allergens and irritants.,
Wear cotton or other soft clothing.,
Take a short, lukewarm bath 2-3 times a week.,
Moisturize your skin regularly.,
Reduce the temptation to scratch, especially overnight.,
Regulate temperature and humidity.,
Relax.,
Talk to a dermatologist about prescription-strength treatments.",How to Treat Dermatitis2," Literally meaning ""strange skin inflammation"", the cause for this common condition appears to be a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Many patients develop symptoms before age 5, and in many cases symptoms lessen or disappear in adulthood.Symptoms of atopic dermatitis include intense itching (especially at night); dry, scaly patches on the elbows, knees, hands, upper torso, face, and ankles; small bumps that might ooze fluid; and swollen, sensitive skin.If you or anyone in your genetic family has had similar rashes, asthma, or hay fever, a diagnosis of atopic dermatitis is more likely., Atopic dermatitis episodes can be triggered by any number of things. A doctor can conduct tests to narrow down specific causes, but as this condition is not as simple as contact dermatitis, it's wise to minimize your exposure to all of the following:Perfumes, dyes, and cosmetics
Dust, sand, and dust mites
Chlorine, mineral oil, solvents, and other strong chemicals
Animal fur or dander
Cigarette smoke
Pollen
Food you or your doctor suspect you may be allergic to
Excessive bathing without moisturizing
Low humidity
Emotional stress
Overheating of skin, Wool and other rough material can exacerbate atopic dermatitis, as can clothing that fits poorly or clothing that makes you sweat.Be sure that your clothing is loose and can promote air flow to the skin.Wash any fabrics that come into contact with the skin regularly using fragrance-free detergent. Dust mites can exacerbate eczema, so you want your clothing, towels, sheets, and pillows to be as clean and irritant-free as possible.

, Bathing, showering, or swimming more than 2–3 times a week can dry out the skin and trigger a rash. If this isn't the cause of your episode, you may wash more frequently, but it's still important to follow a skin care regimen.Stay away from any harsh or scented soaps and cleansers to keep your skin from acting up.


You may add a 1/2 cup of household bleach to disinfect the skin during these baths.Be sure that you do not submerge your head during a bleach bath.Other soothing things to add to a bath include uncooked oatmeal, colloidal oatmeal, or baking soda.Gently pat dry with a towel after bathing. Don't rub hard or vigorously, and only dry off after you've applied some moisturizer.

, Apply a moisturizing ointment or cream immediately after bathing, before bed, and throughout the day if necessary.Pay particular attention to your back, chest, and legs, as well as any other affected areas on your body. Ask your doctor for recommendations for thick, soothing moisturizers that will not aggravate your condition.


Use a low water content lotion, such as Eucerin, Cetaphil, and Nutraderm, or a zero water content option such as petroleum jelly, Vaseline, and Aquaphor. These protect against water evaporation on your skin and have a lower chance of triggering a flare of the disease compared with high water content lotions.

, Itching can be severe in atopic dermatitis cases. However, scratching your itchy patches will make your condition worse and might also lead to skin infections. Some ways to resist the urge to scratch include:Take an antihistamine pill (not a cream) to reduce itching.Apply an anti-itch cream such as calamine lotion or an over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream.Cut your fingernails short to minimize damage from scratching.
Wear gloves at night if you scratch yourself while sleeping.
Take a sleep aid. Some antihistamines (such as Benadryl) already have a soporific effect, so read the label to make sure you don't double up.

, Stay cool to avoid sweating, which can irritate your skin. Use a humidifier at night to prevent cold, dry air making your dermatitis worse., Stress has been proven to worsen the symptoms of atopic dermatitis.If you find that stress exacerbates your condition, be sure that you find effective treatments. These might include regular exercise, talk therapy, meditation, or deep breathing exercises. Keep your mind healthy to keep your skin healthy.

, Sometimes eczema can be treated at home. However, more severe and chronic cases might require formal medical intervention. There are a number of therapies available on a prescription basis. Talk to your doctor about what would be a good fit for you. Some of these treatments include:


Corticosteroid creams. A prescription-strength cream can be used for severe cases to reduce inflammation and scaling. Some examples include desonide or hydrocortisone cream for mild eczema, or triamcinolone, fluocinolone, or betamethasone for moderate eczema. Often these are applied twice a day for up to two weeks. Be aware that extended use of the medications can thin the skin or increase your risk of infection.
Oral antibiotics can help treat skin infections as well as reduce the skin bacteria that can worsen atopic dermatitis.UV Phototherapy can help treat atopic dermatitis. However, it can also cause side effects such as premature skin aging.Wet dressings. A combination of moisturizers and corticosteroids can be applied to the skin using wrapped bandages.The treatment is effective but often requires a skilled medical practitioner in order to apply the bandages and wrappings correctly.
For atopic dermatitis on your face or that is not controlled by topical corticosteroids, ask your doctor about the possibility of being treated with topical calcineurin inhibitors, such as tacrolimus or pimecrolimus. You should only use these agents for short periods of time and only use the minimum amount to control your symptoms."

Impetigo is a rash that can form large blisters and is contagious.

Cellulitis will appear as a red or swollen area of skin. Sores that emit a discharge may appear in the affected area.;
, Bacteremia is a condition that is caused when staph bacteria gain access to the bloodstream. This is a serious issue as the staph infection can travel to other parts of the body. If staph reaches other areas, such as internal organs or bones, it can infect them as well.Having a fever may indicate the presence of bacteremia.
Low-blood pressure will usually accompany an instance of bacteremia.

, Toxic shock syndrome is a life-threatening condition and requires immediate medical treatment. This condition occurs when staph bacteria are introduced to the body by skin injuries, surgery, or even some types of tampons. Look for the following symptoms of toxic shock syndrome:High fever
Muscle soreness
Abdominal pain
Nausea
Vomiting
Diarrhea

, Septic arthritis has been know to be caused by staph infections. This occurs when the staph bacteria reach a joint and infect it.

Septic arthritis is usually accompanied y the following the symptoms:Swelling in the affected joint
Extreme pain in the joint
High fever

, If you suspect that you might have a staph infection, you will need to visit your doctor as soon as possible. Staph infections can enter deeply into the body and cause serious and life-threatening health issues. Don't hesitate to seek medical help if you think you may have a staph infection.Review the following points to prepare for your appointment.


Be ready to provide your doctor with information about your health history and current symptoms. Make sure you include any medications or current medical issues besides your staph infection.
Your doctor will ask you some questions about your symptoms including when you first noticed them and how severe they are. Your doctor will try to discover how you may have gotten a staph infection.

, To determine if you have a staph infection, your doctor will need to run diagnostic tests. These tests will allow for an accurate diagnosis of a staph infection and will allow the proper treatment to be determined by your doctor. Knowing what to expect ahead of time can reduce stress and help you know what to ask your doctor about.Your doctor will do a physical examination of skin or surface level symptoms including any rashes, boils, or sores.
Tissue samples will be collected from any affected areas and from the nasal canals. These samples will be examined in detail for signs of staph bacteria.

, After your doctor has diagnosed you with having a staph infection, treatments can then be administered. Most treatments will be done directly by your doctor, but some can be done at home. Antibiotics will likely be prescribed. Your doctor will give you specific instructions that must be followed when taking your antibiotics.
An incision may be made in any skin infections that need draining.
If you have a surgical device that was implanted and it either caused the infection or became infected, it will need to be removed.

, Washing your hands is a simple and effective way to avoid staph infections, as well as a number of other health issues. By keeping your hands clean you can reduce the chances of a staph infection happening to you.Wash your hands thoroughly for 20 to 30 seconds.
Hand sanitizers can be used as long as they have at least 62% alcohol content.

, Having an open wound can be an entry point for a staph infection. By keeping any cuts or scrapes covered, clean and protected you can reduce the chances of a staph infection setting in.Always keep a bandage over any cut or scrape.
Make sure bandages are dry and sterile.
Covering a wound that has become infected with staph can help prevent the staph from spreading.

, A tampon should only be used for a short period of time before it must be changed. Using one tampon for too long can lead to staph bacteria multiplying and causing life-threatening toxic shock syndrome. Avoid this risk by changing tampons when necessary.


Change tampons at least once every four to eight hours.Low absorbency tampons can reduce the risk of toxic-shock-syndrome.

, Sharing any personal items can come with the risk of sharing staph infections. Staph bacteria can be spread by either direct personal contact with another person or by contact with an item carrying the bacteria. If you must share a personal item, make sure it has been properly cleaned.Don't share items such as towels, clothes, or razors.
Wash any shared clothing or sheets in hot water and use bleach if possible.
Clean surfaces in your home with disinfectants to remove or kill staph bacteria.

Stay away from triggers.",How to Recognize Hives (Rash)," Hives may begin as an itchy or stinging area on your skin. If you begin to notice itching, stinging or pain on any parts of your skin with or without a specific cause, it may be hives and you could develop welts.Keep an eye on any itchy or stinging spots for a few days and see if any hives develop. If nothing happens, you may have a bug bite or another condition that caused temporary itching.;
, Any itching, stinging or pain may quickly turn into welts, which are also known as wheals.You may have individual welt or they may get bigger, spread, and join to form larger patterns of welts or wheals. Welts may be red or skin-colored.Be aware that welts and wheals can appear on any part of your body.They can also change shape and disappear within minutes or hours. Some welts may have a roughly oval shape or be shaped like a worm. They can range in size from a few millimeters to several inches across.See if you have any swelling of the surface of your skin with clearly defined edges, which is a clear sign of hives.

, If you have red welts, press the center of them. If they turn white, this is called blanching. Blanching is a clear sign that you have hives instead of another skin condition.Use gentle pressure when checking for blanching. Pressing too hard may cause swelling or inflammation., Angioedema is a condition that is similar to hives, but it develops in the deeper layers of your skin. It may even occur at the same time as hives; however, there are some differences between the two skin reactions. Knowing what these are can help you get proper care for either condition.Look for angioedema around your eyes, cheeks, or lips. Angioedema most commonly appears in these places.
Examine the appearance of any welts you have. If they are large, thick, and firm, they are likely angioedema instead of hives.
Feel your welts for pain or warmth, both of which are signs of angioedema.

, If you detect hives, they may present on one part of your body or be more widespread. Hives may also always appear on the same spot of your body. Watching the pattern of welts and wheals on your body can help you identify the cause.You may have:


Localized hives, which present on one specific part of your body. These hives are generally caused by direct skin contact with food, pet saliva and fur, pollen or plants.Widespread hives, which present all over your body. These hives can be a reaction to a viral infection. They may also be caused by an allergic reaction to food, medication, or an insect bite.
Acute hives, which are short-lived.Most acute hives will go away within 24 hours.Chronic hives, which may occur daily for more than six weeks. Each hive will last for less than 24 hours, but others will reappear in different spots., Exposure to different substances may cause hives. Figuring out what may have caused your hives can help you get proper treatment and avoid a more serious reaction in the future — each exposure may increase the intensity of the allergic reaction, especially if a food or medicine is the culprit.The following may cause hives:


Foods such as shellfish, fish, nuts, milk, and eggsMedications including penicillin, aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen and blood pressure drugs
Common allergens such as pollen, animal dander, latex, and insect bites
Environmental factors including heat, cold, sunlight, water, pressure on the skin, emotional stress, anxiety, and exercise
Underlying medical conditions such as lupus, blood transfusions, lymphoma, hepatitis, HIV, and the Epstein-Barr virus

, Hives are a very common skin condition. Some people are at an increased risk of developing hives. You may be more susceptible to hives if you:Have had hives in the past
Have had other allergic reactions
Have a condition associated with hives including lupus, lymphoma and thyroid disease
Have a family history of hives.

, If your hives don’t respond to self-care measures or are severe and uncomfortable, call your doctor to schedule an appointment. Your doctor may prescribe medication for your hives or any underlying conditions which may cause them.If you experience angioedema symptoms, a new cough, or a scratchy throat along with the hives, those can be signs the reaction is more serious and you need prompt medical attention.
Let your doctor know when your hives started and anything you think may have caused them. Tell your doctor any self-care measures you’ve taken as well. Answer any questions your doctor may have for you.Make sure you mention any food allergies, as some medications and immunizations have food derivatives (such as eggs in flu shots), and should be avoided if you are allergic.
Follow any instructions your doctor gives you, including taking prescription medication to relieve the hives. Your doctor may prescribe antihistamines, corticosteroids, autoimmune drugs, or blood protein controllers to relieve your hives., If your hives are only on one part of your body, wash the area with soap and water. This can relieve the hives and any discomfort. It may also keep your hives from getting worse.Use a soap of your choice to remove the allergen. Wash the area thoroughly with cool water, which can further soothe your skin. Make sure to rinse the area thoroughly so that none of the allergen remains on your skin. Pat your skin dry with a clean towel to avoid irritating it.

, If your hives are more widespread, sit in a cool bath for a few minutes. It can soothe redness and irritation as well as reduce inflammation.Add a few sprinkles of baking soda, uncooked oatmeal, or colloidal oatmeal. These can further soothe itchy and inflamed skin.
Stay in the bath for 10 – 15 minutes. Any longer and you might get too cold., Hives often come with intense itching and inflammation. Gently rubbing a calamine lotion or non-prescription anti-itch cream can soothe itching and inflammation. It may also relieve your hives.Purchase either calamine lotion or a nonprescription hydrocortisone, or anti-itch cream. Get an anti-itch cream that is at least 1% hydrocortisone.Put on the calamine or hydrocortisone to the affected area once a day after you bathe.

, If your hives are widespread, take an antihistamine. It can block the histamine that is causing your hives and relieve itching and inflammation.Be aware that antihistamines can cause drowsiness.Follow dosing instructions on the following anti-histamines for optimal effects:


Loratadine (Claritin)
Cetirizine (Zyrtec)
Diphenhydramine (Benadryl, others)

, The itching and inflammation associated with hives are a result of histamine in your blood. Apply a cold pack or cool, wet compresses to alleviate itching and inflammation. This can also prevent you from scratchingCover your hives with compresses for 10 to 15 minutes. You can apply them every two hours or as needed., Even though hives can be very itchy, it’s important to not scratch them. It can spread allergen over a larger area of your skin and make symptoms worse. It can also lead to other problems such as a skin infection., Some types of clothing can irritate hives. You can prevent and relieve itching and inflammation by wearing loose clothing that has a smooth texture. Clothing that covers your hives may also protect your skin from triggers and relieve symptoms.Choose clothing made of cotton or merino wool. This can prevent scratching and excess sweating, both of which may make your hives worse.Consider long-sleeved shirts and long pants to protect your skin from external irritants.

, Hives often develop as a result of an allergen or specific irritant. If you know what your trigger is, try and avoid it. If you don’t, rule out the cause by limiting exposure to suspected triggers.Remember that your trigger could be an allergen such as pet dander, a food allergy, a topical product such as detergent, or an environmental factor like sunlight.Limit your exposure to suspected triggers. If this relieves your hives, you’ve likely found your specific trigger. Keeping track of things such as what you eat, wear, cleanse with, and are exposed can help you point out your triggers.Be aware that sun exposure, stress, sweat, and temperature changes can cause and exacerbate hives.Wash with mild or “hypoallergenic” soaps and detergents. These have fewer chemicals that may cause hives or make them worse.

Be aware of other infections.",How to Treat Jock Itch With Sudocrem," Jock itch typically consists of a red, circular rash found on or underneath your groin, in your inner thighs and/or buttocks. It typically occurs in areas of the body that retain moisture from sweat.Jock itch gets its common name from athletes, who often sweat frequently in this area of the body.
You do not have to be an athlete, however, in order to get it. Many studies have shown that overweight patients sometimes suffer from jock itch due to sweat as well.;
, If you have a red, irritated rash, you might be tempted not to wash it, but you should clean it before applying any ointment. While taking a shower or bath, apply a gentle, hydrating cleanser to the area.


Gently apply the cleanser to wet skin with your fingertips. Avoid using thick washcloths or a loofah as these can irritate the bumps on the rash.Use a thick, creamy cleanser on the area, such as a milky body wash or face wash. A gel-based cleanser might be too drying.
If you are using a bar soap, you can also apply this directly to the skin.
Avoid cleansers with exfoliating agents in them, such as salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide (typically found in face washes for acne). These will only further irritate the layer of skin affected by the rash.
Do not shave the area while you are cleansing it. This will only cause painful irritation and could transfer bacteria from your razor to the infected skin.Make sure you have thoroughly removed all of the soap from the groin area before leaving the shower.

, After you get out of the shower or bath, be sure to thoroughly dry the area with a clean towel. Pat the area gently with the towel. Do not rub harshly as this could cause further pain.


It is very important that the towel is clean and dry. Damp towels are often traps for mold and mildew, which could further irritate your rash.If you can wait a few minutes to let the area around your groin air dry, that will help ensure the Sudocrem is most effective when it is applied.

, If you have handled anything besides your clean towel since washing the groin, then wash your hands again with warm water and antibacterial soap. Dry them with a clean towel., Sudocrem can come in tube or jar form. If you have jar packaging, you may want to use a plastic mini-spatula to scoop out the cream and place it on your fingers. This will reduce the risk of contaminating the cream in the jar from bacteria on your fingers.

, Use light, circular motions to apply it. Do not rub it harshly; allow it time to absorb into the skin., You should use enough cream that it substantially covers the rash, but not so much that it can't absorb into the skin.


The cream should absorb so you can no longer see the white color of the cream. If you can still see the thick, creamy substance on your skin, you have applied too much.Wait a couple minutes before putting on underwear so the cream has a chance to fully absorb. It should create a barrier between your rash and any clothing you are wearing.

, It is very important that you wear clean clothes as dirty underwear and pants can contain bacteria that will only make the rash worse.Be sure to wear undergarments that are breathable and won't cause you to sweat more in the groin. Avoid polyester or other constricting fabrics. Instead, use simple cotton boxers or panties.

, If you have been sweating during the day, wash the area again before you reapply.

, Most forms of jock itch are responsive to over-the-counter treatments and will clear up within 10 days.If the rash persists for more than two weeks, talk to your doctor about other forms of treatment. You might need a stronger antifungal cream than is available without a prescription. Or you might need to take antifungal medicine orally., Bacteria that is trapped in dirty pants, shorts or underwear can cause fungal infections on your skin.Wash clothes with a gentle laundry detergent and in a washing machine/dryer. Avoid harsh bleaches or fabric softeners as these can irritate the skin.
Be sure to wash your gym or athletic clothes frequently because they can retain sweat.
Make sure you clothing is comfortable and fits properly, especially your underwear. Clothing that chafes or makes the skin raw could leave you vulnerable to an infection.
Do not share clothing as it is possible to pass the infection through clothing.

, Sweat that is trapped in the groin is the key culprit behind jock itch. If you sweat frequently during the day, be sure to shower or bathe regularly.You might also consider applying antibacterial wipes to the area around the inner thigh and groin during the day if you sweat frequently. Be sure to follow up with a dry towel to remove any moisture left by the wipes.

, If you use a jock strap or athletic cup, be sure to wash and clean these items frequently. Follow the instructions on the package of the product in order to prevent the growth of a fungal infection., If you constantly suffer from jock itch, consider applying antifungal creams every day after showering. If you want to try something besides Sudocrem, look into Lotrimin (or any cream with the ingredient clotrimazole) and Hydrocortisone. These are specially designed to take down rashes and relieve irritation., Sometimes, jock itch occurs alongside other fungal infections such as ringworm or athlete's foot. If you have these other conditions, talk to your doctor about the best ways to treat them."

Buy a back scratcher.,
Wrap a coarse cloth around a spatula.,
Use water in the shower.,
Scratch your back against a rough surface.,
Use a hairbrush.",How to Scratch Your Back2," Many beauty salons, supermarkets, and cosmetic stores sell back scratchers. These are devices designed to help scratch hard-to-reach places on your back. They are usually long wooden rods with somewhat sharpened edges designed to alleviate itch.


Depending on your type of back scratcher, you may want to avoid using it on bare skin. If your back scratcher has very sharp edges, for example, it may be harsh on bare skin.
As with regular itching, avoid overusing your back scratcher. This can result in an itch worsening. If your itch is due to a rash, scratching it too much can actually make the itch worse.

, If you're having trouble reaching your back, you can make a back scratcher with a coarse cloth and a spatula. Simply wrap a coarse cloth or rag around a spatula. If necessary, tie a rubber band around the rag to secure. You can use this device to scratch the middle of your back.One advantage of using a rag is that it may be gentler on your back than your fingernails or a conventional back scratcher.
You can also apply anti-itch cream or moisturizer to the middle of your back by dabbing some on the rag before use., If you have a removable nozzle in your shower, you can use this to scratch your back. Turn the water on a high pressure setting and spray the itchy area on your back. This may alleviate some of the itch.


Cold water can actually help alleviate itch, so consider turning the water down to a cooler setting before spraying down your back., If a handheld backscratcher isn't cutting it, you can scratch your back against a rough surface. For example, scratch your back against a bumpy wall, a tree, the carpet, the corner of a wall, and so on. This should help alleviate some of your back itch.


Be careful when using this method. If you're scratching your back outside, keep your clothing on to avoid exposing yourself to any bacteria or toxins. A brick wall of a building, for example, can be incredibly dirty.

, You can also use a hairbrush to scratch your back. A paddle brush may work best as its design is somewhat similar to a back scratcher. Simply grab the handle of a brush, place the brush behind your back, and maneuver the hairbrush until you scratch your itch.


If your back is sweaty, you may want to rinse out the hairbrush if you used it on bare skin.
If you're using someone else's hairbrush, make sure to ask them first.

Use a cool, wet compress.,
Take an oatmeal bath.,
Be careful with products that have contact with your skin.,
Watch out for an allergic reaction.",How to Scratch Your Back3," Exposing an itch to cold temperatures is actually much more effective than scratching.

Cover it with a cloth or paper towel before applying it to your skin.If you can't reach the itchy spot, consider taking a cold bath or shower.
Follow up with a moisturizing lotion.

, Oatmeal can help alleviate itch for many. Fill a tub with lukewarm water and sprinkle about a handful of oatmeal into the water. For the best effects, grind the oatmeal in the blender ahead of time. You can also purchase colloidal oatmeal, finely ground oatmeal specifically sold for oatmeal baths, at a local drugstore or beauty shop. Soak for about 20 minutes., Soaps, perfumes, laundry detergents, and shampoos can all cause skin irritation. This can lead to itching. Go for mild soap and detergents and, when possible, unscented varieties. See if this results in less itchiness., If you notice itchiness, warmness, redness, or swelling after using a new skin care product, cease use immediately. You may be having an allergic reaction. Hopefully, the reaction will clear up on its own. If symptoms persist after a few days, or get worse, seek medical care.Scratching an itch can usually make it worse, but especially so if you have an allergic reaction. Make sure you avoid scratching your back if you suspect you're experiencing allergies.

Identify the itching spot.,
Try a moisturizer or an alternative to scratching.,
Scratch in slow, circular motions.",How to Scratch2," In the broad majority of cases, it will be very easy to figure out where you need to scratch. Other times, it may actually take some time before you're able to pinpoint. If you're having trouble figuring out where the itch is on your body, take a few seconds to relax and get in touch with your body. Scratching lightly in big circles should help you find the spot quickly enough.

, While some occasional light scratching isn't usually a problem, it's still preferable to try other things first. An itch is most often the symptom of an underlying problem, most often dry skin. Moisturizing your skin with an emollient may remove the need for scratching to begin with. Give the itchy area some moisture, and see if the itching stops. It may well be that your skin was simply trying to tell you something all along! Use a wet compress if you have an irritated area. Put a clean hand towel in a bowl of warm water and several drops of essential oils. Wring it out and apply to the afflicted area. You should feel a sensation of pleasant relief within several seconds. Other mild itching may go away within seconds if left unattended.
As a general rule, drinking a lot of water throughout the day will help to keep the rest of your body hydrated.

, When it comes time to actually scratch, it's important to keep your scratching limited to small, slow and steady circular movements. Keep your touch light and gentle. Scratch on and around the itchy area. Within a few seconds, the itch should go away.


As with most things, it's best to keep your scratching within moderation. Anything more than a light scratch could actually exacerbate the scratch you're trying to solve!
Limit yourself to scratching sessions of 30 seconds maximum.

"

Maintain open communication.,
Find the itchy spot.,
Scratch in a very gentle, circular motion.",How to Scratch3," If you're going to try to scratch someone else's itch for them, the most important way to ensure success to keep talking to them. Understand exactly where they want to be scratched, and how. Everyone's skin tolerance is a bit different, so it's best to start gentle and adjust depending on the way they respond.

, As with itching yourself, this is usually a straightforward step. However, when you're scratching someone else, it again requires some communication to find where you should be itching. This will arguably require more effort on the part of your partner, who will need to cautiously direct your movements.


If you're having any difficulty with finding the spot, you can play the 'hot/cold' game; the person will say 'hotter' if you're getting closer to the afflicted area. Likewise, the person will say 'colder' if you're getting further away from it.

, Unless you already know your partner's scratching preferences, it's best to stay as gentle as you can at first. Much as if you were scratching yourself, you should stick to a slow and concentrated scratch. While you're scratching the person, you should remain just as alert regarding their signs. Are they enjoying it? Are they in pain? It is always better to be too gentle than too rough, so be safe at first and increase the intensity at the partner's discretion.


At the same time, don't be afraid to get more intense! Your partner's skin could very well be tougher than yours, so you shouldn't be shy about digging in slightly more than you normally would.

Look for redness.,
Identify blisters.,
Watch the blisters for scabbing.",How to Recognize Shingles Symptoms (Herpes Zoster Symptoms)2," After the initial feeling of pain, itching, tingling, numbness, or sensitivity, look for a red rash to develop on that area of your skin. This usually occurs a few days after the initial discomfort.Some people get the feeling of burning or pain and never develop the shingles rash.

, The shingles rash forms blisters (or vesicles), which are small painful swellings in the skin filled with fluid. Shingles blisters generally appear in a group in a single area on the body.


Do not touch or scratch your blisters – the fluid in the blisters contains the virus, and you can spread infection to other areas of your body. Keep your blisters covered and wash your hands often to minimize the risk of spreading the virus.

, Shingles blisters usually crust over and form scabs 7-10 days after they appear. These should clear up in about 2-4 weeks, and the scabs should fall off. Do not pull these off yourself, let it occur naturally."

Realize that anyone who has had chickenpox can get shingles.,
Recall whether you’ve been exposed to VZV.,
Recognize if you’re high risk for infection.,
Talk to your doctor about getting the shingles vaccine, if you are over 60.",How to Recognize Shingles Symptoms (Herpes Zoster Symptoms)3," There’s a common myth that if you’ve had chickenpox once, you can never get it again. Unfortunately, because VZV stays in your body the rest of your life, this simply isn’t true – though once you’ve had chickenpox, the virus usually returns as shingles. Even children can develop shingles if they’re exposed to the virus.


Most people only get shingles once, but it is possible to develop an outbreak of shingles multiple times throughout your life., The Shingles virus is not sexually transmitted or spread through sneezing or coughing. Rather, it is transmitted by touching the shingles blisters or fluid from the blisters.If you have been around someone in the blister-phase of the infection, you should wash your hands thoroughly; avoid touching anyone else’s rash.


A person is not contagious before the blisters appear or once the blisters have crusted over completely.
Keeping the blisters covered lowers the risk of transmitting the virus.
If you have never had chickenpox and come in contact with someone with shingles, you can get VZV – but you’ll get chickenpox, not shingles. (However, you can then get shingles later in life.), Most cases of shingles occur in adults over the age of 60. You are also at higher risk of getting shingles if you have a weakened immune system. This may be due to:Cancer treatment with chemotherapy or radiation
Lymphoma or leukemia
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome)
Taking immunosuppressive medications like steroids or drugs given after an organ transplant

, If you are 60 years old or over, you should get the shingles vaccine to reduce your risk of contracting the disease.Being unvaccinated after age 60 is a risk-factor for most people. Talk to your doctor if you have any concerns about whether the shingles vaccine is right for you."

See your doctor soon if you think that you are having a shingles outbreak.,
Seek care immediately if the rash is widespread or is near your eye.,
Get treated as soon as possible if you’re over 70 or immunocompromised.",How to Recognize Shingles Symptoms (Herpes Zoster Symptoms)4," There are a number of anti-viral medicines that you can take to reduce the severity of an outbreak, but they be need to be started quickly for maximum effect.


Some common medications used are acyclovir (Zovirax), valacyclovir (Valtrex), and famciclovir (Famvir).Pain medications can help with the painful symptoms of shingles, but these should be prescribed by your doctor.

, Everyone with shingles should see a doctor to prevent complications. However, get care as soon as possible if the rash shows up around or near your eye. Leaving this untreated can cause blindness. Also talk to your doctor immediately if your rash covers large areas of your body and is painful., The older you are when you are affected by shingles, the higher your risk of developing serious complications. Those over 70 are at a greatly increased risk. The same is true if you have a weak immune system from disease or medications.If you get shingles and someone else in your household is elderly or immunocompromised it is very important that you’re treated immediately to reduce their chance of getting the virus.

Avoid situations that lead to sweating.,
Avoid strenuous exercise in hot and humid weather.,
Wear lightweight and loose-fitting clothing.,
Drink plenty of water.",How to Prevent Skin Rashes1," Heat rash develops when the sweat ducts in your skin get clogged. When this happens, instead of evaporating, sweat gets trapped beneath the skin and leads to skin rash.Heat rash occurs most often in hot and humid conditions.
Keep your body dry by avoiding outdoors during the hottest time of the day.
Use an air conditioner.
Take a shower to cool down or apply cool, wet towels over overheated areas.;
, The heat emitted from your body coupled with the warm weather is likely to cause rashes around certain parts of the body with the most sweat glands, such as around the armpits.Instead of exercising outside during hot weather, go to an air conditioned gym.
Take a cool shower immediately after exercising.

, Clothes that fit snugly are likely to irritate the skin and cause rashes by trapping heat emitting from the body.Allow your skin to breathe and wear light, loose clothing. This goes for babies, too. Don't over-dress or bundle up your baby in hot weather.
The exception is during exercise. Wearing fitted exercise clothing that is designed to wick away sweat and excess moisture can help prevent heat rash, especially during very active exercise such as cycling and running.

, Your body requires water to function properly and what is lost during sweating needs to be replenished.Drink water throughout the day to prevent dehydration.
Drink at least two to four glasses (16-32 ounces) of cool fluids each hour.

Absolutely do not clean your face with dirty hands or a used towel. Towels rub your skin and make pimples worse.Use a gentle non-soap facial cleanser that dissolves during washing.Cetaphil is a good, inexpensive, and mild cleanser you can try.
Avoid washing with soap or astringents, which will dry out your skin.Do not scrub or abrade your skin, as that can irritate it and provoke acne. Avoid abrasive products, such as scrubs that contain ground fruit pits or aluminum oxide.;
, Keeping your hair clean will help prevent facial acne. Hair is naturally oily, and it gets oilier if it's unwashed. If you haven't had a chance to wash your hair, wear it pulled back from your face.


Shower after you sweat. Sweat that stays on your skin, or gets trapped against your skin by tight workout clothes, can feed bacteria., Use oil-free makeups, lotions, sunscreens, and other skin products. Products with oil can clog your pores. Pick products that are water-based rather than alcohol or oil based. The labels ""noncomedogenic"" and ""non-acnegenic"" mean oil-free.Clean your hands and skin before applying products.
Remove makeup at bedtime. Though noncomedogenic cosmetics won't necessarily cause breakouts, they are more likely to clog your pores if you keep them on constantly.Throw out old cosmetics and clean your brushes every two weeks with soapy water., Apply an oil-free moisturizer with sunscreen every day, and avoid sunbathing or tanning. Sun can make acne worse in many cases, and if you are using an acne medication you may be more sensitive to sunlight.According to the American Academy of Dermatology it is recommended that you use a broad spectrum sunscreen with UVA and UVB coverage, SPF of at least 30, and water-resistant. About 1 ounce (enough to fill a shot glass) is the amount considered needed to cover the exposed areas of the body.Some antibiotics that people are on for acne (including tetracycline) cause you to be more sensitive to sunlight.

, Touching your face, or picking at problem areas, can trigger a breakout. Avoid resting your phone on your face, as it comes into contact with many things and may carry bacteria.If you wear a hijab, a hoodie, or other fabrics close to your face, change them daily.
Keep anything that touches an acne-prone part of your body clean. Wash your pillowcase every few days, or more if you use hairspray or have oily hair.

Wash your hands frequently. After wetting hands and applying soap, rub hands together for at least 20 seconds (or the time it takes to sing ""Happy Birthday"" twice). Be sure to rinse thoroughly with warm water. Dry hands using a paper towel or air dryer.
Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer when soap and water aren't accessible. After applying the sanitizer, rub hands together until they are dry. Be sure to to apply product to all surfaces of the hand including in between fingers.
In some public places, such as hospitals and nursing homes, there is often a sanitary station where you can keep your hands clean. These are usually foam-based sanitizers which sometimes have moisturizer in them, too. Utilize these stations when you can.;
, Although washing hands often helps reduce skin infections, it can also lead to dry skin. Dry skin may result in cracks in the skin, which can allow bacteria to enter the cut. Use a moisturizing lotion often to prevent cracks and peeling of the skin.


Avoid lotions that have a long list of ingredients including many perfumes and fragrances. Plain moisturizers such as petroleum jelly work best.
As a rule of thumb, creamy moisturizers tend to have more preservatives so grease-based moisturizes tend to be more effective.

, Some germs can survive on surfaces anywhere from hours to days.By avoiding skin-to-skin contact with surfaces like locker room floors and doorknobs, you can decrease your chance of coming into contact with infectious germs.


Clean or use a barrier (like gloves or napkins) when touching overly-exposed surfaces. Items like restroom doors, restaurants menus, and cell phones are full of bacteria.Avoiding direct contact with such items can reduce the spread of germs.
Sanitize surface areas often by using household disinfectants or wipes such as Lysol.

, Even though people are taught from a young age that ""sharing is caring,"" sharing personal hygiene items or items that come into contact with bodily fluids can often lead to the transmission of germs.


Personal hygiene products always contain germs. Avoid sharing items like make-up, hair brushes, towels, and deodorant. Never share toothbrushes or razors.
Sharing drinks and eating utensils easily spreads saliva which is a common host of germs.

, The most common fungal skin infection is athlete's foot, the most common bacterial skin infection is staph, and the most common viral skin infections include herpes simplex (cold sores) and rashes accompanied by viral infections. Knowing the differences between the various types of infections can help you to know the causes of each and how to avoid them.


Fungal infections come from airborne organisms and typically start off in the lungs or skin. Athlete's foot, yeast infections, and ringworms are examples of common fungal infections. Athlete's foot is contagious and can be spread through contaminated floors, towels, and clothing.
Bacteria is not always bad; in fact, bacteria is naturally found in the human body and less than 1% has the ability to make people sick. It is the ""bad"" strains of bacteria (such as Streptococcus or Staphylococcus) which causes skin infections like Cellulitis, Erysipelas and Impetigo.However, skin infections can also spread to your joints, bones, or blood. Additionally, you should be careful if anyone you know has MRSA, which is a resistant bacterial infection.
Viral infections are caused by organisms that are small containers with genetic material within.They invade healthy cells, reproduce, and eventually kill the cell to make you sick. Common skin infections caused by viruses include chickenpox, cold sores, measles, and rubella. There are currently no vaccinations for cold sores, so be aware if you come across this infection.

, Those who are constantly around warm and moist conditions (such as athletes) are more susceptible to infections. Also, people with weakened immune systems (such as those with diabetes, cancer, or HIV) are more likely to have a skin infection.


Many athletes report infection because bacteria tends to thrive in warm and moist areas. Avoid infection by washing frequently, sanitizing shared spaces and equipment, and laundering uniforms after each use. For example, athlete's foot typically occurs as a result of your sweaty feet being confined in tight-fitting shoes.
Those who have conditions which lower the strength of their immune system are more susceptible to infection because their body cannot produce enough of an immune response to the bacteria and viruses to fight infection. Follow the same tips to prevent infection but also take additional precautions such as wearing shoes, keeping raw foods away from prepared foods, and avoiding pet waste.

, Fungal infections usually take the form of ""athletes foot"" because fungus tends to shed spores and the most common place for this to occur is in shoes.Keeping your feet and shoes clean and dry, and avoiding going barefoot can assist in reducing infections.


Keep your feet as cool and dry as possible. Change socks often, and wear shoes that breathe easily like leather as opposed to plastic.
Avoid walking barefoot, especially on shared public surfaces such as at the gym or the pool. Instead, wear slippers or place towels on the floor.
Practice good toe hygiene, such as clipping toenails straight across and avoiding ingrown toenails. Avoid sharing clippers and other manicuring products.

, When skin is damaged, bacteria can cause infection through untreated cuts and scrapes. Quickly clean and dress damaged skin to avoid infection. Also, use sunblock and lotion as often as possible to avoid damaging skin.


Wash lacerations with soap and rinse thoroughly with water to clean the area. Use tweezers to remove any foreign debris like dirt. Be sure to not apply too much pressure to avoid pushing germs into the cut.
Apply an antiseptic or antibiotic ointment to the abrasion and the surrounding area of skin. This may destroy any bacteria and prevent skin infections from developing.
Cover an open sore or cut with a bandage to keep it clean and dry and to prevent bacteria or fungus from entering the open wound. Change the bandage as needed if it becomes dirty or wet.
Skin is more susceptible to bacterial infections when damaged by sunburn, inflammation, or scratching so taking the necessary precautions to prevent skin damage can assist in decreasing your chances of bacterial skin infection.
Make sure that you're always up to date on your tetanus shots.

, The immune system is a network of cells, tissues, and organs that work together to protect the body.When your immune system is weakened, your body is more susceptible to all infections, especially viral infections. By getting the proper amount of rest and nutrients you can avoid viral infections.


Ensure the proper mix of nutrients. If you don't get enough vitamins and minerals through diet, take a multivitamin that is high in nutrients like vitamin C and D.
Get your rest. Though it sounds simple, resting allows your body and immune system to revamp and recharge, being better capable to fight viral infections. Try to get between 7 and 9 hours of sleep every night.

, It is important to know what type of infection may be present because various infections are treated in different manners. Fungal infections can be treated with over-the-counter creams, bacterial infections usually require prescription antibiotics, and viral infections typically can't be cured with medication.

, Fungal infections are typically treated with OTC topical creams such as Lotrimin or Lamisil, or by oral medications if the infection is severe or affects hair-bearing areas.

, Bacterial infections are usually treated by antibiotic medications that can be prescribed by a medical professional such as a doctor or dentist.


The feared complication of bacterial infections of the skin is MRSA, a resistant bacterial species. If you contract a MRSA skin infection, you will need to be admitted to the hospital and given IV antibiotics.

, It is difficult to treat viral infections because they live inside the cells of your body. They don't react to medicines. There are only a few viral infection medications on the market today. The best course of action is to prevent these infections with immunizations (for example, getting a flu shot ahead of time).

, Different skin conditions require different forms of treatment. While some can be treated with over-the-counter drugs, others require prescription medication. Always visit your doctor to discuss treatment options for areas which seem to be infected.


Visit a doctor when you experience warmth, redness, pain, or swelling of skin. This can be a sign of cellulitis, which occurs when the infection begins to spread and inflame the lymphatic ducts.Left untreated, it can infect the bloodstream.
Visit a doctor if your infection develops into pus-filled blisters.
See a doctor if fever accompanies your irritated skin.

Try non-natural treatment.,
Consider hydroxyurea.,
Ask about phototherapy.",How to Naturally Stop Granuloma Annulare," Take a liquid vitamin E caplet, snip off one end, and squeeze the liquid onto the rash. Massage it in gently and reapply daily.;
, There are a number of herbs that work in a way that is similar to NSAIDs because they block the same set of enzymes and can reduce inflammation. These herbs have been safely recommended for topical use.You can mix certain anti-inflammatory herbs with oils to make a rub that you can massage into the rash twice a day for 4 weeks. These herbs include turmeric, scutellaria or skullcap, ginger, boswellia, and white willow bark.


To make a paste for your skin, take 4 teaspoons of the dried and powdered herb and mix with 4 tablespoons of olive oil. Make more if larger areas of your body are affected. Store in a dark jar in a cool place.
Always check with a knowledgeable healthcare practitioner before using any of these recommendations. It is always best to ensure that nothing interacts with your treatment plan.Turmeric can turn your skin a bit orange, but is one of the most effective anti-inflammatory herbs known., Avocado is a rich source of vitamin E. This is likely the reason of the reported success of the avocado paste. To make the paste, mash an avocado and mix with enough olive oil to make a paste. Apply it gently to the affected skin.


Leave it on for 30-40 minutes, then rinse the area clean. Repeat daily., The aloe vera plant contains a natural gel that has a soothing effect and can reduce the itch and pain that comes with GA. The gel has the ability to reach deeper skin layers, directly easing the inflammation and enhancing the healing of skin wounds that arise from GA rashes and bumps.


If you have a whole plant, cut it down the center with a knife to get the gel out, then apply it directly on your rash. Keep the rest of the plant in the fridge to be used later.
The gel that comes from your local pharmacy can be used as well. Just slather it on the area generously and let it soak into your skin., Coconut oil can be applied to the skin affected by GA or it can be taken orally. A typical oral dose of coconut oil is 1 Tbsp three times daily.Coconut oil has antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal, and antiparasitic properties. This makes it a good option for conditions such as GA which have an unclear cause.

, There are a few other topical treatments that have been seen to have positive results with GA. Mix 1/2 cup of apple cider vinegar with 4 drops of tea tree oil. Use a cotton ball or cloth to apply daily. You can also crush a clove of garlic and apply it to the affected area.


Keep the garlic on the affected area for 30 minutes, then rinse off. You can re-apply once a day. This works best on small areas of the skin.
If after 4 weeks of using these treatments, there is no change in your GA, see your physician again to determine of more treatment is recommended., Just like its topical use, ginger can be ingested to help with your GA as well. Ginger has a strong anti-inflammatory, antiseptic, and antibacterial effects. Try adding it to your meals by eating the root raw, adding it into recipes, or using the ginger powder in rubs and marinades.


You can also drink it in your tea or with your milk by adding as much as you think is necessary to get a pleasant taste., Just as with ginger, turmeric has powerful anti-inflammatory effects. It contains curcumin as one of its active ingredients, which is considered one of the strongest antioxidant and detoxifying substances there is. It can reduce the rash and itchiness sensation as well as preventing bacterial infections as well.


Turmeric powder can be drank in warm teas like ginger. It can also be added like any spice to zest up your meals.
Curmurin blocks the COX-II enzyme responsible for releasing prostaglandin, which is an inflammatory chemical, making turmeric a triple threat because it is an anti-inflammatory, antiseptic, and antibacterial spice., Boswellia serrata is made from the gum of the Indian olibanum tree. It is a very good anti-inflammatory drug and helps limit the production of leukotrienes that are found in leukocytes, which are unsaturated fatty acids that are released during allergic reactions. The standard extract dosage is 2-8 grams of resin per day.


Stop taking boswellia after 8 to 12 weeks. The safety of taking the herb internally for longer periods is currently unknown.
Boswellia topical cream can also be used for treatment of GA., Green tea has been linked to healing properties when consumed on a regular basis. Try drinking green tea at least twice a day daily. Afterwards, use the filters containing the green tea leaves as compresses for your skin. Also consider taking a green tea supplement in tablet form.


The direct application of green tea to the bumps can sooth them and reduce the burning sensation. This effect happens due to green tea's flavonoids called catechins. They are antioxidants that detoxify any harmful substances, including toxins and free radicals, that can trigger or spread your skin rash. Green tea also is reported to have anti-inflammatory effects that can reduce the irritation of the itchy spots., Rheum rhabarbarum contains beta-carotene, which helps fight infection and promote healing. Beta-carotene also helps in autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. Because the skin symptoms of these diseases are similar, it is thought that it may help in GA as well.


You may apply grated rheum as a poultice on the rash for 15 minutes and then wash it off. You may do this 2-3 times a week for as long as needed., Yarrow powder is also a very good drug for blood purification. It also has antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and wound healing properties.The application of yarrow powder as a paste to the lesions should be helpful. Mix the powder with enough water to make it a paste. Leave it on the area for 15 minutes or so and wash off with a mild soap and water.


A 4.5 g dose of yarrow herb can be taken daily. However, there are not many clinical studies to validate this dose., Spirulina is a good immunomodulator and is used as a common supplement to skin related symptoms. This is because it is packed with vitamins, amino acids, and chlorophyll. Due to these properties, this natural algae might help in curtailing the autoimmune reaction that produces GA.


A typical daily dose of spirulina is 2,000 to 3,000 milligrams, usually consumed in four to six portions of 500 milligrams each. The effects of spirulina can be seen even in weak doses, which are around 800 mg.
It can be taken with a glass of water or along with fruit or vegetable juice. Do not use spirulina for more than 3 weeks consecutively.If you see no results or changes after 4 weeks of using these treatments, consult your doctor again to see if more treatment is recommended., There are three main forms of GA that you may suffer from. The most common form is localized granuloma annulare. It is characterized by skin-colored or reddish lesions up to 2 inches or 5 cm in diameter. The bumps may form rings or may be solitary. Localized GA tends to be found on the feet, the ankles, the lower limbs, and the wrists.Other form of the condition is called generalized GA, which occurs most commonly in adults. It usually involves the torso, but the rings or bumps can be found on the neck, extremities, face, scalp, palms, and soles of the feet. The rash can include widespread bumps, ring-shaped rashes, and large areas of discolored skin. The rashes usually range in color from a yellowish tone to a reddish color.You may also need to treat subcutaneous GA, which is the form that occurs most commonly in children 2-10 years old. With this form of GA, firm bumps or masses are felt deep in the skin. Individual bumps or masses can measure from very small to up to 1.5 inches in diameter and are most common on the knees, ankles, tops of the feet, buttocks, hands, scalp, and eyelids.There are two rare forms of GA. Perforating GA is a very rare form that is usually found on the back of the hands and fingers, may be found on the trunk or the arms and legs, and can often form scars. Accurate dermal erythema is another rare form of GA that can form large rings with a central clear area., There are certain groups of people the GA attacks more often. Women are affected twice as often as men, though researchers are not sure why. Children and those under the age of 30 are more commonly affected than those who are older in age. The cause of any form of GA is unknown. However, some things can trigger the condition, such as the development of various infections, getting bites from either animals or insects, taking PPD skin tests for tuberculosis, receiving vaccinations, and exposing yourself to the sun.


The underlying mechanism in GA is thought to be immune in nature., Typically, the doctor will use a visual examination to diagnosis GA. There are some cases, however, where a small sample of skin may be taken as a biopsy for microscopic examination.


There is evidence that the reaction which causes the rash is based on a delayed hypersensitivity reaction involving specialized immune cells.Because of the shape of the rash, GA can sometimes be confused with ringworm. However, your doctor will do a simple lab test and visual inspection to distinguish between the two conditions., Most often, GA disappears on its own within 2 years, though it usually disappears within 3-4 months. In some cases, however, other treatments may be recommended. These include topical or injected steroids at the site of the rash, and various medicines such as dapsone, retinoids, antimalarial drugs, tacrolimus, and pimecrolimus.


Cryotherapy, which is a treatment where the skin is frozen with liquid nitrogen or nitrous oxide, is sometimes suggested., Some cases of long-term GA (lasting over 10 years) were cured by exposure to 500 mg of hydroxyurea twice per day for several months. Hydroxyurea is a chemotherapeutic agent that suppresses immune cells. It should be used only under a doctor’s close supervision so that she can ensure that the therapy does not overly affect bone marrow growth., This is a fairly new treatment option, but there is evidence to suggest that GA can be improved by exposing areas of skin affected by GA to narrow-band UVB light (light rays that are between 280-325 nanometers and which cause sunburn but not deeper skin damage).A similar light-based treatment is low-level laser therapy with different colored laser beams. The color of the laser beam determines the depth of skin penetration, which can help target the specific area of skin that is affected by the GA."

Keep skin folds clean and dry.,
Apply a barrier cream.,
Wear loose-fitting, clean clothing.,
Lose weight.",How to Prevent Skin Rashes2," Intertrigo is caused by skin-to-skin friction, which causes irritation and a rash. It is common in areas of the body that are warm and moist, especially areas where skin can rub against other skin such as in the groin, under the breasts, between thighs, under arms, or between toes. It may also lead to bacterial or fungal infections. Unlike heat rash, it can happen in any environment.Keep your skin clean and dry, especially where it may rub against other skin. Apply antiperspirant to your underarms. You may find that petroleum jelly helps form a protective barrier for areas such as your inner thighs. Applying baby powder or medicated powder can also help absorb excess moisture.
Wear open-toed shoes or sandals.This will help reduce moisture in between your toes., Medicated barrier creams can be bought at most drug stores and pharmacies. Diaper rash ointment (such as Desitin) can be helpful for areas that are often moist and prone to friction, such as the groin area. Zinc oxide ointment may also be effective.If you have frequent trouble with friction rashes, ask your doctor about Tetrix, a prescription barrier cream that contains dimethicone. It is more effective than over-the-counter treatments.

, Clothing that rubs against your skin can cause friction rashes.Wear natural fibers such as cotton, silk, or bamboo when possible, as artificial fibers can irritate skin and often do not breathe well.

, Intertrigo is common in people who are overweight or obese, as there are more areas of skin that can cause friction. Talk with your doctor about whether your rashes might benefit from you losing weight.Do not begin a weight loss regimen without consulting your doctor first.

Identify and avoid the triggers of eczema.,
Ask your doctor about allergy medications or treatments.,
Take shorter baths or showers.,
Moisturize your skin at least twice a day.",How to Prevent Skin Rashes3," Eczema, also known as atopic dermatitis, is a chronic skin disorder that presents itself as a red, scaly and itchy rash which is sensitive to the touch and can involve some swelling. People with eczema lack certain proteins in their skin and certain conditions can worsen their condition.Learn to recognize the triggers of eczema and avoid them, such as:


Skin infections
Allergens such as pollen, mold, dust mites, animals, or foods
Cold and dry air in the winter, getting too hot or too cold, or sudden changes of temperature
Chemical irritants or rough materials, such as wool
Emotional stress
Perfumes or dyes added to skin lotions or soaps

, You may not be able to avoid all of your triggers, especially if you're allergic to things like pollen. Talk to your doctor about possible allergy treatments to help reduce your symptoms., Taking too many baths or showers can strip the skin of its natural oils, which can cause excess dryness.Limit your baths and showers to maximum of 10 to 15 minutes.
When taking baths, use warm water instead of hot
After the shower, use a soft towel to gently pat dry your skin.
Use only mild and gentle shower cleansers or soaps. Mild, hypoallergenic soaps and shower oils are gentle and do not strip the skin out of its protective natural oils.Avoid using anti-bacterial or alcohol-based cleansers, which can easily dry your skin.
Choose shower cleansers with added moisturizers.

, Moisturizers help seal in the skin’s natural moisture and thus keep it protected and hydrated.Moisturized skin is tougher against irritation, such as against harsh fabrics rubbing or scratching against the skin, and help prevent eczema flare ups.
Also apply moisturizer right after you pat dry after a bath or shower.

Avoid skin irritants and allergens.,
Get an allergy test.,
Wash your skin immediately after contact.,
Wear protective clothing or gloves when dealing with irritants.,
Use moisturizer to protect your skin.,
Talk to your doctor if you experience a rash after taking medications.",How to Prevent Skin Rashes4," Contact dermatitis is caused by irritants that come into contact with your skin. Contact dermatitis can be an allergic reaction or it can be caused by a common irritant (non-allergenic), but the good news is that it can be prevented by avoiding the trigger.Avoid exposing your skin to common irritants, such as dust mites, pollen, chemicals, cosmetics, plant oils (poison ivy) and other substances, which may trigger your individual contact dermatitis reaction. Irritant contact dermatitis usually causes a dry, scaly rash that does not itch. However, some types of contact dermatitis may cause itching and blistering.Some people can have a reaction to irritants just after a single exposure, while others may have symptoms only after repeated exposures. Sometimes you can develop a tolerance to the irritant over time.

, If you are unsure whether you have allergies, your doctor can perform an allergy test to identify substances that might trigger your contact dermatitis.


Common allergens include nickel, medications (including topical antibiotics and antihistamines), formaldehyde and skin tattooing and black henna products.Another common allergen is Balsam of Peru, used in cosmetics, perfumes, mouth rinses and flavorings. If a new product gives you a reaction, stop using it.
Check labels to ensure you are not accidentally purchasing products that contain an allergen.

, If you get exposed to an irritant or allergen, rinse the affected area immediately. This can help reduce the reaction or even prevent it.Use warm water and mild soaps or take a shower if the exposure was large.
Also, wash all clothing and anything else that has come to contact with the substance.

, If you need to work with the substance, protect your skin from coming into direct contact with the irritant or allergen by wearing coveralls, goggles and gloves.Remember to follow proper techniques and guidelines for handling harmful substances.

, Moisturizers coat the skin with a protective barrier and help restore its outer layer.Apply moisturizer before possible contact with the irritant and use regularly to keep your skin healthy.

, Several medications can cause a ""drug rash"" as either a side effect or an allergic reaction. This commonly begins within a week after starting a new drug, and begins as red spots that spread to cover large areas of the body. Common medications that cause drug rashes include:Antibiotics
Anti-seizure medications
Diuretics (water pills)

Take all medications as prescribed.,
Avoid stress.,
Avoid injury to skin.,
Avoid medications that trigger psoriasis.,
Avoid and treat infections.,
Do not drink full-calorie beer.,
Stop smoking.,
Avoid cold and dry weather.",How to Prevent Skin Rashes5," Psoriasis medications can often help prevent flare-ups if taken as your doctor recommends. This is especially true for medications that work through your immune system, such as biologics.


It is also important not to stop taking medication without consulting your doctor first. Stopping a medication for psoriasis without working with your doctor can cause one type of psoriasis to become a more severe type., Psoriasis is an autoimmune skin disorder characterized by itchy, scaly skin rash. The cause of psoriasis is often unknown, but there are known triggers that can aggravate the condition and cause an outbreak, including stress.Take steps to reduce stress in your life. Try relaxation techniques, such as yoga and meditation.
Exercise regularly. Exercise helps release endorphins and can alleviate stress.

, Damage of the skin (vaccination, bites, scrapes and sunburn) can trigger the formation of new psoriasis lesions. This is called the Koebner phenomenon.Use protective clothing and care for all scrapes and injuries immediately using hygienic techniques.
Prevent sunburns by using sunscreens, protective clothing (hats and long loose clothing), or shades. Also, limit the amount of time you spend in the direct sun.

, Some medications are known triggers of psoriasis outbreak, including anti-malarial drugs, lithium, inderal, indomethacin and quinidine.If you suspect that your medication might be triggering psoriasis, ask your doctor for an alternative medication.
Do not stop taking a prescription medication suddenly without asking your doctor first.

, Anything that can affect your immune system may trigger psoriasis flare ups, such as strep throat (Streptococcal pharyngitis), thrush (Candida albicans) and respiratory infections.Seek immediate medical attention if you suspect an infection.

, One clinical study found that regular beer (but not light beer, wine or other types of alcohol) may be associated with an increased risk of psoriasis outbreak.


The risk was 2.3 times higher for women who consumed five or more beers per week compared with women who did not drink beer., Smoking makes psoriasis worse. It's bad for your health in general, too. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist about options to help you stop smoking.Women who are smokers are at particular risk of making psoriasis worse., Cold and dry weather removes natural moisture from the surface of the skin and might trigger a psoriasis outbreak.Stay warm and consider getting a humidifier to your home.

Apply topical treatment.,
Continue to use your acne medication.,
Take oral contraceptives.,
Attend light therapy sessions.",How to Prevent Skin Breakouts2," Even when your skin is clear, you can use a product to help prevent breakouts. Use an over-the-counter acne cream or gel to dry excess oil. Use a product that has benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid as the active ingredient. Check the label for strength, and pick a gentle product to begin.Start with a 2.5 percent concentration of the active ingredient, and try using more of the product or upgrading to a stronger product if you see no results after several weeks. Stronger products are not always more effective, and they may dry out your skin.Consult with your health care provider if your over-the-counter product is not working.

, Some prescribed medications used to treat outbreaks of acne can be used as preventative medicine after the acne has cleared. Discuss the continued use of a prescribed acne medication with your health care provider.Commonly, teens are on an antibiotic to kill the bacteria that are in the hair follicles, and isotretinoin, which reduces oil production, unplugs follicles, and reduces inflammation. Isotretinoin is teratogenic and should not be used in those who may become pregnant.
In most cases your doctor will recommend ""tapering,"" or slowly decreasing, an antibiotic acne medication, as you risk building resistance if you continue at a high dose., Birth-control pills have been shown to be as effective at treating acne as traditional acne antibiotics, and in some cases more effective. If you are a woman or female-assigned person who has passed through puberty, you may be eligible for hormonal acne prevention in the form of oral contraceptives., Your doctor may recommend you participate in light therapy sessions. Light therapy targets the bacteria that cause breakouts, so it can be used preventatively.Light therapy has also been moderately successful at diminishing acne scars.
If you are taking an antibiotic that causes you to be extra sensitive to light, talk to your doctor before trying one of these methods. They may not be appropriate or you may need to stop the antibiotic.

Wear loose-fitting clothes.,
Avoid foods that trigger breakouts.,
Avoid stress.",How to Prevent Skin Breakouts3," To prevent body acne, wear clothing that does not squeeze or rub your skin. Tight clothing and accessories can trap heat and moisture in your skin, which can cause breakouts. Remove backpacks, helmets, and sports equipment when not in use, as they can rub your skin and irritate it.Some dermatologists recommend wearing natural fabrics like cotton and silk to let your skin breathe. Synthetic fabrics, like Lycra, might trap sweat in the skin, allowing bacteria to flourish.Never reuse sports or athletic clothing without washing it with soap and water first.

, Some dermatologists believe that certain foods might trigger breakouts. Dairy products, carbohydrates, chocolate, and fatty foods have all been linked to breakouts.Triggers may vary person to person, so take note of what you have been eating and how your skin reacts.

, Stress does not cause acne, but it can make it worse.If you are prone to acne, it can help to identify stressful situations.Acne itself can be a source of stress. If you are having acne-related stress, you might want to talk to a family member, a counselor, or a support group.Exercise is sometimes recommended to prevent acne. Though it hasn't been proven to help acne directly, exercise is a great stress management technique, and could help prevent stress-related acne.In a study conducted in 2003, it was found that students suffered from more outbreaks of acne during exams — a period during which they reported experiencing more stress."

Prepare an ACV compress to treat your psoriasis.,
Use pure ACV to soak nails.,
Use a cotton ball to apply ACV at night.",How to Use Apple Cider Vinegar for Psoriasis1,"









Dampen a washcloth with warm water to use as a compress.
Make a solution of apple cider vinegar and warm water. Mix 1 part vinegar with 3 parts water.
Use the warm washcloth as a compress. Apply the ACV solution directly to the affected areas and hold the compress on the skin for 30 seconds to 1 minute. Apply several times a day as needed for itching. ACV makes the pH levels in the skin more acidic, thus reducing irritation.;
, Many people with psoriasis find that their toenails and fingernails become affected. To treat these areas, soak them in a bowl of ACV for 5 minutes daily.








, For itchy patches or legions, saturate a cotton ball with pure ACV and apply to affected areas. Leave the treatment overnight and shower off in the morning.

Apply soothing oils or lotions to the affected area to relieve pain and discomfort.,
Avoid scratching at the affected area.,
Visit a doctor if the fungal infection doesn't clear up after a course of over-the-counter treatments.",How to Heal Armpit Rash," This condition is called folliculitis. Folliculitis starts when hair follicles get damaged for whatever reason, becoming infected. Luckily, this irritating condition can be avoided and treated.


Wear clothing that isn't too tight in the armpit area. Rubbing can cause irritation.
Wear clothing that allows your skin to breathe, especially if you live in a warm climate.
Be sure that you aren't sensitive or allergic to any certain type of material, such as wool.
Wash your clothes in non-irritating detergent. Refrain from using any fabric softeners.;
, Shaving can cause hair follicles to become ingrown and even infected. Try waxing or use a depilatory (hair removal agent) instead until the condition has cleared up.

, Deodorants often contain aluminum, fragrances, alcohol and parabens — all of which can trigger a rash.This is one of the easiest causes of itching or redness to eliminate.


Experiment with hygiene products by trial and error. Try switching to a fragrance-free deodorant first. If this doesn't heal the rash, switch to different, preferably fragrance-free, soap. If the problem persists, see a doctor.
Some non-irritating deodorants to consider if you think your deodorant or antiperspirant might be the culprit:

Potassium Alum: Potassium Alum is a mineral that has astringent and antiseptic qualities. While it does not prevent perspiration, it is effective in inhibiting the growth of the bacteria responsible for body odor. It is commonly found in stone-form and is very cheap.

Baking soda: Mix an eighth of a teaspoon of baking soda with a little bit of water — don't dissolve it — and rub it under your arms. If you wish, you can also dust a little bit of baking soda and cornstarch under your arms for a drier feel.

Lemon: The citric acid in lemon juice also kills the bacteria underneath your arms. Take a slice of lemon and swipe it under your pits for a nice natural deodorant. Just be sure not to use lemon juice immediately after you shave.

Rubbing alcohol: Fill a spray bottle with isopropyl alcohol and simply mist underneath your arms. For a nice fragrance, add a few drops of an essential oil like lavender or mint, though its safer to avoid the fragrance altogether.

, The underarm area is a perfect breeding ground for bacteria and fungus because it is dark and moist. Armpit rash can be attributable to poor hygiene, but it's far more likely that the rash is a direct result of heat, friction or contact with allergens., These may include allergies to food and medication, poison ivy or poison oak, insect bites, or an autoimmune disorder such as psoriasis. Viruses such as flu or chicken pox can also cause rashes. Consult your physician if you suspect any of these as reasons for underarm inflammation.

, If you've developed armpit rash and started some of the regimens listed above, it's time to help soothe the rash, first and foremost. Follow these steps to help soothe the rash.


Wash under your arms with mild, fragrance-free soap. Allow the area to dry thoroughly.
Wear loose fitting clothing made of natural materials such as cotton, jute and linen. These materials will help your skin breathe easier, cutting down on the chance of folliculitis.
Drink hydrating fluids that allow your body to optimally regulate its temperature. Water and green tea are best. Energy drinks, coffee, and other diuretics are best avoided because they can dehydrate.
Use an over-the-counter anti-fungal cream or lotion. These are the same products used for fungal infections in other areas of the body such as the feet and groin.

, The moist compress should help promote drainage.Once washcloth has been used, substitute it for another clean compress the next time you apply it.

, An oil containing vitamin E may help, although topical vitamin E may irritate the skin of some people.Other oils you may consider are aloe vera, tea tree and emu.


A mild hydrocortisone creams applied to the irritated area to help your armpit rash to heal while preventing irritation and itching.Calamine lotion is also a popular anti-itch cream used on rashes.
Take an oatmeal bath. Try a colloidal store-bought product, or make your own oatmeal bath by wrapping 1 cup of oatmeal in a cotton cloth or sock and boiling as you would to cook it. Let it cool down a little bit, and use the oatmeal poultice as a sponge to bathe in., Skin abrasions caused by scratching can lead to fungal or bacterial infection. Use a topical ointment, such as hydrocortisone, if the itching becomes unbearable.

, He/She may need to prescribe a stronger medication. In the meantime, it's okay to take ibuprofen or aspirin to ease pain and inflammation.

This will help keep it moist and prevent cracking and irritation. Avoid moisturizers with dyes or perfumes that may irritate your skin. Moisturizers and oils should be applied when your skin is still wet after a bath or shower to seal in the moisture. The following work well:Cetaphil
Nutraderm
Eucerin
Baby oil;
, Allergy medicines contain antihistamines, which may help because eczema is related to allergies. Some good options include:Cetirizine (Zyrtec)
Fexofenadine (Allegra)
Diphenhydramine (Benadryl)

, Some topical creams, such as steroid creams, calamine lotion, and topical calcineurin inhibitors will help to reduce itching. You can apply them to your eczema ta few times per day to get relief. Some options include:Hydrocortisone cream. A 1% hydrocortisone cream can help to reduce itching. Just keep in mind that frequent use of steroid creams may lead to thinning of the skin, so it is best to use these creams on a short term basis. Ask your doctor first before using a hydrocortisone cream on your face or in between skin folds.
Calamine lotion. Calamine lotion is often used for poison ivy, but it can also help with itching caused by eczema.
Topical Calcineurin Inhibitors. These prescription topical creams provide itch and rash relief, but they do not thin the skin like steroid creams are known to do., A cold compress can help to relieve itching and it will also help to reduce swelling.You can either use a cold, wet washcloth or an ice pack as a cold compress.


To use a wet washcloth, hold a washcloth under cool running water and then wring out the excess water. Hold the washcloth on your skin for about five minutes. Then, dry the area thoroughly and apply moisturizer.
To use an ice pack wrap it in a clean cotton cloth or paper towel first. Then, hold the ice pack against your eczema for up to 20 minutes. Give your skin a chance to return to its normal temperature before using the ice pack again or you may cause tissue damage.

, If you scratch, you will irritate the area and may break the skin. This will allow bacteria to get in and make you more prone to infection. If you scratch without thinking about it, try:Putting a bandage on it.
Keeping your nails trimmed.
Wearing a pair of cotton gloves at night.

, This is particularly enjoyable on a cold winter day and it may help to reduce itching and soothe your skin.Draw a warm bath and then sprinkle baking soda, uncooked oatmeal, or colloidal oatmeal into the water.
Relax for 15 minutes, and then get out.
Apply moisturizer to your wet skin. This will help seal the moisture into your skin.Some people wait 20 minutes after drying the skin otherwise the moisturizer can penetrate too quickly causing added irritation.

, This may sting a bit, but it will help to kill any bacteria that may be growing in the irritated or broken skin. In the summer a swim in the ocean would help, but during winter, you will need to mix your own salt solution.Dissolve several teaspoons of table salt into a cup of warm water.
Using washcloth, dab it onto the eczema patch and let it dry.

, Always consult your doctor before trying alternative medicines, particularly herbal supplements, which may interact with other medications. These methods have not been scientifically proven to help, but anecdotal evidence suggests they may help some people:Supplements of vitamin D, E, zinc, selenium, probiotics, or various oils
Herbal supplements like St. John’s wort, calendula flowers, tea tree oil, German chamomile, Oregon grape root, licorice, rice bran broth (topically)
Acupuncture or acupressure
Using aromatherapy or color therapy to increase relaxation
Massage therapy

, During the winter, the days are shorter and we spend more time indoors, reducing the amount of light we are exposed to throughout the day. Light therapy can be done by deliberately exposing yourself to sunlight, or using artificial ultraviolet A, or narrow band UVB light. However, this can be harmful and is generally not used on children. Side effects include:Early aging of the skin
A risk of developing skin cancer

Recall if you've had contact with someone who has herpes.Herpes simplex virus is very common and highly contagious.,
Look for early symptoms.,
Observe more typical whitlow symptoms in the disease phase.Once the initial prodrome phase has passed, you will see far more specific symptoms that point clearly to whitlow:


Swelling, redness, and rash, with fluid filled vesicles around the area.The vesicles may rupture, and a white, clear, or bloody fluid will come out.,
Get a formal medical diagnosis.,
Take antiviral medication.,
Take precautions to prevent spreading the infection.Since the virus can spread through contact, your healthcare provider may advise you not to touch others, or even to avoid touching yourself with the infected finger.,
Wrap the infected area.Your healthcare provider may wrap the infected area with a bandage, cloth, or any form of dry wrap with medical tape.,
Monitor children closely.,
Get pain medication if necessary.The doctor may provide or advise you to use over-the-counter pain medication like Advil, Tylenol, ibuprofen or aspirin.,
Ask the doctor to test for bacterial infection.If you try to burst or drain the vesicles on your finger on your own, you give debris and bacteria opportunity to invade.,
Take antibiotics as prescribed.,
Do not pick at vesicles.,
Soak the infected area.Warm water can provide pain relief from whitlow.,
Add soap to the water for open blisters.,
Apply magnesium sulphate paste.,
Use an ice pack.The extreme cold will numb the nerves in the surrounding area, relieving the pain.,
Reduce your stress levels.",How to Treat Whitlow," HSV -1 commonly affects the face, and often causes cold sores (painful blisters on the lips). HSV-2 tends to cause painful genital blisters.


HSV-1 can spread through kissing or oral sex, while HSV-2 can spread through skin to skin contact with infected genitals.
Be aware that HSV can have a long-dormant period. You may have contracted herpes long ago, but the virus may have stayed dormant in the nerve cells where it resides. Stress and lack of immunity (getting sick) are common triggers for activation of the virus from the dormant phase.
Even if you can't remember ever being in contact with someone with HSV-1, consider if you've ever had a cold sore or fever blister.;
, In the ""prodrome"" or early phase of any disease, symptoms indicate the onset of a condition. For whitlow, these symptoms usually appear 2 to 20 days after initial exposure, and include:


Fever
Fatigue
Unusual pain
Numbness
Tingling in the area,
These vesicles may merge and take on a black/brown color.
Ulceration, or a break in the skin, may develop later.
Symptoms can resolve from anywhere from 10 days to 3 weeks.

, Since whitlow is a more of a clinical diagnosis, the medical staff might not order any additional tests. Instead, the doctor will take your symptoms and medical history — including an HSV diagnosis — into consideration to diagnose whitlow. The doctor may also take a tube of your blood to order a complete blood count (CBC) with a differential (a count of your white blood cells). This will let them see if you have enough immune cells to fight infections, or if you have an underlying immune dysfunction that causes reoccurring infections.


The doctor may want to test for herpes if you haven't been diagnosed with it. They may analyze your blood for herpes antibodies, order a PCR test (for the detection of herpes DNA), and/or order a viral culture (to see if actual herpes virus is growing from your blood)., If whitlow is diagnosed within 48 hours after the symptoms start, the doctor can prescribe antiviral medication to you. The medicine might be topical (a cream) or oral (pills), and it will lessen the severity of the infection and promote quicker healing.Thus, it's crucial that you seek immediate medical advice.


Commonly prescribed medications include topical acyclovir 5%, oral acyclovir, oral Famciclovir or valacyclovir.
Take the medications as advised by your doctor or pharmacist.
Dosages will be adjusted for children, but the treatments will remain the same.

, In particular, avoid touching body parts that contain fluids or bodily secretions. These include the eyes, mouth, tongue, genitals, ears, and breast.


If you wear contacts, don't wear them until the infection has resolved. Touching the contacts, then inserting them into your eyes, could infect the eye.

, You can do this easily at home, too, by buying the bandages or wraps from your local pharmacy. To keep the wrap fresh, change it daily. To be extra safe, your doctor may advise you to both wrap the infected area and wear a glove over it.

, It can be difficult enough to be conscious of your hands as an adult, but children often find it quite difficult. You don't want them sucking on infected fingers, touching their eyes, or any other areas of the body that contain or carry bodily fluids. Even after wrapping the infected area, watch them closely to make sure everything is as it should be.

, They should ease pain while the infection heals by reducing inflammation to the area. If you saw a doctor within 48 hours of noticing the symptoms, the doctor might not recommend anything beyond pain medication.


Children and teenagers with viral infections are advised not to take aspirin. There's a risk of developing a multi-organ fatal condition known as Reye’s syndrome.
Seek expert medical advice before taking over-the-counter pain meds for viral infections.
Take all medications as described either by your healthcare provider or on the label. Be careful not to exceed the maximum daily dose.

, Whitlow is a viral infection, but you can compound the issue with a bacterial infection (this can appear dark, have an odor, and may have a whitish pus discharge).


The doctors will order a complete blood count with differential (to detect immune cells or white blood cells) if they suspect bacterial infection.
The white blood cells will be high if you have a bacterial infection.
They may reorder this test after you've completed your antibiotic course to check for normal levels of white blood cells. This isn't always necessary if symptoms have calmed and they have no further suspicion.

, A doctor will likely want to confirm a bacterial infection before prescribing antibiotic treatment. This is because overuse of antibiotics can cause bacteria to adapt and become resistant to treatment. However, once bacterial infection is confirmed, antibiotic treatment is very simple.Always follow your doctor or the label's directions precisely.
Make sure to complete the full course of treatment, even if symptoms seem to resolve.

, You may be tempted to pick at or try to burst the vesicles, just as people can't resist the urge to pop pimples. However, this makes the wound open to bacterial infection.Furthermore, the released fluid carries the virus, and can spread the viral infection further.

, This is best used when painful lesions start appearing on the infected area. You can add salt or epsom salt to the water to help with relief. The concentrated salt will diminish swelling in the effected area.


Fill a container deep enough for the infected area with warm water. Soak the infected area for 15 minutes.
Repeat as the pain reoccurs.
When finished, wrap the area with a dry bandage wrap to prevent disease transmission.

, If you've tried to burst or drain a vesicle, you can add regular or antibacterial soap to the warm water when you soak the area.While you may opt for antibacterial soap, studies suggest that regular soap works just as well at protecting against bacteria and infection. Keeping soap in the water can help prevent the spread of the condition as fluid from the infection mixes in with the water.

, Magnesium sulphate paste can help with the pain and swelling associated with whitlow. Though this is widely documented, the exact reason behind this effect is still unclear. In a study published 2008, a group of patients with HSV 1 or 2 were treated with a mixture that included magnesium. The results showed that over 95% had resolution of symptoms within 7 days.To properly use magnesium paste, first clean the infected area using a suitable antiseptic. Examples include isopropyl alcohol, alcohol prep pad or soap.
Apply a generous amount of magnesium sulphate paste. You can buy this product at any pharmacy.
Cover the pasted area with lint or cotton wool, then bandage it.
Change the bandage daily, and applying fresh paste each time.

, It will also slow blood flow to the area, reducing any inflammation or swelling that would contribute to the pain. You can either buy an ice pack from the pharmacy, or just wrap some ice cubes in a towel. Gently apply the pack to the infected area.

, This can be challenging, but making an effort can help prevent future outbreaks. HSV can lie dormant in nerve cells for quite some time, but stress can activate it.Thus, avoiding stress can be the key to avoiding whitlow. Some options to deal with stress and boost the immune system include eating healthier, getting a good night sleep, and exercising regularly.

Dress comfortably in soft and light fabrics.This includes the sheets and blankets you use for sleeping or resting.,
Turn down the heat.,
Bathe or shower in tepid water.,
Place cold washcloths or icepacks on your neck.There are several methods you can use to get something cool enough to put on your forehead, face or the back of your neck.,
Go to bed with wet socks.,
Take an over-the-counter medication.,
Take a prescription medication.,
Drink a LOT of fluids.,
Get lots of rest.,
Wash your hands.,
Do NOT touch your face.,
Do not share bottles, cups, or cutlery.,
Get your regular immunizations.",How to Treat Skin Sensitivity Associated With Fever," Try to use as few layers as possible.;
, If it’s the winter and you have your furnace on, consider temporarily turning down the temperature to keep your home cool while you recover.If it isn’t winter, and you cannot turn down the temperature, try using a fan instead. Misting yourself occasionally with water while you're in front of the fan also feels wonderful.

, Tepid water is considered water that is at 85 °F or 30 °C. Baths are better than showers as you get to immerse yourself in the water, but showers are okay if you do not have a bathtub.Do not bathe or shower in ice cold water.
Do not use (rubbing) alcohol in an attempt to cool your skin.

, You can run a washcloth under cool or cold water, place an icepack or ice cubes inside a washcloth or towel (this method will last longer), or wet a washcloth and put it in the freezer before using it. Try making a rice pack and placing it in the freezer. This can be made with a cloth bag and dry rice or purchased as is.

, Before bed, soak your feet in hot water. Then wet a pair of cotton socks in cold water and put them on. Put a pair of thicker socks overtop of your wet socks. Go to bed.This is not recommended for diabetics, as they do not have good circulation or sensation in their feet.
Some skincare manufacturers make products for your feet that contain mint. When applied to your feet they make the skin feel cool. Use a lotion, cream or gel like this on your feet throughout the day to help cool you down.

, Doctors usually suggest taking acetaminophen, ibuprofen or aspirin if you are an adult with a fever. Follow the dosage instructions on the box to determine how much to take, and at what frequency., Since your fever is probably a symptom of another, underlying condition, your doctor may prescribe a drug to help that underlying condition (such as an antibiotic).Only take prescription medication that has been prescribed specifically for you and your situation. And take the medication in the amount and frequency determined by your doctor, and written on the bottle.

, Fevers can cause your body to become dehydrated, but in order to keep your body strong to fight whatever you have, you have to keep yourself hydrated. Drink as much water or juice as you can, as often as you can.Broths are also helpful, since they contain some salt, which can help alleviate dehydration.
An alternative to simply drinking a liquid is to suck on ice chips or popsicles. Because you have a fever and are probably very hot, this might also help you feel a little cooler, at least temporarily.

, You have a fever because something is wrong. Your body needs to use all its energy for fighting, not doing other unnecessary things. In addition, activities which need energy also cause your temperature to increase, something you definitely do not need right now!Stay in bed or on the couch. Don’t go to work or school. Don’t go out on errands unless absolutely necessary. Don’t worry about chores until you feel better.

, You can never wash your hands too much. You should especially wash your hands after you’ve used the bathroom and before you eat. It is also helpful to get into the habit of washing your hands after you’ve been out in public, or have touched public door handles, elevator buttons, or railings., You hands are your connection to world. Unfortunately that means they’re probably covered in dirt, oil, bacteria and other stuff you don’t want to think about, especially before you’ve washed them., This is especially important if either you or the other person are currently feeling ill. But just to be safe, because many illnesses can be contagious when the person isn’t symptomatic, it’s best just to avoid sharing anything, with anyone, that touches your mouth., Make sure your vaccinations and immunizations are up-to-date. If you can’t remember when you last had one, speak to your doctor — in some cases it’s better to get a shot early than not at all. These immunizations will help keep away many illnesses like the flu or the measles that have a fever as a symptom.


Note that it is not uncommon for an immunization with an active virus to give you temporary symptoms, including a fever, in the few days following the shot. Make sure you’re aware of these possible side effects by speaking to your doctor.

Get a punch biopsy.,
Undergo a skin shave.,
Get a surgical excision.,
Undergo an incisional biopsy.",How to Undergo a Mole Biopsy1," A punch biopsy is when the doctor uses a special tool to punch into the skin around the mole. The tool has a circular blade, and the doctor presses it to the skin to remove a circular piece of skin to biopsy. The doctor will numb the skin around the area being biopsied.Punch biopsies are done for smaller moles when the doctor wants to remove the entire mole.;
, One way that doctors can biopsy the mole is to surgically shave it to the same flat level as your skin. They will give you an anesthetic in the area and allow the area to go numb. Then, they will take a scalpel to cut the mole away.Skin shaves are often used for small moles or freckle-like areas that are flat on the skin.
Often, the area where the mole is removed will be closed by cauterisation, which is when they apply heat to close the wound.

, The doctor may decide to perform a surgical excision. This process is when the doctor numbs the skin and then removes the entire mole and the surrounding tissue. Then they stitch the skin closed.A surgical excision is used for small to medium sized areas, when the doctor wants to remove the entire mole and surrounding tissue.

, During an incisional biopsy, the doctor will numb the area and then only cut off the irregular part of the mole instead of removing the whole thing. Then, they will examine the sample of tissue in a lab.An incisional biopsy technique is used when removing the entire mole is difficult, such as when it is too big to remove through other techniques.

An oral medication
An injection

, Your doctor may prescribe an antibiotic if you have scratched open your eczema and it has gotten infected. These medications will also reduce the bacteria on your skin, lessening the likelihood of reinfection. They can be prescribed as:Staphylococcus aureus is the most common infection with atopic dermatitis. If you have the following signs, it is best to get checked by a doctor.A rash that looks infected, showing red streaks, pus, or yellow scabs
A rash that hurts
Eye problems caused by the rash
A rash that doesn’t respond to self-care
A rash that is preventing you from sleeping and going about your daily life

, These drugs prevent the effects of chemicals called histamines and reduce itching.You can take a sedating antihistamine to reduce itching and help you sleep, or take a non-sedating antihistamine to lessen itching during the day.

, These medications may enable the skin to heal more quickly. Two possible medications are:Tacrolimus (Protopic)
Pimecrolimus (Elidel)

, This is often done by a doctor, but it might also be possible to do at home if your doctor explains in detail how to do it. This is generally used for severe eczema:First a topical corticosteroid is applied to the eczema patches. Then wet bandages are wrapped around it. This may yield relief within hours.

Shower promptly after exercise to prevent sweat from irritating your eczema.

, People who have eczema are often highly sensitive to strong soaps and exposure may bring on an outbreak. Add thick lotion before putting the gloves on. Avoid contact with:Solvents
Cleaners
Dish soaps
Detergents

, Consider whether your eczema is worse when you are exposed to environmental irritants, such as dust and cigarette smoke. Because you spend more time indoors in winter, you may be more exposed to these irritants more often.Try to reduce your exposure to environmental irritants as much as possible.

, Eczema is related to allergies, so you may want to consider eliminating foods that you are allergic to. You can ask your doctor to test you for allergies if you are not sure if you have any allergies. Foods that may irritate your eczema include:Eggs
Milk
Peanuts
Soybeans
Fish
Wheat

, Avoid sudden changes in heat and humidity. If the weather is changing dramatically, stay inside as much as possible to give your skin a chance to adjust.


If the weather suddenly gets very dry, try using a humidifier in your house to moisten the air.

, Loose clothing will allow your skin to breathe. Dress warmly in winter and protect your skin from drying winter winds.Avoid scratchy wool.
Wear cool clothing that breathes well during exercise.

, Stress may make you more prone to eczema. By reducing your stress, you can promote healing for existing patches and reduce the likelihood of it flaring up. Excellent ways to reduce stress include:


Getting 8 hours of sleep each night. This will give you the mental energy to face the challenges in your life.
Exercising for approximately 2.5 hours per week. This can be harder to do in winter, but it will pay off. Your body will release endorphins which will relax you and lift your mood. Possible activities include sports, jogging, swimming, and biking.
Using relaxation techniques such as meditation, yoga, deep breathing, visualizing calming images, and massage.

Cover your head with a towel and place your face 12-15 inches from the water.,
Steam your face for 10 minutes.,
Moisturize your face.",How to Prevent Acne Naturally1," Steam cleaning is a simple and effective way to refresh your skin and prevent acne. You will need to following materials:


1-quart pot
Water
A clean towel
Essential oils
Dried herbs, if you do not have access to essential oils;
, You should use essential oils that have antibacterial or antiseptic properties. They will kill bacteria and other microorganisms that can infect your skin and lead to acne. You can choose from the following oils:


Spearmint or peppermint: Spearmint or peppermint has antiseptic and immune boosting properties due to the high percentage of menthol in these herbs.Thyme: This herb can boost your immune system and also provides antibacterial relief for your skin. It can also help to increase your blood circulation.Lavender: This herb is known for its soothing and calming properties as well as its antibacterial properties. It can also help with anxiety and depression.Calendula: This herb can help to accelerate healing and also has antimicrobial properties.You should always pre-test the oil on a small area of your skin before using it to ensure you do not have an allergic reaction or develop a rash. Place one drop on your wrist and wait 10-15 minutes. If there is no reaction on the surface of your skin, you can use the oil for steam cleaning.

, Tie your hair back so your face is exposed. Then, cleanse your face with a plant-oil based product so it is clean and ready for steaming. You can use oils like glycerin, grapeseed, and sunflower to create a plant-oil based product.


Apply the product to your face and use your fingertips to gently massage it in circular motions. Clean your face for about a minute and then use lukewarm water to rinse your face, removing the cleanser.
Pat your face dry with a clean towel.

, Take the 1-quart pot and fill it halfway with water. Set it on the stove and let it boil for one to two minutes. The water should produce a nice flow of steam.


Add one to two drops of the essential oils. If you do not have essential oils, you can use dried herbs instead. Add ½ teaspoon of dried herbs per quart of water.
Let the water boil for another minute and then take it off the heat. Use a potholder, as the pot will be hot. Turn off the stove and place the pot on an even surface in an open area.

, Cover your head with the towel first so you can positive your face 12-15 inches from the water. This will allow your blood vessels to dilate and your pores to open up, but the steam will not damage your skin.


Close your eyes and breathe in and out deeply. Try to relax as the steam wafts over your face.

, After one minute, take your face away from the steam and let your skin rest for 10 minutes. If you do not have an allergic reaction to the oils in the steam after 10 minutes, with no sneezing or itching, you can reheat the water and use the steam again.


Keep your face over the steam for up to 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, rinse your skin with lukewarm water and pat dry it with a towel.

, Finish the steam session by moisturizing your face with natural oils or a non-comedogenic moisturizer. Moisturizing after the steam session can help to keep your skin soft and prevent damage to your skin.


Opt for store-brand moisturizers that advertise non-comedogenic properties or non-clogging properties, like Olay, Neutrogena, and Clinique moisturizers.
You can also use natural oils that are high in non-comedogenic properties, such as hemp seed oil, shea butter, sunflower oil, castor oil, calendula oil, or argan oil.Start by moisturizing your face twice a day with natural oils, once in the morning and once in the evening. You can then do the steam treatment once a day, in the morning or the evening.

Use moisturizing cream on the rash.A moisturizing lotion may be made up mostly of water and, with repeated use, can actually strip the natural oils from the skin, causing further irritation.Look for a cream or ointment that is not labeled as a solution or lotion and contains natural oils.Aloe vera will also soothe and hydrate the skin affected by the rash.,
Apply a hydrocortisone cream to reduce swelling, reduce redness, and itching.Hydrocortisone is a mild corticosteroid and can make you much more comfortable as your rash heals.,
Take an antihistamine to control itchiness.,
See a doctor if the rash doesn't disappear after a few days or respond to treatment.,
Don't touch or scratch the affected area.,
Don't put soap on the rash when you take the shower.,
Don't shave or reapply cream for 72 hours after using a depilatory cream.You should wait 24 hours before applying deodorant, perfumes, makeup, or tanning lotions to the area where you've used the cream.,
Use baby wipes instead of toilet paper.",How to Get Rid of a Rash from Nair," A little tingling is normal, but if your skin starts to burn, get the cream off your skin immediately. Some companies include a spatula to help scrape off the product; use the spatula or a soft cloth to wipe the cream off your skin.Don't scrub your skin or use anything rough or abrasive (like a loofah or exfoliating glove) to remove the cream. You don't want to scratch yourself or irritate your skin further.;
, You probably want to hop in the shower to do this so you can have a steady stream of water flowing over the rash.Make sure you are rinsing off any cream that may still be on your body, including the residue.Do not use soap, body wash or any other product to cleanse the area as you rinse your body.
Gently pat your skin dry after rinsing., You may have a chemical burn and need professional treatment.If the rash is on your face, around your eyes, or genitals, contact your physician for assistance., You can use an aloe vera gel or use it straight from the plant itself.Make sure the product is unscented, as the additional ingredients can irritate your rash., It should only be used in the short-term unless longer use is prescribed by a doctor.Stop using the cream if you experience further irritation or redness or develop acne where you applied the hydrocortisone.Laying a damp cotton cloth over the applied hydrocortisone can help your skin absorb it faster., You can get a over-the-counter antihistamines in drowsy or non-drowsy formulas.Your body will have released histamines to protect you from infection, but these may also cause you to itch (they're the same things that cause your nose to run when you have an allergic reaction). The antihistamine will suppress the side-effects of the histamine, leaving you itch-free.If the itching is keeping you awake at night, try an antihistamine that makes you sleepy (it probably won't be labeled as such, but it won't have ""non-drowsy"" on the box).Because antihistamines can make you tired (sometimes even the non-drowsy antihistamines can have this side-effect), don't take any before driving or doing anything else that requires you to be very alert., If you begin developing other side effects, like hives or a fever, or your current symptoms get worse, contact your doctor immediately., This can damage and further irritate the skin and can lead to an infection.You may even have some depilatory cream still under your nails.


Wear loose clothes that won't rub or chafe the rash and possibly cause a friction burn..
When using a cloth to wash the Nair off, don't rub too hard or scrub and try not to wipe the same area too many times.

, The rash will only get worse.

, These products can cause you to develop a rash or possibly a chemical burn.Wait 24 hours before going swimming or sunbathing., Choose unscented baby wipes that contain aloe in place of toilet paper if the rash is on your bikini area.

Stay warm.,
Don't scratch the chilblains.,
Avoid direct heat.,
Wash your feet at least two to three times a week.,
Use a good chilblain ointment.,
Exercise to improve your circulation.,
Change your shoes.,
Avoid smoking and being around people who smoke.,
Avoid being in cold areas.,
Wait.,
See a doctor if you still have severe chilblains after 14 days.",How to Get Rid of Chilblains," Try to avoid being cold by:


Wearing thick socks and gloves. If you have chilblains on your ears, wear beanies or soft earmuffs but it is important that the earmuffs are regularly cleaned.
Wear thick clothing to ensure that you're warm.
Have a hot beverage (i.e a cup of tea; hot chocolate; coffee etc.). Use either a thick mug or wrap a hand towel around the cup to avoid the heat from the drink.;
, The chilblains may crack open and get infected. The pain will be worse if you do scratch them. If you can't stop scratching them, use calamine lotion or witch hazel to soothe the itching. They can usually be found at your local pharmacy. , Don't place your chilblain affected areas directly over heaters; hot water bottles; kettles etc. Cover your hot water bottles in thick towels. If you have an electric blanket, keep the heat on low.

, Keeping your feet clean will help prevent your chilblains becoming infected and getting worse. Soak your feet and hands with warm water for 15 to 20 minutes as much as possible. Very hot water must be avoided. , You can find them at your local pharmacist. Apply the ointment to the affected area two to three times a day. The ointment will partly relieve the scratching and can help the healing process. Always read the package instructions.

, Sometimes chilblains are formed when the circulation isn't very good. Do some moderate exercises that help your circulation flow (e.g. yoga; light jogging; stretches etc.).

, Are your shoes too tight? Test to see by touching around the shoe while your foot is inside. If you can feel your foot easily, the shoe is too tight. Consider buying some new shoes or using another pair. If the shoes are sneakers, try loosening the shoelaces.

, Stay away from people you see light up a cigarette or cover your nose and mouth. Even if you don't smoke, inhaling smoke from others is known as second-hand smoke so you are affected just as much. Smoking delays the healing of chilblains and can make them worse. People who smoke are more at risk of getting chilblains. Pollution can also affect the healing process of chilblains, try staying away from the city central area in your town.

, Stay inside a warm building instead of going outside but make sure that the building you are in is not hot. Quickly overheating can make chilblains worse. If the building is hot, go outside and put on some warm clothing. Enter the building again and take off the warm clothing. This is so that you can gradually warm up instead of warming up very quickly. Warming up quickly can make the chilblains worse.

, Chilblains usually don't go away until 7 to 14 days later. Sometimes, chilblains may not go away until warmer weather arrives. Don't panic unless you see the chilblains get worse. Look out for:


Skin peeling off the chilblains. You may be seeing your skin turning white and your skin may always be very damp.
Chilblains changing colour. Blue, purple or black chilblains are something you must watch out for.

, It could be a serious problem so ask your doctor if you could have a blood test to detect any problems. You can also ask your doctor if the medication you are currently on is affecting the chilblains. Your doctor may prescribe you some medication to take.


Your doctor may recommend to take nifedipine. This drug helps relax the blood vessels which improves circulation. However, your doctor may only prescribe it to you if the chilblains are a severe problem to you. Chilblains are a symptom of the Raynaud's phenomenon, so if you do have Raynaud's phenomenon, see a doctor immediately."

Headache
Flu-like symptoms
Sensitivity to light
Itching, irritation, tingling, and pain where a rash starts developing, but only on one side of the body;
, Knowing the symptoms of each stage can help you doctor evaluate how to best treat your case.


Stage 1 (before the rash): itchiness, tingling, numbness or pain develops in the area where the rash will eventually develop. Diarrhea, stomach ache, and chills (usually without fever) accompany this dermal irritation. Your lymph nodes may be tender or swollen.
Stage 2 (rash and blisters): a rash will develop on one side of your body, with blisters forming eventually. The liquid in the blisters starts off clear but eventually gets cloudy. If a rash develops around the eyes, see a doctor immediately.The rash and blisters are sometimes accompanied by intense stinging pain.
Stage 3 (after the rash and blisters): pain may develop in the area affected by the rash. This pain is called postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), and it may last a matter of weeks or even years. PHN is associated with extreme sensitivity, chronic pain, as well as aching or burning sensations.

, If you receive immunosuppressive drugs, such as steroids, after an organ transplant, you are at a higher risk of getting shingles. If you suffer from the following conditions, you are also at a higher risk:


Cancer
Lymphoma
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
Leukemia

, The sooner your doctor diagnoses shingles, the better. (Sorry, self-diagnosis is not recommended.) Patients who start a course of drug treatment within three days of symptoms see better results than patients who wait longer than three days to start treatment., Most treatments for shingles are not very elaborate. They involve treating the symptoms of the rash while managing the patient's pain. Your doctor may ask you to try the following:


An antiviral medicine, like acyclovir (Zovirax), valacyclovir (Valtrex), famciclovir (Famvir), in order to dull the pain of the rash and make it last shorter
Over-the-counter NSAIDS such as ibuprofen, aspirin, or acetaminophen to manage pain
Certain topical antibiotics to prevent infection and spread of any rash or blisters

, Your doctor may diagnose postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). In order to treat this chronic condition that 15 out of every 100 shingles patients experiences, you doctor may give you:


Antidepressants (PHN is often associated with depression, as certain daily activities become painful and/or difficult to do).
Topical anesthetics, including benzocaine (available OTC) and lidocaine patches (available by prescription only).
Anticonvulsants, as some studies show that these drugs may help with chronic nerve pain.
Opoids, such as codeine, to help reduce chronic pain.

, Although you should never let shingles go untreated, there are a number of things you can do at home to combine with doctor's orders. These include:


Don't cover or itch the rash or blisters too much. Let the rash and blisters breathe, even as they scab over. If the pain keeps you from sleeping, it's acceptable to wrap the rash in a sports bandage.Icing the shingles for 10 minutes, with 5-minute breaks in between, for several hours. Afterward, dissolve some aluminum acetate (Domeboro) in water and apply using a moist compress to the rash.
Have your pharmacist mix a salve. Ask your pharmacist to mix together 78% calamine lotion with 20% rubbing alcohol, 1% phenol, and 1% menthol.Apply this salve to your blisters until they scab over.

, Shingles comes with long-term complications in some cases. You should look out for the following scenarios if you are dealing with shingles or PHN:


A spreading out of the rash over large parts of your body. This condition is called disseminated zoster, and it may affect internal organs as well as joints. Treatment of disseminated zoster usually involves both antibiotic and antiviral medicines.
A spreading of the rash to the face. This condition is called herpes zoster ophthalmicus, and it potentially threatens the eyesight if left untreated. See your doctor or ophthalmologist quickly if you notice shingles spreading to your face.

, If you have already been exposed to chickenpox and are concerned about getting shingles, or want to make a possible shingles episode less painful, consider getting the shingles vaccine. The vaccine is marketed under the name Zostavax, and adults 50 and older can receive one shot, whether or not they have had shingles before.


People who have never had chickenpox or shingles should avoid getting the vaccine, instead opting for the varicella vaccine.

, Those who have never had chickenpox or shingles before should avoid contact with those people who have an outbreak of either. Blisters are contagious and should be avoided; exposure to fluid from shingles blisters causes chickenpox and possible shingles episodes later in life.


Shingles is more common in people older than 50 than it is in younger people.Those older than 50 should be especially vigilant about shingles.

, The coolness of the water will help soothe the pain and uncomfortableness of shingles. But make sure it's not too cold! Your skin will react to any extreme temperature, causing even more pain. And when you're done soaking, dry yourself off completely with a warm towel.


You could take an oatmeal or starch bath, too. In lukewarm water (not cold or hot), the oatmeal or starch will provide you a soothing, silkening feeling. Read wikiHow's How to Make an Oatmeal Bath for ideas!
Be sure to wash any towels you use in the hottest setting on your washing machine. You don't want to spread anything!

, Just like the bath, anything cool and wet will feel great on your skin. Just grab a washcloth, soak it in cool water, wring it out, and apply to your skin. After several minutes, repeat the process to renew the feeling.


Don't use ice packs! Those are too cold for your skin right now -- if you think it's sensitive normally, it's extra sensitive right now.
Always, always, always wash your towels after you use them, especially when you have shingles.

, Normal lotions -- especially those that are scented -- could just make the situation worse. Stick to lotions like calamine that are extra soothing and be sure to wash your hands after application. Remember to apply it only to the affected area.

, That's the stuff found in hot red peppers, believe it or not. While you probably shouldn't spend the afternoon rubbing peppers on yourself, you might find relief in using a cream that contains it. They're widely available at most pharmacies.


Keep in mind that this doesn't make the shingles go away -- but it will make you feel a whole lot better. Your case should clear up in about 3 weeks, for the record., Just on the sores, though! It'll dry them up and hasten the healing process. Just make a paste out of 2 parts baking soda (or cornstarch) to one part water. Leave the paste on for about 15 minutes, rinse it off, and pat dry with a towel. Then wash the towel when you're done!You can do this a few times a day. But don't do it too often! You could dry out your skin so thoroughly you exacerbate the problem.

Go to the emergency room or call emergency services.,
Stop taking the medicine.,
Ask your doctor about desensitization.",How to Get Rid of a Skin Rash Caused by Antibiotic Allergy1," If you believe you are experiencing an allergic reaction to antibiotics, seek medical help immediately, no matter how severe your symptoms are. Many allergic reactions are confined to skin rashes and will not result in any complications, but it's important to talk to your doctor about any reaction. Some rashes can be caused by Stevens-Johnson syndrome, a severe complication that needs hospitalization.Other rashes are a precursor to anaphylaxis, which can be life-threatening if not treated.Seek immediate medical assistance if you experience:Fever
Sore throat/mouth, with our without a cough
Facial swelling
Tongue swelling
Skin pain
Rashes and/or blisters
Hives
Difficulty breathing or tightness in the throat
An abnormally hoarse voice
Hives or swelling
Nausea or vomiting
Abdominal pain
Dizziness or fainting
Rapid heart beat
Feelings of doom;
, If you're experiencing any allergic reactions to an antibiotic, you must discontinue using that medication, and avoid all exposure to it. Exposure can happen accidentally, so it's important to take preventative action.


Tell health care workers about your allergy any time you are receiving medical treatment of any kind.Ensure that this is included in your medical records for future reference, but don't ever assume medical personnel have seen the chart or know of your allergy. It is your responsibility to communicate your allergies when being treated.
Wear a medical alert bracelet. These bracelets can be invaluable, especially if you ever require emergency care while unconscious. It alerts health care workers about your allergy in times when you cannot communicate your allergy.You may want to carry an epinephrine auto-injector (commonly called an ""Epipen""). This is typically only needed for people susceptible to anaphylaxis, but your doctor may recommend that you have one if your allergies are severe., In most cases, if you have a known allergy, your doctor will prescribe an alternative drug. In some very isolated cases where benefit outweighs the risk and there are not alternative treatments, that may not be an option. If you must take a particular drug and have a known allergy to that medication, your doctor may work with you through a drug desensitization treatment.During drug desensitization treatments, your doctor will administer a very small dose of the drug you're allergic to, and will monitor your symptoms. Then they will administer an increasingly larger dose every 15 to 30 minutes, over the course of several hours or even days.If you are able to tolerate the desired dosage without any adverse reactions, your doctor may then safely prescribe a regular course of the medication.This is generally done in severe cases and should only be done by a professional with training in emergency treatment.

Rinse off your skin.,
Avoid touching anything.,
Change your clothes.,
Avoid itching.",How to Get Rid of Poison Oak Rash1," The first thing you need to do when you are exposed to poison oak is rinse off any exposed skin. Use soap and warm water as soon as possible, ideally within 30 minutes of your exposure.If you are still in the woods away from a bathroom, look for a nearby stream and rinse your skin. This will get rid of any urushiol (the substance that triggers an allergic reaction) left of your skin, which will help reduce irritation.
If you don't have any water, you can use rubbing alcohol or lemon juice over the rash as well. This will help remove the urushiol.;
, Once you know you have been exposed, you should limit who and what you touch until you have a chance to rinse off. Poison oak is not contagious unless you still have urushiol on your skin, so you can touch people and objects once you wash your skin off properly., Urushiol can be spread from your clothes, which can spread the rash over your body as well as to other people. To prevent this, remove any clothes you had on when you were exposed that can be removed.


Once you remove your clothes, wash them according to their tag instructions to remove any urushiol on them. Just to be safe, wash them in a load by themselves to ensure no cross contamination.
You should also wash off any tools or other objects that might have come into contact with the plant or your skin after you were exposed., You can transfer the rash across your body if you scratch too much while the urishiol is on your skin. Once the urishiol is washed off your skin, you are no longer in jeopardy of spreading the rash across your skin, so you can touch your skin normally.Although you cannot make the rash spread after you get the urushiol off your skin, you can irritate the rash and cause skin damage. Try to avoid itching any portion of the rash, even if it itches badly, to ensure that your rash heals as fast as possible.

Take oral antihistamines.,
Apply calamine lotion.,
Try hydrocortisone cream.",How to Get Rid of a Skin Rash Caused by Antibiotic Allergy2," Antihistamines increase the passage of white blood cells in your body while reducing your body's production of histamine, which your immune system releases in response to an allergen.Depending on the severity of your reaction, your doctor may recommend a prescription-strength antihistamine, or they may advise you to use an over-the-counter antihistamine.Diphenhydramine (Benadryl). In the case of severe allergy, it is always good to use diphenhydramine (Benadryl) as this is a strong antihistamine. Consider keeping some in your first aid kit for emergencies.
Other common over-the-counter antihistamines include loratadine (Claritin), cetirizine (Zyrtec), or chlorpheniramine (Aller-Chlor).The dosage you take will depend on a number of factors, including your age and the particular antihistamine you are taking.Follow the instructions on the package, or ask a doctor or pharmacist for dosage instructions.
Do not drive or operate machinery after taking antihistamines, as most first generation antihistamines (like Benadryl) can cause severe drowsiness, making it difficult to function.Do not use antihistamines if you are pregnant or breastfeeding. These medications may cause adverse side effects in infants and could cause birth defects in developing fetuses.Do not give antihistamines to children under four years of age. If your little one is experiencing a severe allergy, take them to emergency room. Do not wait it out with respiratory difficulties or facial swelling — get emergency care as soon as possible.
Some elderly patients experience adverse side effects from antihistamine. These side effects include confusion, dizziness, drowsiness, nervousness, and irritability.This places them at risk for falling. Falling and breaking hips can be fatal to the elderly, as their immune systems are not as robust as young to middle-aged adults.

, If you are experiencing a rash or hives caused by an allergic reaction, calamine lotion may help soothe the itching and discomfort.Calamine lotion contains a mixture of calamine, zinc oxide, and other ingredients. Calamine and zinc oxide are both known anti-itch topical medications.Calamine is for external use only. You should not ingest calamine, nor should you apply it near the eyes, nose, mouth, genitals, or anal areas., Low-dose hydrocortisone cream is available over-the-counter at 0.5 or one percent concentrations, though stronger concentrations are available by prescription. This topical medication suppresses your body's immune system reaction to relieve skin irritations, itching, and rashes.Hydrocortisone cream is a topical steroid. This class of medication is generally safe, but should not be used for more than seven consecutive days to avoid complications, including itching, cracked skin, thinned skin, and acne.Topical hydrocortisone should not be used on children under two years of age. Do not use this medication if you are pregnant or breastfeeding, unless otherwise directed by your physician.Apply to the affected areas one to four times daily for up to seven days. Avoid contact with the eyes if you are applying this medication to your face."

Take a tepid bath.,
Apply a cold compress.,
Avoid irritants.,
Refrain from scratching or rubbing.,
Avoid exposure to heat.,
Wear comfortable clothing.",How to Get Rid of a Skin Rash Caused by Antibiotic Allergy3," Both hot and cold temperature extremes can affect hives, and may cause them to worsen when hives are already present.For best results, take a comfortable, room-temperature bath to soothe skin rashes.Sprinkle baking soda, uncooked oatmeal, or finely-ground colloidal oatmeal into your bath to help relieve itching.Avoid using soap until you know whether or not a given soap brand will irritate your hives., Cool, wet compresses can help alleviate the symptoms associated with rashes and hives. Exposure to a cold, wet bandage or dressing can help soothe irritated skin, and may help reduce inflammation by slowing blood flow to the rash., There are many things that can irritate hives and rashes. Even if you are not normally affected by common household irritants, it's best to avoid them until you know how your current rash/hives will react to these items.Common irritants include:Cosmetics
Dye (including dye used in clothing)
Fur and leather products
Hair coloring
Latex
Nickel products, including jewelry, zippers, buttons, and kitchen utensils
Nail care products, including nail polish and artificial nails
Soap and household cleaning products

, Even though your rash may itch very intensely, it's important to avoid scratching or rubbing the rash/hives. Scratching can cause the skin to break, leaving you prone to infection and delaying the healing process., In some people, exposure to heat and humidity can further irritate hives and rashes.If you are experiencing rashes or hives, avoid exposure to heat, humidity, and exercise., If you are experiencing rashes and hives, it's important that you choose the right clothing to prevent further irritating your skin. Choose loose, smooth-textured material like cotton. Avoid constricting clothing and any materials that are rough and scratchy like wool."

Talk with your doctor about the need for curettage or electrodesiccation.",How to Treat Skin Cancer," Although skin cancer can develop anywhere on the body, it's most likely to occur on areas with the most sun exposure.It's the UV radiation in the sun that damages the DNA of skin cells and makes them mutate into cancer cells. Thus, spend more time checking parts of your body that get the most sun, such as your scalp, face (especially your nose), ears, neck, upper chest, forearms and hands. Look for unusual marks and blemishes on your skin, especially new growths (see below).


It's obviously a good idea to not let certain areas get constant sun exposure, but some outdoor jobs make it difficult. If you can't always cover skin up, then apply a strong sunscreen that blocks out UV radiation.
Women tend to be more susceptible to skin cancer on their legs and upper arms because they wear skirts, shorts and halter tops.
Check your skin for unusual spots while you're naked (just prior to bathing, for example) so you can see as much of your skin as possible. Use a magnifying glass if your eyesight is poor.;
, Some people are more susceptible to skin cancer than others because they have more risk factors. The main risk factors currently identified include: fair skin with freckles, red hair, over-exposure to UV radiation (from the sun or tanning beds), history of serious sunburns, having lots of moles, prior radiation treatments, weakened immunity, exposure to arsenic and a family history of skin cancer.Some of these risk factors can't be avoided (skin complexion), but some are merely behaviors that can be changed, such as being cautious while in the sun.


Any skin color is susceptible to cancer, but lighter shades have less pigment (melanin), which is protective against the damaging effects of UV radiation. This makes people with lighter skin more at risk for skin cancer.Blistering sunburns as a child/teenager increases your risk of getting skin cancer as an adult.
People who live in sunny and/or high-altitude climates get more UV exposure. That's beneficial for producing vitamin D and lowering your risk of depression, but a potential risk factor for developing skin cancer.
Moles are not cancerous, but large irregularly shaped ones (called dysplastic nevi) can become cancerous when exposed to lots of UV radiation., It's important to understand the differences between normal marks on the skin (such as freckles, moles, warts, pimples) and skin cancer. For examples, basal cell carcinoma often appears as pearly/waxy bumps in its early stages, and later as a flat, flesh-colored or brown scar-like lesions.In contrast, squamous cell carcinoma often appear firm, red nodules and progress to flat lesions with scaly, crusted surfaces. Finally, melanomas can appear as large brownish spots with darker speckles, or small lesions with irregular borders and colorful speckles (red, white, blue-black).


Basal cell carcinomas almost always appear in sun-exposed areas, such as your neck or face.
Squamous cell carcinomas also appear in sun-exposed areas and are more common in darker-skinned people.
Melanoma tends to develop anywhere, even on skin that has no sun exposure. It has a tendency to develop on the palms, soles, fingertips or toes.

, A handy acronym to learn and help you identify potential melanomas on your skin is referred to as the ABCDEs of melanoma.More specifically, the characteristics are: A = asymmetry, B = border, C = color, D = diameter and E = evolving.


Asymmetry: one half of the mole/blemish is unlike the other half.
Border: a mole/blemish with an irregular, scalloped or poorly defined border.
Color: the mole/blemish is varied from one area to another — has shades of tan, brown or black, or is sometimes white, red or blue.
Diameter: melanomas are usually greater than 6 mm when diagnosed, but they can be a little smaller.
Evolving: a mole/blemish that looks different from others or is changing in size, shape or color.
Consult your dermatologist immediately if any of your moles or pigmented spots exhibit the above-mentioned signs or features.

, If you find unusual looking marks or blemishes on your skin, particularly if you didn't notice them before or they've recently transformed, see your doctor right away. Your family physician can rule out most other skin conditions that can mimic cancer (such as eczema, psoriasis, ingrown hairs, carbuncles, skin tags), but you'll likely get referred to a skin specialist called a dermatologist.Remember that catching skin cancer early makes treatment much more effective.To better diagnose your skin condition, the doctor will likely take a skin biopsy (tissue sample) and look at it under a microscope. Different types of skin biopsies are called a shave biopsy and a punch biopsy.
In addition to a suspicious look, skin cancer can get itchy, inflamed and tender to touch. In some cases, particularly with melanoma, the skin can bleed and form a scab.
Most cases of skin cancer change/grow slowly. If it gets bigger quickly, it's usually a more serious variety of skin cancer.

, There are a number of non-invasive and quick procedures that are used if your skin cancer is a simple basal cell carcinoma or a thin squamous cell carcinoma — not nearly as serious or dangerous as melanomas.Examples include radiation therapy, chemotherapy, photodynamic therapy and biological therapy.


Radiation therapy uses high-powered focal x-rays to kill skin cancer cells. It's typically used for basal cell carcinomas that can't easily be cut out. Patients often need 15-30 treatments.
Chemotherapy involves using cancer killing drugs in ointments or creams that are applied directly to the skin lesion. This treatment is limited for cancers on the skin's surface, not deeper ones.
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) uses laser light after chemicals are applied to the skin and absorbed. The combination destroys cancer cells because the drugs make them sensitive to the high-intensity light.
Biological therapy (or immunotherapy) enlists your immune system to kill cancerous cells. You're given compounds (interferon, imiquimod) made by your body or in the lab that boost your natural defenses against cancer., Skin cancer treatment varies greatly and depends on the size, type, depth and location of the lesion(s). Small skin cancers on the surface are easiest to remove, either by shaving them off or by freezing them off.Getting cryosurgery is a sign your skin cancer is small and not very dangerous. Your doctor then applies liquid nitrogen to the lesion to freeze and kill the cells, and then the dead tissue eventually sloughs off when it thaws — it takes a few days.


Cryosurgery can be very effective for small basal cell carcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas because they are closer to the surface of the skin, but it's not often used for deeper melanomas.
Cryosurgery is also used to remove warts and skin tags. It's a quick and simple procedure that's that very painful.

, Excisional surgery involves cutting (or excising) out the cancerous tissue and the surrounding margin of healthy skin.Sometimes quite a bit of normal skin is removed around the lesion just to be on the safe side, which leaves a relatively large wound to heal. This type of surgery is appropriate for any type of skin cancer, even deeper melanomas.


Excisional surgery is performed by your dermatologist during an office visit. The area around the lesion is numbed with topical anesthesia.
The removed marginal (normal) skin is always examined under the microscope to see if it's truly free of cancer cells.

, Mohs surgery involves removing successive layers of skin from a lesion and examining each layer under the microscope until no cancerous cells can be seen.It's similar to excisional surgery, but it allows cancer cells to be removed without taking lots of surrounding healthy skin (smaller wounds and quicker recovery). Mohs surgery is more appropriate for larger, recurring or difficult-to-treat skin cancers.


Mohs surgery is often used on the nose, where it's necessary to conserve as much skin as possible.
Mohs surgery has a reputation for offering the highest cure rate for difficult-to-treat basal cell carcinomas., This treatment involves scraping away the surface tumor with a sharp, spoon-shaped tool called a curette and then destroying any remaining cancer cells with an electric needle (electrodessication).The electricity not only destroys cancer cells, but it also cauterizes the wound so it doesn't bleed. The procedure is often repeated up to 3 times to get all of the cancerous cells.


Electrodesiccation is used on essentially all skin cancer types, although it's more effective and efficient on smaller lesions closer to the surface of the skin.
This technique tends to leave a moderate wound, less than regular excisional surgery, but bigger than that left from Mohs surgery.

Try a cool compress.,
Use aloe vera.,
Try witch hazel.,
Use over the counter creams.",How to Get Rid of Poison Oak Rash2," Calamine lotion is a great over the counter anti-itch cream that will help calm the skin of your poison oak rash. Apply the lotion directly to your rash, using enough to cover the whole area. You can reapply as needed., Use oatmeal in a bath to help reduce itching and sooth your skin. Pour two cups of uncooked oatmeal into a nylon stocking or sock. Tie the end of the sock to the tap of the tub to allow the water to run through it, which will disperse the soothing qualities of the oatmeal through the bath. Then soak your whole body, or just the affected area, in the tub for at least 30 minutes.


You can repeat as often as needed.You can also use oatmeal infused soap products to help. Aveeno has multiple washes and bubble baths that may help relieve irritation. , If your rash is small, slice some fresh cucumbers and place them over your rash. For more coverage, make a cucumbers paste by sending the cucumbers through a food processor. Spread this directly to your skin or spread it across a thin cotton towel and make it into a compress to help sooth your skin.


Cucumber also has anti-inflammatory agents to help with swelling and may also help hydrate your skin.Replace the cucumber every one to two hours.

, Apple cider vinegar can help reduce the pH of your skin, which can help reduce itching. To apply it to your skin, soak a brown paper bag in some apple cider vinegar, then use the soaked bag as a compress. Replace the bag as needed or when the apple cider vinegar has dried.

, Since the rash causes skin irritation, a cool compress will help relieve the pain. Soak a clean, soft cotton washcloth or towel in cool water. Wring out the water and lay it against your skin.


Reapply as often as needed or when the towel gets too warm, which is typically 15 to 30 minutes., Apply aloe vera gel to help reduce or stop your rash from itching.Aloe vera has been used for a long time to help heal in skin wounds and provide an anti-inflammatory agent for skin. Apply the gel directly to the rash to help reducing the itching. Once it dries, you can rinse off any residue with warm water.


Reapply aloe vera gel as often as needed., If your rash has blisters that have started oozing fluids, apply witch hazel. Soak a cotton ball it witch hazel and gently rub the liquid against your blisters. This will help relieve the itchiness as well as dry out the fluids from the blisters.


You can also use it to relieve itching even if you don't have blisters.

Recognize poison oak rash.,
Learn why you get a rash.,
Call your physician.",How to Get Rid of Poison Oak Rash3," A poison oak rash can vary. In general, the rash will be very itchy, extremely red with red bumps. These bumps may turn into blisters that ooze clear fluids. The rash may be streaky or patchy and will range from mild to extremely severe depending on your exposure.


The rash typically develops 12 to 48 hours after exposure to the plant., The leaves and stems of poison oak contain a substance called urushiol, which triggers an allergic reaction in your skin. This reaction is what causes the rash that develops when you come into contact with the plant. Urushiol is also found in the roots and dead remnants of poison oak, so be careful when even if the poison oak plant is dead or uprooted. It can also become airborne if the plant is burned.

, If the itching from your rash is very severe, call your doctor. She may be able to prescribe you a topical steroid cream that will help you control the itching.


The rash should go away by itself with home treatments within one to three weeks, depending on how much you were exposed. If it doesn't, see your doctor.If you notice any trouble swallowing, have difficulty breathing, have a fever over 100 degreed Fahrenheit, the rash oozes pus, or there is severe swelling, call emergency services. You should also receive immediate help if your rash covers most or large parts of your body."

Know the different types of hyperpigmentation.,
Discuss your condition with a dermatologist.,
Get a prescription for a topical application.,
Consider getting a nonablative professional procedure.,
Visit a salon for a microdermabrasion treatment.,
Treat hyperpigmentation using over-the-counter medications.,
Try a home remedy.,
Limit your exposure to UV rays.,
Consider your medications.,
Be wary of professional skin treatments.",How to Treat Hyperpigmentation," Getting familiar with the types of hyperpigmentation will help you determine the right course of treatment and give you ideas for lifestyle changes you can make to prevent further discoloration from occurring. Understand that hyperpigmentation does not only occur on your face. Here are the three types of hyperpigmentation:Melasma. This type of hyperpigmentation is caused by hormonal fluctuations, and is a normal occurrence during pregnancy. It can also occur as a result of thyroid dysfunction and as a side effect of taking birth control pills or hormone therapy medication. This is a difficult type of hyperpigmentation to treat.

Lentigines. These are also known as liver spots or age spots. They are found on 90% of people over the age of 60, and are caused but exposure to UV rays.

Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH). This is caused by skin injury such as psoriasis, burns, acne, and some skin care treatments. It usually goes away as the skin regenerates and heals.;
, See a dermatologist to find out what type of hyperpigmentation is affecting your skin. After asking you questions about your lifestyle and medical history, your skin will be examined using a magnifying lamp. Expect your dermatologist to ask the following questions to help determine what type of hyperpigmentation you have:


How frequently do you use a tanning bed? How often do you use sunscreen? What is your level of sun exposure?
What are your current and past medical conditions?
Are you or have you recently been pregnant? Are you or have you recently taken birth control or done hormone replacement therapy?
What medications are you taking?
What plastic surgery or professional skin treatments have you undergone?
Did you wear sun screen or UV protection in your youth?

, Topical applications containing alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) and retinoids, which exfoliate and rejuvenate the skin, are helpful in treating hyperpigmentation of all types. The following types of topical applications are available:



Hydroquinone. This topical application is the most commonly used, and it's the only skin lightening treatment approved by the FDA.

Kojic acid. This acid is derived from a fungus and works similarly to hydroquinone.

Azelaic acid. Developed to treat acne, this has been found to be an effective treatment for hyperpigmentation as well.

Mandelic acid. Derived from almonds, this type of acid is used to treat all types of hyperpigmentation.

, If topical treatments don't work, your dermatologist might recommend getting a procedure done to target your hyperpigmentation. Available procedures include the following:Skin peels, including salicylic acid peels, to treat darkened skin areas. Skin peels are used when topical therapy fails.
IPL (Intense Pulsed Light) therapy. These target selective dark spots only. IPL devices are used under strict supervision under a trained physician.
Laser skin resurfacing.

, This is a very popular option among people with hyperpigmentation. Seek an experienced practitioner; abrading the skin can cause irritation, making the discoloration worse. Microdermabrasion should not be done too often, as your skin needs time to heal between treatments.

, If you want to treat hyperpigmentation without getting a prescription, look for these over-the-counter options:


Skin lightening creams. These works by slowing down melanin production and removing existing melanin from the skin. Look for products that contain a combination of these ingredients: cysteamine, hydroquinone, soy milk, cucumber, kojic acid, calcium, azelaic acid, or arbutin.
A topical treatment that contains Retin-A or alpha-hydroxy acids.

, Apply any of the following topically to help to lighten dark areas of the skin:


Rose hip oil
Sliced, pureed or the juice of cucumber
Lemon juice
Aloe Vera

, Exposure to UV rays is one of the most common causes of hyperpigmentation. While limiting exposure will do nothing to affect hyperpigmentation you already have it can help prevent further discoloration.


Always wear sunscreen. In strong, direct sun, wear a hat and long sleeves.
Don't use tanning beds.
Limit your time outside and don't sunbathe.

, In many cases you won't be able to stop taking a medication just because it causes hyperpigmentation. Hyperpigmentation is a common side effect of birth control and other medication containing hormones. If switching to a new medication or ceasing to take it is an option, it's something to consider.

, Hyperpigmentation can result from trauma to the skin, which can be caused by plastic surgery and other professional skin treatments. Be sure to do thorough research before opting to get plastic surgery. Make sure your doctor or practitioner is highly experienced.

Identify different biologics.,
Get pre-treatment testing.,
Receive or give yourself biologics injections.,
Have regular biologic infusions.,
Combine biologics with other psoriasis treatments.,
Watch for side effects.,
Speak to your doctor about your options.,
Recognize the benefits of biologic treatments.,
Be aware of the risk factors of using biologics.",How to Treat Psoriasis with Biologics," Biologics are protein-based drugs derived from living cells cultured in a laboratory. There are a large number of biologics used to treat psoriasis. These drugs target different aspects of psoriasis. Your doctor will decide on your treatment based on your symptoms. Having an idea of what types of biologic your doctor may prescribe can help you understand your psoriasis treatment. Biologic drugs for psoriasis include:Drugs that block TNF-alpha, which leads to the production of excess skin cells. These include: Cimzia (certolizumab pegol), Enbrel (etanercept), Humira (adalimumab), Remicade (infliximab) and Simponi (golimumab). These can stop the rapid growth of skin cells and/or damage to joint tissue. They can also minimize inflammation and the inflammatory cycle of psoriasis.
Interleukin 12/23, which blocks specific proteins associated with psoriasis. Stelara (ustekinumab) is the biologic most often used to block these proteins. These drugs can ease inflammation and stop the inflammation cycle.
Interleukin 17-A, which binds and inhibits a protein that causes psoriatic inflammation as well as plaque psoriasis. The biologics used to block interleukin-17A are Cosentyx (secukinumab) and Taltz (ixekizumab). These drugs can relieve inflammation, stop the inflammatory cycle of psoriasis, and may improve your symptoms.;
, Some individuals with psoriasis may not be ideal candidates for biologic treatments. Your doctor will prescribe blood tests to ensure that you don’t have any active infections, diseases, or a compromised immune system. Have these tests before you begin any to ensure that you get maximum benefit from biologics.Recognize that if your immune system is significantly compromised or you have active infections, you may not use biologics. In addition, individuals with infectious diseases, especially tuberculosis, may not be able to undergo treatment with biologics. Biologics may also not be suitable for individuals with cancer., Most biologic treatments for psoriasis are administered by injection. You can either inject these drugs yourself on a regular basis or your doctor may do it for you. The most common injectable biologics are Cosentyx, Enbrel, Humira, Stelara, Cimzia and Taltz.Follow dosing instructions that your doctor provides. In general, you’ll get injections at regular intervals such as once every week or two weeks. Use injectable biologics continuously to maintain your results.
Undergo additional blood testing while using injectable biologics to determine their effectiveness.

, Some biologic treatments for psoriasis are administered by intravenous infusion in a doctor’s office.The most common infusion biologic is Remicade.Like biologic injections, you’ll need infusions at regular intervals to maintain your results.Receive three infusions of Remicade during your first six weeks of treatment. After that, you’ll have repeat infusions every eight weeks.
Recognize that Remicade may also minimize any progression of joint damage as a result of psoriasis.

, Your doctor may combine biologics with other psoriasis treatments, including oral and topical medications and phototherapy. Combination therapy can increase the effects of your treatment. This may be best way to ease your symptoms and prevent them in the future.Talk to your doctor about using a topical solution for treating small and localized areas with psoriasis.
Try going out for short bursts of sun exposure a few times a day. Do not stay out too long in the sun, and avoid getting sunburned.Be aware that using phototherapy with Remicade can increase your risk of skin cancer.
If your scalp is affected, you can try using tar shampoo for relief.

, Like any medication, you may experience side effects from biologic treatments for psoriasis. These range from mild to severe and may include skin reactions and flu-like symptoms. Contact your doctor if you experience any of the following common and/ or rare side effects of biologics:Respiratory infections
Flu-like symptoms
Injection site reactions
Seizures (rare)

, Biologics are a great option to treat severe psoriasis that hasn’t responded to other treatments. It’s also good for individuals who have had bad side effects from systemic treatments including oral medications.If you have had either of these experiences with other psoriasis treatment, ask your doctor if biologics are a good option for you.


Let your doctor know why you’d like to try biologics. For example, “Dr. Gonzalez, these pills don’t seem to be working for me as well any longer and I keep having recurrent bouts of psoriasis. I read recently that there are newer treatments called biologics. Are these something that would benefit my psoriasis?”
Ask your doctor about combining treatments or switching over only using biologics. You may want to discuss costs, including what insurance may cover and payment programs that some drug companies offer. Not all insurance companies cover biologics and other may require pre-authorization for treatments. Make sure to check with your insurance company before you undergo treatment with biologics., Doctors have used biologic treatments for at least the last 100 years. However, new technologies and developments have made biologics much more widely available and effective.Some additional benefits of using biologics to treat your psoriasis include:


Stopping the inflammatory cycle of psoriasis
Decreasing plaque buildup
Halting joint damageReducing inflammation

, Just as there are benefits to using biologic treatments for your psoriasis, you may expose yourself to risk as well. Recognizing the risks can not only help you and your doctor determine the best form of treatment, but also catch any potential issues before they become complications.Recognize that biologics can lead to rare side effects that include developing nervous system disorders such as multiple sclerosis, blood disorders, and certain types of cancer.
Be aware of other risks including heart failure in patients with cardiovascular conditions, changes in blood pressure, difficulty breathing, and dizziness. You may even have abdominal discomfort or headaches."

Understand what causes the hives.,
Get away from the allergens.,
Protect yourself from pollen.",How to Treat Hives Naturally1," Anyone can get hives. About 20% of the population have experienced them at some point in their lives.During an allergic reaction, certain skin cells, such as the mast cells that contain histamine and other chemical messengers like cytokines, are stimulated to release the histamine and other cytokines. These increase the amount of leakage from the tiny blood vessels in the skin and cause the swelling and itching that is so characteristic of hives., The first step in treating hives is to ensure you are away from the source of the allergic response. If you know what it is, which is how most cases of hives are, remove the substance that is causing the allergic reaction from your skin or environment. Common allergens that are easy to determine are poison ivy, poison oak, insect bites, wool clothing, a cat, or a dog. Avoid these or any other known allergen as much as possible.


In some cases of chronic hives, you may have to do some detective work to determine what your specific hive trigger is. Other common causes are food, medication, chemicals such as acetone, a polymer such as latex, an viral, fungal, or bacterial infection, pet hair or dander, plants, and physical stimuli such as pressure, temperature, and sun exposure., There are some cases where environmental agents can cause hives. If you react to pollen, avoid being outside in the morning and in the evening when pollen levels are at their highest. Keep your windows closed during these times as well and avoid drying clothes outside. Change into “indoor clothes” as soon as possible and wash your “outdoor clothes” right away.


Using a humidifier in the home can be helpful as well.
You may also need to avoid other common air irritants such as insect sprays, tobacco smoke, wood smoke, and fresh tar or paint as much as possible. "

Learn about the virus.,
Determine if you have visible lesions that bother you.,
Decide if you want to be proactive about preventing transmission.,
Discuss your options with your doctor.",How to Treat Molluscum (Molluscum Contagiosum)1," Molluscum contagiosum is an infection that is caused by a virus that results in noticeable skin lesions that can appear anywhere on the body. These lesions are small, raised, and white or pink in color. They are usually no smaller than the size of a pinhead, but no bigger than the size of a pencil eraser. Molluscum outbreaks should eventually clear up all on their own (usually within six to 12 months, but in some cases it may take up to four years).There are three main groups that are affected by molluscum: include children, sexually active young adults, and those with compromised immune systems.
One of the biggest reasons that people choose not to let this condition clear up on its own is if the lesions are located on or around their genitals and they want to continue being sexually active.;
, Since the lesions will usually go away on their own, there is often not a pressing need to get them removed or treated; however, if the lesions are located in an obviously visible location on your body (like the face, neck, or arms), you may choose to look into treatment options because that will make you more comfortable.Visible lesions in the genital area may be an indication of another kind of sexually transmitted disease, so it’s important to get these lesions checked out by a doctor.

, If you are especially anxious about transmitting this disease to others, you should consider treatment options. If you are sexually active, have children, or otherwise feel like contact with others is unavoidable, you may want to consider treatment.Transmission of the molluscum virus occurs through direct person-to-person contact or by touching an infected object. The virus lives inside the top layer of skin of the lesion (not inside your body), so researchers believe that contact with the material inside the lesions is what causes transmission of the disease.

, Whatever you decide, you should discuss your choices with a medical professional so they can help guide you to the right course of treatment and answer any questions you may have.


It is never a good idea to try to remove a molluscum bump yourself. Doing so may cause the virus to spread, cause unnecessary pain, create a serious bacterial infection, or cause scarring that might have otherwise been avoided.
Discussing your options with a doctor is important, especially since there are treatments advertised on the Internet to treat molluscum that do more harm than good.

Try to keep from scratching at your blisters.,
Use a baking soda paste to reduce irritation.,
Apply a cold compress to your blisters.,
Spread Benzocaine cream on your blisters after you remove the cold compress.,

Consider spinal cord or peripheral nerve stimulation.,
Talk to your doctor about pulsed radiofrequency lesioning (PRF).,
Know the symptoms of shingles.,
Visit your doctor within 24 to 72 hours if you think you have shingles.,
Use a topical medication to clear the shingles up before they get worse.",How to Treat Nerve Pain Caused by Shingles," As difficult as it may be, leave your blisters alone and avoid scratching. They will crust over and then fall off on their own. If you scratch them, they will open up and become more susceptible to infection.


You will also spread bacteria with your hands if you scratch at the blisters. If this does happen inadvertently, always wash your hands afterward to stay hygienic.;
, Baking soda has a pH greater than 7 (making it alkaline), giving it the ability to neutralize the chemical that creates the itching sensation. The chemical creating the itching sensation is acidic with a pH that is less than 7.Apply a paste made of 3 teaspoons baking soda mixed with 1 teaspoon of water. This relieves itching and helps the blisters dry out quicker.
You can apply this paste as often as needed to relieve the itching.

, Use a cool, moist compress to ease discomfort. You can apply this compress for up to 20 minutes at a time, several times a day.


You can make a cold compress by wrapping an ice block in a clean towel and pressing it against your skin. Alternatively, you can use a bag of frozen vegetables. Just make sure not to put it directly on your skin and not to keep it on your skin for more than 20 minutes at a time as both of these conditions can lead to tissue damage.

, Apply a topical cream, such as nonprescription benzocaine cream, directly after your cool compress application. Benzocaine works as an anesthetic, numbing the nerve endings in the skin., Infected sores are bad news, so if you think that your sores may be infected, you should contact your doctor immediately. Signs that your sores are infected include:A fever
An increase in inflammation that causes additional pain
The sore feels warm to the touch
The sore is shiny and smooth
Your symptoms are getting worse

, You can soak any infected sores in Burow’s solution (commercial name, Domeboro) or tap water. This helps to decrease oozing, clean away any crusting and soothe the skin.Burow’s solution has antibacterial and astringent properties. You can purchase it without a prescription at your local pharmacy.
Instead of soaking your sores, you can also apply the Burow’s solution directly onto your sores via the cold compress. You can apply the compress for up to 20 minutes, several times a day.

, Once a lesion has crusted over, you can apply capsaicin cream (e.g. Zostrix) to it. You can apply the capsaicin cream up to 5 times a day in order to promote healing.

, After the blisters have healed, you can apply a 5% lidocaine patch to your skin to reduce nerve pain. The lidocaine patch provides effective pain relief without the risk of negative side effects


These are available at most pharmacies and online. Stronger patches may be available through your doctor.

, Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs) are often prescribed in addition to other narcotic medications in order to boost pain relief. They are inexpensive and odds are you already have at least one in your bathroom cabinet.


Examples of NSAIDs include acetaminophen, ibuprofen or indomethacin. These medications can be taken up to three times per day – just be sure to follow the label for instructions on the appropriate dosage for you.

, Corticosteroids are often prescribed for relatively healthy elderly people who present with moderate to severe nerve pain. The corticosteroids are often prescribed in addition to antiviral medications.


Talk to your doctor about this option. Effective (that is, stronger) corticosteroids are available by prescription only.

, Narcotic analgesics are sometimes prescribed to treat severe nerve pain caused by shingles. However, narcotics only provide symptomatic relief – they do not treat the cause of the pain.


In addition, narcotics are addictive substances which the patient can quickly become dependent on. Therefore their use must be carefully monitored by a physician.

, Sometimes tricyclic antidepressants are prescribed to treat specific types of nerve pain caused by shingles. Although their exact mechanism is unknown, they work by blocking pain receptors in the body.

, Antiepileptic drugs are widely used in pain clinics to treat neuropathic pain. There are many types of antiepileptic drugs, such as phenytoin, carbamazepine, lamotrigine and gabapentin, any of which may be prescribed to treat nerve pain in shingles patients.


For the above two steps, your doctor will know if these are viable treatments for you. In general, these two are reserved for more serious cases of nerve pain.

, One of the simplest surgical techniques for relieving nerve pain is an injection of alcohol or phenol into the peripheral branch of the nerve. This causes permanent damage to the nerve, thus helping to prevent pain.


This is a procedure done by a medical professional. Your health history and condition will determine if this is a suitable route to pursue.

, This treatment involves the placement of electrodes over the nerves that are causing the pain. These electrodes deliver tiny, painless electrical impulses to nearby nerve pathways.


Exactly how these impulses relieve pain is uncertain. One theory is that the impulses stimulate the production of endorphins, your body’s natural painkillers.
Unfortunately, this treatment doesn’t work for everyone, but it tends to be more effective if it is given in conjunction with a drug called pregabalin.

, These devices are similar to TENS, but are implanted ‘’underneath’’ the skin. Like TENS units, you can turn these units on and off as needed to control pain.


Before the device is surgically implanted, doctors do a trial first using a thin wire electrode. The trial is done to ensure that the stimulator will provide effective pain relief.
The electrode is inserted through your skin into the epidural space over the spinal cord for a spinal cord stimulator, or under your skin above a peripheral nerve in the case of a peripheral nerve stimulator.

, This a very safe and effective form of pain relief that uses radiofrequency to modulate pain at a molecular level. After a single treatment, the pain relief can last for up to 12 weeks.

, Shingles first presents as pain, itching and tingling of the skin. Sometimes these initial symptoms are followed by confusion, fatigue, fever, headache, memory loss, an upset stomach and/or stomach pain.


Up to five days after the appearance of these initial symptoms, a painful rash may appear on one side of the face or body.

, If you think you have shingles, visit your physician within 24 to 72 hours. Antiviral drugs like famciclovir, valtrex and acyclovir can be used to effectively treat the symptoms of shingles, but only if they are started within 72 hours of onset., In addition to antiviral medications, your physician may prescribe a topical medication, such as caladryl. Caladryl may help your already open lesions by reducing pain and itching.


Caladryl works by interfering with the pain signals the nerves send to the brain and is available in gel, lotion, spray or stick form.
Caladryl may be applied every 6 hours, up to 4 times a day. You need to wash and dry the affected area prior to application.

Take a clean, cotton towel and soak it in cool water. Squeeze out the extra water and place over the affected areas. Leave it on for 10 minutes, then re-soak the towel to keep the water cool, which will in turn keep your skin cool.


You can use a cool compress as long as you need to soothe away the hives.
Avoid using very cold water because, in some people, this can make the hives worse., Oatmeal is one of the best natural ways to treat the itchy, irritated skin associated with hives. Get a cup of plain, all natural rolled oats and place them in a food processor or coffee grinder. Pulse until there the oatmeal becomes a thick powder. Once it is ground into the fine substance, place one to two cups of rolled oats in a warm or cool bath, which will make the water a white colored, thick consistency. Get into the bath and soak for as long as you want. Repeat as often as needed.


Do not use hot water or cold water, since it often causes the hives to become irritated.
You can add up to four cups of milk for added relief from the irritation., Bromelain is an enzyme found in pineapples and can help reduce the swelling of hives. Crush some pineapple, either canned or fresh, and place it on a thin cotton towel. Pull the four corners of the towel together and tie them off with a rubber band. Place the damp, pineapple filled towel over the hives.


When not using the pineapple compress, store in a closed container in the refrigerator. Use as often as needed but replace the pineapple every 24 hours.
You can also place pieces of pineapple directly on your hives.
Bromelain also comes in a supplement, which you can also take to help with the hives., Baking soda can be used to help relieve the itching of your hives. Mix 1 tbsp of baking soda with enough water to make a paste. Try a few drops at first and stir, adding more as needed. Using your fingers or soft spatula, spread the paste over the hives. Use as often as needed and rinse off with cool water.


You can also use cream of tartar if you have it. Make a paste in the same manner and apply as needed., There are many healing nutrients in vinegar. Pick any kind of vinegar. Pour 1 tsp of vinegar into 1 tbsp of water and stir. Using a cotton ball or napkin, apply the mixture to your hives. This will help soothe the itching., Nettles have been traditionally used to treat hives because it is natural antihistamine. You can make nettles into tea, eat it, or take it as a supplement. To make a cup of nettles tea, take 1 tsp of the dried herb and add it to a cup of hot water. Let it steep and allow it to cool. Soak a cotton towel with the nettles tea, wring out the excess tea, and place the damp towel over the hives. Use as often as needed.


For the nettles supplement, take up to six 400 mg tablets per day. To eat it, steam the plant and then eat it.Store unused nettles tea in the refrigerator in a closed container. Make new tea every 24 hours.

, Calamine lotion is a mixture of zinc oxide and zinc carbonate. It can be applied to hives to relieve the itching as often as needed. When the itching subsides or you want to reapply, rinse off the calamine lotion with cool water.You can also use milk of magnesia or Pepto-Bismol on the hives as well. These are both alkaline, which will help relieve the itching."

Use rutin supplements.,
Take quercetin.,
Try coleus forskohlii.",How to Treat Hives Naturally3," A number of herbs and supplements have natural anti-inflammatory activity. Rutin is a natural bioflavonoid found in citrus fruits and buckwheat. It can function to reduce inflammation and swelling by limiting the leakage from blood vessels.Suggested dosage for rutin is 250 mg every 12 hours., Quercetin can also be effective in reducing inflammation and swelling. It is a flavonoid produced in the body from rutin.Eat more fruits and vegetables, such as apples, citrus fruits, onions, sage, parsley, dark cherries, grapes, blueberries, blackberries, and bilberries, to get more quercetin in your diet. You can also drink more tea and red wine or use more olive oil to increase your intake of it. You can take quercetin as a dietary supplement as well.Quercetin is more effective than the prescription drug cromolyn in blocking histamine release, which will also help with your hives.If you take the supplement, ask your doctor which dosage is right for your particular case of hives. It varies on a case by case basis., Coleus forskohlii is a plant native to Southeast Asia that is used in Ayurvedic medicine. Studies have shown that it reduces the histamine and leukotriene release from mast cells when you get hives.It is generally suggested that you take between 100 to 250 mg of coleus forskohii a day, but there are not strict guidelines. Ask you doctor which dosage is right for you.

Relax.,
Try deep breathing techniques.,
Practice positive affirmations.",How to Treat Hives Naturally4," While it is not known exactly how stress and hives are related, stress does seem to put a person at higher risk for having hives. Reduce your stress levels by trying to relax. Take time out of you schedule everyday to take part in relaxing activities, such as a leisurely walk, reading a book, gardening, or watching a movie.


Relaxing activities can be very subjective. Find whatever makes you happy and relaxed and do it every day., Deep breathing techniques have been shown to help reduce stress. Start by lying flat on your back. Use pillows under your knees and neck to make sure you are comfortable. Put your hands, palm down, on your stomach right below the rib cage. Place the fingers of your hands together so you can feel them separate and know you are doing the exercise correctly. Take a long, slow deep breath by expanding your belly, breathing like a baby breathes, meaning from the diaphragm. Your fingers should separate as they lie on your belly.


Make sure you are using your diaphragm to breathe rather than your rib cage. The diaphragm creates suction that pulls more air into your lungs than can be achieved by expanding the rib cage., Positive affirmations are phrases you say to yourself to help reduce your stress and bring up your mood. When saying these, use the present tense and repeat as often as you can. Examples of positive affirmations are:


Yes, I can do this.
I am successful.
I am getting healthy.
I feel better every day.
Some people write down their positive affirmations on sticky notes and post these notes everywhere they can to help them relax every day."

Recognize the symptoms.,
Diagnose hives.,
Take medicine for hives.,

The symptoms and appearance of hives can last for months and years. Hives can also appear on any area of the body, though the most common are the raised, itchy bumps that appear in the same area that was exposed to the allergen.


They are usually round, though hives can appear to “merge” into what looks like a large, irregularly shaped welt., The diagnosis of hives is generally straightforward and requires only a visual examination. If you were unable to find the allergen causing your hives on your own, your doctor can run tests when you are diagnosed to determine what causes your hives. He or she does this by performing an allergy test that test for skin reactions to a variety of substances.


If this method does not work, you may also need blood tests and a skin biopsy to examine the skin under a microscope., For a case of hives that is mild to moderate, antihistamines are often used. These may be over the counter medications or prescription antihistamines. These include:


Sedating antihistamines like Brompheniramine (Dimetane), Chlorpheniramine (Chlor-Trimeton) and Diphenhydramine (Benadryl).
Non-sedating antihistamines like Cetirizine (Zyrtec, Zyrtec-D), Clemastine (Tavist), Fexofenadine (Allegra, Allegra D) and Loratadine (Claritin, Claritin D, Alavert).
Over the counter corticosteroids in nasal sprays (Nasacort) and prescription corticosteroids including Prednisone, Prednisolone, Cortisol, and Methylprednisolone.
Mast-cell stabilizers such as Cromolyn sodium (Nasalcrom).
Leukotriene inhibitors like Montelukast (Singulair).
Topical immune-modulating substances (Protopic) and Pimecrolimus (Elidel)., In rare cases, hives can cause swelling in the throat and can cause an emergency situation that requires epinephrine. Epinephrine can also be used as an EpiPen in those who are severely allergic to a particular substance and require epinephrine to avoid anaphylaxis, which is a severe allergic reaction that may occur with or without the appearance of hives. The symptoms of an anaphylactic reaction include:


Skin rashes which may include hives, itching, and flushed or pale skin.
A sense of warmth.
The sensation or feeling a lump in the throat.
Wheezing or other difficulty in breathing.
A swollen tongue or throat.
A rapid pulse and heartbeat.
Nausea, vomiting or diarrhea.
Dizziness or fainting."

Look into cryotherapy.,
Consider curettage.,
Use lasers on the lesions.",How to Treat Molluscum (Molluscum Contagiosum)2," This method (freezing the lesion with liquid nitrogen) is the same process often used to remove warts from the skin. This method may leave scars.This kind of treatment is often good at eliminating the top lesion itself. And since that is where the virus lives in the body, this can help get rid of the outbreaks altogether.

, This is where the fluid from the bump is removed by piercing the core and scraping the underlying material. This method can also leave scars.Again, do not consider doing this yourself. While it may sound easy to do, you might unintentionally infect other parts of your body with the lesion fluid or transmit it to others in the process.
You could also cause a bacterial infection in the skin by scratching or scraping yourself.

The creams are applied directly to each lesion.The cream Imiquimod helps strengthen the skin’s immune system. This is sometimes used to treat the lesions.
These creams do not always remove the bumps and they may be harmful. So be sure to consult with your doctor before using any of them.

, Using retinoid or another kind of antiviral medicine on the skin can help cure the molluscum outbreak in most healthy patients. This kind of topical treatment helps eliminate the virus, thereby reducing the lesions over time.Make sure to follow your doctor’s instructions for application.

, This is an oral medication prescribed by a doctor and most often given to children because it is less painful and can be performed at home where the patient is more comfortable.Unfortunately, facial lesions don’t respond as well to this type of treatment as lesions in other parts of the body.
As with most medicines, cimetidine may cause unwanted side effects such as headache, diarrhea, dizziness, drowsiness, confusion, or depression."

, There are many therapies used to restore immune system functionality in patients with compromised immune systems. Some of these treatments include stimulating cytokines (chemical messages that enable communication within the cells of the immune system), introducing Interleukin-2 to help increase CD4 cells, or antiretroviral therapy., This kind of therapy aims to eliminate the ability of the virus to reproduce itself within its host. In many cases, this helps eradicate the virus altogether.This type of treatment often has severe side effects including flu-like symptoms, tenderness around the site of the lesion, depression, and lethargy.

, Lactic acid has been proven to help break up the keratin that clogs up hair follicles, leaving those unsightly bumps. AmLactin and Lac-Hydrin are two brands that can be purchased without a prescription.


Try topical retinoids. These are lotions that use derivations of vitamin A, which aids in dry skin. Look for Retin-A, Isotrex, or Differin at your local drugstore.Use urea cream, which breaks down dead skin and keratin. Be careful with this, however, as it can damage healthy skin if used too much. Always wash your hands directly after applying, and apply only as much as the directions instruct. Find a moisturizer that uses glycolic acid. This helps to dissolve the dead skin and buildup in the hair follicles.If you are unable to purchase a specialized brand of moisturizer for your bumps, look for mild lotions advertised for sensitive skin. Some ingredients in regular lotions can worsen your keratosis pilaris.

, Similar to moisturizers and creams, oils work to soften skin and the keratin in it. Try rubbing a little oil once or twice a day on the affected area of your skin.

If nothing else, spending time in the sun has direct links to lessening depression and anxiety, which is good for everyone., Taking extremely hot baths or showers can scald the skin and dry it out. When possible take warm or cool baths and showers to lessen the effect of the heat on your skin.

Talk to your doctor about Psoralen UVA light (PUVA) therapy.,
Get laser therapies.,
Avoid tanning beds as a form of therapy.",How to Treat Psoriasis with Phototherapy1," There are two different types of ultraviolet B (UVB) phototherapy, home and clinical. UVB phototherapy is undergone when the light penetrates the skin, which slows down the growth of the skin cells. Whether it is done at home or in a clinic, UVB phototherapy is given for specified periods of time and on a regular schedule.


The specific time periods and your schedule for this treatment depend on how extensive your psoriasis is and the specific areas of your body that are affected.
Home phototherapy can be done with UVB equipment or a newer technology, NarrowBand, which is being increasingly used by dermatologists.
Before you can use any home treatments, you will need to be trained to use the home equipment. You should also go for regular check ups with your physician while doing UVB treatments at home. ;

Start with five to 10 minutes of sun exposure on the affected areas of your skin every day. To do this, go outside when the sun is highest, which is typically around noon. Cover any unaffected areas of skin with sunscreen, but keep those affected areas unprotected against the UVA and UVB rays.


You can increase your exposure to the sun by one minute until you get to the point where it is too much for your skin. Make sure you get out of the sun before you get sunburned. This can make your psoriasis worse.Talk to your physician before you start using sunlight as a treatment and make sure you tell your doctor what medications you are taking. There are some medications prescribed for psoriasis that may cause your skin to be sensitive to sunlight, which may cause severe sunburn. The medications that can cause this include coal tar, tazarotene, Elidel (pimecrolimus), and Protopic (tacrolimus). Your doctor will be able to tell you how long it is safe to stay in the sun., PUVA (Psoralen + UVA) is a type of phototherapy generally performed in a clinic.

A newly approved type of laser phototherapy is the excimer laser therapy, which emits UVB light. This method is best used on chronic, localized psoriasis, with extensive effectiveness on the scalp and with topical steroids. Typically, your skin will respond to the treatment within four to 10 sessions when done twice a week in a clinic or physician’s office.


You can also try pulsed dye laser, which is also used with psoriasis. It uses a dye with light wavelengths not UVA or UVB. Treatment is in a physician’s office or clinic, with treatment given every three weeks and lasting 15 to 30 minutes each session., Although phototherapy is a valid form of treatment for psoriasis, you should never use a tanning bed as a method of exposure to light. Tanning beds will increases your risk of serious skin cancer by almost 60%.

Pain or burning during urination or sex.
Thick (like cottage cheese), white discharge in the vagina. Note that not all women experience this symptom.;
, If you are having trouble determining whether or not you have a yeast infection, then consider some of the most frequent causes of yeast infections:



Antibiotics - Many women develop a yeast infection after taking antibiotics for several days.Antibiotics kill some of the good bacteria in your body, including the bacteria that prevents the overgrowth of yeast, which leads to yeast infections.If you have been taking antibiotics recently and are experiencing vaginal burning and itching, you might have a yeast infection.

Menstruation - A woman is most likely to develop a yeast infection around the time of her period. So if you're experiencing the above symptoms and it is near the time of your period, then you may have a yeast infection.Birth control - Birth control pills and one-time ""morning after"" pills cause a change in hormone levels, which in turn can bring about a yeast infection.Existing medical conditions - Some diseases or conditions, such as HIV or diabetes, can also cause yeast infections.Pregnancy - Due to the hormonal changes that accompany pregnancy, yeast infections are more likely during this time.General health - Illness, obesity, poor sleeping habits, and stress can increase the likelihood of developing a yeast infection., As in the case of pregnancies, there are tests you can take to determine what's going on down there. Normal vaginal pH is around 4, which is slightly acidic. Follow any instructions accompanying the test.In a pH test, you hold a piece of pH paper against the wall of your vagina for a few seconds. Then, compare the color of the paper to the chart provided with the test. The number on the chart for the color that best approximates the color of the paper is your vaginal pH number.If the test result is above 4, it's best to see your doctor. This is not indicative of a yeast infection, but could be a sign of another infection.If the test result is below 4, it is likely (but not definitively) a yeast infection.

, If you have never had a yeast infection before or are unsure about the diagnosis, then you should schedule an appointment with your doctor or a nurse at your gynecologist's office.Your doctor or nurse will perform a brief vaginal examination, and then use a cotton swab to take a sample of vaginal discharge in order to conduct a yeast count. This is called a wet mount. Your doctor may order additional tests to rule out other causes of your symptoms.Although yeast infections are very common among women, they can be difficult to accurately self-diagnose. Research has shown that only 35% of women with a history of yeast infection were able to correctly diagnose a yeast infection from their symptoms alone.Herpes outbreaks and allergic reactions to laundry detergent are frequently confused with yeast infections.
Remember that there are other potential reasons why you may be experiencing abnormal vaginal discharge and vaginal discomfort, including other infections such as bacterial vaginosis or trichomoniasis. For example, many of the symptoms of a yeast infection are very similar to those of an STD.If you have a recurring yeast infections, your doctor may need to perform a cultures test to determine if a candida species other than C. albicans is causing infection.
Pregnant women should not treat a yeast infection before consulting a doctor."

Identify and avoid the triggering substance.One of the key steps in treating contact dermatitis is to identify the causative agent, and to avoid further exposure to whatever it is that triggered your contact dermatitis in the first place.,
Wash the rash with warm water and mild soap.,
Use an emollient cream or ointment.Using a basic moisturizing cream or ointment can help to soothe the itchiness and/or dryness of your rash.,
Avoid using too much soap, makeup, or personal cosmetics, if these aggravate your contact dermatitis.Many hand soaps contain harsh ingredients and, as such, may exacerbate symptoms contact dermatitis (particularly if your contact dermatitis rash is present on your hands and/or lower forearms).,
Soothe your skin with cool, wet compresses to minimize irritation.Especially if your rash is crusting over and/or oozing fluid, wet dressings can be very effective.,
Try having an oatmeal bath to reduce itchiness and irritation.Follow the instructions here for instructions on how to make an oatmeal bath.,
Do not use topical antihistamines.Topical antihistamine creams may actually worsen contact dermatitis and further aggravate the area of concern.,
Opt for a steroid cream.If basic self-care measures are insufficient to get your rash under control, your doctor may suggest an over-the-counter or prescription steroid cream.,
Try medications that directly target your immune system.There are creams and ointments available that can directly target your immune system and help to repair your damaged (and irritated) skin.,
Use oral corticosteroids for very severe cases.In the most severe cases of contact dermatitis — cases that do not resolve with a combination of self-care methods and steroid creams — your doctor may advise a short course of oral corticosteroids.,
Ask your doctor for antibiotics if your rash has become infected.As your rash/reaction heals following exposure to the triggering substance, it is key to keep an eye on it and to monitor for any signs of possible complications such as an infection.,
Recognize the signs and symptoms of contact dermatitis.Contact dermatitis is a skin reaction to something that your skin has been in contact with.,
Familiarize yourself with the different causes of contact dermatitis.,
Think back to recent exposures when attempting to diagnose the cause.,
See your doctor to confirm the diagnosis of contact dermatitis, and to receive treatment as needed.It is especially important to see your doctor if the rash becomes very painful and uncomfortable, interfering with your daily routine and/or with your ability to sleep.",How to Treat Contact Dermatitis," Symptoms often appear a day or so after exposure to the trigger, and the rash will cover the area of skin that was in direct contact with the triggering agent. If you avoid further contact with the triggering agent, your contact dermatitis will usually resolve on its own in two to four weeks following exposure. Common causes of contact dermatitis include:


Soap, cosmetics, nail polish, hair dyes, deodorant, or other personal care products
Poison Ivy
Bleach
Nickel in jewelry and/or buckles
Certain medical creams such as topical antibiotics
Formaldehyde
A recent tattoo and/or black henna
Perfume
Sunscreen
Rubbing alcohol;
, Before applying any topical treatments, be sure to first wash the area with warm (not hot) water and a gentle soap. This will ensure you remove any remaining traces of the possible trigger for your rash.

, These can be purchased at your local pharmacy or drugstore.


Calamine lotion has also been shown to provide relief in cases of contact dermatitis., If you find soap aggravating, minimize your use of soap while your rash recovers. Consider opting for a more mild cleanser, and use it sparingly until your rash improves.


Also avoid other cosmetics and personal hygiene products that trigger your contact dermatitis.
If you are looking to replace cosmetics that you have noticed irritate your dermatitis, look for ones with a label that says ""hypoallergenic"" as these are less likely to trigger contact dermatitis. You may also want to consider switching to organic skin products.
Even if you have been using the same products for years, sometimes formulas can change and a new additive might be causing new symptoms.

, They may help to remove the crusts and diminish the itchiness and irritation.


Apply the compress for 15 to 30 minutes.
If the contact dermatitis rash is widespread over your body (such as affecting both legs, both arms, or your trunk), one of the easiest solutions is to wear a wet piece of clothing.
For instance, you may wear wet long johns with dry pants overtop, so that the moisture remains in contact with the affected areas of skin.
The piece of clothing that you get wet will of course depend upon the area of your body that is affected.
Change wet garments at least every eight hours.Use them as needed to soothe and ease symptoms.

, Oatmeal baths can help to decrease itchiness and to reduce inflammation, so they can be especially helpful in cases of contact dermatitis.

, As a result, it is not a treatment that doctors advise. Oral antihistamines, however, can help calm your symptoms, especially in allergic contact dermatitis.

, In the United States, Hydrocortisone cream is available over-the-counter in a strength of 1%; however, prescription steroid creams are available at higher strengths, and are thus more effective.


Note that steroid creams are most effective when you cover the area of the rash after applying the cream. This ensures that the cream remains on the location of interest, and is able to have an effective medicinal effect.
Examples of coverings you can use over top of the steroid cream include a plastic wrap, petroleum jelly, or a dressing such as Telfa.

, Examples include Tacrolimus/Protopic and Pimecrolimus/Elidel (both are calcineurin inhibitors).


These are not available over-the-counter, and must be prescribed by your physician.
These are rarely given except for in very severe cases of contact dermatitis, as there is an FDA warning about a possible link between these immune-stimulating creams and ointments and certain types of cancer.

, It is not advisable to take oral corticosteroids for long periods of time due to the numerous side effects; however, used over the course of a few days, they may greatly help to get your rash under control.


An example of an oral corticosteroid is Prednisone.

, If your rash does become infected, your doctor will need to prescribe you a course of antibiotics to help combat the infection. It is important that you finish the full course of antibiotics, and do not miss any of the pills, even if your symptoms begin to resolve within a few days (as failure to do so could lead to the infection returning). Signs that your rash may be infected include:


You develop a fever
Pus begins to ooze from your rash
You develop fluid-filled blisters (as these may contain infectious material)
Your skin becomes warm and red

, This means the distribution of the rash/reaction will be where your skin was in direct contact with the triggering substance or object. For instance, it may be where your skin brushed up against poison ivy, or where a certain triggering metal from a piece of jewelry was in contact with your skin. Signs and symptoms to be on the lookout for include:


Reddening of the skin
Bumps on the skin (most often red in color)
Dry, cracked, or scaly skin
Swelling over the affected area
Painful, tender skin over the affected area
Sometimes a burning sensation of the skin over the affected area
Sometimes blisters that may ooze fluid and subsequently crust over (in more severe cases)

, There are two types of contact dermatitis, irritant and allergic, plus a number of different conditions that may resemble contact dermatitis. Irritant dermatitis is caused by something that physically, mechanically, or chemically, which disrupts the skin barrier. Allergic dermatitis is caused by something that triggers an auto-immune reaction. Allergic reactions do not show up immediately after exposure — it may be 12 to 48 hours before you react, or it may take repeated exposures (sometimes over a period of years) for a rash to appear. There are many things that can cause a reaction, so it may be difficult at first to figure out what is causing the rash., If you look at the specific area of skin that is affected, you may be able to trace back the cause of your contact dermatitis. Think about objects or substances that have been in contact with the affected area of your body recently, that are unusual or ""outside the norm"" for you. It is possible that any of these things could be the offending agent.


Note that contact dermatitis often gets worse with time — that is, the more times you are exposed to the offending substance, the worse your rash/reaction will be.
This is because it is an ""adaptive immune response,"" meaning that your immune system stores the ""memory"" of the triggering agent and reacts more aggressively each time you are exposed to the triggering agent.

, Also, if the rash affects your face or genitals it is key to see a physician for evaluation and treatment. Finally, if your rash shows no improvement after two to three weeks following exposure to the triggering agent, seek medical help by booking an appointment with your family doctor.

Be cautious in self-treatment.,
Take a prescribed oral treatment.,
Use a topical treatment.,
Complete the full course of treatment.,
Know that the treatment depends on the infection.",How to Treat a Yeast Infection2," Remember that you should only treat a yeast infection yourself if you are fully confident in your diagnosis. But do keep in mind that many women who've had yeast infections before still make mistakes in diagnosing themselves. If you have even the slightest bit of doubt, see your doctor.

, Your doctor might prescribe you a single-dose tablet of the antifungal medication fluconazole (Diflucan), which is taken by mouth.Relief can be expected within the first 12-24 hours.


This is the fastest and most effective cure for a yeast infection. If you are experiencing severe symptoms, see your doctor immediately to determine if this is the right treatment option for you.

, This is the most common form of treatment. Topical treatments are available both over-the-counter and with a prescription. These include anti-fungal creams, ointments, and suppositories that are applied and/or inserted into the vaginal area. Over-the-counter creams and ointments can be found at most pharmacies, drug stores, and supermarkets. If you have trouble locating a treatment, ask a pharmacist who can help direct you.The medication in these treatments comes from a class of drugs called the azoles, including clotrimazole (Mycelex), butoconazole (Gynezol or Femstat), miconazole nitrate (Monistat), and tioconazole (Vagistat-1). These treatments can be purchased with different time frames for use (e.g., a one-time application, a one-to-three day application, etc). You should consult with your doctor or the pharmacist before deciding which option is best for you.Be sure to carefully read all of the instructions that come with your medication. The instructions will provide guidance on how to apply the cream and/or insert the suppository into your vagina. It's important that you follow the instructions. If you are unsure of what to do, consult your physician or the pharmacist for guidance.

, Do not stop using these treatments early once you no longer experience any symptoms. Use them for as long as directed according to the instructions.If you use an over-the-counter treatment and don't experience relief with 2-3 days, make an appointment with your physician to discuss an alternative treatment.
Be careful with condoms if you use anti-fungal creams or suppositories. The oil in some of the medications can weaken the latex in condoms., While mild yeast infections should go away within a few days, more severe infections could take longer to effectively treat. Your doctor may prescribe a medication for you to take that lasts up to two weeks.


If you keep having repeat infections, this is also something you should discuss with your doctor. It may be a sign of a hormonal imbalance or a need to make some dietary changes.
To keep your yeast levels in check, your doctor may prescribe a medication (such as Diflucan or Fluconazole) that you take once or twice a week for up to six months. Other doctors might prescribe clotrimazole as a vaginal suppository to be used once a week instead of an oral pill."

Take probiotics.,
Reduce your intake of sugar and caffeine.,
Watch what you wear.,
Use Alka Seltzer tablets.,
Use apple cider vinegar.Apple cider vinegar (ACV), when diluted with fresh water and used as a douche, can help to ease or even fix the yeast infection.,

Use garlic.Garlic is another effective way to treat the yeast infection.",How to Treat a Yeast Infection3," Cranberries can treat and prevent both yeast infections and urinary tract infections.Be sure you buy 100% cranberry juice, as the sugar in cranberry juice cocktail will only make matters worse.


You can also buy cranberry supplements in pill form.A pretty mild remedy, cranberries are especially useful if you think you might be coming down with a yeast infection. If you already have one, they can be useful as supplements to your other treatments., Eat yogurt or apply it to the vaginal area. You can also insert yogurt directly into the vagina by using a needle-less syringe or by putting the yogurt in plastic tampon applicators, freezing them, and then inserting them.The idea is that yogurt contains live cultures of bacteria (lactobacillus acidophilus) that help restore the level of healthy bacteria in the vagina.Anecdotally, some women have reported success with eating lactobacillus-containing yogurt, although this method remains scientifically unconfirmed.Several studies have suggested that there is little to no benefit to eating or using yogurt as a treatment., You can also take oral supplements containing lactobacillus acidophilus, commonly known as probiotics. These can be purchased at most grocery, drug, and health food stores. Some women also use suppositories of probiotics to help treat a yeast infection, although the evidence that the suppositories are effective is mixed and needs further research.In general, probiotics are safe to use because they are like the good bacteria already in our systems. Moreover, some probiotics have been used across the ages, such as that in fermented foods and drinks and cultured milk. However, more research is needed to determine the safety of taking probiotics for populations with weaker immune systems, such as the elderly and children.
ALWAYS speak with your physician before inserting or applying probiotics to the vagina. Most practitioners recommend oral use of probiotics over vaginal application.

, The sugar in chocolate, candy, and even fruit juice can cause blood sugar spikes, which promote the growth of yeast. Caffeine can also worsen the effects of sugar by increasing the speed of blood sugar spikes.If you experience regular yeast infections, you should consider cutting back on the amount of sugar and caffeine you consume on a regular basis.

, Avoid tight-fitting pants and wear cotton underwear to allow your vagina to ""breathe"" and stay cool. Yeast thrive in a moist, warm environment, so making sure your clothes provide dryness and airflow for your vagina will help to keep the yeast from multiplying.Change your underwear daily and wear loose-fitting pants, shorts, and skirts.Change out of any wet clothes as soon as you can, including swimsuits and workout clothes.Avoid hot tubs or very hot baths, since yeast like warm, wet areas., Although they are marketed for curing stomach pains, hangovers and body aches, and not for yeast infections, the citric acid in them can cure the early stages of a yeast infection.

, You can use this mixture as a douche once or twice a day. Also, you can apply apple cider vinegar directly over the vagina with the help of a cotton ball. This reduces the inflammation and relieves you from the itchiness.

, It can be an excellent remedy if you are suffering with vaginal yeast infections. If applied around the vagina on a regular basis, and at least twice a day, coconut oil can kill the Candida and free you completely from the infections., Cut a clove of garlic into two and place it inside your vagina overnight. Repeat the process for a few nights to see the results. However, you need to be careful as garlic might trigger a little burning in your vaginal region, and there’s always that stench that can bother you.

Learn about common rashes.,
Recognize ordinary rashes.,
Consider the cause.,
Consult your doctor.,
Visit a dermatologist.",How to Diagnose a Rash1," A rash is a skin inflammation that causes discoloration to the affected area. There are many different types of rashes. Some cause discomfort, and some are more severe than others. Familiarize yourself with common rashes so that you will be able to knowledgeably treat your rash. Eczema (atopic dermatitis) is one of the most common rashes. It appears as small blisters or as dry, crusty patches of skin. Eczema is a chronic, inflammatory, itchy skin condition seen with increased frequency in people with environmental allergies. It is typically itchy and uncomfortable. The blisters may ooze fluids.
Contact dermatitis, which causes inflammation after contact with certain plants (such as poison ivy, poison sumac, and poison oak) is another common issue. The contact can be direct or airborne in smoke. The rash can spread if not immediately washed off the skin, clothes and any object that is touched. The rash is characterized by redness, swelling, and itching. Blisters also typically appear on the area where the rash is located.
Many people suffer from hives. Hives are itchy, red areas of raised skin. They can change size, shape, and location. They can appear suddenly on any area of the body. Most often, hives have an elevated raised red area, surrounded by an itchy, red rash.
Heat rash is also very common and is caused by exposure to sun and hot, humid climate. Symptoms of heat rash are red, raised spots on the skin. It may also feel like there is an itch underneath your skin.
Swimmer’s itch, also called cercarial dermatitis, appears as an itchy skin rash caused by certain parasites that penetrate the skin and cause a reaction. Animals and snails shed parasite eggs into fresh and salt water via their feces. The developing larvae may penetrate the skin of humans, but the resulting rash is self-limiting, as humans are not a good host for the larvae and they will soon die.
Shingles is a rash caused by the same virus that causes chicken pox. The first sign is a painful sensation under the skin, followed by a red, localized rash. The bumps will look like red blisters and often arranged in groups of fluid filled vesicles.
Many people suffer from a skin condition called psoriasis. If you have psoriasis, you will see red scaly patches of skin surrounded by red areas. Typically, this rash occurs on the scalp, elbow, and knees.
Rosacea is another chronic rash that causes persistent inflammation of the facial skin. An early symptom is a flushed appearance on your face.;
, When dealing with a rash, it is useful to pay attention to the appearance. Notice the types of inflammation and where the bumps or redness appear. Different types of rashes will cause unique reactions in your skin. You will also want to pay attention to other symptoms that accompany the rash, such as fever. There are many kinds of ordinary rashes that you can learn to diagnose at home. Just remember to always verify with your doctor.Shingles is a rash caused by the same virus that causes chicken pox. The first sign is a painful sensation under the skin, followed by a red, localized rash. The bumps will look like red blisters.

Rosacea is a chronic rash that causes persistent inflammation of the facial skin. An early symptom is a flushed appearance on your face.

, When you have a rash that you need to diagnose, spend some time thinking about recent your activities. For example, did you spend too much time in the sun? Those red bumps might be heat rash. Did you take a hike in nature? It's possible you brushed up against some poison ivy.Think about any recent changes to your daily life. Many times, rashes are caused by allergies. Maybe you switched laundry detergents, lotion, or shampoo, and you are reacting to a new ingredient.
Reflect on any changes to your diet. It is possible that your rash is caused by a food allergy that you didn't know you have.

, Many rashes will go away by themselves after a couple of days. Most respond well to treatments you can do at home; however, there are cases when you need to seek medical attention. If your rash continues to spread over the course of a few days, or if you are in severe pain, do not hesitate to call your doctor.Be prepared for your visit. Jot down notes about when your rash appeared, what you suspect the cause is, and any other information about your skin inflammation.
If your rash appeared after trying a new medication, you need to call your doctor immediately. Allergic reactions to medication are typified by irregular, raised, or flat red sores.
If you have red bumps that seem to bruise and are tender to the touch, call your doctor. These could be signs of a severe allergic reaction or an infection.

, If your rash is chronic, or your primary care physician seems mystified, it is time to consult a dermatologist. Dermatologists are doctors who specialize in treating the skin. Ask your doctor for a referral.Make sure your new dermatologist has your medical history. She will have questions about your medical history and even your family history. Ask your primary physician to send over your charts.
Ask your dermatologist to suggest possible treatment plans for your skin ailment.

Undergo surgery for bone misalignment.",How to Treat Calluses on Your Hands and Feet," Most people can safely treat their calluses at home. If you have an underlying condition that causes poor blood flow to your hands and feet, seek your doctor’s advice. This can ensure that you get proper treatment that won’t exacerbate underlying conditions or cause complications. People who have the following conditions should seek medical treatment for calluses:Diabetes
Peripheral arterial diseasePeripheral neuropathy
Fragile skin;
, Moisture can soften the hardened skin of calluses. Soaking your hands and/or feet in warm water can soften your calluses and prepare them for filing and moisturizer.Add a cup of apple cider vinegar or Epsom salts to the water. These may further soften your calluses.Soak for 5-10 minutes or until your skin softens.Avoid soaking in hot water. This can strip your skin of moisture and increase the risk of scalding or burning yourself.
Pat your hands and/or feet dry once your skin feels softened.

, Applying moisturizers to your hands and feet every day can keep your skin soft.Choose creams or lotions with salicylic acid, ammonium lactate, or urea. These can also gradually soften your calluses.Apply creams or lotions as needed or according to the product packaging.

, Dip a pumice stone or foot file in warm water. Gently rub the stone or foot file in a circular or sideways motion over the callus to remove dead and hardened skin.Apply gentle pressure with your pumice stone or foot file. Only remove layers of dead skin and not healthy tissue. Feel the affected area every few strokes to ensure that your skin feels soft but not raw or irritated.
Use an emery board or soft washcloth if you prefer less scrubbing action., Salicylic acid, which is the primary compound in aspirin, can also remove calluses. Crush five or six uncoated aspirin tablets and mix them into a paste with equal parts water and apple cider vinegar. Rub the paste onto your calluses. Use a bandage to hold the mixture in place. Wait at least 10 minutes before removing the bandage. This should soften up the callus enough to gently rub it off with a pumice stone or other filing tool., Purchase salicylic acid callus remover pads at your local pharmacy or large retailer. Most places sell these pads over the counter at strengths of up to 40% salicylic acid. Follow the packaging instruction and reapply the patches as directed.Cover the healthy area surrounding the callus with a plastic bandage or a thin layer of petroleum jelly. This can prevent damage to healthy skin from the treatment.Keep the pads away from your eyes, nose, or mouth. Rinse healthy skin exposed to salicylic acid with water as soon as possible.Avoid using salicylic acid pads if you have cracked or broken skin. You should also not use these pads if you have fragile skin.

, Salicylic acid also comes in a liquid or gel form. They are generally mild and shouldn’t cause pain. Follow the application instructions to get optimal results and prevent damaging your skin. You should avoid using salicylic lotions or gels if you have cracked or broken skin around the callus or fragile skin., Soak a ½ slice of stale bread in apple cider vinegar. Secure it to your calluses with a piece of adhesive tape. Then cover the area with plastic wrap under a sock. Leave this on overnight, which may make your calluses disappear by morning.Remove the bread immediately if you experience any pain.

, A podiatrist, or doctor of podiatric medicine (DPM), is a doctor who specializes in foot care.If you have stubborn calluses or a condition that increases your risk for serious foot issues, then you will need to get professional medical treatment. Your doctor or podiatrist can treat your calluses and instruct you on safe home treatments.Let your doctor know how long you’ve had the callus and what type of pain or discomfort you experience. Tell your doctor if you’ve tried home treatments and whether they have helped the callus.

, If you have a large callus or one that doesn’t respond to treatment, your doctor can trim or scrape away excess skin during your visit. They will safely remove calluses with medical implements such as a scalpel or medical scissors. Trimming and scraping can also redistribute weight away from the affected area.Avoid trimming or cutting away excess skin at home. This can lead to serious problems, including infection., Your doctor may prescribe salicylic acid pads or gels that you can’t get over the counter. These are effective on especially stubborn or large calluses. Follow your doctor’s instructions when applying and reapplying the prescription gel and pads., Your doctor may also prescribe an antibiotic ointment for your calluses. This can minimize your risk of infection on callused areas. Follow any application and usage instructions to prevent complications or other problems., If you have recurring calluses on your feet, your doctor may suggest wearing over-the-counter cushion pads or insoles in your shoes. These help eliminate pressure points that can cause calluses.Recognize that your doctor may suggest custom-made insoles if bone misalignment causes severe and recurrent callusing.

, In rare cases, you may require surgery to treat calluses. The surgery will readjust a bone’s position to minimize how often you get calluses.Get a second opinion on treating your calluses if you are unsure of your doctor’s suggestion to do surgery. Most doctors will welcome the opinion of another doctor.

Use lots of warm, soapy water. If you can, wash within the first 30 minutes of touching the poison ivy. If you're still outdoors, find a stream or creek. Place the affected area in the running water for at least 10 minutes.You should also wash underneath your fingernails.
If you're washing up at home, wash all of your clothes and shoes or boots as well.;
, A poison ivy rash can easily spread by simply scratching or touching. If you've come into contact with poison ivy or have a rash, do not touch anywhere around your eyes, mouth, or genitals. All parts of a poison ivy plant (even dead plants) contain an oily allergen called urushiol. This causes a rash or blisters if it comes into contact with your skin or you breathe it in.If you do get a rash around your eyes, mouth or genitals, you should see your doctor immediately.

, If you have blisters from the poison ivy, never break them open since this increases your risk of infection and scarring. Instead, soak your blisters in a bath with a solution of Burow's solution. You can buy a product containing this solution of aluminum sulfate and aluminum acetate at a drugstore or pharmacy. Soak the blisters for 20 minutes at least two or three times a day.Soaking in Burow's solution acts as an astringent which can reduce the size of the blisters and help dry them out.

, Fill a sock or nylon knee-high with steel-cut oatmeal. Tie the filled sock onto the tap of your bathtub. Run a cool bath so that the water runs through the oatmeal and into the tub. Soak in the oatmeal bath as long and as often as you like.


Studies have shown that oatmeal is great for soothing your rash and relieving itchiness. The less you scratch your rash, the sooner it will dry up.You can also purchase an oatmeal bath product that you simply mix into your tub.

, Soak a clean cotton towel in cold water and squeeze out the extra water. Place the cold cloth over the rash for as long as it stays cool. When it warms up, simply run the cloth under cold water and wring it out again. You can do this as often as you like.To make an astringent compress that dries out the rash, brew a pot of tea. Soak a clean towel in the cooled tea and apply it to your rash.
When your body temperature is higher, your rash may seem itchier. Applying a cool compress can make the rash less itchy and soothe your skin.

, Once you've washed the oily allergen off of your skin, you should apply a product to relieve itching and help dry up the rash quickly. You can purchase calamine lotion and over-the-counter (OTC) hydrocortisone cream at a drugstore or pharmacy. Calamine will dry up any oozing or weeping coming from your poison ivy rash. Hydrocortisone relieves redness, swelling, and itching caused by poison ivy.You can purchase calamine lotion and over-the-counter (OTC) hydrocortisone cream at a drugstore or pharmacy.

, Try OTC antihistamines like brompheniramine, cetirizine, chlorpheniramine or diphenhydramine. These can help block the allergen that's causing your reaction to poison ivy. You may want to take diphenhydramine at night since it can make you drowsy and use loratadine or cetirizine for during the day.Always follow the manufacturer's dosing instructions.

, It may be difficult to leave a poison ivy blister alone if the blister is large. To draw out the fluid in the blister and reduce the size of the blister, make an astringent paste. Combine baking soda with just enough water to make a paste and apply it directly to your rash or blisters. Or if your rash is large, add a cup of baking soda to a tub of cool water and soak in it for at least 30 minutes.For smaller rashes, dab some witch hazel or apple cider vinegar onto the rash. You can also soak a green or black tea bag in water and apply the tea bag directly to the rash.

, While the worst part of a poison ivy rash is the first few days, it will clear up within a few weeks. If the rash covers a large portion of your body or the itching is very severe (even after trying treatments), call your doctor. You may need prescription-strength oral steroids or antihistamines. You should also call your doctor if:You have a temperature over 100.4°F (38°C)
The rash is oozing pus or has soft yellow scabs
The itching gets worse or prevents you from sleeping
The rash doesn't seem to improve within a few weeks

, Poison ivy usually grows as a vine or a shrub and has clumps of three leaves. You may have heard the rhyme, “Leaves of three, let it be.” But other plants also grow as three leaves from a single stem (like blackberry, raspberry, and box elder). The main difference is that in the poison ivy plant, the middle or central leaf grows from a longer single stem. Poison ivy is usually glossy and the leaves might have red stems or reddish leaves.To determine if a plant is poison ivy, look for hairy tendrils on the main vine. These let the plant climb and grow.

, Poison ivy plants can grow all year long and throughout most of the United States. For example, your region may have poisonous sumac or oak. The following regions have these poisonous plants:Eastern poison ivy: these vines grow on the ground and can climb
Western poison ivy: these vines only grow on the ground
Pacific poison oak: this grows as a shrub, ground vine, and climbing vine
Atlantic poison oak: this is a ground vine and shrub (but not very common)
Poison sumac is a small tree usually found in wet areas

, If you've come into contact with poison ivy, a rash will appear within minutes to hours (12 to 24 hours) of touching the oily allergen (urushiol). The rash will usually be red, itchy and swollen. Your rash might also have streaks if you brushed against the plant. The fluid-filled blisters can also form, but they don't spread the rash.Don't be surprised if it takes up to three days for a poison ivy rash to develop.

, If you know you'll be hiking in an area with poison ivy or you'll be clearing the plant from your yard, wear clothing that prevents the oil from brushing against your skin. Wear long pants and shirts, socks, boots, and vinyl gloves.If your clothes have come into contact with poison ivy, wash your clothing as soon as you can and avoid touching the clothes with bare hands. You should also wash your shoes and any outdoor gear you used to clear the poison ivy.

, If you have a pet that likes to romp through the brush or lives outdoors, be aware that they could potentially carry the oil on their fur. If the oil comes into contact with their skin (the belly of a dog, for instance), your pet may also suffer a rash. But if they just brush by the plant and get the oil on their fur, they will not be affected. If you go to pet or hold them, however, you will be exposing yourself to the oil and may suffer a rash.

Try to keep an eye on your pets when they are outdoors. If you see them come into contact with poison ivy, wear protective gloves and give them a bath to remove the oil from the fur and prevent them from spreading it.

, Before going on a walk in the woods, you may want to apply a skincare product that prevents poison ivy oil from getting on your skin. You can purchase an ivy-block barrier from a drugstore. Look for a product that contains a 5% solution of bentoquatam. Apply the thick cream 15 minutes before you'll be encountering poison ivy.Reapply the ivy-block barrier every four hours. To remove the cream, wash it off using soap and water. Avoid using the barrier cream on kids under six years old.

Wear a loose cotton or silk pajama.,
Avoid wearing substances that irritate your skin at night.",How to Deal With an Itch That Occurs Throughout the Night1," Antihistamine creams and tablets are medications that can ease an itch resulting from an allergic reaction. They work by blocking histamines binding to your cells and thus, prevent the release of mediators that cause the symptoms of allergy (including itching).Apply Benadryl (diphenhydramine) topical cream to the skin or take oral tablets/liquid before bedtime. Besides helping with the itching, oral Benadryl also causes drowsiness, which can help you sleep better.If you have large areas of skin that itches, you should choose an oral anti-histamine instead of putting a topical cream on a large area.
However, choose either the topical cream or the oral diphenhydramine. Never use both together or you could be exposed to too much of the medication.
Always follow the directions in the label and never exceed the recommended dose.
Other antihistamines you can try include over-the-counter Zyrtec (cetirizine) and Claritin (loratadine).
Make sure you check with your doctor or pharmacist before taking oral medications if you have medical conditions, allergies to medicines, or take other medications.;
, Corticosteroids are effective in controlling inflammation by altering the function of a number of cells and chemicals in the skin. If the itching is caused by an inflammatory condition (such as eczema), try using corticosteroid cream.When using corticosteroid cream, you may want to cover the area with a damp cotton material soaked in water. This will help the skin absorb the cream.Corticosteroid creams are available in mild forms over-the-counter, or stronger by prescription only.
If the itchy area isn’t large, your doctor may prescribe calcineurin inhibitor drugs (such as Protopic or Elidel) instead of corticosteroid creams.

, These may help for mild itching if you prefer not to use over-the-counter or prescription medications. Apply the moisturizing cream before bedtime and, in case of a prolonged condition, at least twice a day until the symptoms are gone.Try Cetaphil, Eucerin, Sarna, or CeraVe moisturizers or Aveeno, which is made of oats.
Calamine or menthol are also good anti-itch products that can temporarily relieve the symptoms.Optionally, form a protective barrier on the skin by using barrier creams that contain zinc oxide, lanolin or petrolatum. For example, petroleum jelly is an inexpensive treatment that is gentle in handling itchy, dry skin., This can help reduce irritation but also protects the skin and prevents you from scratching it during the night.You may be attempted to scratch the affected area but try to avoid this. You can easily break your skin by constant scratching during the night, making the skin vulnerable for infection. If you can’t avoid scratching, trim your nails or wear gloves at night.
Optionally, you can tape a plastic wrap around the skin to protect it and prevent yourself from scratching it.

, Oats have chemicals called avenanthramides that fight inflammation and redness and can help soothe itching.Grind oatmeal in a blender and slowly sprinkle it into the tub while the water is running. Then soak for at least 15 minutes before bedtime.
Or try Aveeno oatmeal baths, which are available over-the-counter and easy to use.
Or add 1 cup baking soda to a tub of warm water and soak your itchy skin for 30 to 60 minutes before bedtime.
Localized itches can also be treated with a baking soda paste. Combine 3 parts baking soda and 1 part water and mix, then apply over the affected area. Only use over skin that is not broken.

, These materials can help reduce irritation. Avoid clothes that irritate your skin, such as wool and some man-made fabrics. It may also beneficial to avoid tight-fitting clothes., Some materials can cause irritation or allergic reaction, such as jewelry, perfume, skin products with strong fragrances, cleaning products, and cosmetics. Do not use these at night.Also use unscented laundry detergent when washing your pajama or bedding and use the extra-rinse cycle on your washing machine.

Identify diaper rash.,
Spot cradle cap.,
Watch for impetigo.,
Consider other common causes.,
Learn about reactions to medication.,
Recognize allergic reactions.",How to Diagnose a Rash2," Babies come down with a wide variety of rashes, and diaper rash is among the most common. To identify diaper rash, pay close attention to the appearance of your baby's bottom. Diaper rash looks like a red, irritated patchwork across the skin, or in isolated spots.Babies have very sensitive skin, which causes them to be very susceptible to skin irritations. Diaper rash is typically caused by wet diapers, or a diaper that has not been changed recently.
To avoid diaper rash, make sure to frequently change your baby's diaper and make sure the area is clean and dry before putting on a new diaper.
While diaper rash can look scary, remember that it is completely normal. It can be typically cleared up by using an over the counter cream. Air drying can sometimes cure the least severe cases.

, Cradle cap, or seborrhoeic dermatitis, is another common skin ailment in babies. Cradle cap is characterized by yellow, greasy, scaly patches of skin. Typically, these patches occur on the scalp, but can also appear on the face, ears, or neck.Sometimes cradle cap will cause the infected area to become flaky, and the skin to peel off. This can also cause hair loss. Don't worry, it will grow back.
Cradle cap is very common, and typically goes away by itself in a week or two. It does not cause discomfort or irritation to your baby. It looks scary, but is normal and harmless.
If your baby is trying to scratch at the scaly area, this is a sign that it could be something other than cradle cap. Ask your doctor for a definitive diagnosis.

, This is one of the most common skin infections that affects children and is usually caused when the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes penetrate the skin.It causes one or multiple honey-crusted lesions on the face, arms or legs. Fever is also common.

Your child may be more susceptible if she has already had skin problems such as eczema, poison ivy, insect bites, and cuts or scrapes, as this can make it easier for the bacteria to penetrate the skin.Frequent washing of the face and hands can help prevent impetigo. It is contagious and can be spread by direct contact or by touching an item that was in contact with infected skin (such as clothes, towels, and bedding).Impetigo is usually treated with antibiotic ointment. If the infection has spread over the body or topical treatment doesn't seem to be working, the doctor may prescribe oral antibiotics to be taken for seven to 10 days., Because babies have such sensitive skin, they are prone to many other minor rashes when they are small. One rash is called milia, and looks like tiny white spots on the infant's face. Almost half of all newborns have milia, and it is no cause for concern. It typically disappears within four weeks.If your newborn has blotchy, red skin, it is likely a rash called erythema toxicum. This rash typically appears when the baby is two to three days old, and is completely normal. It will disappear on its own within a few days.
Just like adults, babies can also suffer from acne. If your baby has what appear to be small pimples, try washing with a very mild moisturizer and warm water.

, Children of all ages can develop what are known as drug rashes. These inflammations occur when the child has a negative reaction to a medication. Drug rashes can be tricky to diagnose because they can occur even after the child has been taking the medication for a sustained period of time. Drug rashes can take many forms, such as scaly patches, pimples, hives, and general redness.Typically, you will need your doctor to diagnose a drug rash. Take notes about the appearance of the rash and the duration. You'll want to be able to clearly answer your doctor's questions.

, Children can be allergic to many things: foods, pollen, animals, and chemicals. If your child develops a rash after coming into contact with an allergen, that is known as contact dermatitis. The skin may be raised, red, and itchy. If the allergy is severe, the skin might blister.Contact dermatitis can occur from coming into contact with certain cleaning agents, plants, and some cosmetics.
Medication allergies (for example penicillin) can manifest themselves as a rush.
Food allergies are also very common in children. An allergy may appear as hives or eczema.
A child can be allergic to any food, but the most common are eggs, nuts, soy, wheat, and shellfish.
If you suspect an environmental factor, such as pollen, is the allergen, try closing your windows and keeping your child in doors for a few days.
If your child has any difficulty breathing, contact your doctor immediately.

Consider getting a second opinion if you are not satisfied with your physician’s diagnosis and treatment.",How to Treat a Cyst1," An epidermoid cyst is more common than a sebaceous cyst. Each will have slightly different symptoms and will be treated just a little differently. Therefore, it is important that the cyst you have on your skin is diagnosed appropriately for effective treatment.


Both types of cysts are flesh-colored or white-yellow and have a smooth surface.Epidermoid cysts are more common. These are slow growing and often painless. They don’t usually require treatment, unless they are causing pain or become infected.Pilar cysts are composed primarily of keratin (the protein that makes up hair and nails) and form from the outer hair root sheath, typically on the head.A pilar cyst is often thought to be another term for a sebaceous cysts, but they are in fact different.
Sebaceous cysts are commonly found in the hair follicles on the head. They form inside the glands that secrete sebum, an oily substance that coats the hair. When these normal secretions are trapped, they develop into a pouch containing a cheese-like substance. They are commonly found in areas near the neck, upper back, and on the scalp.Sebaceous cysts are often confused with pilar or epidermoid cysts.;
, Without a mammogram or needle biopsy it is almost impossible to distinguish between the two different types of lumps in the breast. Symptoms of a breast cyst will include:


Smooth, easily movable lump with distinct edges
Pain or tenderness over the lump
Size and tenderness will increase just before your period starts
Size and tenderness will decrease when your period ends

, Acne is a general term that describes a variety of different types of pimples, blackheads, pustules, whiteheads and cysts. Cystic acne are nodules that are red, raised, often 2–4 mm in size and nodular and are the most severe form of acne. The infection in a cystic acne is deeper than that in other pustules or whiteheads. Cystic acne is painful., These are the most common types of lumps found on the hand and wrist. They are not cancerous and often harmless. Filled with fluid, they can quickly appear, disappear or change in size. They do not require treatment unless they interfere with function or are unacceptable in appearance., In this condition there is a cyst, abscess or dimple that forms in the crease between the buttocks that runs from the lower end of the spine to the anus. It can be caused from wearing tight clothing, excess body hair, sitting for long periods of time or obesity. Symptoms can include pus from the area, tenderness over the cyst, or the skin may be warm, tender or swollen near the tailbone. Or there may not be any symptoms beside a pit or dimple at the base of the spine., These glands are located on either side of the vaginal opening to lubricate the vagina. When the gland becomes obstructed, a relatively painless swelling forms called a Bartholin's cyst. If the cyst is not infected you may not notice it. An infection can occur in a matter of days causing tenderness, fever, discomfort walking, pain with intercourse, and a tender, painful lump near the vaginal opening., All testicular swelling must be diagnosed by a physician to determine the differences between a cyst, cancerous growth, hydrocele or infection in the testicles. A testicular cysts, also called a spermatocele or epididymal cyst, is typically a painless, fluid-filled, noncancerous sac in the scrotum above the testicles. T, Although most epidermoid and pilar cysts do not require treatment from a physician, if you do seek medical advice and are not satisfied with the results seek a second opinion. Most sebaceous and epidermoid cysts are straightforward, but there are other conditions that may mimic these cysts.In a case study written in the Royal College of Surgeons of England, the authors presented two cases in which melanoma and a deep oral cavity were originally mistaken for a sebaceous cyst.
There are a variety of other infectious processes that may be mistaken for a sebaceous cyst, including boils, furuncles and carbuncles.

Understand which cysts are not preventable.,
Understand which cysts are preventable.,
Lower your chances of developing cysts.",How to Treat a Cyst2," Pilar cysts develop after puberty and have an autosomal dominant inheritance. This means that they occur in both sexes and if one parent carries the gene for a pilar cyst then it increases the risk that the children will experience these cysts. Seventy percent of people who get them will have multiple cysts over their lifetime.There is no known cause at this time for cysts that develop in the breast tissue.
Doctors do not have a clear answer about the risk factors and prevention for Cystic acne but it is believed to be related to increasing hormonal levels in puberty and pregnancy and deep infections from hair follicles plugged by sebum (oil on the skin)., Most cysts are not but some are. For instance, prevention for a pilonidal cyst includes wearing clothing that is not tight, maintaining normal weight limits, and getting up from a seated position every 30 minutes throughout the day.


According to the American Academy of Dermatology, there is no effective means of preventing an epidermoid cyst from forming.However, there are groups of people who appear to be at greater risk for developing them: more men than women, acne sufferers, and people who spend a long time in the sun.People who have suffered hand injury are more likely to experience an epidermoid or ganglion cyst on the hand.
Bartholin gland cysts can occur after injury to the area at the opening to the vagina.

, While most cysts are not preventable, you can lower your risks of getting the ones that are. Use oil-free skin products and avoiding excessive sun exposure.Shaving and waxing may also be responsible for cyst formation. Avoid excessive shaving and waxing in areas where you have already gotten cysts to prevent reformation or new cysts.

Treat uninfected epidermoid and sebaceous cysts at home.,
Use a wet, warm compress over an epidermoid cyst to encourage it to drain and heal.,
Refrain from picking, squeezing, or trying to pop either an epidermoid cyst or sebaceous cyst.,
Allow an epidermoid cyst to drain naturally.,
Keep the area clean.",How to Treat a Cyst3," Signs of infection include the area becoming swollen, red, tender, or red and warm. If your home treatment for these cysts is not effective or if you experience symptoms, which indicate an infection, you should seek medical care from your physician.If the cyst causes pain or discomfort with walking or intercourse, medical care is needed to treat the cyst.

, The washcloth should be hot but not so hot that it burns the skin. Place it over the cyst two to three times a day.Cystic acne responds better to ice than it does to heat.
Bartholin gland cysts can be treated at home using warm water sitz baths. This involves sitting in several inches of warm water to encourage the cyst to drain.

, This can increase the risk of infection and scarring. Also, never pick, squeeze or attempt to pop a cystic acne. This drives the infection deeper and increases the risk of scar tissue.

, Once it begins to drain, cover it with a sterile dressing, which you can change twice a day. If a large amount of pus begins to drain from the cyst, the skin surrounding the cyst turns red, the area becomes warm and tender, or blood begins to drain from the cyst, it is time to seek medical care.

, To prevent an infection, keep the cyst and the area surrounding it clean. Wash it daily using an antibacterial soap or cream.

Understand treatment of a testicular cyst.",How to Treat a Cyst4," Most cysts are completely harmless and will go away on their own, while others may require medical attention. Call your doctor if the cyst is painful or swollen, or if the skin around the affected area becomes warm, as these are signs of an infection., If the cyst is interfering with your everyday life, don't attempt to pop it yourself. Talk to your doctor to determine whether it would be safe and advisable to have it surgically removed., These will vary depending upon the location, the size, and how the cyst may be interfering with bodily functions. There are three options for the removal of cysts in the body. You and your physician should discuss each to determine which is the best option for your circumstances and the type of cyst you have.


Incision and drainage (I & D) is a simple procedure where the physician makes a 2-3 mm cut in the cyst and gently expresses the contents of the cyst. This can be done in the office for skin cysts, such as epidermoid and sebaceous cysts and surface pilonidal cysts which are not deep or infected if necessary. I & D can be used for breast cysts, ganglion cysts, testicular or bartholin gland cysts on an outpatient basis using either general or local anesthesia.However, there is a higher incidence of recurrence when the cyst wall is not removed. In an incision and drainage the wall cannot be removed.
A minimal excision technique will remove the wall of the cyst and the cheesy center material.The cyst is opened and drained before the cyst wall is pulled out. Sutures may or may not be necessary, depending upon the size of the incision. This technique will be the treatment of choice for breast cysts, testicular cysts, bartholin gland cysts, and ganglion cysts. Surgical excisions are very rarely done for cystic acne. Surgical excision is generally done under local anesthesia and often as an outpatient procedure, while general anesthesia is used for children.
Laser removal is an option for only epidermoid cysts when they are large or are in an area where the skin is thick. It entails opening the cyst with a laser and gently expressing the the fluid inside. One month later a minimal incision is made to pull out the cyst wall. This gives good cosmetic results in cases where the cyst is not inflamed or infected., However, it is important to seek medical care if the area appears infected, if the cyst grows rapidly, if the cyst is in a spot that is constantly irritated, or if you are bothered for cosmetic reasons.

, If you haven’t reached menopause, your doctor will ask that you monitor the cyst each month. Your physician may do a fine needle aspiration to drain the cyst.


If you notice a cyst through two or three menstrual periods that does not resolve spontaneously, or increases in size, your doctor may order an ultrasound.
Your physician may recommend oral contraception to regulate your menstrual cycle hormones. This treatment is only used in women with severe symptoms.
Surgical removal is necessary only when the cysts are uncomfortable, have blood-tinged or green-colored fluid on aspiration, or the physician believes there may be a non-benign growth pattern. In this case the entire cyst will be removed with anesthesia as an incision and drainage technique would leave the capsule and increase the risk the cyst will reappear.

, If you do not receive good results, the doctor may recommend the use of isotretinoin or Accutane.


Accutane is an effective medication that helps manage acne. However, may cause serious side effects, such as birth defects, can increase the risk of depression and suicide, and can affect your lipid levels, liver function, blood sugar, and white blood cell count. You will need to have blood tests done once monthly to monitor your response to the medication.Women must be on two forms of contraception to take Accutane.

, Treatment for this type of cyst is usually nonsurgical and will include observation. The area can be immobilized if activity increases the size, pressure or pain to the area.Aspiration of the fluid in the ganglion cyst might be done if it is causing pain or limiting activity. In this procedure the physician takes the fluid out of the cyst with a fine needle, in the office under sterile conditions.


If symptoms are not relieved through nonsurgical methods (needle aspiration or immobilization), or the cyst returns after aspiration, your doctor may recommend a surgical excision of the cyst also known as total ganglionectomy. During excision part of the involved tendon or joint capsule will also be removed. There is a small chance that the cyst will return even after complete removal. This is a surgical procedure done under local anesthesia and is often an outpatient procedure.

, The type of treatment is dependent upon the size of the cyst, your discomfort, and whether or not it’s infected.Warm sitz baths (sitting in several inches of warm water) several times a day can help the gland to drain on its own.


Surgical incision and drainage will be used if the gland is very large or infected and sitz baths are not effective. Local anesthesia or sedation will be used. A catheter will remain in the gland to keep it open for up to six weeks to allow for complete drainage.
Antibiotics may be prescribed to treat the infection.

, First a physician must determine that the growth is non-cancerous.If the cyst is large enough to trigger a feeling of heaviness or dragging in the testicle, surgical excision will be discussed.


Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia does not initially recommend surgery for their adolescents. Instead, they recommend that the young men learn to do self-examinations and report any changes or increases in size which may indicate the need for surgical treatment.Cysts in children often resolve on their own.
Percutaneous sclerotherapy is an option that reduces the risks of surgery to the scrotum and has had good results in research.Using ultrasound to guide the injection of a sclerosing agent, 84% of the men used in the study were symptom free in six month. The sclerosing agent will reduce the size and symptoms of a testicular cyst. This procedure has significantly less physical risk and less risk of recurrence of the cyst.

Stop using harsh skin care products.,
Wash daily with a gentle cleanser and lukewarm water.,
Moisturize your skin at least once a day.,
Switch to a laundry detergent without fragrances or harsh chemicals.,
Buy a humidifier for your bedroom.,
Eat an anti-inflammatory diet.",How to Calm Irritated Skin3," Often, redness and irritation is the result of over-exfoliating or using abrasive or harsh acne reducing products. Stop using anything new you have put on your skin for at least 4 days, and consider switching to a gentler cleaning product.Acne medicines using retinoids are particularly irritating.
After 4 days, try using the product sparingly to see if irritation still occurs. If so, throw it away.
Do not introduce more than one product at a time to your skin, so you know which one is “too much.”

, A good cleanser should wash off all dirt and makeup, but not your skin’s natural oils. If your skin feels tight or squeaky after washing, the product is too harsh.Cetaphil and Eucerin are good products for sensitive skin.


Hot or cold water can damage capillaries and cause redness. Hot water also dries your skin out quickly, causing redness.Look for a cleanser made for your skin type, whether it tends to be oily or dry. Foaming cleansers are generally bad for dry skin.Avoid cleansers with harsh ingredients like sodium laureth sulfate, menthol or alcohol.Avoid products with fragrances and dyes. Also avoid medicated acne cleansers, since they usually strip away good oils.You may need to use different products for different seasons, depending on how dry the air is and how you skin conditions adjust accordingly.

, Choose a moisturizer with glycerin as the first ingredient since it is very efficient at holding in moisture,or just use plain petroleum jelly.Use it every time you shower, after drying off.

Apply hot compresses to the boil.,
Do not lance or burst the boil at home.,
Wash the drained boil with antibacterial soap.,
Apply an antibacterial cream and dress the boil.,
Continue applying hot compresses until the boil is fully healed.,
See a doctor if the boil has not drained within two weeks, or has become infected.,
Do not share towels, clothes or bedding with anyone who has a boil.,
Practice good hygiene.,
Clean any cuts or wounds immediately and thoroughly.,
Avoid sitting down for extended periods of time.,
Use tea tree oil.,

Experiment with turmeric.,
Apply colloidal silver cream.,
Use apple cider vinegar.,
Try castor oil.",How to Treat a Boil," As soon as you notice a boil beginning to form, you should begin treating with hot compresses. The sooner you begin treatment, the less likely it is that complications will occur. Make a hot compress by holding a clean washcloth under hot water until wet, and then squeeze out the excess moisture. Press the warm, damp cloth gently onto the boil for five to ten minutes. Repeat three to four times a day.


The hot compress does several things to speed up the healing of a boil. Firstly, the warmth increases circulation to the area, helping to draw antibodies and white blood cells to the site of the infection. The heat also draws pus to the surface of the boil, encouraging it to drain faster. Lastly, the hot compress will help to relieve pain.
Instead of a hot compress, you can also soak the boil in warm water if it is on an area of the body where it's convenient to do so. For boils on the lower body, sitting in a hot bath can be helpful.;
, As the surface of the boil softens and fills with pus, it may be tempting to burst the skin with a needle and drain the contents yourself. However, this is not recommended as it can cause the boil to become infected or the bacteria within the boil to spread, causing multiple boils. With continued application of hot compresses to the area, the boil should burst and drain by itself within about two weeks., Once the boil starts draining, it is very important that you keep the area clean. Wash the boil thoroughly with an antibacterial soap and warm water, until all of the pus has drained. Once clean, dry the boil with a clean towel or some paper towel, which should be washed or thrown away immediately after use, to avoid spreading the infection.

, Next, you should apply an antibacterial cream or ointment to the boil and cover it with a gauze dressing. The gauze will allow the boil to continue draining, so the dressing should be changed frequently. Antibacterial creams and ointments made specifically to deal with boils are available over-the-counter at your local pharmacy., Once the boil has drained, you should continue to apply hot compresses, clean the area and dress the boil until it has fully healed. As long as you are conscientious about keeping the area clean, there should be no complications, and the boil should heal completely within a week or two.


Make sure to wash your hands with antibacterial soap before and after touching the boil, to avoid spreading infection.

, In some cases, medical treatment will be required to deal with the boil, due to its size, location, or infection. A doctor will need to lance the boil, either in his/her office or surgery. In these cases, the boil may have several pockets of pus to be drained, or be in a delicate are such as the nose or ear canal. If the boil or the skin surrounding it becomes infected, you may be given a shot of antibiotics or given a prescription to take them orally. The situations where you should seek medical advice include:


If a boil develops on the face or spine, in the nose or ear canal or the crease between the buttocks. These boils can be extremely painful and are difficult to treat at home.
If the boils are consistently recurring. In some cases, treatment of recurring boils in areas such as the groin and armpit will require the removal of sweat glands whose regular inflammation is causing the boils.
If the boils are accompanied by a fever, red streaks oozing from the boil or redness and inflammation of the skin surrounding the boil. These are all signs of infection.
If you suffer from a disease (such as cancer or diabetes) or are taking medication that weakens the immune system. In these cases, the body may not be able to fight off the infection causing the boil on its own.
If the boil doesn't drain after two weeks of home treatment or the boil is extremely painful., Although boils themselves are not contagious, the bacteria which causes them is. That's why it's very important to exercise caution and avoid sharing any towels, clothes or bedding used by a family member with boils. These items should also be thoroughly washed after used by the infected person., Good hygiene is probably the most important thing you can do to prevent boils As boils are usually caused by bacteria infecting the hair follicles, you should prevent the build up of bacteria on the surface of the skin by washing daily. Normal soap is fine, but if you are prone to developing boils, an antibacterial wash may be better.


You can also use an abrasive brush or sponge, such as a loofah, to scrub the skin. This will break up any oil from becoming clogged around the hair follicles.

, Bacteria can easily enter the body through cuts and wounds on the skin. It can then travel down the hair follicle where it causes infection and the development of boils. To avoid this, make sure to clean all minor cuts and scrapes well with an antibacterial wash, apply a cream or ointment, and cover with a bandage until healed.

, Boils that form between the buttocks, also known as ""pilonidal cysts,"" usually develop as a result of direct pressure caused by sitting down for long periods of time. They are common in truck drivers and people who have recently traveled on a long flight. If possible, try to relieve the pressure by taking frequent breaks to stretch your legs., Tea tree oil is a natural antiseptic and is used in the treatment of numerous skin conditions, including boils. Simply apply a dab of tea tree oil directly to the boil once a day, using a q-tip.

, Epsom salt is a drying agent that can assist in bringing the boil to a head. To use, dissolve the Epsom salts in warm water and use this water to make a warm compress to place over the boil. Repeat three times a day until the boil begins to drain.

, Turmeric is an Indian spice with impressive anti-inflammatory properties. It also acts as a blood purifier. Turmeric can be taken orally in capsule form, or it can be mixed with a little water to form a paste and applied directly onto the boil. Just make sure to cover the boil with a bandage afterward, as the turmeric can stain clothes., Colloidal silver is a natural disinfectant that has been used with success in the home treatment of boils. Simply rub a little of the cream directly onto the boil twice a day.

, Apple cider vinegar is a natural disinfectant that can be used to cleanse infection from the boil once it has begun to drain. Dip a cotton ball into the vinegar and press it gently against the boil. If you find that it stings too much, dilute the apple cider vinegar to half strength with water first.

, Castor oil is used in numerous natural and medical treatments - including chemotherapy for cancer patients.It is an effective anti-inflammatory that can be used to lessen the swelling and tenderness of boils. Soak a cotton boil in castor oil and place it on the boil. Secure the cotton ball with a band-aid or some gauze. Change every few hours.

Wash your hands.,
Clean the infected skin.,
Spread Bactroban ointment onto your skin.,
Follow your prescription to completion.",How to Apply Bactroban1," Before (and after) applying Bactroban to your skin, wash your hands with warm water and soap. Make sure your hands are completely dry before applying Bactroban to your skin. Work the soap into a lather and thoroughly spread it across your hands (palms and back) and fingers.You may use any kind of soap you want, but those of the antibacterial variety are recommended.
Washing your hands before applying Bactroban serves to wash away dirt and bacteria before touching your infected area; washing after application serves to get the ointment off your hands so you don't get any in your mouth or eyes.;
, Do this using warm water and soap, in much the same way you did for your hands. Dry the area thoroughly using a clean cloth or towel before applying Bactroban. If your infection is located in a hard-to-reach area, it may be easiest to complete this step while showering.Use a scent-free soap to wash your infected skin. Soaps with perfumes and artificial dyes can irritate your skin and may be painful if your skin infection is severe.

, This should be done by first squeezing a small amount out of the tube and onto your fingers or palm, then spreading it evenly across your infected skin. Typically, only a small amount of ointment is required; follow the instructions provided by your doctor or on the label.If you have impetigo, then you will need to apply Bactroban ointment twice a day for five days. You may cover it with gauze and reassess if there has not been any improvement in three to five days.
If you have a bacterial skin infection, then make sure that you limit the area where you apply Bactroban. The area where you apply the Bactroban should be no bigger than the size of your palm (100cm2).
Bactroban ointment won't be completely absorbed by your skin when you first apply it; you should be able to see a thin layer of the cream on your skin.
You can cover the infected area with a bandage after applying Bactroban if you wish as long as it is a relatively breathable material (such as gauze).

, It is very important that you use the Bactroban ointment for the full period ordered by your doctor (typically around 10 days), or as advised by the package insert. If you stop using the ointment early because your infection appears to be gone, you might end up with a stronger infection that could even be resistant to antibiotics.Apply the ointment three times a day for 10 days for a bacterial skin infection. Consult your primary care provider if you see no improvement in three to five days
This is a good reason not to use Bactroban without a doctor's prescription, even if you are in a country where you can get it over the counter.
If you accidentally miss a dose of Bactroban, apply it as soon as you remember to do so unless it is already time for your next dose; in such a case, skip the missed dose. You should not use a double dose without your physician's approval.

Get a proper diagnosis.,
Understand the standard medical treatments for rosacea.,
Research appropriate herbal remedies.,
Apply a gel containing licorice root extract.,
Apply a skin cream containing feverfew flower extract.,

Rub oatmeal-based soap onto the affected areas of your face.,
Apply lavender oil to the affected areas of your face.,
Consider using chamomile products on your face.,
Apply tea tree oil to affected areas.,
Apply camphor oil to the affected areas of your skin.,
Try taking turmeric root extract.,
Try taking gamma-linolenic acid (GLA).,
Try eating ginger root products.,
Supplement with grapeseed extract products.",How to Use Herbal Remedies for Rosacea," Many other skin conditions affect the face and can mimic rosacea, such as acne, hives or eczema, so make an appointment with a skin specialist (dermatologist) in order to get a correct diagnosis. There is no point starting any treatment regimen, herbal or otherwise, until you know exactly what you have.


Rosacea affects about 10% of the population and usually starts during middle age for both men and women (women have higher incidence), particularly those of Celtic and Northern European ancestry.There is no lab test to confirm a diagnosis of rosacea, but any qualified dermatologist should be able to tell.
An experienced esthetician may also be of value when trying to understand your skin condition.
Chronic stress often manifests as various skin conditions.;
, Before heading off to find some herbs, allow your dermatologist to explain the mainstream medical treatments that are most commonly used to combat rosacea. These treatments include antibiotics, anti-inflammatories, acne medications, micro-abrasion, and laser therapy.


Rosacea currently has no known cure, but there are many therapies that can combat its symptoms.
The causes of rosacea are not well understood, but are thought to be a combination of genetic and environmental factors.

, Your dermatologist may be a good source of information regarding herbal remedies for rosacea, but you may still want to do some research on the internet to get an idea of the best potential treatments.


When searching for health information on the internet, always stick to reputable medical or health sites.
Herbalists, nutritionists, naturopaths and chiropractors may also be good sources of information regarding safe and effective herbal remedies for skin conditions.

, Licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra) reduces inflammation by inhibiting an enzyme called 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. Licorice has also been shown to significantly reduce redness, swelling and itching in patients with dermatitis.Rosacea most often affects the cheeks, nose, chin, eyelids, or forehead.
Consider applying a licorice-based gel to affected areas 2x daily.

, Feverfew (Tanacetum parthenium) reduces inflammation by inhibiting the enzymes 5-lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase and by decreasing platelet aggregation in the blood.Pregnant or nursing women and young children should not use feverfew products.
Feverfew preparations are more effective when used sparingly.

, Green tea (Camellia sinensis) has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and photoprotective properties, which is especially significant because sun sensitivity is a hallmark of rosacea. Green tea may also reduce the disruption of the skin barrier that can be present in rosacea.


Apply green tea-based creams to affected areas twice daily.
Alternatively, soaking a compress in cold brewed green tea and applying it to your face may also be of benefit.

, Oatmeal cleanses, moisturizes, soothes irritation and relieves itchiness. It also has anti-inflammatory effects. Oatmeal contains proteins and polysaccharides that bind to skin and provide a protective barrier.


A burning or stinging feeling in the face is common with rosacea, but using oatmeal-based soap can help combat this.

, Lavender (Lavandula angustifolia) may also be helpful with painful and inflammatory conditions of the skin. After you clean your face and dry it, soak a cotton ball with lavender oil and gently massage it into problematic areas such as your nose (a red, bulbous nose is common with rosacea sufferers). Repeat on a daily basis.


Start with a very small amount to see if you are allergic, because lavender can irritate the skin of some people.
Rosacea is more common in fair skinned, red-headed women, between the ages of 30 and 50, especially if they tend to blush easily.

, Applying chilled chamomile tea to your face may help with rosacea because it has soothing and mild anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties. Brew some chamomile tea, let it sit in the fridge for a few hours and then pour some of it onto a facecloth and use it as a cold compress for quick relief. Chamomile can also be found in creams and ointments.


Chamomile is a common ingredient in certain cosmetic products.
In rare cases, chamomile may cause allergic reactions, including skin rashes.

, Tea tree oil (Melaleuca alternifolia) is a good antiseptic and anti-inflammatory, making it another good option for treating the symptoms of rosacea. Dip a clean Q-tip into the bottle containing tea tree oil and then gently apply it to the inflamed areas or pustules on your face.


Apply twice daily to start with and gauge your progress.
Use tea tree oil with caution because it may cause side effects such as allergic contact dermatitis., Camphor (Cinnamomum camphora) is readily absorbed through the skin and has soothing, analgesic (pain relieving) and antimicrobial properties. However, camphor can irritate the skin, so dab a small amount on with a cotton swab to see how your skin reacts.


Refrain from applying different types of herbal oils during the course of a day. The ones listed here can be helpful, but may create issues (such as skin irritation and itchiness) when used in combination.

, Turmeric (Curcuma longa) contains more than 20 anti-inflammatory compounds, including agents that inhibit cyclooxygenase-2 (an enzyme that leads to the production of prostaglandins, which cause pain, inflammation, and swelling). Turmeric is a primary ingredient in Indian curry dishes and provides the dark yellow color.Turmeric extracts are also available in capsules.


Consider starting with 400 to 600 mg of turmeric extract three times daily.
In addition to supplements, you can also eat curried dishes or drink turmeric tea for added benefits.

, GLA is an effective anti-inflammatory agent that promotes healthy skin. Once consumed, GLA is converted to dihomogamma-linolenic acid (DGLA), which is thought to be responsible for most of GLA’s beneficial effects.Rich sources of GLA include black currant seed oil and evening primrose oil, which both come in liquids and capsules.


Start with 500 mg of either oil twice daily.
Certain nutrients (zinc, magnesium and vitamins C, B3 and B6) promote the conversion of GLA to DGLA.

, Ginger (Zingiber officinale) contains active phytonutrients, such as gingerols and shogaols, that are thought to be responsible for ginger’s potent anti-inflammatory effects.Ginger can be eaten raw, pickled (common at sushi restaurants), as a spice or taken as a supplement.


Alternatively, make ginger tea by steeping a few slices of fresh ginger root in a large cup of hot water for at least five minutes before drinking it.
Adding some ginger to a stir-fry can really spice it up.

, Grapeseed extract assists in collagen formation, which is the elastic component of skin. Grapeseed is also a decent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory, so it would be appropriate to put it directly on the face too.


Start by taking 50 mg of grapeseed extract orally, 3x daily.

See your doctor.,
Have the cyst drained.,
Keep the area clean.",How to Treat a Pilonidal Cyst1," After trying home remedies with no relief, if the pilonidal cyst has become infected, it is recommended that you see a physician. Call your physician if the cyst seems to be infected, which means it may be painful warm, swollen, or have reddened skin, or if symptoms are getting worse. It is not recommended that you try to drain a cyst on your own.


If you think a cyst has become infected, keep it clean and covered until you are seen by a physician.
Be very careful not to squeeze or otherwise damage the area.;
, Infected pilonidal cysts are treated by draining them surgically. The area is numbed with a local anesthetic and a small incision is made into the cyst to drain the contents. The contents of the cyst usually include a mixture of blood, pus, dead skin cells, and other debris.After drainage, the cyst can be left open to heal. This often takes longer to heal, but is associated with a decreased risk of having the cyst recur.
Alternatively, the cyst can be sewn shut and allowed to heal.
20 – 50 percent of the time the cyst reoccurs after an incision and drainage. Definitive treatment is surgical excision.

, After you have the cyst surgically drained, you need to make sure to keep the area clean. You should make sure the dressings are regularly changed. The wound should be cleaned daily, either in the shower or with a sitz bath.During the healing process, keep the hair around the wound shaved. You may consider trimming or shaving the hair in that area to avoid a future cyst.

Monitor for red-brown patches.,
Check for dry skin.,
Identify where eczema occurs.",How to Tell the Difference Between Eczema and Psoriasis1," Eczema and psoriasis both cause red patches on the skin; however, eczema has red patches that may also have a brownish or gray tint to them. The skin may also be covered in smaller bumps that are filled with fluid or that are crusty.The red patches of skin may be covered in raised bumps that look like goosebumps.
The affected skin may thicken or develop knots.
The color may be darker or lighter depending on the type of eczema, how long it has been affecting you, or how serious the flare up is.;
, Eczema often makes your skin dry. Your skin may be flaky or peel off when scratched. In extreme cases, the skin may be cracked because it is so dry.The skin may crack and ooze a clear substance. The cracked skin may lead to skin infections.

Press on your nostrils to disperse the medicine.,
Discard the tube.",How to Apply Bactroban2," Before using Bactroban nasal, make sure that you fully understand your doctor’s instructions and follow them carefully. Read the label carefully, and call your doctor if you have any questions about using the medication, such as how long or how often to apply it., It is important to make sure that your hands are clean before you begin your Bactroban Nasal application and after you apply the medicine.Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and warm water, and dry them completely before and after using Bactroban., To begin, insert the application tube into your nostril. Then, push half of the ointment into this nostril. Then, insert the tube into the other nostril and apply the other half of the medication., After you have applied all of the ointment between your two nostrils, begin pressing on the sides of your nostrils in an alternating fashion. Go back and forth between pressing gently on your right and left nostrils for about one minute., After you have finished, dispose of the application tube. Do not reuse the tube. These tubes are meant for a single application of Bactroban and are not meant to be reused."

Assess your condition after three to five days.,
Watch out for side effects.,
Avoid combining Bactroban with other creams.,
Reassess your condition.",How to Apply Bactroban3," Look for physical signs of improvement in your skin condition. If you see no change in your infection or it appears to be worsening, get in touch with your doctor right away. This could be a sign that you have an infection that is resistant to Mupirocin, in which case Bactroban will not help you.Your infection probably won't be completely cleared up within three to five days of beginning Bactroban use, but there should be some visible improvement by then.
Continue to use Bactroban until you can see your doctor unless it is making your infection worse.

, The following are potential side effects of Bactroban use and should be monitored carefully: skin dryness, irritation, itching, burning, redness, and blistering. If you experience any of these while using Bactroban, stop using the ointment and visit your doctor so he or she can evaluate your reaction to the medication.It is possible that you could be allergic to some of the ingredients of Bactroban, in which case you should not use it. It is best to have your doctor make this determination.
Additional side-effects are possible in young children, pregnant women, and the elderly. Ask a doctor about potential issues associated with these special cases.
Serious side-effects that warrant immediate emergency medical attention include difficulty breathing, hives, wheezing, a severe rash, and itching or swelling of the mouth or throat.

, Although Bactroban (Mupirocin) are not known to react poorly to other medicines or ointments, it is recommended that you do not use any other cream, lotion, or ointment on the same area to which you are applying Bactroban, as this could dilute Bactroban's effectiveness.If you must use Bactroban and another topical cream on the same area, try to apply them at least 30 minutes apart from one another.
Using a lotion or cream on your skin could cause irritation, especially if it contains perfumes; this could make it difficult to tell whether Bactroban is helping your skin infection.

, Once your prescribed period of Bactroban use has ended, keep an eye on your skin infection and make sure there are no signs of a lingering (or recurring) issue. If your infection does not appear to be fully eradicated (and you have completed your original Bactroban regimen), talk to your doctor.


Do not resume using Bactroban without first clearing it with your doctor, as this could make your infection worse in certain situations (such as promoting antibiotic resistance).Wait a couple of days after finishing your prescribed run of Bactroban use before deciding that your infection hasn't cleared up.

Start treating the cyst when it starts to form.,
Make a warm compress.,
Use essential oils.,
Apply drying agents.,
Use burdock root.,
Try bloodroot.",How to Treat a Pilonidal Cyst2," You can treat a pilonidal cyst with at-home treatments. The at-home treatments are best done as soon as you feel any swelling or tenderness that may indicate a pilonidal cyst is forming. If it is showing signs of infection, see your doctor.


Wash your hands carefully before and after applications of any or the home remedies.
Signs of infection include redness, swelling, pain, warmth around the area, and a white, foul-smelling pus that may look like cheese., A warm compress can help treat the pilonidal cyst. The warmth can help reduce pain and swelling. The dampness from the compress can help soften the cyst.Take a clean washcloth and soak it in warm water. Apply the warm compress to the cyst at least four times a day for at least 10 minutes.
If you want, you can soak the cotton in diluted chamomile tea (½ cup of water and ½ cup of chamomile tea steeped for 10 minutes) or diluted apple cider vinegar (equal volumes or apple cider vinegar and boiled then cooled water). You can also add a few drops of the essential oils to the water before soaking the rag.
You can also make a warm compress by soaking a chamomile tea bag. Apply the warm tea bag directly on the cyst. Chamomile tea helps promote healing.

, The essential oils used to treat pilonidal cysts, such as tea tree or turmeric oil, have anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties, which help reduce the swelling and the chance of infection. Many of these oils are used to treat cystic acne and other types of infected cysts as well as used to reduce inflammation.Essential oils you can use to treat pilonidal cysts include tea tree oil, turmeric oil, garlic oil, and frankincense oil. Castor oil is commonly used as an anti-inflammatory agent and to soften the cyst.It may also be helpful in speeding the healing of a cyst.
The essential oils can be applied directly onto the cyst, though you can also mix them with castor using three parts essential oil and seven parts castor oil. Use a cotton ball or a Q-tip for application.
Apply to the cyst four times daily. You may cover the cyst with a bandage after application of the oil. If no improvement is seen with one to two weeks, contact your physician for advice.

, You can dab witch hazel or apple cider vinegar on the cyst to help heal it by drying out. Witch hazel will help dry out the cyst because of the astringent qualities of the tannins found in it. Apple cider vinegar also has astringent properties. Apple cider vinegar and witch hazel also help to fight infections.If it stings or your skin seems to be sensitive to the apple cider vinegar, dilute the vinegar with an equal amount of water.
Just apply with a cotton ball or a Q-tip.

, Dry burdock root can help draw out the proteins in the cyst. Burdock can be used to dry out the cyst, and is a common herbal remedy for skin conditions.Mix 1/2 teaspoon of dried burdock root with one tablespoon of honey. Apply to the cyst. The honey is an antimicrobial substance and will also draw out the material in the cyst.

, Bloodroot has been used traditionally in Native American medicine to treat skin disorders. You can mix ⅛ teaspoon of bloodroot powder with two tablespoons of castor oil. Use a Q-tip to apply directly on the cyst.


Use only small amounts of bloodroot and only on intact skin with no breaks or cuts in the skin.
It should not be taken internally and should not be used around the eyes, mouth, or around the genitals.

Learn what a pilonidal cyst is.,
Determine if you are at risk.,
Recognize the signs and symptoms of pilonidal cysts.",How to Treat a Pilonidal Cyst3," A pilonidal cyst is a bump that pops up at the top of the cleft of the buttocks. The pilonidal cyst can get infected and turn into an abscess, which means it will fill with pus and need to be drained.A pilonidal cyst usually occurs due to ingrown hairs or other debris trapped beneath the skin.

, Pilonidal cysts occur most commonly in men in their twenties and thirties. They also can occur in people who have to sit a lot and have sedentary jobs, such as truck driving and office work.Pilonidal cysts also occur more commonly in people with a lot of body hair or with coarse, stiff hair. These types of hair can puncture a cyst more easily.
Other risk factors include being overweight or obese, if you have recently experienced local trauma or irritation, a deep natal cleft (the groove between the buttock), or if there is a family history of such disease.

, If a pilonidal cyst is not infected, there are usually no significant symptoms; however, if an imbedded hair punctures the cyst, either because you are sitting too much, wearing tight clothing, or some other unknown factor, the cyst can become infected. If you are experiencing any of these symptoms, you should see a physician as soon as possible. When the cyst becomes infected, you may experience:Swelling
Pain
Redness
Drainage with a nasty odor
Fever
Formation of a cavity which may contain granulation tissue, hair, and debris

Look for red patches of skin.,
Notice the areas where afflicted.,
Check for pain.,
Determine if there was a related cause.",How to Tell the Difference Between Eczema and Psoriasis2," The most common symptom of psoriasis is thick, scaly, raised red patches of skin. The patches of red skin are covered with silver-colored or white scales. A different type of psoriasis may have small red spots all over the skin. Psoriasis may also cause swollen red areas of the skin or bumps with pus.The raised scaly patches of skin are extremely dry. The patches may crack and bleed.
Pus-filled bumps will dry out and may turn brown or become scaly.

, Where the red areas appear on your skin depends on the type of psoriasis you have. Psoriasis can happen pretty much any place on your body. If you have the large, thick silvery-red scales, this can be anywhere, including your mouth or genitals. Mostly it forms on the knees, elbows, lower back, and scalp.Guttate psoriasis causes small red bumps mostly occur on the torso, back, arms, legs, and scalp.
Inverse psoriasis gives you patches of red skin along the folds of your skin, such as on your armpits, groin, under the breasts, along your buttocks, and around your genitals.You may also get psoriasis of the nails or hands. Pustular psoriasis may only affect the palms or the soles of the feet.

, Psoriasis sometimes causes pain. The red patches on your skin may have a burning sensation or become sore and tender. Some bumps may cause blisters that are painful to touch or throb. You may also experience swollen or painful joints.Some psoriasis may leave the skin feeling raw and achy.

, Some psoriasis may occur after or alongside other conditions. Some types of psoriasis, such as the small red bumps, may show up after certain illnesses like strep throat.Some forms of psoriasis may be accompanied by fever, fatigue, chills, muscle weakness, or an overall feeling of sickness.
Some types of psoriasis are accompanied by rapid heart rates or a rapid pulse.

Notice when it occurs.,
Determine the cause.,
Notice the intensity of the itching.",How to Tell the Difference Between Eczema and Psoriasis3," Eczema and psoriasis affect people at different times in their life. This can help you determine which condition the person has. Eczema is common in babies and young children. Psoriasis is common in young adults or the elderly. If the condition starts in childhood, it’s probably eczema, but if it starts as a teenager or adult, it’s more than likely psoriasis.


Eczema may occur in adults, but it mostly occurs in small children. Generally, the eczema gets better as the child grows up.
Psoriasis is most common between the ages of 15 and 30. It may also begin between the ages of 50 and 60., Eczema and psoriasis are triggered by different things. Psoriasis is caused by an unknown underlying reason, but some factors like stress, cold weather, damage to the skin, or medication side effects may cause it. Eczema occurs as a reaction to environmental factors.For example, eczema may occur if a person is exposed to allergens like pet dander or hair, jewelry metal, fragrances, detergents, or stress.
Psoriasis is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic factors and experiencing a trigger, such as a stressful event; strep throat; cold, dry weather; or a cut, scratch or sunburn., Both psoriasis and eczema can cause skin discomfort. The difference in the intensity of the discomfort or itching can provide some insight on which condition the person has.If you have psoriasis, itching the skin may cause the skin or inflamed area to thicken.Psoriasis may be accompanied by mild or moderate itching; however, with psoriasis the skin or area may be painful to touch.If it’s eczema, the itching may be intense or severe, especially at night. The itching may keep someone up because it’s so bad."

Test out apple cider vinegar.,
Know that garlic might be effective.,
Use iodine.,
Try sour apple juice.,
Prep with pineapple and sea salt.,
Test out castor oil and baking soda.,
Try using honey.,
Use home remedies responsibly.",How to Remove Moles Quickly1," Apple cider vinegar - a miracle ingredient used in countless home remedies - is one of the most common treatments for mole removal. The acids contained in the vinegar, such as malic and tartaric acid, actually work to dissolve the mole, completely removing it from the skin. Simply swab a little onto clean skin everyday using a q-tip., Garlic is another multi-purpose remedy, which many claim as an effective treatment for mole removal. Simply crush some fresh garlic into a paste and carefully apply directly to the mole, making sure to avoid the surrounding skin (garlic can burn). Cover with a bandage and leave for a few hours or overnight. This method has been said to work in as little as five days., Iodine is a good option for people with more sensitive skin, as it won't burn like garlic or apple cider vinegar. Apply the iodine directly to the mole using a q-tip, up to three times a day. Continue to do this every day, until you see a noticeable improvement in the mole's appearance., Juice a couple of sour cooking apples and apply a little juice directly to the mole. Like the apple cider vinegar, the acids in the juice will work to dissolve the mole, though it may be at least three weeks before you start to notice any improvements in the mole's appearance. , Pineapple juice can be applied directly to the mole, but you should also try blending half a cup of fresh pineapple and a quarter cup of coarse sea salt to make a fantastic facial scrub. This may help to remove the top layers of skin from the mole., Combine one tablespoon of baking soda and two tablespoons of castor oil make a paste. Apply a little directly to your mole and leave for several hours or overnight, before washing off., Honey is well-known as a delicious edible treat, but did you know it also boasts impressive anti-bacterial and healing properties? Dab a little honey directly onto the mole for a safe, natural treatment. Add in a drop of soothing, softening flaxseed oil too, if you like., There are numerous home remedies designed to get rid of moles using natural ingredients. Though there is little science to back up some of the treatments, many people will attest to their effectiveness. Just be careful when using acidic natural juices, which have the potential to burn the skin. To use home remedies safely but effectively, apply the natural juices at least once and a maximum of three times a day.If you have very sensitive skin, only let the juices sit on your skin for 10 to 15 minutes, to prevent it from becoming irritated.
Try applying a little petroleum jelly to the skin around the mole. This will prevent it from becoming unnecessarily irritated by the mole treatments.
The length of time it takes for a mole to lighten or disappear will differ from one person to another.
Be aware that home remedies are not likely to work as quickly or be as effective as surgical removal or stronger medical creams, but are a good option if you are looking for either a cost-free solution or a natural remedy.

Make an appointment with a dermatologist.,
Determine whether a biopsy is needed.,
See if shaving is an option.,
Have a surgical excision if necessary.,
Avoid using mole removal creams.,
Avoid laser mole removal.,
Don't ignore a mole that's changing.,
Protect your skin from UV rays to prevent new moles from forming.,
Try apple cider vinegar.,
Use garlic.,
Use banana peels.,
Try baking soda and castor oil.,
Use tea tree oil.",How to Remove Moles Without Surgery," Going about mole removal the safe way is a decision you won't regret. It's extremely important to have your mole examined by a professional rather than trying to remove it yourself, even if you just want it removed for cosmetic reasons. When you see a physician, he or she will be able to tell whether the mole is potentially cancerous. If it is, professional removal is the only safe method, since other methods won't adequately deal with the cancer cells.


If you don't have a dermatologist, ask your primary care physician to refer you to one.
If you don't have health insurance, see if there's a health clinic in your area that provides mole removal services or referrals.;
, At your appointment, the doctor will examine your mole to see whether it appears to be cancerous. If the mole exhibits common symptoms of melanoma or another type of skin cancer, the doctor will order a biopsy to test whether cancer cells are present. If it doesn't, the doctor will be able to go ahead and remove the mole.


To perform a biopsy, a sample from the mole is sent to a lab and tested.
If it comes back positive, further treatment will be needed. If it's negative, you can choose to keep the mole or have it removed.

, Surgical shaving is a procedure in which the mole is shaved off the surface of the skin. Local anesthesia is administered near the mole, so you won't feel pain during the process (aside from a needle prick). No stitches are required to heal a surgical shave. The process will leave a small scar behind.In some cases the area is also cauterized using a tool that burns away layers of skin to reduce the chances that the mole will grow back.
This option may be available for moles that are noncancerous and relatively small. Moles that cover a larger surface area are too big to be shaved off and cauterized.

, If the mole is cancerous, or if it's large and covers a big surface area, it will probably need to be removed using surgical excision. After administering local anesthesia, the dermatologist will make a deeper cut to remove the mole and surrounding tissues, preventing it from growing back. The wound is then closed using sutures designed to leave minimal scarring.While it may sound like a big deal, surgical excision is actually a quick, out-patient medical procedure. Once the treatment gets underway it will be over in a matter of minutes.
Since only local anesthesia is administered, you'll be fine to drive home and go about your day as normal.
Be sure to care for the wound as directed. You may have to return to the doctor's office to get the sutures removed.

, These creams are often sold online, marketed as a cheap, noninvasive alternative to surgical removal. In fact, mole removal creams can end up leaving deep pockets in your skin, since they go beyond the mole and dig into the skin underneath, causing irreparable damage. The small scar left behind by surgical removal is minimal in comparison.In addition, mole removal creams don't address the issue of whether or not the mole is cancerous. Applying it to a cancerous mole can be very dangerous; cancerous cells could remain and end up growing out of control without your knowledge.
Don't use any type of cream or other product without consulting a doctor first.

, This option is offered by some cosmetic salons, but it's not a good alternative to having your mole professionally removed by a doctor. Laser removal, like mole removal creams, does not factor in whether the mole is cancerous. Plus, the scar left behind by laser removal can be the same or worse than a surgical scar. Best to go to the dermatologist to have your mole removed safely.

, If you don't like the prospect of having surgery, you might be tempted to let your mole be and forget about it. That's usually fine, unless you notice that the mole has changed over time. A changing mole can be a sign of the presence of cancer cells. Use the ABCDE guide to examine your mole. If you notice the following, be sure to make an appointment with a doctor:A is for asymmetrical shape. If your mole has two very different looking halves, this could be a sign of cancer.
B is for border; look for moles with irregular, rather than smooth, borders.
C is for color. Moles that have changed in color, have more than one color, or have color gradations should be checked out.
D is for diameter. If your mole is larger than 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) and still growing, have it checked.
E is for evolving. Look for any changes to your mole that occur over weeks or months.

, Exposure to the sun's rays can cause new moles to form. It also makes older moles more susceptible to changing and developing cancer. Be sure to protect yourself from UV rays so you don't develop new moles, and your existing ones stay healthy.


Use sunscreen with SPF 15 or higher, even in the winter.
Try to keep your moles covered with a coverup or a hat.
Avoid using a tanning bed.

, While there are no science-based studies confirming that this method works, some have found that applying apple cider vinegar reduces the appearance of moles. To use this method,


Put a few drops of apple cider vinegar on a cotton ball.
Put the cotton ball on the mole and wrap a bandage around it.
Leave the bandage on for an hour.
Do this every day until the mole disappears. Stop if skin irritation occurs.

, Garlic has many medicinal properties, and some say it helps with mole removal. To give this method a try, you need fresh garlic, not dried. Here's what to do:


Take a clove of garlic and slice it in half.
Put the half piece of garlic on the mole and leave it overnight wrapped in a bandage.
Repeat for several days. Stop if skin irritation occurs.

, Some say applying a banana peel to a mole will help remove it. At the very least, it will moisturize your skin.


Pull the peel off a banana.
Apply it to the mole for an hour.
Repeat every day until the mole is gone. Stop if skin irritation occurs.

, Take a pinch of baking soda and moisten it with a couple of drops of castor oil. Dab this paste onto the mole. Leave it on overnight. After a few days, check to see if the mole is still there. Stop if skin irritation occurs.

, Brush tea tree oil on the mole twice daily using a q-tip. At night, you can also soak a cotton ball in tea tree oil and secure it over the mole with a Band-Aid. Repeat this method for a month, or however long it takes the mole to go away, potentially a lifetime. Stop if skin irritation occurs.

Use an emollient.An emollient is a skin-softening preparation that can be purchased over-the-counter at your local drugstore or pharmacy.,
Try a topical corticosteroid.A corticosteroid cream or ointment functions by suppressing the immune response at the area of the psoriatic lesions.,
Opt for vitamin D derivatives.,
Consider other topical treatments.Other topical treatments that can be used to treat psoriasis flare ups include tar, tazarotene, calcineurin inhibitors, and anthralin.",How to Soothe Psoriasis Flares1," Examples include petroleum jelly (Vasoline), or other thick creams that may be recommended by your doctor or dermatologist. An emollient is best applied to your psoriasis lesions right after a shower or bath.


You can also make your own emollients at home, using ingredients such as cocoa butter, almond butter, coconut oil, olive oil, and beeswax among other things.
One example is to mix 4 ounces of cocoa butter, 4 ounces of almond butter, and 2 ounces of shaved beeswax. Use heat to mix them the ingredients together, then place them in a heat-proof container and let them cool before use.
Another example is to mix 4 ounces of extra virgin olive oil with 2 ounces of coconut oil, 1 ounce of vitamin E oil, and 1 ounce of shaved beeswax. Again, mix the ingredients with heat so that they meld together, then put them in a heat-proof container and let the mixture cool before use.

Avoid verrucas by wearing shoes in communal showers and bringing your own towels and washcloths to the pool and gym.",How to Remove Verrucas1," Verrucas are simply warts on the bottom of your feet. All verrucas will go away over time, but this may take up to two years. If they are painful or bothering you, however, you should consider cryotherapy, which is freezing off the wart. Freezing hardens and kills skin cells rapidly. Once they warm up the skin cracks off, removing the verruca.


No treatment option, unfortunately, is 100% effective. However, freezing is considered the most successful option and is usually be repeated 2-3 times to fully destroy the verruca.
Freezing at home is best for smaller warts, under 1 centimeter in size. Still, you will likely need to repeat the process several times.
Freezing is somewhat painful, so it may not be the best option for young children.If you are worried about the procedure or have large verrucas that seem resistant to treatment, you can get professional cryotherapy at your doctor or dermatologist's office.;
, Found in most over-the-counter wart removers, salicylic acid is the best way to painlessly remove a verruca. Buy some at your local pharmacy and use according to the directions on the box.


Your treatment make take several weeks, depending on the verruca.
Remove the bandage and wash the verruca with soap and water once a day.
You often get faster results if you grind down the wart with a pumice stone before applying.

, All verrucas will go away on their own with time. But if the wart is getting in the way of your daily life, a doctor can help expedite the process through a variety of treatments. Seeing the doctor is rarely medically necessary, but it will help you get treatment faster., Verrucas are caused by a virus found in moist, warm environments. It enters your skin through any small cuts or openings in your foot, and thus the verruca is born. By protecting your feet in warm, wet, communal environments you can be sure to avoid most verrucas.


The virus often lives in your body for at least 2 years, meaning that a verruca might reappear occasionally until your immune system handles it."

Try using mole removal cream.,
Try out whitening cream.",How to Remove Moles Quickly2," Mole removal creams are an affordable and fairly effective method of removing moles at home.


Most creams work by lightening the mole until it is no longer visible, which can happen in a matter of weeks.
Stronger, over-the-counter creams focus on peeling the skin away layer by layer until the mole is removed.

, A general-use whitening cream can also be effective at reducing the appearance of moles. This works much like the mole removal creams since it removes the mole at a superficial level using skin lightening.

"
"
Consult your doctor or dermatologist.,
Weigh up your options.,
Consider removal using simple cutting or shaving.,
Consider removal using an excision followed by stitches.,
Consider removal using cryosurgery, or freezing.,
Consider removal using electrocoagulation, or burning.",How to Remove Moles Quickly3," You should have your mole examined by a doctor or dermatologist before you get it removed. They will be able to tell you whether your mole is malignant. They will also discuss what mole removal method is best for you.


The vast majority of moles are benign. However, symptoms including itchiness, bleeding and changes in size or color may indicate that the mole is malignant. If a mole is malignant, it should be removed as soon as possible.
If your mole is not dangerous, it may not be necessary to have it removed. However, many people prefer to have their moles removed for aesthetic reasons.

, There are several methods of removing moles and you should carefully consider which method is best for you. You will need to think about:



Effectiveness. Consider how effective each treatment is supposed to be. Will your chosen procedure remove the mole completely? Is there a risk that it could grow back?

Cost. Different procedures will vary in terms of price, so think about what you can afford.

Risk. What are the risks associated with each procedure? Can the mole become infected? Is there a risk of scarring or nerve damage? Will you need to be put under anesthetic?

, This type of removal works best for surface level moles. The mole is either removed with a surgical scissors or shaved off with a scalpel.


First, the surgeon will cut the mole away, so it no longer forms a bump on the skin.
With this type of removal, stitches are unnecessary. The wound will be cauterized or covered in a cream or solution to stop the bleeding. Then a topical antibiotic will be applied.
The wound will be bandaged up and you'll be free to leave the office in a matter of minutes., This type of removal works best for moles that are darker in color or flat moles that penetrate deep within the skin.


First, the mole and surrounding skin will be sterilized and numbed.
Then, the surgeon uses a scalpel to cut out the mole. How deep of an incision needs to be made will depend on the size of the mole and whether or not it's malign. A wider area is usually cut away when the mole is malign, to ensure it is removed completely.
The wound is then stitched closed. Some types of stitches require a follow-up appointment to be removed, while others will dissolve on their own., This is an alternate mole removal method which uses liquid nitrogen to freeze and destroy the mole. It is only offered by certain clinics.


The liquid nitrogen can be applied to the mole directly using a cotton swab, or may be applied in the form of a spray.
The liquid nitrogen may need to be applied several times to completely get rid of the mole. It will cause a blister to form on the skin, but once this heals, the skin should return to normal., Electrocoagulation burns the mole by shocking it with an electric current. This destroys the mole's tissue after several sessions. There is no need for stitches with this method, as the heat from the electricity cauterizes the wound.


Two other specialized mole removal methods offered by some clinics are radiosurgery, which uses radio frequency waves rather than electricity, and laser treatments. Both of these work on the same idea of burning the mole tissue away. "

Know that the use of UV light is one of the mainstays of psoriasis treatment.Exposure to UV light (done by a dermatologist) has been correlated with significant improvement in psoriasis lesions and flare ups.,
Bathe the affected areas prior to receiving UV therapy.You will want to bathe them and clean them by lightly scrubbing with soap and water.,
Use mineral oil to coat your psoriasis lesions before obtaining UV therapy.Interestingly enough, coating the lesions with mineral oil before therapy has been shown to allow the UV light to penetrate your skin more effectively.,
Receive UV therapy.After you have prepared your skin for your UV sessions, the next step is to go to the sessions themselves.",How to Soothe Psoriasis Flares2," Although there are risks associated with the procedure, such as a mildly heightened risk of developing a future skin cancer (due to increased UV exposure), for many people the benefits and the improvement of their condition exceed the associated risks.

, This optimally prepares your skin to receive the most benefit from UV therapy.

, This, in turn, increases the effectiveness of treatment.


Your doctor may also offer your UV-sensitizing medications prior to receiving UV therapy.
However, the use of these medications may increase your risk of burning your skin.
It is best to follow your doctor's advice, as they will be able to give you the best recommendation.

, Note that, for some, UV therapy can be inconvenient to attend and/or expensive. Look into whether you have any coverage for UV therapy under your health plan.


Alternatively, you can consider gaining actual sun exposure (within safe limits), or trying a home light treatment or a tanning bed.
Ask your doctor for recommendations that they feel will be most beneficial to your skin, while also minimizing the risk that comes with excess UV exposure.

Reduce your stress.Psoriasis flare ups have a strong correlation to emotional and psychological stress.,
Quit smoking.Smoking has been tied to worsening of psoriasis as well as to more frequent and more severe psoriasis flare ups.,
Consider other medical options.Oral treatments for psoriasis flare ups that can be prescribed by your doctor include methotrexate, retinoids, and apremilast.,
Inquire about natural remedies.Some natural remedies that may help with psoriasis flare ups include aloe vera, apple cider vinegar, tea tree oil, and turmeric, among other things.,
Understand that psoriasis cannot be cured.If you have been diagnosed with psoriasis, even if the lesions go away, you are always at risk of them returning throughout your life.",How to Soothe Psoriasis Flares3," If at all possible, find ways to decrease the stress in your life, as this will likely help to soothe your psoriasis flare ups. Consider sharing your life stressors with a close friend, or even seeking professional help from a counsellor or psychologist.


You may also consider trying activities such as meditation, yoga, or taking walks out in nature as ways to invite a calm energy into your life.
Increasing your aerobic exercise (exercise that elevates your heart rate, such as jogging, brisk walking, swimming, or cycling) to at least 30 minutes three times per week has been shown to decrease stress levels.
Psoriasis also has a close association with depression, due to the psycho-social impact that the disease can have.
If you believe that you may be suffering from depression, book an appointment with your family doctor. They will ask you further questions, and may offer you medical treatment for depression if needed.
Dealing with any concurrent depression may help to reduce your stress, and to decrease the severity of your psoriasis.

, If you have been contemplating quitting smoking, now may be the time to do so.


You can consult your family doctor for support in quitting smoking.
They can offer you nicotine replacement options as needed, as well as medications (if you are interested) that can help to tame your craving for cigarettes (such as Wellbutrin, Chantix, or bupropion).

, There are also injectable medications, known as ""biologics,"" that your doctor may recommend if other strategies to combat your psoriasis flare ups have been ineffective at producing the desired results.


Biologics are the next generation of medication of immunological diseases like psoriasis. Before you start any biologic therapy, such as a TNF alpha inhibitor it is important to get tested for tuberculosis, as this could complicate treatment. Talk with your healthcare provider about safely starting these medications.

, Speak to your naturopath for further information.


It is important to always mention to your doctor any natural remedies you are trying, to ensure that they do not interfere with any of the medical treatments you are on.

, This is because it is a condition that cannot be fully cured; it can only be managed as effectively as possible.

Take an over-the-counter pain reliever if you are worried about the pain.,
Apply the freezing agent as directed.,
Lightly wrap the frozen-over area with a bandage.,
Refreeze the wart 2-3 weeks later if it persists.",How to Remove Verrucas2," 30 minutes or so before applying treatment, take 1-2 regular strength pain relief pills. Advil or Ibuprofen are perfectly acceptable anti-inflammatories that will decrease the pain of the procedure. While freezing off a wart is not an unbearable pain, you can make the procedure as pleasant as possible., You can purchase a home cryotherapy kit, usually sold for under $20, at most drug stores.Follow the instructions on your bottle if you are performing at home. Usually, there is a small, tipped prod or swab that must be chilled. You then touch this to the verruca for 2-3 seconds. While most home cryotherapy kits work the same way, be sure to read the specific instructions on your kit in order to get the best results.


You will feel a sharp, pinch-like pain for 3 seconds or so, but after that the pain should fade. After 10-15 minutes you will likely feel nothing but light numbness.
If you have a low pain tolerance, sit down to perform the procedure. While fainting is uncommon, you want to make sure you don't hit anything if you feel woozy.

, After freezing, a scab will form over the verruca. You may even have a small blister develop. Use sterile gauze to cover up the verruca, and make sure that it is not draining or bleeding.


If you get a blister, and it breaks, carefully wipe up and contain the fluid. It may contain the wart virus.While you can swim and continue normal activity after cryotherapy, avoid using a hot tub, as it contains specific bacteria that can cause infections in the wart.

, Only small warts can be removed with just one freezing. More often than not you'll need several treatments. Be sure to keep the scab and any blisters properly cleaned and covered in between treatments to avoid infection.


See a doctor if you have bleeding, discharge, numbness lasting more than 2-3 days, or swelling consistent with an infection."

Couple freezing with home remedies for the best response.,
Weaken the wart with warm water and light filing.,
Use salicylic acid gels, creams, and patches.,
Try duct tape.,
Pierce the verruca, then disinfect and cover it.,
Give verrucas time to disappear on their own.",How to Remove Verrucas3," While freezing is the quickest, most effective method for removing warts, it rarely destroys the wart completely on the first try. Freezing can remove the bulk of the wart, making patches, salicylic acid, or other methods more effective. Using a combination of freezing and the following home remedies to best fight the verruca.

, You can make your wart treatments much more effective if you take the time to physically weaken it. Before treating the wart, use a pumice stone or a file to gently sand down the wart, removing the top layer of skin so that the medicine is more effective. You should also soak your foot in warm water before applying gels and creams, softening the skin and making it more receptive.


Make sure you dry your foot and wipe away any dead skin before applying any treatments., Salicylic acid is the main ingredient in most over-the-counter wart treatments. You can find it in gels and patches, making it a convenient, effective way to treat your verrucas over time. Generally treatment occurs slowly, often taking 12 weeks or longer to completely destroy the verrucas. Because of the amount of time it takes, many people use salicylic acid in conjunction with freezing or other removal methods.


Salicylic acid damages healthy skin as well as unhealthy, but you can protect the skin around your verrucas with a light coating of petroleum jelly.
Keep the wart covered after applying the salicylic acid so that the medicine stays close to the skin., While there is little hard evidence about the effectiveness of duct tape treatment, many people swear by its effectiveness. Apply a piece of duct tape tightly over the verruca and left there for six days.When the six days come to an end, remove the tape and soak the verruca for 5 minutes in warm water. Duct tape supposedly works by containing the virus near the skin, aggravating it while causing your immune system to focus on the wart and destroy it.


If the tape falls apply a fresh piece of tape immediately.
This may need to be repeated, or used in conjunction with other methods, so don't be alarmed if you still have a wart, or if it returns, when treatment is finished.

, This method simply speeds up your natural immune response to the wart, bringing white blood cells to the area that was cut. While this method is not strictly recommended, as it can be incredibly painful, it does have its merits. It is completely natural, costs nothing, and helps your body fight the infection on its own. If you decide to pierce it:


Sterilize the needle ahead of time by holding it over an open flame for 5-10 seconds.
Clean the wart with soap and water. Soak it for 5 minutes in warm water to loosen the skin.
Piece the wart with a quick, shallow movement. You only need to break the skin. This will be painful.
Clean the wart, cover with anti-bacterial ointment, and bandage it up for 1-2 weeks., All verrucas will clear up by themselves with a year or two, so if the verruca is not causing you any pain, you should consider letting it run its course. This is the easiest, best way to get rid of your warts, as your immune system does all the work.


However, verrucas will rarely clear up on their own in people with weakened immune systems (such as people with HIV), so it is recommended that they seek treatment.
Avoid high-heeled shoes, or anything that puts a lot of your weight onto the verruca, to ease the pain. Thicker socks and comfortable shoes will all help.
You can buy moleskin and craft a donut-shaped pad, leaving the verruca in the middle. This padding can prevent you from painfully stepping on the wart.

"
"
Have the verruca pared down.,
Have the verruca professionally frozen off.,
Get a prescription for chemical treatments.,
Opt for laser or surgical removal for serious verrucas.",How to Remove Verrucas4," In some cases, verrucas can be pared or rubbed down by a podiatrist or a chiropodist. This often happens in conjunction with other therapies, as it makes it easier for the medicine to get to the root of the wart and destroy it.


This will not completely remove the verruca, but it will decrease its size and hopefully make it less painful.

, It is possible to remove verrucas at the doctor's office using liquid nitrogen. This procedure is known as cryotherapy, and is a more intense version of home cryotherapy kits.


The liquid nitrogen is sprayed on the verruca, destroying the skin cells through freezing. A blister will form following the procedure, which will scab over and fall off within a number of days, taking the verruca with it.For very large verrucas, the procedure may need to be repeated several times before the verruca is completely removed.
Cryotherapy can be quite painful, so it is not recommended for young children.

, In some instances, your doctor will prescribe a chemical treatment in which a corrosive substance is dabbed directly onto the verruca to kill the skill cells. Some prescription treatments include:


Retinoid cream (Avita, Retin-A).
Cantharidin (Cantharone, Cantharone Plus). This medicine causes the skin under the wart to blister, lifting the wart off the skin. This medicine is applied to the wart at your doctor's office.
Immunotherapy medicines to fight the HPV virus.
Bleomycin injections, though these are very painful and rarely used anymore., Used only in the most extreme cases, this will get rid of the wart quickly and permanently. It may, however, be expensive and your foot will be painful to walk on, making this one of the least attractive options to get rid of your wart.

"
"
Cover your verruca at the swimming pool.,
Don't share towels, socks or shoes.,
Wear flip-flops in communal showers.,
Never touch other people's warts, or touch yours without washing your hands.,
Use the sterilizing wipes at the gym.",How to Remove Verrucas5," Verrucas are most commonly passed from person to person at the swimming pool, therefore it is important to cover your verruca with a waterproof plaster when you go swimming. Alternatively, you can buy special swim socks at the pharmacy.


You can cover the verruca in nail polish varnish, which creates a seal that prevents you from passing the virus on to other people., Verrucas can spread through the sharing of towels, socks, and shoes, so if you have a verruca, do not share these items with others. At the gym or local pool, you should bring and use your own equipment.

, Similarly to swimming pools, verrucas can easily be passed from person to person in communal showers. You should wear flip-flops when using public showers., The HPV virus that causes warts is incredibly contagious, so you should keep the verruca covered and avoid touching other's warts., The gym is the most common place to get verrucas for adults, but they can be easily prevented using the wipes found near the equipment. Be sure to wipe down anything you use after you're done, and consider getting some lifting gloves if you are worried about spreading verrucas."

Have the skin tag surgically removed.,
Get the skin tag cauterized.,
Have the skin tag frozen off.,
Leave the skin tag alone.",How to Remove a Skin Tag from Your Neck1," Probably the easiest way to get rid of a skin tag is to ask your doctor to remove it. This can be done quickly, right in the doctor's office. The doctor will first clean around the tag with some alcohol, then use a sterilized scissors or scalpel to snip it away.


Small tags will be removed without an anesthetic, and will be no more painful than a mosquito bite. If you have a large tag or multiple tags in the same area, the doctor may apply a numbing cream or use a local anesthetic before removing.
The skin tag may bleed a little at first, but will usually heal within 24 hours.;
, A very effective method for removing skin tags is to have them burned off with an electric cautery at the doctor's office. This will cause the skin tag to turn black and fall off almost immediately.


Unfortunately, most health insurance providers consider skin tag removal to be a cosmetic procedure, so you will need to cover the cost of this treatment yourself.
The exception is suspicious looking or symptomatic skin tags, which may be covered under your health care policy., Using a similar method to cauterization, you can also have skin tags frozen off with liquid nitrogen in a procedure known as cryotherapy. Cryotherapy is also used in the treatment of other undesirable skin conditions, such as warts and moles.


Cryotherapy treatment is also considered a cosmetic procedure and will not be covered under most insurance policies.
Cryotherapy may leave a slight discoloration on the skin after the tag has been removed, but this should fade over time., Keep in mind that skin tags are completely harmless and it is not necessary to remove them for health reasons. If the skin tag on your neck is small and not causing you any irritation, you should consider simply leaving it alone."
"
Rinse your skin.,
Dab on some rubbing alcohol.,
Wash off with dish soap.,
Put on an ice pack.,
Remove any clothes that came in contact with the poison.,
Crush up some jewel weed.",How to Get Rid of Poison Ivy Rashes1," Timeliness is key, so you should rinse the affected area with copious amounts of water within an hour or two - the sooner, the better. If you know you have contacted poison ivy, head for a stream or lake for some water. Rinse the area that came in contact with the poison ivy with cold water, being careful to avoid touching the area unnecessarily. Use the coldest water you are able to find as it will help close the pores in your skin, allowing the oils to be washed away rather than into your system. Do not use hot water at this point because doing so opens your pores, allowing more of the irritating (urushiol) oil to enter your body and setting the stage for a more severe allergic reaction.


If you encounter poison ivy near the beach, use some wet sand to scrub the area, then soak the area in seawater.Avoid showering your whole body to rinse the rash, as doing so may worse exposure by spreading the rash to other parts of your body.;
, Rinsing with cool water should be your first action when you think (or know) that you have contacted poison ivy. After you have rinsed, or if clear water is unavailable, bit of rubbing alcohol onto a cotton pad and pat it over the affected area. Drowning out the skin with the rubbing alcohol may stop the spread of the poison, and prevent the rash from becoming even worse in the future. Do this as soon as you are able in order to prevent the rash from growing.

, The toxins from the poison ivy plant are an oil, and therefore won’t be able to be removed completely with just water. Use a dish soap that advertises breaking up oil to wash the affected area. The dish soap should help to minimize the spread of the poison and limit the rash.

, Closing off your pores will keep your skin from absorbing the toxic oils. Hold a cold compress or an ice pack to the rash to constrict the pores. Doing this will also feel soothing on the blistered skin.

, If your clothes are covered in the oil from the plant, touching them later could spread the rash to other parts of your body. Remove any clothes near the area and wash them immediately, separate from any other laundry.

, If you are outdoors, look for jewelweed - a plant that often grows near poison ivy and is a natural cure for the toxins. It can be recognized as a low growing leafy bush with yellow and orange bell shaped flowers. Crush up some of the weeds to form a paste, and then smear them across the rash. Leave the paste for as long as you can, replacing with a paste of fresh jewelweed when it becomes dried out."

Notice the symptoms of boils.,
Recognize the kind of boils.,
Know the causes and placement of boils.,
Learn the risk factors.,
Treat the boils medically.,
Seek medical care.",How to Stop Recurring Boils1," Boils are bump-like manifestations on the skin. When it is advanced, a boil can disappear on its own or increase in size. When they increase in size they become abscesses and are of significant concern, both medically and cosmetically. If it increases in size, it will eventually form a head, which means that underneath the top surface, the skin becomes filled with pus. It can break open, draining and oozing pus, which is a mixture of blood cells, bacteria and fluids. The symptoms include:


A firm, typically red bump on the skin
Tenderness at the sight of the bump, which is sometimes extreme
Swelling;
, When you notice the symptoms of a boil, you may need to figure out which boil you have. A boil is a common form of a medical condition called an abscess which is a collection of pus underneath the dermis (the layer of skin under the epidermis). There are a number of different types of boils that may appear. These include:


Furuncles, which occur in hair follicles. They are associated with a fever and chills and can become chronic.
Carbuncles, which are generally larger than furuncles and can also become chronic. They can also form hardened lumps under the skin.
Cystic acne, which is both a type of acne and a type of boil associated with more severe forms of acne.
Hidradenitis suppurativa, which is an inflammatory condition of the sweat glands. It occurs when there are multiple boils cropping up under the arms and along the groin area. It is also resistant to antibiotics and may require surgery to remove the affected sweat glands.
Pilonidal cysts, which result from inflamed hair follicles at the top of the buttock crease. Pilonidal cysts are uncommon, can occur after long periods of sitting, and occurs more in men than women., There are multiple things that can cause boils. They are the result of an infection from the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus most commonly, though other fungi and bacteria can be found in the boils. Boils can be found anywhere on the body; however, they are most commonly found on the face, armpit, neck, inner thighs, and buttocks., Boils can happen to anyone at any time. The bacteria that causes boils is very common on nearly everyone’s skin, so it is possible for almost anyone to get it from that. There are also some other factors that can increase your risk. These include:


Coming into close contact with someone close who has a boil or a Staph infection. If you are around someone with Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), take extra precautions, as this can colonize on your body and increase your risk of serious infection.
Diabetes, which can suppress the immune system and lead to more infections. Due to the increase in blood sugar, microbes are more likely to colonize and infect a person with diabetes. If you have a boil and are diabetic, seek out medical attention immediately.
Any condition resulting in a suppressed immune system, such as HIV or cancer.
Other skin conditions that weaken the barrier capabilities of the skin, such as psoriasis, eczema, acne, or other condition in which the skin is dried or broken., Boils diagnosed in most cases by their appearance. There are a few different ways to treat them. Once they are diagnosed by your doctor, you can have them lanced, which is when the doctor pokes a hole in the head, or pus-filled head, of the boil and drains the pus.


In some cases, your doctor may also prescribe antibiotics, which can be topical or oral. This is usually reserved for large boils or those that last longer than two or three weeks.
If the boils are on your face or spine, are particularly painful, and/or are associated with a fever, more treatment may be necessary. , In rare occasions, the infection from a boil can spread, causing infections in the brain, heart, bones, blood, and spinal cord. Because of this, any suspected boils should not be ignored, especially if they are recurring. See your doctor if any remedies or treatments recommended do not help within two weeks. Also call your doctor if:You are running a fever
The boil is very painful or limits movement or sitting
The boil is on your face
You feel over-fatigued
You see reddish streaks coming from the boil
It gets worse or another boil develops

Learn to identify poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac, and when you see them, avoid them at all costs.,
Wear long pants, long-sleeve shirts, socks, and fully-enclosed footwear when walking in poison-ivy infested areas.,
Wear gloves when working where poison ivy may be present, such as when cutting down trees in the woods, mowing brush, etc.,
Apply a barrier cream, such as Ivy Block or Stokoguard, if you know you have a good chance of exposure to poison ivy.,
Watch out for poison ivy oil carried back on pets.,
Be careful around streams or ponds.,
Beware latent resin.,
Control poison ivy manually.,
Dispose of poison ivy or exposed objects properly.,
Wash exposed skin immediately.,
Be sure of your ability to identify poison ivy.",How to Prevent Getting Poison Ivy or Poison Oak," All are woody vines or shrubs that grow independently or climb and trail up trees, fences, and other objects, and along the ground.



Poison Ivy:

Leaves. Poison ivy has thin, often shiny, bright-green compound leaves. The edges of the leaves usually have large indentations at irregular intervals. The leaves occur in threes, with one leaf at the end of the stem, and two leaves opposite each other on the stem. Hence the saying, ""leaves of three, leave it be."" The young leaves may be orange, and in the fall the leaves turn red.
Vine. The stem is woody and in its native territory is the only native vine with aerial roots. Aerial roots are small roots that grow out of the stem and also help the vine to cling to a support. English Ivy also has aerial roots, but it is not a native plant, and its leaves are very different from those of poison ivy. The aerial roots are commonly seen on older plants growing up or over non-soil supports (stones, trees, fences, etc.). They are often reddish. The aerial roots make the main stem appear hairy, hence the saying, ""hairy rope, don't be a dope.""
Flowers and berries. Depending on the time of year, the plant may have clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers (usually in June) or hard, greenish-white berries (fall). Deer and birds eat the berries, and excrete the seeds, causing new plants to sprout in new places.



Poison oak grows primarily in dry areas and also has leaves of three leaflets, and while the leaves often resemble ""true oak"" leaves, they may take on other appearances as well. They are usually green in spring and summer, turning reddish in late summer and fall. The flowers and berries are white to yellowish-green, as in poison ivy (hence another saying, ""berries white, poisonous sight"").


Poison sumac has leaves of 7-13 leaflets, produces a small, white or grey berry, and is found in boggy or riparian areas. Hereafter, the article refers only to “poison ivy” for brevity, but the steps for poison oak and poison sumac are the same.
;
, Not only will covering your skin help protect you from poison ivy, but mosquitoes won't bother you as much either.
, It is recommended that you wear plastic gloves over cotton gloves because urushiol (the oil in poison ivy that is responsible for the allergic reaction) can eventually soak through cotton gloves. Not only is getting poison ivy on your hands a pain, it makes it very easy to spread to the rest of your body, so gloves are an important defense.Wearing pants and long sleeve shirts can give you more time before it has contact with your skin.


Exercise caution not to touch your face or eyes (or other exposed skin) with hands or gloves that may have come in contact with poison ivy.

, While no vaccine or medicine has been shown to prevent reactions to poison ivy, barrier creams containing bentoquatam seem to be effective in slowing the absorption of urushiol into the skin. Apply the cream as directed, usually about an hour before potential exposure, and thoroughly wash it off within four hours, reapplying as necessary.

, Even if you avoid poison ivy, your pets may not, particularly if you let them run free in the woods or in a large yard. The urushiol sticks to pets’ fur but typically does not irritate them, so you won’t be able to tell if they’ve gotten into it. Keep dogs on a leash and keep a watchful eye on all pets or farm animals when in poison ivy country. If you think there’s a chance your pet may have been exposed, thoroughly wash it with a good pet shampoo. Wear plastic gloves, cover exposed skin with clothing, and wear safety goggles. Try to prevent your pet from shaking off on the first wash (this is harder than it sounds; hence the safety goggles). Wash and thoroughly rinse your pet with the shampoo and warm water three times in succession to make sure the urushiol is gone. Towel dry, and immediately launder the towel in the washing machine. Let your pet fully dry before touching it with bare skin.

, If the plants are hanging into the water the oils can spread and you may be exposed without ever having seen the plant. This can be particularly serious if you swim or bathe in contaminated water

, Urushiol resin can remain active for a long time—years if kept dry—so handle potentially exposed objects with care. People commonly end up with a reaction from touching garden tools that have been left in the yard, fences from which poison ivy has recently been removed, and clothes that were exposed to urushiol but were put away before the wearer came in contact with the oil. Thoroughly wash or dispose of clothes, tools, or other objects which may have come into contact with poison ivy, and use the same caution touching dead poison ivy plants or plant parts as you would if they were alive. To wash objects, use hot, soapy water and let the clothing or object dry outside for several days.

, Spraying poison ivy with products such as Roundup or Ortho Poison Ivy Killer is not an environmentally friendly choice, especially since such products will usually kill other nearby plants as well. If you wish to remove poison ivy by hand, make sure to dress appropriately, wear barrier cream, and follow all other necessary precautions. Manual removal can be tedious, because you must remove all parts of the plant—stems, leaves, and roots—or it may regrow.

, Check with your municipality to find out any local regulations on poison ivy disposal. In general, dispose of poison ivy or contaminated objects in biodegradable plastic garbage bags, and mark the bags to warn your garbage handlers.

, It takes about 10-30 minutes after contact for urushiol to bind with skin, so fast cleaning may prevent a reaction. If you think your skin may have been exposed to poison ivy, clean the affected area with rubbing alcohol, and then wash it with cool water.

, Use clean hands to dab aloe vera gel directly over the entire cyst.


Aloe vera relieves pain and reduces swelling. Applying it to an inflamed cyst can help speed up the body's natural healing process.

, Use a sterile cotton ball or cotton pad to apply witch hazel gel or cream directly over the cyst on your back. Use just enough witch hazel to completely cover the cyst, and allow it to soak into your skin before cleaning the area.


Witch hazel is an astringent. The bark and leaves of witch hazel can be turned into a topical gel or cream, and the tannins witch hazel contains remove excess oil from the skin when the product is applied. As the oils dry up and the pores are tightened, the cyst can begin shrinking.
Using too much witch hazel can cause skin irritation and may make the cyst worse, so it is best to use this treatment only once a day.

, Apply pure apple cider vinegar directly to the cyst and cover the area with a clean bandage. Keep the bandage on for three to four days.


After you remove the bandage, you may see a hard layer over the surface of the cyst. Carefully wash the area with soap and water and allow the pus to drain.
Once the area is clean, apply a fresh bandage. Keep this bandage on for two to three days. After removing it, the cyst and surrounding skin should be healed.
Apple cider vinegar is believed to help dry excess oils and kill the bacteria responsible for an infected cyst.
Individuals with sensitive skin may not be able to tolerate this treatment, however. If the area burns or severely itches after you apply the apple cider vinegar, you should clean it off immediately and try another treatment option.

, Combine 1/2 cup (125 ml) of wheatgrass with 2 to 4 Tbsp (30 to 60 ml) of pure honey in a blender. Blend the two ingredients together until a thick paste forms, and apply that paste to the cyst.


You may need to blend the wheatgrass down into a liquid before adding the honey. Wheatgrass is rich in various nutrients that help your skin stay healthy, so it makes a good base for the honey paste.
Honey has anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties, both of which help facilitate healing. Add enough honey to the blended wheatgrass to create a thick paste that can be applied over the entire cyst.
After applying the paste, cover the area with a clean bandage and leave it alone overnight. Remove the bandage in the morning and wash the area with mild soap and water.

, If you need to shrink the cyst on your back quickly, you can schedule an appointment with a dermatologist. He or she may inject a cortisone or steroid shot directly into the cystic area.


Both types of injections should cause the cyst to shrink within hours, and both should also remedy any pain or itching previously caused by the cyst.
The use of injections may cause the cyst to heal unpredictably, so you might be left with an indentation or scar after the injection takes effect. This result does not happen to everyone, but it is a definite possibility, so keep the risk in mind when considering this option.

, Depending on size and position of the cyst, your dermatologist may recommend draining it through a needle or catheter.During the procedure, your doctor will usually numb the area before inserting a needle directly into the cyst. The pus and other fluids inside the cyst are then drained through the needle, causing the cyst to collapse in the process.
When done carefully, this procedure does not typically cause any major scarring or pain. Some scarring is possible, but when it does occur, it is usually minimal.

, Surgical removal is usually best when you have a cyst on your back that returns time and time again. Standard excision surgeries are usually relied on for most cyst removals.Conventional wide excision surgery removes the cyst completely, so it is especially worthwhile if the cyst is suspected to be malignant or if it has caused other health problems.
Minimal excision surgery uses a smaller excision to extract the cyst, and as a result, the scarring is much lighter and more likely to heal completely. It is not as effective as wide excision surgery, however, so there is some risk that the cyst will still return.

, Depending on your circumstances, your doctor may recommend the use of a laser with a punch biopsy excision.


During the procedure, the doctor will use a laser to make a small hole in the cyst. The contents of the cyst are then drained, leaving the outer walls to collapse naturally.
Roughly one month later, the drained outer walls are surgically cut and removed.
This procedure takes longer overall, but it leaves minimal scarring and usually prevents the cyst from returning.

, After removing the cyst on your back, your dermatologist should recommend some form of aftercare treatment to minimize scarring and complete the healing process.


Aftercare treatment is especially important when a cyst is removed surgically.
Most aftercare treatment involves the use of an antibiotic ointment. This ointment should be applied to the affected area as directed, and you should continue using it until the area completely heals.
Some dermatologists may also prescribe a scar cream to lighten and minimize possible scarring.

Limit your time in the sun.,
Limit weather exposure.,
Lower the heat on your showers.,
Pick a gentle facial cleanser.,
Limit stress as much as possible.,
Skip creams, cleansers, and foundations that have irritants.,
Change your exercising habits.",How to Reduce Rosacea1," Sunlight is one trigger that can make rosacea worse. If you must be out in the sun, be sure to use a high-SPF sunblock, one built for sensitive skin, to help protect your face.Choose a sunscreen that is at or above 30 SPF. Also, look for the words ""broad spectrum,"" which means it protects against different types of rays.Water-resistant sunblock can help protect you if you are going to be swimming or getting wet or think you might sweat while you are outside.;
, It's not just the sun that can trigger rosacea flareups; other types of weather can be harmful, too. For instance, if it's hot and humid, it's best to stay inside with air conditioner where it's cool and dry. In the winter, cover your face and nose with a scarf to protect yourself against the cold wind and apply a gentle moisturizer to your face daily to help with dry skin., Hot water, whether in the tub or shower, can also make you flush worse than normal with your rosacea. Also, it's important to be gentle when scrubbing your face, as you can aggravate your condition., A gentle facial cleanser won't trigger flareups, and it is fine to use even when you are having a flareup. Pick ones that say they are made for sensitive skin. For instance, cleansers made by Dove or Cetaphil are often made for those with sensitive skin.Clean your face twice a day, as it helps remove dirt, makeup, and oil that can aggravate your condition.For facial hair, it's best to use an electric blade rather than a razor, as it's less harsh.Dry thoroughly. That is, you should give your face time to dry out before trying to apply anything to it and then give the medication time to dry., Stress can trigger flareups for many people, so reducing stress or learning how to deal with it can help decrease your problems with rosacea.In fact, many people found that using techniques such as meditation helped them control their flareups.For instance, you can use deep breathing to calm yourself down when you feel yourself getting stressed. Close your eyes, and focus on your breathing. Count to 10 as you breathe in through your nose, letting your belly (not your chest) rise. Then count to 10 as you breathe out through your mouth. This will stimulate your parasympathetic nervous system and relax you. Keep this process going until you feel yourself calm down., Anything can trigger a flareup for a person with rosacea, including any product you put on your face. Skip ones that don't say they are for sensitive skin, and don't use ones that have alcohol in them., High-intensity exercise that makes you sweat heavily for a long time can contribute to rosacea. Of course, you don't want to stop exercising altogether, as it helps you stay healthy, but you should take some steps to protect yourself.Break it up. Go for shorter routines, say about 15 minutes, rather than hour-long workouts.Try to stay cool. Part of the problem is the heat, so exercise at cooler times and in cooler areas. Swimming may be a good option for you to stay cool while you exercise."

It is related to environmental allergies, hay fever, and asthma, meaning that if you develop one of these conditions, you are more likely to develop the other conditions.Atopic dermatitis is an immune response. Typically, an irritant (called the ""precipitant"" or immediate cause) comes into contact with your body. The body gets confused and overreacts, causing inflammation of the skin even in areas that weren't exposed.;
, If you develop acute (short-term) eczema, you may see small, red, itchy bumps on your skin. There might also be some swelling and scaling. If the eczema continues, the symptoms may reach the chronic stage, developing into itchy, thicker patches of skin that turn brownish or reddish.In addition, the bumps may weep, meaning they produce liquid. You may also have scaly, dry skin., Atopic dermatitis can come and go over time. When the symptoms are worse, it's called a flare-up. However, you can go for long periods when you may exhibit no symptoms., This condition is not contagious, meaning you can't catch it by coming in contact with someone who has it. However, it can be passed genetically from parent to child., This condition can cause problems with your vision. If you think your vision is being affected by a recent flare-up, always speak with your doctor.One way it affects your vision is the skin around your eyes can be red and puffy, making it difficult to see. However, this disease has also been linked to a higher occurrence of cataracts and spontaneous retinal detachment, even when treated., Application of cold causes temporary numbness of the nerve endings, leading to reduced sensation, soothing the skin, and reducing your urge to itch. It also helps in sloughing off dead skin, leading to a smoother appearance and quicker healing.Put cold water in a bowl with some bath oil.If you want it colder, you can add some ice to the water.
Soak a paper towel or clean washcloth in the water. Hold it on your face over the affected area for about 5 minutes., A cream or ointment is best, as they have more oil than lotions, which are heavier on water. The oil helps protect and moisturize your skin better.Pick a cream that is fragrance-free, and make sure to keep it out of your eyes when applying it.
Apply moisturizers as often as your skin feels dry. Applying it after a shower or washing your face is especially effective. These moisturizers soften skin and help heal and prevent flare-ups., One of the most effective treatments for atopic dermatitis is corticosteroid cream, which can help flare-ups go into remission.Only use low-strength preparations intended for use around the eye. (These may be labeled for ""ophthalmic"" use.)


However, this treatment becomes more difficult when the eczema is on or near the eyes. Your skin is not as thick in these areas, so using it for prolonged periods can be more dangerous. You should ask your doctor before using a cream near your eyes and limit your use around your eyes to 2 weeks or less.Try to keep the corticosteroid cream out of your eyes when applying it.

, Stress can make your eczema worse, as can exposure to chemical irritants. Because of this, it often helps to use a holistic medicine approach. Aromatherapy, massage, and similar techniques can help reduce stress and potentially bolster your immune system. Many alternative medicine skin preparations are soothing and irritant-free, such as a light layer of unrefined coconut oil.If you are currently taking medication for your eczema, consult your doctor before taking any dietary supplements or skin care treatments, including herbal remedies.
Essential oils are highly concentrated and should not be used undiluted, especially around sensitive areas such as the eyes. Even when diluted, take care not to let any get in your eyes., Oral antibiotics are sometimes used when you get an infection related to your dermatitis. Because the eye area is more sensitive, your doctor may want to prescribe you an antibiotic if you develop dermatitis around one or both of your eyes., Eczema is often caused by exposure to an allergen. Avoiding your personal triggers is the number one strategy for controlling flare-ups. If you know you are sensitive to certain substances, do your best to avoid them.

Remember that the allergen does not need to come into contact with the affected skin. Your body can detect the allergen in one location and react with a flare up in a different place.

, Stress can increase flare-ups, so try to keep stress levels down. Learn techniques to keep you or your child more even throughout the day.Identify stressors. When your stress levels are running high, think about what's affecting them. Write about what makes you worried or excited, and think about what you can do to reduce the stress of that event. For instance, if you find your job stressful, maybe you can reduce stress by asking your boss if you can telecommute once a week.Try conscious breathing to calm yourself. Take a moment to close your eyes. Let your breathing fill up your mind. Focus on slow, deep breaths, and think only about your breathing. Keep focusing until you feel yourself calming down.Try animal sounds with your kids to meditate. Have them breathe in deeply while raising their arms. As they lower them, have them make extended sounds such as hissing or buzzing. This exercise helps them slow down their breathing and takes their mind off of what is stressing them out., Scratching will only make the rash worse. In fact, when eczema appears near the eyes, scratching can cause swelling, as well as make the skin red and puffy.Scratching can also cause you to lose part of your eyebrows and eyelashes.If you or your child scratches at night, try wearing gloves or trimming your fingernails to help reduce the problem., Over-the-counter antihistamines, such as loratadine and fexofenadine, can help control the symptoms of atopic dermatitis. Because this disease is related to other types of allergic reactions such as hay fever, antihistamines can provide relief, especially for the itching.Follow the directions for the antihistamine you chose. With most non-drowsy antihistamines, you take them once day. Begin a regimen when you have a flare-up.However, if you're having trouble sleeping because of your eczema, an antihistamine that caused drowsiness can be helpful to take at night., Allergens and irritants can contribute to flare-ups. Sometimes changing a product such as laundry detergent or soap may help in treatment of eczema. Attempt to isolate what causes you issues by slowly switching out products to help determine what bothers you.While you are having a flare-up, it's best to skip make-up altogether.It may help to keep a diary recording the food, perfume, scents, and other substances you come into contact with, along with the eczema flare-ups you experience. Look for patterns in the substances you contact in the days before a flare-up.You can visit an allergy specialist to help identify your allergies.
The face and eye area can be especially problematic because so many products are applied in this area, particularly on women. Sunscreen, make-up, soaps, and fragrances can all cause flare-ups., While food allergies have a specific definition (they cause an immediate reaction), foods can contribute to flare-ups. Most common allergens are found in peanuts, egg, milk, fish, rice, soy and wheat.


If you're breastfeeding a child with eczema, you should avoid tree nuts, as you can pass them to your child., When washing your face, choose a soap that has a high fat content, rather than one that dries out your face. Also, pick one that is unscented.Skip soaps that are antibacterial, as they can dry out your skin.Also, avoid soaps that have alpha-hydroxy acid, as it can also remove moisture from your skin.Look for cleansers that say ""gentle"" and ""fragrance-free.""

, Too much hot water and soap can make eczema worse, especially in the delicate skin around the eyes. Lower the temperature of the water and wash less frequently, or take baths without soaking the affected skin., Hot, dry air can irritate your skin and make itching and flaking worse. If necessary, run a humidifier to add moisture to the air., This goes from anything from hot showers to direct sunlight, to hot climates.


Use lukewarm water when you shower or wash your face. Avoid hot water, which can irritate your sensitive skin.Don't spent too much time in hot weather; the heat can easily irritate your skin and cause more inflammation.

Identify triggers for your baby's eczema.,
Observe your baby's diet for possible food allergies.Although the relationship between dietary triggers and eczema is controversial, there is suspicion that food allergies and sensitivities may be triggers for eczema flare-ups for some babies.,
Give your baby a short lukewarm bath.It is best to use lukewarm rather than hot water, as hot water can contribute to drying the skin, which worsens eczema.,
Apply moisturizing cream.,
Dress your baby in loose clothing.Tight clothing can be irritating, so allowing the skin to breathe better with loose clothing is a good idea.,
Try a humidifier.Because eczema is exacerbated with dry skin, using a humidifier to add moisture to the air can reduce your baby's eczema flare-ups.,
Cut your baby's nails short to reduce scratching.Eczema is an itchy rash, and scratching it only makes it worse.,
Check with your doctor to confirm your baby's diagnosis.While eczema is extremely common, you will want to see a doctor or pediatrician to ensure that this is in fact your baby's diagnosis, and to rule out that nothing more severe is going on.",How to Treat Baby Eczema1," Certain babies are more predisposed to developing eczema than others, as it has a strong genetic component. However, if you pay careful attention, you will likely notice that certain things in the environment temporarily worsen, or trigger, a flare-up of your baby's eczema. Common triggers to watch for (and to avoid if possible) include:Soaps and detergents. If you notice that this is a trigger for your baby, use mild, unscented soaps and detergents specifically designed for babies with sensitive skin to minimize irritation.
Certain clothing, such as wool or polyester
Dry skin
Heat and sweat
Stress
Dietary triggers;
, Common problem foods include dairy products, wheat, soy products, eggs, nuts and seeds.


Try removing common problem foods one by one from your baby's diet and see if you notice an improvement in his or her eczema.
If you want to identify the specific trigger, it is important to eliminate only one food group at a time in order to determine which of them specifically is problematic (keeping in mind that it is possible for your baby to have more than one food allergy or sensitivity).
See your doctor to confirm whether or not your baby has a food allergy. Your doctor can order blood tests or refer you to an allergist to help determine if your baby has an allergy to certain foods.

, Also, shorter baths (ideally less than 10 minutes) are better than longer ones, as prolonged exposure to warm water also reduces the skin's natural moisture. You should give your baby a bath every two to three days.


Gently pat your baby dry with a towel after bathing. Do not rub, as this can exacerbate skin irritation and worsen eczema.
You can also try adding oatmeal soaking products to your baby's bath, as this may help to ease itching.
Avoid using scented bubble baths. Stick with gentle products that are made for babies with sensitive skin, such as Aveeno, Cetaphil, or Eucerin.

, Be sure to apply moisturizing cream once a day to maintain the skin's natural moisture, and apply it after bathing as well. Some examples of moisturizing agents that work well include Eucerin, Cetaphil, Nutraderm, and Aveeno., Also, avoid dressing your baby in too many layers of clothing or overheating your baby, as sweating from excess clothing can worsen itching and eczema.

, You can try putting the humidifier on at night in the same room that your baby sleeps.


Using a humidifier is most important in dry climates or during cold, dry weather.

, Therefore, keep your baby's nails short to reduce the impact of any scratching.


You can also have your baby wear mittens or gloves during the day so that he or she cannot scratch, if the eczema is particularly severe.
Another protective measure is applying wet dressings to the areas of the eczema rash. Applying a wet dressing helps to keep the skin moist, and also protects it from your baby trying to scratch. Be sure to change dressings every eight hours. Make sure that you ask your doctor about how to use wet dressings for your baby.

, Also, your doctor can suggest medical treatments if lifestyle measures alone are insufficient in controlling your baby's eczema.

Consult your doctor for a definitive diagnosis if you notice any signs of genital warts, especially if you’ve engaged in unprotected sex.Both men and women can contract genital warts, and repeat outbreaks are common because HPV can remain in your system.Genital warts often present few symptoms and even when signs are present, they may be mild and cause no discomfort.In women, genital warts can appear on the vulva, the perineum, the anal canal, and on the cervix.They can also appear on the mouth, tongue, lips, or throat of a person who engaged in oral sex with an infected person.Common symptoms of genital warts in women are: small, flesh or grey colored lesions in your genital area; lesions clustered together that resemble cauliflower; itching or other discomfort in your genital area; and bleeding during intercourse.The warts or lesions may not be visible to the naked eye.;
, If you notice any signs of genital warts, including lesions on your genitals, or a partner has revealed they have genital warts, see your doctor. She will run tests and confirm a diagnosis and develop the best treatment plan for you.Tell your doctor about the symptoms you're experiencing, signs of genital warts that you've seen, and if you’ve had unprotected sex.
If you’re experiencing a recurrence of genital warts, contact your doctor to see if medication is necessary., If your doctor suspects that you have genital warts, she may order medical tests. These simple screenings will help definitively diagnose the sexually transmitted disease and make it easier to develop the best treatment plan for you.Your doctor may apply a mild acetic acid solution to the suspect areas to see if they whiten any potential warts. After this, she may view the area with a magnifying instrument called a colposcope.Your doctor may give you a Pap test to detect changes in your vagina or cervix from warts or the HPV virus, which causes genital warts.If you are over the age of 30, your doctor may do a test to see if you have HPV in your system, which can help her diagnose genital warts.In some cases, your doctor may biopsy suspect spots, especially if they are atypical or the diagnosis is uncertain., Genital warts may disappear on their own without treatment.If your genital warts are not painful, consider leaving them to heal without treatment.About 30% of genital warts will regress (go away) within the first 4 months after infection, even without treatment.If you decide to not treat your warts, you can leave them to heal as long as they’re not causing you any discomfort.Be aware that even if you decide to leave the warts to heal on their own, that you can still infect others with warts and are more likely to get other diseases.If you choose to not treat your genital warts, they are also more likely to recur.They may also be hard to keep clean.HPV can cause cancer, including cancer of the vulva, vagina, penis, or anus. Because of this, it's a good idea to have a doctor monitor your condition., If your doctor diagnoses you with genital warts, she will likely prescribe you a treatment that you apply directly to your skin. It’s important to use a prescribed medication for genital warts and not an over-the-counter remedy.Your doctor may prescribe imiquimod, podophyllin, or podofilox or to treat the lesion.A prescription ointment using sinecatechins (green tea extract) may be prescribed for external and anal warts.You apply these treatments to the affected areas as prescribed by your doctor.Be aware that these treatments can cause skin sensitivity and weaken condoms or diaphragms.Your doctor may also apply trichloroacetic acid (TCA) to your genital warts.

Cryotherapy, or freezing therapy, uses liquid nitrogen to freeze the area around a wart. The skin then forms a blister that sloughs off the wart. You may require several rounds of cryotherapy to remove genital warts.Electrocautery uses an electrical current to burn off warts.Surgical excision removes an entire area of suspect skin or a cluster of genital warts.Laser treatments are often a final measure for difficult to treat or extensive warts.All of the surgical treatments can cause pain, swelling, and scarring., During the course of your treatment for genital warts, abstain from sexual activity if you can, including oral and anal sex.If you cannot refrain from sex, use a latex or polyurethane condom. This may help from spreading the disease to your partner and decrease your risk of reinfection.If you have lesions, sex may cause discomfort.Be aware that genital wart treatments can decrease the efficacy of condoms., One of the best ways to treat warts is to not get them, but this isn’t always possible.

Because of the increased hormone levels in your body, you may see your genital warts become worse during pregnancy. If they cause you pain or discomfort, talk to your OB/GYN about ways to treat them.Although genital warts do not affect fertility or the ability to have a safe pregnancy, not treating the disease during pregnancy can cause complications such as bleeding or an inability of vaginal tissues to properly stretch.Not treating the disease may also mean you need to have a cesarean delivery (c-section).Pregnant women should usually not use topical treatments unless they are applied by your physician.TCA and cryotherapy are usually effective and safe for pregnant patients., If a doctor treated you for genital warts, get retested at regular intervals for them and for HPV. This will help ensure that the virus and disease have left your system and that you are no longer contagious.Recurrence of genital warts is common and is often treated with the same course of medications., The best way to treat genital warts is to avoid getting them. Using latex or polyurethane condoms and limiting the number of your sex partners will minimize your risk for contracting the disease or having a recurrence.Always use condoms during sexual contact. Although condoms will not eliminate your risk of getting warts, they will decrease your risk. If you have oral sex, use a condom or dental dam.The more sexual partners you have, the higher your risk of getting genital warts is. Try and limit the number of partners you have to decrease your risk, and always use condoms with your partners., Doctors are not sure why, but being a smoker may make you more likely to contract genital warts.This may be because smoking suppresses your immune system.Being a smoker can also increase your likelihood of a recurrence. Try and avoid smoking for your overall health if possible., There is now a vaccine available that can protect against the strains of HPV which cause genital warts. If you or your child is between the ages of 9 and 26, consider getting the Gardasil vaccination to help avoid contracting genital warts.Be aware that Cervarix, which also protects against HPV, does not protect against genital warts.Getting the vaccination may reduce your risk of getting genital warts by 50%."

Make an appointment with a dermatologist.,
Get a cortisone injection into your cyst.This will help to shrink the cyst by diminishing inflammation.,
Inquire about incision and drainage.Because cysts are generally fluid-filled, if your doctor punctures the surface of the cyst, much of the material inside can be drained (i.e.,
Move on to surgical options if your cyst recurs.If you find that you have a persistent cyst, and if you have been unsuccessful at treating it via the other methods, it may be time to consider surgery.,
Follow post-op instructions carefully.,
Ask your doctor about oral antibiotics.",How to Remove a Cyst on Your Face2," If your health care coverage requires a referral to see a specialist, you will want to arrange for an appointment with your primary care physician first.

It is also a quick and easy procedure that can be completed in one office visit with your doctor.

, removed), thereby greatly speeding up the healing process. The one downside to this method, however, is that it does not prevent recurrence of the cyst down the road. To the contrary, although this method is extremely effective in the short-term, it frequently leads to recurrence of the cyst later on. However, it is worth a shot and may very well be the cure you are looking for!


The doctor will pierce the cyst with a sharp object and ensure that all the keratin, sebum or other substances are ejected from the cyst so that it can heal.
Incision and drainage will require careful cleaning and dressing to avoid infection. Follow your doctor's instructions after the procedure to maintain good hygiene in the area.
Never pop open a cyst at home or on your own, as doing it improperly could result in infection and scarring.

, Generally, in order to proceed with surgery, your doctor will want little to no inflammation around your cyst. As a result, if your cyst is inflamed, you may need to undergo a corticosteroid injection first to diminish the inflammation prior to surgery.


You can opt for more mild surgery where just the front wall of the cyst is removed and the rest is left to heal on its own.Alternatively, the entire cyst can be removed surgically. This gives the greatest chance of preventing recurrence or any further problems down the road. This procedure will involve sutures for about a week afterwards, at which point you will return to your doctor to have them removed.
If you are opting for a complete cyst excision, ask your doctor if it is possible to have an incision through the mouth in order to avoid a scar. This is a new surgical technique that is becoming more common, as it is cosmetically preferable., After surgery, carefully follow all the surgeon's directions for optimal healing. Because the cyst was removed from your face, attention to proper healing is key in order to avoid cosmetic concerns down the road. Potential complications of surgery can include scarring, infection, and/or damage to facial muscles.

, These can be an option for people with frequent facial cysts. If you get facial cysts often, your medical provider may prescribe a course of oral antibiotics to prevent more cysts from appearing.

Limit alcohol.,
Skip spicy foods.,
Avoid hot beverages.,
Watch for individual food triggers.",How to Reduce Rosacea2," Many people who have rosacea have flareups triggered by alcohol. When you drink, check to see if that causes a flareup. You may find that certain alcohol beverages are worse than others for you. Limit the ones that cause flareups, or eliminate alcohol from your diet completely., For some people, eating spicy foods, such as chili peppers, cayenne pepper, and even black pepper or paprika, can trigger an outbreak of rosacea. Try using other flavors instead of these spicy ones in your favorite foods., Some people see an increase in rosacea across their face after consuming hot beverages. If you notice this problem for yourself, you may need to start avoiding hot drinks altogether to keep your rosacea under control.You may be able to just lower the temperature of your drinks (from blazing hot to lukewarm) or decrease the number you drink per day to help your rosacea., Everyone has different triggers when it comes to rosacea. Try to pay attention to the foods you eat to see if you can figure out what triggers flareups for you.For example, triggers from sour cream and yogurt to chocolate, oranges, and soy sauce have been reported by people who suffer from rosacea, as well as avocado, vinegar, eggplant, and spinach.Some people have also had issues with histamine-loaded foods (like alcohol, chocolate, pickled foods, beans, walnuts) which may be counteracted by taking an antihistamine two hours before a meal, and niacin-rich foods ( like turkey, liver, mushrooms, peanuts), which may be helped by consuming aspirin."

Because pills affect the whole body, your doctor will likely want you to try a cream, gel, or lotion first, as you just apply these topically to your face.Metronidazole is the standard of treatment for rosacea. The mechanism that it acts upon in unknown, but it is believed to be through antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties.
Topical metronidazole may be helpful in managing pustules and papules, while also contributing to the reduction of redness. It is available in 0.75% cream or gel, 1.0% cream or gel, or 0.75% lotion.
Topical metronidazole is generally well-tolerated, with potential side effects of irritation, dryness, and stinging sensation.
For severe rosacea, doxycycline, minocycline, and tetracycline may be used.

, Acne drugs mainly work to clear up rosacea if it is particularly bad. That is, these drugs primarily help if you've developed lesions from your rosacea, much like acne scars. Isotretinoin is a common drug for this use., Laser surgery and electrosurgery is an option if you have severe scars. It can help reduce the look of blood vessels under your skin, as well as take down any build up of tissue to help your overall look., A new technique being used to control rosacea is light therapy. Light therapy uses intense light pulses on your face, and it may lessen the redness of your face.However, research is still being done on this treatment for rosacea."

Use anti-histamines to help with itching.,
Try topical corticosteroids.Corticosteroids function by suppressing the immune response, thereby lessening the intensity (or altogether getting rid of) the eczema rash.,
Ask your doctor for prescription medications.,
Use UV therapy as a last resort.UV therapy is not used as a first-line treatment because it increases the risk of skin cancer (it is analogous to spending time in the sun).,
Understand the course of eczema.",How to Treat Baby Eczema2," Anti-histamines such as Zyrtec or Claritin can be taken orally, and help with symptom management by reducing the itching associated with eczema.These medicines are available over-the-counter.


Ask your doctor about appropriate dosing for your baby, as medication dosing depends on the age of the infant.

, You can purchase 1% hydrocortisone over-the-counter at your local drugstore or pharmacy.


Apply the medicine to the areas of the rash once or twice per day, or according to the directions on the bottle.

, If over-the-counter options are not enough, then your doctor may order prescription medications for your baby.Your doctor can offer higher strength immune suppressant medications, such as stronger topical corticosteroids or other creams, or rarely oral medications. Or, your doctor may recommend other options such as anti-inflammatory medications.


If your baby's rash becomes infected, he or she may also need topical or oral antibiotics to combat the infection.
Follow your doctor's suggestions, as he or she will know best exactly what your baby needs.

, However, it is sometimes used in very severe cases of eczema.

, Eczema is not a curable condition, but it is one that can be effectively managed by avoiding triggers and treating symptoms. Many people experience prolonged periods of remission of their eczema, and may go years without having any symptoms.


If your baby has eczema, the chances of it recurring later on are high, but some babies outgrow it.

Purchase oats.,
Make an oat sachet.,
Fill the bathtub.,
Place the sachet in the tub.,
Put your child in the tub.,
Gently bathe your child.,
Pat dry.",How to Relieve Itching from the Chicken Pox with Oats1," As a sort of ""super-food,"" oatmeal is not just edible but has number of healing uses: it can moisturize skin, reduce itching, serve as an emollient, and has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. It can also protect against sun damage and the inflammation of certain skin conditions.You should be able to find oatmeal at any food store or supermarket. Whole oats -- not instant -- work better for bathing. Avoid flavored varieties, as well., Pour rolled oats into a nylon stocking or some muslin cloth. The amount you will need for a child is about 1/3 cup. Then, tie a knot in the fabric so that the oats cannot spill out. The key is to use a fabric that will hold the oats while allowing the water to pass through.

, Make sure the water is at an appropriate level and temperature for your child. Not too hot, but warm enough to be soothing to the touch and to activate the oats' healing properties. Lukewarm to warm water is best.

, Leave the oat sachet in the water and let it soak for a few minutes. The oatmeal will soon let off a milky liquid that soothes itching., Once the oats are good and soaked, place your child in the water with them. Take care, as the oatmeal will make the tub more slippery than usual., Let your child soak in the oat bath for between 15 to 20 minutes. Lift the sachet and allow the milky water to gently dribble from the oats onto your child's skin surface., Rather than rubbing, pat your child dry with the towel to avoid aggravating their itchy skin.

Purchase colloidal oatmeal.,
Make your own colloidal oatmeal.,
Prepare the bath.,
Put your child in the tub.,
Bathe your child.,
Pat dry.",How to Relieve Itching from the Chicken Pox with Oats2," Colloidal oats are a special type of oats. They are not edible like regular oats but are finely ground into a powder, and are used in products like shampoo, shaving gel, and moisturizing cream. Colloidal oats have high levels of starch that moisturize in addition to antioxidants and anti-inflammatories, meaning they work great as a soothing and protective skin agent.You should be able to find colloidal oats at most health or natural food stores.

, Alternately, you can make your own colloidal oats by using a food processor. Just take regular oats, not the instant kind. Grind them in a food processor or other grinding mill until they are a fine powder, eliminating any larger flakes. You make as much in advance as you'd like, from a small amount or an entire container.

, You will need about 1/3 cup of oat powder for each bath. Run the bath with lukewarm to warm water. Then, while the tub is filling, pour the oat powder into the running water stream. This will better disperse the oats into a colloidal solution, meaning that they will be suspended in the water and not sink to the bottom of the tub. Make double sure that they are properly dissolved by stirring the water to break up clumps.

, As with a sachet, place your child in the water once the oats have started to work their magic. Take care again because the colloidal oats may make the tub quite slippery., Allow your child to again soak from 15-20 minutes with the colloidal oats. Rather than using the sachet or sponge, scoop up the milky water with your hand and dribble it over your child. , Pat you child dry with a clean towel when done and avoid rubbing their skin, and you are done. You can bathe them once or twice a day like this while the condition persists, more if advised by a doctor.

Look into whitening agents.,
Consider mole removal creams.,
Know your medical procedure options.",How to Remove a Mole at Home1," Over-the-counter skin bleaching creams can be used to treat the mole. They work by slowly discoloring the mole until it is less obvious, particularly for flat moles with no raised borders. The mole will still be present, but not as easily visible.


Look for a cream that contains 2% Hydroquinone, an ingredient that is available over the counter and is FDA approved. Hydroquinone works by reducing the appearance of melanin in the skin on which it is applied.Follow the manufacturer's instructions for use, taking care to test the cream on a small inconspicuous area of skin before using it on your mole. Also be sure to only apply the cream to the mole, and not the surrounding skin.;
, Mole removal creams such as Nevi-Skin are a fairly cost-effective method to treat. Use them with caution, as their claims have not been evaluated by the FDA.


Be sure to carefully follow the manufacturer's instructions, and stop treatment immediately if you have an adverse reaction such as bleeding, irritation, or swelling.
Know that they also sometimes remove more than the mole, leaving pits in your skin and causing scarring.One product, DermaTend, gained popularity as a method of treating moles. It contains extract of a plant called Sanguinaria Canadensi and is said to work by killing the mole at the root and causing it to fall out. The company's claims were not evaluated by the FDA,and in 2014 it was recalled because the FDA worried that use of this product would prevent people from seeking dermatological care and thus could delay diagnosis of skin cancer., Currently, there are three methods you can talk about with your doctor:Excision with stitches: In this process the mole is removed and the area is closed with one or more stitches. Some scarring is a possibility, but this method can be used if a mole is suspicious so that surrounding tissue can also be excised.Shave excision: In this process the mole is cut off at the level of the surrounding skin. Scarring is less common, but this method is not preferred if a mole is suspicious, because surrounding skin (which may contain cancer cells) will remain untouched. Shaving works best on moles that are raised, because moles that are flat have to be ""scooped"" out of the surrounding tissue, which inevitably leaves a scar.Cryosurgery: Cryosurgery is application of extreme cold to kill an unwanted tissue using liquid nitrogen. You will not need any stitches, and recovery time is generally faster than excision methods."

Consider using apple cider vinegar (ACV).,
Try garlic.,
Use baking soda.,
Consider using iodine.,
Apply aloe vera.,
Make an aspirin paste.",How to Remove a Mole at Home2," This is one of the most popular and well known home remedies for removal of moles. ACV is an acid and can cause skin irritation and burning, resulting in the loss of your mole.ACV is available at both pharmacy and grocery stores. You can also make some at home using sour apples.


Because ACV is a strong chemical, test a small area of skin elsewhere before applying it to the mole. If you do not experience any burning or irritation, proceed.
Put a small amount of ACV on a cotton ball. Place the cotton ball on the mole and bandage it securely in place with a bandage, micropore tape, or duct tape.
Repeat this process twice a day with fresh cotton balls for at least 7 days or till the mole falls off. By the end of the week, the mole should have gone.

, Garlic is one of the best known natural remedies with many uses. Its acidic properties are thought to make it an effective mole remover. Peel two garlic cloves, and crush to make a paste. Add a pinch of rock salt to the paste; the salt absorbs moisture from the mole, decreasing its water content and thus makes it dry and shrivel faster.
Apply the paste to the mole thrice a day for 5 days. Be careful; it may sting the surrounding normal skin. Cover the area with a cloth, cotton or bandage whenever you have applied the paste. Wash well with a regular soap every few hours. If the mole persists, continue until it falls off.

, To make a baking soda paste, combine 1 tablespoon of baking soda with 4 tablespoons of water. Mix well until it becomes a paste; if you need to thicken it, add more baking soda. Apply to the affected area and leave it there for an hour, then wash it off with soap and water. Repeat the process twice a day for 4 days.Baking soda when mixed with water to make a paste gives off a very caustic solution. The combination releases free hydrogen ions which are thought to react when applied onto the skin and tissue of the mole and dehydrate it.
You can also mix one pinch baking soda in a teaspoon of vitamin E oil and apply it to the mole. Leave the mixture on the mole overnight. The mixture is thought to eventually fade the mole away. If you have sensitive skin you can use Vitamin E oil without baking soda as well.

, While iodine may not be available over the counter in a pharmacy in its concentrated form, it can be obtained in a diluted mixture in many stores.


Further dilute your store bought iodine with 5 parts of water. Using a cotton ball or a cotton swab, apply it gently on the mole. Keep it on for 3 to 4 minutes and then wash it off with warm water.
Be careful not to touch the surrounding region of healthy skin with the iodine. Keep the iodine off your clothing with gauze as needed, as iodine has strong staining properties.

, Aloe vera helps in making the mole soft and more mobile. Prolonged usage of aloe vera is thought to result in complete disappearance of the mole with no scars. Proponents of this method claim that aloe vera slowly does away with the old hardened tissue and replaces it with newer softer tissue and cells.


Using a fresh aloe vera plant, procure the thick leaves and then squeeze the juicy gummy, clear transparent jelly it stores. This juice is often consumed by people for other conditions as well, but for moles it is to be applied directly on the mole without any other adulteration or dilution.
The jelly/gum can be kept over the mole all day as it gets absorbed into the skin and you can wash it if you wish. Apply it at least 3 times a day for best results. Continue application till the mole falls off.
Although aloe vera has been used topically by various cultures for centuries, there is no scientific data about its long-term safety, so use at your own risk., Aspirin is a blood thinning agent and is thought to work by diluting the blood supply to the mole enough for it dry out and deaden. People who have missing blood coagulant factors or are hemophilic should not use this option.


Take 3 aspirin tablets and crush them in a bowl. Add two teaspoons of water and make a paste.
Using a cotton ball or swab, apply the paste gently to the mole. Leave it there with a bandage for a day. Monitor the progress every day in terms of the size, shape and color. Within 1-2 weeks, it should make the mole fall off by itself.
Those who use blood thinners or anti-coagulants should not use this method without consulting their doctor."
"
Experiment with pomegranate juice.,
Try honey.,
Use castor oil.,
Try ice.,
Try horsehair.",How to Remove a Mole at Home3," Pomegranate naturally contains bleaching properties, which can inhibit melanin production and potentially decreasing the appearance of a mole.Apply fresh pomegranate juice to the mole using a cotton ball or a cotton swab. Let it stay for 15 minutes and then wash it off vigorously with warm water and soap.
Try pomegranate extract instead, which can be ordered online or from a health food store.

, Like aloe vera, honey is thought to soften moles decrease the keratinized (hardened) tissue. It also makes the mole more flexible and mobile if it has a stalk or root.


Honey can be applied on the face of the mole using a cotton swab. Plain honey — undiluted — acts best. Occasionally, neem leaves or turmeric powder may be mixed with it for better results.

, Similarly to aloe vera and honey, this method is thought to soften the mole, reducing its appearance over time.


Castor oil can be applied using a cotton ball or even massaged in a circular motion around and on the mole using your fingers.
Avoid using castor oil if you are prone to acne, as it may aggravate the acne.

, Application of an ice cube directly on the mole or while covered with a cloth decreases the blood supply to the mole, essentially deadening the tissue. This is owing to the contraction caused in the small blood vessels that supply it by the cold temperature of the ice cube applied locally and focused on one area.


Doing this as often as every 4 hours for 5 days is thought to cause a visible decline in the size of the mole.
If it doesn’t respond within 3 days, do not continue with this line of treatment.

, A long strand of hair from the tail of a horse is one of the better known ""natural"" cures for moles that protrude quite a bit from the skin, as well as skin tags. Horsehair is very thin but strong and when tied around the mole can completely cut off the blood supply, forcing the mole to fall off.The hair must be wrapped around the stalk or the base as tightly and firmly as possible. This will ensure cessation of the blood flow and by the next 72 to 96 hours the mole will fall off.
The thread must not be removed even during a bath.

Be aware if you are at risk of developing water warts.,
Take steps to prevent the spread of water warts.",How to Treat Embarrassing Water Warts," Betadine is an effective iodine-based antiseptic that helps to fight off the water wart virus and eliminate the warts. Betadine scrubs are available over-the-counter in most pharmacies.


To use the scrub, wet your hands with a little warm water then rub the Betaine onto the infected skin. Do this for five minutes everyday until the warts disappear. This treatment is not recommended for people allergic to betadine or iodine.
Alternatively, you can apply a pure iodine solution directly onto the warts, using a cotton pad. It's recommended that you prick each wart with a sterilized needle first, as this will help the iodine to penetrate the skin.;
, Apple cider vinegar is an effective home remedy for drying out and removing wards. The acid in the vinegar attacks the wart, causing it to peel away from the healthy surrounding skin, taking the virus with it.


To use apple cider vinegar, soak a cotton ball in the vinegar and place it on the wart. Cover the area with an adhesive bandage for 24 hours. When you remove the bandage the wart should be gone, though you may have a scab in its place (which should disappear in a couple of days).
Apple cider vinegar can be used on all types of warts except those which are caused by sexually transmitted disease, such as genital warts.

, A proteolytic enzyme ( i.e. an enzyme that breaks down protein) found in the milkweed plant can digest and dissolve water warts. Find a milkweed cream in a drugstore or online and apply it to the water warts at least four times a day.

, Salicylic acid is an over-the-counter wart medicine used for treating mild skin conditions. Salicylic acid works by softening the keratin (a protein that forms the structure of the skin), in the warts and the surrounding skin. Once the warts have softened, use a pumice stone or an emery board to remove them., Certain astringent chemicals (found in OTC and prescription skin creams) can be applied to the warts to dry them out, causing them to shrink. Some of the most effective ingredients to look out for include potassium hydrochloride and cantharidin.

, Applying a retinoid cream daily can help to remove water warts, as it disrupts the warts' skin cell growth. Retinoid creams can be purchased OTC or you can get a prescription for a stronger creams from your doctor.

, Silver nitrate ointment works by destroying the very thin layers of the water wart’s tissue. Apply silver nitrate ointment daily until the water wart is completely gone.

, Just like milkweed cream, banana contains a proteolytic enzyme that digests and dissolves water warts. Use a fork to mash up a ripe banana and apply the banana mash to the infected skin at least twice a day. Over time, the warts should begin to disappear.

, The citric acid in lemon juice contains high quantities of vitamin C, which is believed to kill the virus causing the warts. Apply freshly squeezed lemon juice to the water warts at least three times a day, until they are gone.

, Garlic contains a substance called allicin that has antiviral properties that kill a broad spectrum of viruses including molluscum contagiosum virus, which causes the warts.


Crush the garlic in a garlic crusher and apply it directly onto the water warts. Hold it in place with a bandage or a piece of tape for 24 hours. Remember to change the garlic and tape daily.

, With cryosurgery, liquid nitrogen is used to freeze and destroy the water warts. After the treatment, a blister may form at the site of the wart, but this should fall of within 2 to 4 weeks.


Be aware that cryosurgery can be a little painful — the application of liquid nitrogen may cause burning or stinging at the treated site, which may persist for a few minutes after the treatment.
It's also important to be aware that scarring or loss of color at the site of the wart is a possible complication of this treatment.

, Electro desiccation  is a medical treatment for water warts that uses a probe to send electrical currents into the wart. The electricity causes the blood vessels inside the wart to die off, causing the wart to disappear., Pulse dye laser therapy is a fast and effective treatment option for people who suffer from multiple water warts. The laser uses heat energy to destroy the wart and the red blood cells that feed it.The skin surrounding the wart may take up to two weeks to heal, but there should be no scarring on discoloration.
The pulsed dye laser is fast and efficient, but its expense makes it less cost effective than other options.

, Sometimes, your doctor will suggest a treatment that involves an injection of mumps, candida or trichophyton antigens at the site of the wart. These antigens stimulate your body's immune system to create antibodies that will fight the infection caused by the water wart virus.

, Water warts appear as pink colored, dome-shaped lumps, which can appear anywhere on the body. The warts tend to grow in clusters, leading to pear or dome shaped clumps.


The most characteristic feature of water warts is that they have a visible hole or point right in the center. The medical term for this is ""central umbilication"".
Water warts should not feel painful, but the virus may trigger an immune response, causing the wart and the surrounding skin to feel itchy.

, The water wart virus is contagious, meaning it can easily be transmitted from one person to another.


The water wart virus can be transmitted through fomites (inanimate objects capable of carrying infectious organisms) such as towels, bedsheets, doorknobs, clothing, etc. The virus may also be transmitted through sexual contact.
The water wart virus can also spread from one part of your body through the other, via auto-inocculation. This happens when you scratch or touch an existing wart, and then touch other parts of your body, causing multiple lesions.

, This common viral disease has a higher incidence in:



Children: Children are particularly susceptible to auto-inoculation, and may have widespread clusters of lesions. The water wart virus spreads most easily through direct skin-to-skin contact, but kids can get it by touching objects that have the virus on them, such as toys, clothing, towels, and bedding. It can also spread in water, so kids often get water warts from swimming in a public pool.Sexually active adults. Water wart infections are often transmitted through sexual intercourse and affect the genitals, buttocks, lower abdomen and inner thighs. In rare cases, infections are also found on the lips, mouth and eyelids.

People with immune deficiencies: People whose immune systems have been weakened by HIV, cancer treatment, or long-term steroid use are more vulnerable to infection by the water wart virus.

, Since water warts are contagious and can spread to other body parts, an infected person should follow a number of precautions to prevent the water warts from spreading or being transmitted to another person:


Try to cover each growth with clothing or a watertight bandage, especially before participating in activities in which equipment is shared or skin contact can occur, like swimming and wrestling.
Keep the areas with growths clean and change each bandage daily or when it becomes dirty.
Do not scratch or rub water wart growths, and regularly wash your hands with antibacterial soap.
Do not shave over areas that have bumps, as the razor could easily spread the virus from one part of the body to the other.

"
Consider how common warts are, and know that you are not alone with this problem.,
Be aware that warts are most common in children and young adults, which can help in diagnosing them.,
Understand that for anyone with warts, it is easier to treat fewer, smaller warts.,
Use salicylic acid, at home or with the help of a healthcare provider if you would like additional guidance.Prior to treatment with salicylic acid, use a nail file or a pumice stone to remove the outer layer of your wart(s), so that the dead skin cells (the callous part) is removed.You will know when you are done because the skin underneath the callous part is much more sensitive and it will hurt to continue scraping any further.,
Try duct tape — another effective remedy that can be used at home.,
Try exposing the wart(s) to high temperatures (this is called ""hyperthermia"").,
Use garlic cloves.,
Try tea tree oil.,
Ask your doctor to try cryotherapy (also called liquid nitrogen).,
Try having your wart removed via shave excision.,
Ask your doctor about other medical treatments.",How to Treat Warts on Your Feet," The plantar wart gets its name from being on the planter surface (the sole) of your foot.


The human papillomavirus (HPV) is the virus that creates warts, and it invades your body in the superficial layer of your skin, thus causing a thickened growth that resembles a callous.It is more likely to occur in skin that has been broken open or is wet, but can occur in healthy dry skin as well.
Warts may take up to six months to appear on the sole of the foot after exposure to the virus, so it can be difficult to trace back to the precipitating event.;
, (However, it is possible for them to occur in people of any age.)


They are also more common in people whose immune systems are compromised for other reasons, such as people with chronic skin conditions such as eczema, or people with organ transplants or HIV/AIDS., Some people try a ""wait and see"" approach to see if their warts will resolve on their own, but if you notice no improvement within a few weeks, or spreading or growth of the warts, your best bet is to seek treatment sooner rather than later.,
Soak the affected foot (or feet, if you have warts on both sides) in warm water for 10–20 minutes prior to treatment. This softens the skin and enhances the effectiveness of treatment. Make sure your foot is completely dry after soaking to that the salicylic acid patch you will apply stays on as well as possible.
Apply salicylic acid patch to the affected area of your foot. The best time to do this treatment is just before bedtime each night. Leave it on overnight, and remove it in the morning. Continue this treatment every night until the wart(s) is/are gone, and one to two weeks longer after they have disappeared to ensure that the HPV virus has been totally eradicated.
Note that for people with ""neuropathy"" (medical conditions that relate to damage to their nerves), it is not advisable to use salicylic acid. This is because the decreased sensation for people with these conditions may result in the salicylic acid causing damage to their skin without them being able to notice it.

, It is not fully understood why duct tape works as a treatment for plantar warts, but a number of scientific studies have shown that it has good success in a great number of people, so it is definitely worth a try. The silver duct tape available at most home improvement stores is better than the clear type, for the reason that it tends to stick better to the soles of the feet. Place it on the sole of your feet (a piece large enough to fully cover any and all warts), and leave it on for six days. If it falls off before then, replace it with a new piece of duct tape sooner rather than later as the goal is to keep the warts covered for a full six days. Then remove it for one day to let the area breathe. After removing it, soak your foot for 10–20 minutes in warm water to soften the skin, and use a nail file or pumice stone to scrape away dead skin on the surface. Note that people who do find success with the duct tape strategy tend to show improvement by the two week mark, and often complete resolution by the four week mark of using this treatment. If you do not find this is the case for you, it is best to move on and try other options. Be aware that if you have any of the following medical conditions — diabetes, poor circulation to your extremities (hands and feet, called ""peripheral artery disease"" by doctors), nerve problems (called ""neuropathy""), or any chronic skin conditions — it is not advisable to use duct tape as a treatment, as it may irritate your skin as a result of having these conditions. , This entails exposing the affected area of your foot/feet to water of approximately 113 °F (45 °C), for 30–45 minutes two to three times per week. , When applied to the site of the wart(s) and rubbed over them every night (followed by covering the area with a bandage or duct tape), this has been shown to be successful for some people.


Garlic has antiviral properties, which likely explains the utility of this form of treatment.
If you do not notice any improvement after two to three weeks, move on to trying another form of treatment.

, This has also been shown to have antimicrobial properties and, when applied nightly to the area of your wart(s) and covered afterwards with a bandage, this is another easy ""home option"" for treatment.


Again, if you do not notice any improvement after two to three weeks, move on to trying another form of treatment.

, This is where a very cold liquid is applied to the skin that destroys plantar warts by freezing them.Most often you will have to return to see your family doctor several times to receive multiple liquid nitrogen treatments, before the wart (or warts) completely goes away. Your doctor can provide a schedule of how frequently she would like to see you. After the wart disappears, it is most often recommended to use salicylic acid as a follow-up to treatment for one to two weeks to ensure that the wart does not return. Due to some pain that accompanies treatment with liquid nitrogen, it is not recommended for young children. However, older children and adults tend to have no problem with it. Know that there is the possibility with this treatment (for people with darker skin) to have some depigmentation (lightening of the skin) in the area of treatment. If this is a cosmetic concern for you, speak to your doctor who may recommend alternative modes of treatment for your wart(s).
If you notice any depigmentation that bothers you after the first liquid nitrogen treatment, you may choose not to continue. The damage from a single treatment will likely be very minimal (if at all), but it could be permanent so it is best to opt out if this bothers you.

, This is a procedure done by your doctor, if liquid nitrogen alone is unsuccessful.


If your doctor deems that this procedure is what you need, he or she will first inject some local anesthetic (freezing agent) into your skin in the area around the warts. This freezing ensures that the procedure can be done without causing you undue pain.
After the freezing is complete, the doctor will use a small scalpel to excise, or remove, the wart(s) from your skin. Your doctor will likely recommend follow-up treatment of some sort to give the maximum chance that the wart(s) will not return.

, These include Cantharidin, 5-Fluorouracil, Imiquimod, and other forms of ""immunotherapy."" These tend to be used later down the line, but are certainly options you and your doctor can talk more about together.


Your doctor may also consider an injection into the wart itself. This is a procedure done by your doctor for cases that are unsuccessful with other modes of treatment.
Finally, your doctor may try laser treatments (or phototherapy). This is another option available to patients whose warts persist despite trying other simpler treatments. "

Try apple cider vinegar.,
Crush garlic and use it as a mask.,
Try using lemon juice.,
Attach duct tape to the wart.,
Apply a banana peel.,
Look into using betadine.,
Apply milkweed cream.",How to Remove Facial Warts1," Apple cider vinegar can be used on all types of warts. The acid in the vinegar attacks the wart area, causing it to peel away from the healthy surrounding skin, taking the virus with it. It is safe to use on the face and other parts of the body. Dilute it up to 50% with water.In fact, the malic and lactic acids found in the vinegar can help to soften and exfoliate the skin.
These ingredients are commonly used to treat acne on the face.
To apply apple cider vinegar, soak a cotton ball in vinegar (about half-soaked) and place it on the facial wart. Then, cover the area with an adhesive bandage for 24 hours.;
, Garlic’s caustic effect will cause the facial wart to blister and fall off in about one week. The substance allicin in garlic has an antiviral effect that kills a broad spectrum of viruses, including human papilloma virus.Crush the garlic and apply it to the facial warts.
Hold it in place with tape for 24 hours.
Change the garlic and tape daily.

, Lemons are an everyday item with a variety of cleansing properties. The citric acid in lemons contains vitamin C, thought to kill the virus that causes warts. This may also help to soften the wart, making it easier to remove.Apply to the facial warts at least three times per day.

, Although this remedy is not medically verified, some people claim that it works fast. Duct tape supposedly works because of how the body reacts to substances that are contained in it. The use of the duct tape will irritate your skin, which can cause the formation of antibodies that will help get rid of the virus causing your facial warts. This must be done for periods of six days, up to a maximum of two months.


Cover your facial warts with duct tape when you sleep, and then remove it right away when you wake up in the morning.
Repeat this procedure as necessary until the wart is removed.

, Banana mash contains a proteolytic enzyme (an enzyme that breaks down protein) that digests and dissolves the facial wart. This can be an easy and soothing way to remove facial warts. Use surgical tape to adhere the inner part of a banana peel to the wart overnight.The suggested treatment is one to two weeks.
Other foods, such as pineapple, papaya and sauerkraut also contain this enzyme.

, Betadine is an antiseptic that helps fight the virus causing the facial warts. Betadine surgical scrub can be gently rubbed on the infected area for five minutes daily until the lesions resolve. Similar products exist in stores, for example: Bactrine or Bazuka. You can apply it twice daily.This treatment is not recommended for those allergic to iodine or betadine.
Consult a doctor if your skin becomes irritated.

, Milkweed cream can be found at your local health care store or apothecary. An enzyme found in the milkweed plant digests and dissolves the wart. These products are made from the sticky sap of the milkweed plant. These plants have also been shown to be a possible anti-acne treatment.Apply to the facial warts at least four times per day.
The secretion made by the plant when broken can also be applied directly to the wart.

File away the excess skin.",How to Remove Warts Naturally Using Garlic1," Garlic is a great home remedy for the common wart. Fresh garlic works the best, but you can also use garlic juice. Rub garlic into a small portion of your skin first to see if your skin is sensitive to the garlic. Some people can get a rash from fresh garlic. The rash is not dangerous, but it can be irritating.


If this happens to you, you can still use the remedy, but the rash may persist. If you do, only leave the crushed garlic on for an hour at a time. It may also take longer to get rid of the wart.
A study where children's warts were treated with garlic found that 100% of the warts were cleared with no significant side effects other than complaints of the smell and once instance of mild skin irritation. Another study used a lipid, or fat, extract of garlic on both warts and corns. They studied 42 patients of various ages and found 100% recovery in all the patients with the warts.
It is believed that the main anti-viral component of garlic, a substance known as allicin, is the chemical which is working on warts, but little research to substantiate this claim has been done.;
, Before you apply the garlic, you need to sanitize and dry the area of your skin with the wart. Wash your hands and then wash the area with the wart. Use warm soap and water. Dry the area with a cotton towel.


Wash any cloth material that came into contact with the wart in hot, soapy water. You can also bleach the towels to make sure you kill off any wart virus., Take one clove of garlic and crush it with the flat part of a knife. You can also cut a clove of garlic in half. Rub the area with the crushed garlic or cut edge of the clove to let the juice sink in., Place the crushed garlic directly onto the wart. Cover the garlic and the wart with a bandage or, if you prefer, a piece of duct tape. Avoid placing the garlic on unaffected skin.


Make sure you don't have any open cuts or wounds in the area. The garlic can burn and the wart virus may spread to the area. , The treatment does not work overnight. You need to repeat the process daily. Rewash and dry the wound. Apply fresh crushed or cut garlic to your wart. Cover the wart with the fresh garlic and always wrap the wound in a fresh bandage.


You can also use duct tape to wrap the wound. This helps it stay dry. However, this can irritate other areas of your skin. Repeat the garlic remedy daily for at least 3-4 weeks.
Most people begin to see the wart getting smaller within 6-7 days. It may look pruney and wrinkled after removing the bandage and washing away the garlic. It will also look paler than before.
If you don’t see any improvement, see your physician to see if something else is going on.

, You can use an emery board to help file away the skin of a wart. Hold the area with the wart over the sink. Dampen the wart. Use the rougher side of the board and gently rub the top and sides of the wart. Next, turn the emery board over to the smoother side of the board. Repeat the same path as you did with the rough side. Rinse off the area, wash it, and re-apply the crushed garlic.



Do not rub hard enough to draw blood. Also be careful not to touch any unaffected skin with the emery board.
If you are dealing with a plantar wart, keep your foot over the bathtub or over a small plastic tub.
Make sure and wash away any of the infected skin you have rubbed off. Wash everything in the sink or into the tub. You don't want to get re-infected.
Throw away the used emery board."

Gather your supplies.,
Soak your wart.,
Exfoliate your skin.",How to Remove a Wart Using Epsom Salts or Daffodils1," Using Epsom salts to remove your warts may be a safe and inexpensive home remedy. All you need is a tub, sink, or bowl to soak in and some Epsom salts. You can find Epsom salts at any drugstore or grocery store.Don't be afraid to buy a large container of Epsom salts. There are many things you can use the salts for around your house. For example, salt baths are a great way to ease muscle pain.;
, If your wart is on your foot or hand, you can just get a large bowl or bucket and fill it with warm but not hot water. Then add a small amount of Epsom salts to the water. The package should tell you the correct amount of salts to add depending on how much water you are using. For example, if you are filling a bathtub, you'll want to use 2 cups of Epsom salts. If you are just making a foot bath, try using a half cup of salts. Place the body part with the wart into the salt water and let it soak for 30 minutes.Make the water very warm but still comfortable. You do not want to use hot water.
If you like, you can fill your bathtub with Epsom salt water and soak your entire body. Epsom salt is great for easing aches and pains. It also soothes dry, itchy skin., Soaking a wart can help soften it, which will make it more receptive to other forms of treatment. Sometimes, however, it will need just a little extra encouragement to go away. If the wart is still there, you can gently exfoliate your skin to remove the remnants. Do this immediately after soaking, when your skin is the softest.Use an Emory board or pumice stone to gently scrub away the last of the wart. Make sure to wash or throw away any tool that you used to scrub away your wart, as they can spread the virus to other parts of your body.
Finish the wart removal by smoothing a non-irritating moisturizing lotion over your skin. You'll feel hydrated, smooth, and wart-free.
Since warts are caused by a virus, they may reappear after treatment. If your warts reappear, you can use this method as often as necessary to get rid of them. Most warts will naturally go away after a year or two."

Consult your doctor.Schedule an appointment with your physician to treat your HPV wart.,
Consider your options.,
Be aware that only a doctor should apply TCA.",How to Remove an HPV Wart Using TCA1," Think of your appointment as an information-sharing session. You should prepare relevant questions to ask your doctor and expect your doctor to have many questions for you.


Your doctor might want to know:

How long have you had HPV warts?
Do your HPV warts cause pain when touched?
Have you receive treatment for HPV warts before?


You might want to ask:

What is the best treatment plan?
How did I contract HPV warts?
Is there any danger in leaving HPV warts untreated?

;
, There are a wide variety of treatments available for treating HPV warts. You and your doctor should consider the size, shape, location, and quantity of warts before settling on a treatment.You should also consider the cost of treatment. TCA, podophyllin resin, and imiquimod treatments are more expensive than cryotherapy, surgical removal, and laser treatments. However, TCA is less expensive than interferon treatment. TCA typically costs $500-$1,000 depending on the extent and number of HPV warts.You can also discuss cryotherapy with your doctor. This is the process of freezing off the warts using liquid nitrogen or cryoprobe. It requires weekly or biweekly applications.Your doctor may also apply podophyllin resin in a 10 to 25% compound.There are also some medications that you can apply yourself including podofilox, imiquimod, or sinecatechins.HPV warts larger than 10 millimeters in diameter should be removed surgically.If you are pregnant, TCA is a safe option.HPV warts often abate on their own given enough time. If you are concerned about paying for or receiving treatment, consider waiting for a time to allow the warts to go away.

, TCA must be applied by a doctor.Do not attempt to apply it yourself or to have someone else apply it for you."
"
Clean the skin around the wart.,
Let the skin dry completely.,
Cover the wart with duct tape.,
Leave the tape on for six days.,
Remove the duct tape on the evening of the sixth day.,
Soak your wart in warm water for one minute.,
Lightly scrape the wart with an emery board, pumice stone, or other gentle abrasive.,
Leave the wart exposed the night of the sixth day, then re-apply duct tape in the morning.,
Repeat these steps until the wart is gone.",How to Remove a Wart With Duct Tape," This remedy requires you to cover the skin surrounding the wart for about a week at a time. Before proceeding, it's smart to clean the wart and the surrounding area to ensure that dirt or other detritus which can cause blemishes and pimples isn't trapped against the skin.

, Just as you shouldn't let any dirt get trapped between your skin and the duct tape, so shouldn't you let any moisture. Trapping moisture against your skin can irritate it or, in rare cases, lead to fungal infection. However, what's more likely is that moisture under the duct tape will simply cause the adhesive to weaken and the tape to fall off. You want your tape to grip your skin tightly, so be sure to dry your skin after washing.








, Cut a small square of ordinary grey duct tape - large enough to cover your wart completely, but not any larger. Carefully lay this duct tape over your wart. Press the tape onto your skin to ensure good adhesion.









Use regular grey duct tape. Clear duct tape has been found to be not as effective as the standard grey variety. In one study, for instance clear duct tape was not significantly more effective than a moleskin bandage.The speculation is that clear duct tape uses a different type of adhesive than grey duct tape and the difference accounts for the lack of effectiveness.

, DTOT takes time to work - it may, in some cases, take up to two months. For the first six days, keep the duct tape in place. If your duct tape falls off, replace it as soon as you can.









The exact mechanism by which DTOT eliminates warts is unknown. One popular hypothesis is that the rubber-based adhesive in grey duct tape irritates your skin, provoking a local immune response. Your immune system then unwittingly attacks the human papilloma virus (HPV) which causes the cell multiplication (or wart).

, After six full days of wearing your duct tape patch, remove it to check on your wart. If, at this point (or during any future check-up), your wart appears irritated or worse than it was before, stop using duct tape and make an appointment to see your doctor or dermatologist.








, Use a soft cloth to soak your wart with warm water, or immerse the affected area in a bowl, wash basin, or bathtub. Warm water softens your skin (and the wart) in preparation for the next step, in which you will debride it.








, By scraping the wart with a mild abrasive, you essentially ""file"" the dead wart tissue away, a process called ""debriding"" (removing dead material). Soaking your skin in warm water beforehand makes this process easier. If, at any point, you begin to feel pain, stop.









When you're done, soak your emery board, pumice stone, or other tool in a solution of bleach and water. Wart tissue that remains on your abrasive contains HPV and spread, creating new warts. It is, therefore, very important to sterilize your tools after every use.

, Give your skin a chance to dry out and rest on the sixth night. Take care, however, not to touch, rub, or scratch your wart, as warts can be spread through touch.In the morning, apply another piece of duct tape.









On the sixth night, examine your wart. Make note of any progress you've made. - Does your wart appear smaller? Is it less raised than before?

, Continue to perform these steps in a cycle, removing your duct tape every sixth evening, washing, debriding, and allowing your skin to rest, then applying duct tape the next morning. Over time, your wart should gradually recede. Don't stop your treatment until you're 100% sure the wart is gone. Be patient. This method can take a long time. - The original Focht, et al study lasted for about two months.









If your wart doesn't get better after two months or seems to get worse, see a doctor. You may have an especially hardy wart. - Luckily, there are other options for removal, including salicylic acid treatment and cryotherapy.

Exfoliate the wart with pumice.,
Apply salicylic acid to the wart.,
Try cryotherapy on the wart.,
Use wart creams instead.,
Cover the wart with duct tape.,
Use apple cider vinegar.,
Try some garlic extract on the wart.,
Consider using Thuja oil instead.,
Don't forget about tea tree oil.,

Ask about stronger prescription medication.,
Consider laser treatments instead.,
Talk to your doctor about surgery as a last resort.",How to Get Rid of Warts on Hands," A quick and cost-effective way to try and remove a hand wart is to exfoliate it with a pumice stone. Pumice is naturally abrasive and works well to sand away the surface layer of the wart, especially if its covered by a thick callousAlthough pumice stone is effective at removing surface layers, it can't get to the deeper ""roots"" of the wart below the skin's surface. As such, a pumice stone should be used in conjunction with some sort of ointment to destroy the deeper parts of the hand wart.


Before exfoliating your wart with pumice, soak your hand in warm water for about 15 minutes to soften the skin up.
Be cautious when using pumice on smaller warts not covered by a callous. It may cause an abrasion / cut and draw blood. For smaller, more fleshy hand warts, consider using a small emery board to exfoliate it.
People with diabetes or peripheral neuropathy should not exfoliate warts on their hands or feet with pumice because their reduced nerve sensations may lead to tissue damage.;
, Another way of removing successive layers of a wart is by applying salicylic acid to it. Salicylic acid dissolves the keratin (protein) of the surface of warts and any calloused skin covering them.However, it can also damage or irritate healthy skin surrounding warts, so be careful when you apply the liquid, gel, ointment or patch — up to twice daily. Before applying salicylic acid, soak the surrounding skin and file down the surface layers of the wart with pumice or an emery board (as mentioned above) so the medication can penetrate deeper. Cover with a bandage overnight for best results. It can take many weeks to get rid of a large hand wart using salicylic acid, so be patient,


Salicylic acid is an over-the-counter (OTC) wart medication widely available in most pharmacies. Some products also contain dichloroacetic or trichloroacetic acids, which help to burn the wart away.
For most hand warts, a 17% salicylic acid solution or a patch at 15% strength will be effective.Remember that some hand warts disappear due to your body's immune system and don't need treatment, so playing the ""wait and see"" game for a few weeks is often a good idea.

, Cryotherapy (cold therapy) involves freezing warts off. It's a common procedure for warts used by family doctors and dermatologists, but there are some effective OTC products that contain liquid nitrogen (Compound W Freeze Off, Dr. Scholl's Freeze Away) that you can use at home.Applying liquid nitrogen to a wart causes a blister to form initially, then the blister and wart fall off together after about a week. Multiple treatments are needed so the wart doesn't grow back. To make liquid nitrogen treatment more effective, file down the wart with pumice or an emery board before application.


Cryotherapy can be a little bit painful, but usually it's tolerable. If the pain is severe, stop applying it and see your doctor.
Liquid nitrogen can scar healthy light-colored skin or cause dark spots on dark-colored skin, so be careful when applying it.
Ice and frozen gel packs are forms of cryotherapy used for musculoskeletal injuries, but don't use these methods for warts. It's not effective and it may lead to frost bite.

, There are many OTC creams that can help get rid of warts, and they are usually less painful than cryotherapy. They work by destroying the structure of the wart on a chemical level, ultimately breaking it down into nothing. These creams often contain dichloroacetic acid, trichloroacetic acid, 5‐fluorouracil, zinc oxide, or some type of low-dose retinoid (vitamin A derivative).Apply by rubbing the cream or ointment onto your hand wart and let it absorb for 5 minutes or so before eventually washing your hands.


Use wart pads, instead. Wart pads work like wart creams do. You can apply the medication on the pad by rubbing it onto the wart directly, or you can place a small piece of wart pad over the wart and hold it in place for an hour or so using medical tape or an adhesive bandage.
Retinoids are typically used to help slow down the effects of aging, but they can also be used to strip dead skin cells off your face, preventing anything from getting into your pores. This includes warts.

, There are many reports (and some research) claiming that applying regular duct tape to warts is an effective treatment, although how it works is not entirely understood.In a 2002 study, 85% of people using duct tape were cured of their warts within a month, which happened to be more effective than using cryotherapy.So try covering your hand wart with regular duct tape, then remove it and pumice or file away the dead tissue and see if it grows back. You may need to repeat the process a couple of times, but it's worth a try given it's low cost and lack of side effects.


Clean your skin with rubbing alcohol first and then securely attach a small strip of duct over your hand wart. Leave it on for 24 hours before replacing it with a fresh piece — repeat this cycle in 1 week increments for up to 6 weeks if needed.
Some people people claim that other nonporous tape, such as electrical tape, works as well on warts but no research confirms this yet.
Other unusual items that some people place over their warts to get rid of them include banana peels and potato skin.

, Apple cider vinegar is an old home remedy used to to remove all sorts of skin blemished, including warts. The vinegar contains citric acid and also a high percentage of acetic acid, which is an antiviral (it kills HPV and some other viruses).However, citric and acetic acids can also irritate healthy skin, so be careful when applying it to your hand wart. Try soaking a cotton ball or Q-tip in vinegar and then applying it directly on top of the wart, then cover it with a bandage overnight. After about a week of daily treatment, the wart should turn darker and then fall off. New skin will soon grow in its place.


Apple cider vinegar may cause mild burning or swelling in the skin around the hand wart initially, but it usually goes away quickly.
Another potential downside to using apple cider vinegar is that it smells bad to most people.
White vinegar consists of acetic acid also, but it doesn't seem to have the impact on warts that apple cider vinegar does.

, Garlic is another old home remedy that's used for many conditions. It contains a compound called allicin, which is a strong antimicrobial that can kill a variety of microorganisms, including HPV.In a 2005 study, an extract of garlic was discovered to completely cure warts after a few weeks and there was no reappearance many months later.Raw, crushed garlic or store-bought extracts can be applied directly onto your hand wart a few times daily for 1-2 weeks. Once you apply it, cover it with a bandage for a few hours until you decide to reapply more. For best results, apply the garlic just before bedtime so the allicin can absorb deep into the wart.


Like the application of apple cider vinegar, using garlic on warts may cause mild burning or swelling in the skin around your hand wart, but it usually fades away. And obviously, it also has a strong odor.
As a less-effective alternative, you can take capsules of refined garlic orally (by mouth), which attacks HPV from your bloodstream.

, Thuja oil is made from leaves and roots of Western Red Cedars. It's an old Ayurvedic remedy popular for many conditions because it's a strong antiviral — it contains compounds that stimulate your immune system to destroy viruses such as HPV.(it kills HPV). As such, its a good option for warts of all types. Apply Thuja oil directly onto your hand wart and allow it to absorb for about 5 minutes, then cover with a bandage. Repeat twice daily for up to 2 weeks. Thuja oil tends to be very potent and can easily irritate the surrounding skin, so be careful when applying it to your hand wart.


To reduce the risk of skin irritation, try diluting the Thuja oil with some mineral or cod liver oil before applying it.
Thuja oil is typically recommended for really stubborn warts that are resistant to other forms of treatments — kind of a last resort herbal remedy.
Thuja is also available as homeopathic tablets, which are taken under the tongue a few times per day. The tablets are small and tasteless and have only trace amounts of Thuja extract, but they can be effective and have no known side effects.

, Tea tree oil is an extract of melaleuca alternifolia, an Australian tree. It can be helpful for warts and other skin blemishes because its a strong antimicrobial and antiviral that can destroy HPV. However, tea tree oil doesn't seem to penetrate warts quite as well as apple cider vinegar, garlic extract or Thuja oil.However, tea tree oil also boosts your immune system if taken internally, which can be helpful in preventing HPV re-infection. Start with 2-3 drops of tea tree oil extract on your hand wart, 2x per day for at least 3-4 weeks and see if it helps. To make it more effective, file down the fleshy part of the hand wart with pumice or an emery board.


Tea tree oil has been used for a few hundred years in Australia and New Zealand, but its only become popular in North America during the last decade or so.
Tea tree oil can irritate and trigger allergic skin reactions in some sensitive people, but it's very rare.

, If your hand wart doesn't go away naturally or after trying the above-mentioned home remedies, then make an appointment with your family doctor — especially if the wart is painful or located in a very inconvenient spot. Your doctor will examine your hand and make sure it's just a wart and not some other kind of skin condition. Skin problems that can mimic warts include: corns, calluses, moles, ingrown hairs, pimples, boils, seborrheic keratosis, lichen planus and squamous cell carcinoma.To make sure it's not something serious, such as skin cancer, your doctor can take a tissue sample (biopsy) of it and examine it under a microscope.


If it's not a wart on your hand, your family doctor will likely refer you to a skin specialist (dermatologist) for treatment.
If it is a regular wart, you doctor will likely use a form of cryotherapy (stronger than the OTC products). The doctor may have to numb the your hand before applying the liquid nitrogen.
Cryotherapy, when done by your doctor, should leave no skin scars. Healthy skin grows and fills in the hole left by the destroyed wart.

, If you or your doctor are not keen on cryotherapy, then ask about prescription topical medications — they're usually just stronger varieties of OTC creams and ointments. For example, prescription salicylic acid solution is 27.5% concentrated or higher (compared to 17% or less in OTC varieties), which makes it more effective, but also more dangerous to handle. Another common topical prescription medication applied to warts (especially plantar warts on feet) is cantharidin, a compound made from blister beetles. Cantharidin is a strong blistering agent that burns warts off. It's often used in combination with salicylic acid.


Research confirms that salicylic acid is more effective when its combined with cryotherapy.Prescription salicylic acid products are sometimes given to patients to take home, but there's a much higher risk of skin irritation and scarring.
Cantharidin, on the other hand, is poisonous if swallowed and not typically given to patients for home use.

, Advancing technologies give doctors and dermatologists other means to get rid of skin blemishes such as warts. For example, pulsed-dye lasers can burn and destroy (or cauterize) the tiny blood vessels that surround and nourish warts, which cause them to die and flake off.Other types of more conventional lasers can burn the wart off directly within minutes, although a topical anesthetic is needed. The procedure is an outpatient one and there's usually only mild irritation to surrounding skin.


Pulsed-dye laser treatments have a 95% success rate against all types of warts and they very rarely ever return.
Keep in mind that laser therapy for warts and other skin conditions tends to be expensive, so check with your health insurance plan to see if you're covered. Warts on the hand are not considered a significant medical condition, so you may have to pay out of pocket for treatment.

, If home remedies and other medical treatments fail to get rid of your hand wart, then consult with your doctor about removing it surgically. Wart removal is considered minor surgery (outpatient) and involves cutting away the wart with a scalpel or destroying the tissue by using an electrical or ultrasonic device (called electrodesiccation and curettage).In essence, desiccation involves destroying the wart tissue and curettage involves scraping away the dead tissue with a metal tool called a curette. This procedure is painful, so a topical anesthetic is needed.


Surgical wart removal usually leaves a scar, so keep that in mind if you're a ""hand model.""
Following electrodesiccation, it's not unusual for warts to return within the scar tissue at a later time.
Cutting into the tissue around a deep wart sometimes causes it to spread to nearby areas, particularly in people who have weak immune systems.

Get topical medications prescribed.,
Investigate keratolysis.,
Request cryosurgery.,
Try pulsed dye laser therapy.,
Talk to your doctor about intralesional bleomycin sulfate therapy.,
Consider immunotherapy.",How to Remove Facial Warts2," There are some medicines used to lessen the symptoms of infection and remove facial warts. These treatments usually require several months for the infection to clear, and are often associated with intense inflammation and discomfort. These medications are:


Retinoid (Tretinoin) Cream. Daily topical application of this cream may trigger resolution.Retinoid cream disrupts the wart's skin cell growth. When applying Tretinoin cream to the facial warts, the following guidelines must be followed:

Apply once a day at bedtime.
First, wash the wart with soap and water and wait at least 15 to minutes for it to dry. Then apply a pearl-sized portion to the facial wart. If applied on moist skin, it can cause peeling and irritation.
Tretinoin cream can cause sensitivity to sunlight because it makes the skin soft and thin. Remember to wear sunscreen when going outside.


Cantharidin or other topical agents containing trichloroacetic acid. Cantharidin contains an extract from a blister beetle. When it is applied to the skin, a blister will form around the wart. The blister will then lift the wart off your skin and the dermatologist can remove the dead portion of the wart.Cover the affected area with a clean bandage afterwards.
Follow all instructions given by your doctor when using this.


5-Fluorouracil. This cream will stop the replication of DNA and RNA, which should stop wart growth.Apply the cream twice a day for three to five weeks.Protect the area from the sun, as this can worsen irritation., Keratolysis involves the abrasive removal of dead skin from the surface of the skin. This works through a combination of chemical treatment (usually, the use of salicylic acid), which softens and kills the cells of the virus, and manual exfoliation. When the wart becomes soft from the chemical treatment, and then a pumice stone or an emery board is used to remove it., Liquid nitrogen is used to freeze and destroy warts,which are then scraped off with a curette. Cryosurgery is a good way to treat stubborn warts that have resisted all noninvasive treatments. Talk to your doctor if you wish to seek this treatment, though there are over-the-counter versions of this treatment.


With liquid nitrogen, a blister may form at the treatment site, but it will slough off in two to four weeks.
It should be noted that cryosurgery and curette scraping are not painless procedures and the application of liquid nitrogen may cause burning or stinging at the treated site that may persist for a few minutes after the treatment.
Scarring or loss of color can complicate this treatment.

, Laser therapy uses heat energy to destroy the wart and the red blood cells that feed it. The therapy is usually well tolerated, and does not leave scars or pigment anomalies. The pulsed dye laser is fast and efficient, but its cost makes it less accessible than other options. This treatment has an 80% or greater efficacy when used on warts.The lesions usually resolve without scarring at about two weeks.
This treatment is used for a variety of skin problems.

, If you have severe facial warts, you may wish to try this highly effective procedure.The doctor will inject your wart(s) with intralesional bleomycin, which is a drug usually used to treat cancer. A single injection may be enough to remove the wart, or you may need to follow up for more injections every three to four weeks.This therapy causes little or no scarring and may cause slight pigmentation that usually fades within a year of treatment.This treatment may be very expensive, but it has a very high success rate (92% in one study)and is more effective than cryosurgery., For warts that have not responded to other treatments, immunotherapy is another option. Your doctor will try to rally your immune system to attack the wart, either by applying a chemical (such as diphencyprone) to the wart or injecting it with a molecule (usually Candida antigen).The hope is that these will cause a reaction from your immune system, which will attack both the injected substance and the wart, eliminating it naturally.It may also help decrease the reoccurrence of warts, since your body will learn to defend against HPV virus."

Ignore the warts and let them heal themselves.,
Do not pick your warts and maintain proper hand hygiene.,
Never brush, comb or even shave areas where there are warts.",How to Remove Facial Warts3," If you can, just ignore the warts because they can sometimes go away on their own. You can cover the warts with bandages or even be stylish by using a scarf or a bandanna to cover facial warts. Study shows that most warts will resolve themselves after two years.However, if the warts really bother you, by all means try the treatment options discussed above.
If the warts persist for years, or if you find they begin to spread, seek medical attention.

, Stop touching the warts and leave them alone. Practice the universal precaution of good hand hygiene so that you don’t transmit the warts to others. Picking warts can worsen your problem.


Keep your hands dry and clean because warts thrive on moist areas.
Make it a habit to wash your hands before and after applying topical solutions on your warts.
Isolate your clothes and towels. Make sure that others don't use these items of yours to prevent the transmission of warts. If possible, label them so that others will know that these are your items and will think twice about using them.

, This can easily spread the virus to other areas. Remember, warts are highly contagious. Even a slight brush of the affected part can infect you or others. This can also harbor warts and spread them to other people. You may want to let your facial hair grow if you can, to avoid shaving the area. Facial scrubs and abrasives may contribute to this as well.

"
Use onions.,
Soak the wart in vinegar.,
Use a dandelion.,
Apply banana peel.,
Try fresh basil.",How to Remove Warts Naturally Using Garlic2," Like garlic, you can use onions to help remove warts. Take 1/8th of a medium sized onion and crush it. Place the onion directly on to the wart and cover with a bandage or, if you prefer, a piece of duct tape. Repeat, applying fresh onion every day, covering the wart with a fresh covering.


As with the garlic method, use a disposable emery board to file away the excess skin of the wart between applications., Vinegar is an acid, diluted acetic acid, and is thought to break down cell membranes. Then the acidic environment kills the virus. Soak a cotton ball in white vinegar and apply to the wart. Attach the cotton ball to the wart using duct tape. You can leave it on for 2 hours up to 2 days. Repeat as necessary.


Between applications, use a disposable emery board to file away the skin. , Dandelion sap contains a number of ingredients that help with warts, including anti-viral substances. These substances likely kill off the virus-infected cells. Pick a dandelion or two off your lawn. Break the stem and squeeze the dandelion sap onto the wart. Cover the wart with a bandage or duct tape. Leave it on for 24 hours. Repeat as necessary.


Use a disposable emery board to file away the wart between treatments., Banana peels contain a number of substances, including various enzymes that may break down the cell membrane. Place the banana peel with the inner part of the peel on the wart. Cover the peel with a bandage or duct tape and leave it on overnight. Repeat as necessary.


In addition, banana peels contain carotenoids, which are the substances from which Vitamin A can be synthesized. Vitamin A has anti-viral effects.
Between applications, use a disposable emery board to file away the wart., Basil has a number of anti-viral substances and that is believed to help basil kill off the wart virus. Cut a fresh basil leaf and ball it up. Place it over the wart. Cover the basil with a bandage or duct tape and leave it on for 24 hours. Repeat as necessary.Between applications, use a disposable emery board to file away the skin.

Prepare your skin.,
Use Salicylic acid.,
Try to freeze the wart.,
Try the duct tape method.",How to Remove Warts Naturally Using Garlic3," Regardless of the remedy you are using, always wash and dry your hands before and after touching a wart. You should limit the area of normal skin treated by any of the over-the-counter methods. These methods generally work within a few days. If your wart is not smaller or has not changed in appearance after 6-7 days, check with your healthcare professional. You may need another, stronger approach.

, Salicylic acid acts by breaking up and killing the cells infected by HPV. Instead of attacking normal cells as well, the acid leaves the normal cells alone. Buy Salicylic acid, such as Compound W or Dr. Scholl's Clear Away, at your local drugstore as a patch or a liquid. Wash the area well and dry it. Apply the patch or liquid as directed. Repeat daily until the wart is gone. This can take 2-3 months.Avoid getting the medicine on any other portion of your skin.
To help the acid work better, soak and file down your wart so the medicine can soak deeper into your skin.
You can get a stronger concentration of Salicylic acid by prescription., Over-the-counter freezing medicines use dimethyl ether and propane to freeze the skin of the wart. The medicine essentially freezes the wart and kills the skin, causing it to fall off. Freezing medicines, such as Compound W's Freeze Off or Dr. Scholl's Freeze Away, can be purchased at your local drugstore. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions. They can take up to 2 months to work. Keep the medicine away from any open flame. The FDA warns that these medicines may be flammable.A recent study has suggested that the freezing method may be more effective in getting rid of warts within 2 months., The duct tape method, also known as tape occlusion, is a tried and true home remedy that many people swear by. It is not known how the duct tape works. Some say that the adhesive has a substance that breaks down the skin cells and are then pulled off by the physical action of tape removal. For this method, buy silver duct tape and apply a small piece of the duct tape to the wart. Leave the tape on the wart for 6-7 days. Remove the tape and soak the wart in water. Use a disposable emery board to “file away” the wart.


Leave the wart uncovered overnight or up to 24 hours. Reapply the duct tape for 6-7 days. Repeat the process as often as necessary for up to 2 months.
You can apply onion or garlic juice on the wart before putting on the duct tape.
In one study, duct tape actually worked better that freezing the warts off."

Understand transmission of HPV.,
Know the symptoms.,
Distinguish the kinds of warts.",How to Remove Warts Naturally Using Garlic4," A wart is a skin growth caused by Human Papilloma Virus (HPV). The warts can appear anywhere on your body. However, they only infect the top layer of skin. Common warts mostly tend to be found on the hands and plantar warts are found on the soles of the feet., The HPV virus can be easily passed from one person to another. You can also re-infect yourself by touching your wart and then touching another part of your body. Warts can also be spread by sharing towels, razors, or any other personal items that come into contact with the wart.


Some people seem more likely to get warts than others. You are at higher risk for warts if you have a suppressed or less effective immune system., Warts are generally an elevated bump on the skin with a roughened surface, though some warts are flatter and smoother. They can come in many different shapes and sizes. Warts tend to be painless, though some plantar warts that can make walking difficult. Warts on the fingers can also be uncomfortable because they are used and irritated more frequently.


Generally, warts can be diagnosed by a physician without a skin sample based on where they are and what they look like.

, Common warts can be spread to the genitals or the rectal area, but common warts are usually caused by a different type of HPV than genital warts. The common wart is not associated with a higher risk of cancer, while many genital warts are.


Make sure you see your healthcare professional to make sure you are dealing with a common wart.
If you have warts around your genitals or around your anus, you should see your physician to determine what specific form of virus is causing the warts."

Minimize the pain.,
Stay aware of potential complications.,
Monitor your wart’s condition.,
Return to your doctor’s office for follow-up treatments.",How to Remove an HPV Wart Using TCA2," It is normal to feel pain, heat, and discomfort as the TCA does its job. Your doctor may cover the HPV wart in a light film of lubricating jelly to minimize the pain. The amount needed will vary with the size of the affected area. Your doctor may also neutralize the TCA if the pain is intense. TCA is acidic and can cause serious tissue damage if it is misused.


If you feel intense pain when the TCA is applied, tell your doctor. Your doctor can try to neutralize the acid, such as by powdering the area with sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) or talc., If you continue to feel pain for more than thirty minutes after the TCA treatment, wash the area vigorously with soapy water and contact your physician. Some patients experience a change in the color of the skin on or around the area where TCA was applied. If you notice the area where you applied TCA becomes crusty or starts oozing, contact your physician immediately., Look for signs of improvement. There is no cure for HPV or the attendant warts it causes. Treatment may remove your warts forever, but you may also see new warts in or around the same area as the ones you treated. You might also see new warts in areas which have never had warts. While clearance rates hover around 75%, there is also, unfortunately, a recurrence rate of 36%., Each week, return to the doctor for an application of TCA. A treatment schedule usually lasts for six to ten weeks.While most sources advise that you should pursue other avenues if the warts are not gone within six weeks, some recommend continued application of TCA until the warts have been eliminated.Talk to your physician if you have concerns about the efficacy of TCA in treating your warts.


If you are fair-skinned, chances that you will be more sensitive to the TCA treatment, and your treatment schedule should be extended one or two weeks."

Examine your genital area and your anus for small pink or red growths.,
Note if the warts are itchy or irritated.,
Be aware that you can have genital warts and experience no symptoms.,
Get examined for genital warts by your doctor.,
Allow your doctor to perform a test for HPV.,
Discuss your treatment options with your doctor.",How to Recognize Genital Warts," Genital warts will appear as small pink or red growths or bumps on your sex organs and possibly your anus. You may see or feel genital warts on your vagina, your vulva, your cervix, your anus, your penis, or your urethra. Though rare, you can also develop genital warts on your mouth, lips, tongue, or in your throat.The warts may look similar to the tops of a cauliflower, and they may be tiny or difficult to see. Look for warts in clusters of three or four that appear to be growing and spreading on your body.;
, Though genital warts are not usually painful, they may cause irritation, itching, mild discomfort, and sometimes bleeding due to aggressive scratching.Keep in mind genital warts can develop six weeks to six months after you have been infected, or longer. You may not notice the warts until several weeks after you have had contact with an infected person, when they are fully developed and the symptoms become apparent.

, Some people who contract this STI do not display any symptoms and may not be aware they are carrying the disease. This is why it is important to get tested regularly for STIs to ensure you are not unknowingly spreading genital warts.Other infections and conditions can mistakenly be identified as genital warts, such as hemorrhoids, syphilis, pearly penile papules, and skin tags. As well, certain skin cancers can appear as genital warts. The only way to confirm you have genital warts is to get tested by your doctor or healthcare provider.

, Your doctor will look closely at the growths on your body to confirm you have genital warts, particularly any growths on your genital area and your rectum.For women, your doctor may perform a complete pelvic exam to check your cervix for genital warts.
Your doctor may also take a sample of fluid to test for other STIs, like gonorrhea and chlamydia, as well as a blood sample to test for syphilis and HIV.

, HPV is a group of more than 60 viruses, some of which can cause genital warts. During your check up for genital warts, your doctor may suggest you also get tested for HPV. For women, this means getting a Pap smear to look for any changes in your cervix that could be symptoms of an HPV infection. It is possible that HPV can lead to cervical cancer in women, and it is very important that you get a yearly Pap smear to monitor any possible infections in your cervix; however, the types of HPV that cause genital warts do not cause cancer.People with anogenital HPV are at increased risk for a number of anogenital cancers, so it is important to let your doctor know if you have or think you may have genital herpes so that proper screening can be done.There is no HPV test for men.

, If your doctor confirms you have genital warts, you should have a talk about possible treatments for the STI. One option is to allow your body to fight off the virus and let the warts go away on their own. You should keep the area as dry as possible and wear cotton underwear to allow the warts to clear up.If the warts are uncomfortable you can remove them with various genital warts treatments. Keep in mind the warts may still return after treatment, as the treatment cannot cure the virus that causes the warts.
Refrain from sexual intercourse when you have an active outbreak of warts from HPV, as that is when the virus is most transmissible.
Your doctor may prescribe medicated creams or ointment that can be applied directly to the genital warts to prevent them from spreading and to help them heal. You can also ask your doctor about injecting a medication called interferon into the warts to remove them.
You can also remove the genital warts by using cryotherapy to freeze them or electrocauterization to burn them off. Your doctor should explain these procedures and discuss any risks or side effects.
In general though, all treatments for HPV genital warts are fairly ineffective, with 30–70% of people treated having recurrence within six months."

Run cool water over the blister.,
Apply honey to the blister.,
Cover the blister with a bandage.,
Refrain from using common at-home burn remedies.,
Avoid popping the blister.",How to Treat a Blister Burn1," The first thing you can do to treat a blister burn is to run cool or lukewarm water over the affected area. You can also use a cool bath or press a towel soaked in cool water on the burn. Keep the affected area in the cool water for 10 to 15 minutes.Make sure you are using cool water and not cold or ice water.;
, You can cover the blister burn with a thin layer of honey. Honey has antibiotic and antiseptic properties and has been shown to improve the healing of burns. Gently apply a thin layer over the affected area.Local wild honey is good choice. Another good choice are the medicinal honeys, such as Manuka honey.

, If you have a blister from a burn, it is recommended that you cover the affected area with a sterile bandage if possible. Leave enough room for blister formation. Make a tent in the bandage or cloth over the burn. This helps prevent the blister from breaking or becoming irritated or infected.


If it isn’t possible to use a bandage or gauze, use a clean towel or cloth instead.

, Many people believe that you should use all sorts of household items as burn remedies. People think you should put butter, egg whites, oil sprays, or ice on burns. Don’t put these substances on a blister burn. They can lead to infection or tissue damage.Instead, either use a burn cream or ointment, honey, or skip any type of ointment completely.

, You should not break open the blister that forms from a burn, at least for the first three to four days. To aid in keeping the blister in tact, keep it covered. To remove the bandage without breaking the blister, you may have to soak the bandage in warm water.


Change the bandage daily, applying either the antibiotic ointment or the honey every time.
If the burn blister becomes too painful or has become infected, you can take steps to carefully break the blister. Always wash your hands first, and then clean the area around the blister with alcohol or an iodine solution to kill off any bacteria on the skin. Pierce the skin of the blister at its base, near the bottom of the blister, with a needle that has been sterilized by swabbing it with alcohol. Let the fluid drain out. Use a cotton ball to soak up the fluid or pus. Leave the overlying skin as intact as possible.

Hold it in the water for 10-15 minutes. You can also wrap it in a towel soaked with cool tap water for the same amount of time, or submerge the body part in a container of water if you don't have access to a running tap.This can minimize pain, decrease swelling, and prevent tissue damage.Avoid placing your finger under cold or warm water or in ice. This can make the burning and blistering worse.Cool water cleans the burn, reduces swelling and promotes quicker healing with less scarring;
, Cold can help reduce swelling. While you are cooling off your finger with water or a damp towel, take off rings or other tight items around your fingers. Do this as quickly and gently as possible before the area swells. This may minimize the discomfort of removing them when dry. It also allows you to better treat the burned and blistered finger., You may immediately notice small blisters that are no bigger than a fingernail. Leave these intact to prevent bacteria growth and infection. If the blisters break open, gently clean them with mild soap and water. Then apply and antibiotic ointment and nonstick gauze bandage.Get prompt medical attention if the blister is large. Your doctor may need to break it to minimize the risk of it breaking on its own or developing an infection.

, In some cases, burns with blisters may require immediate medical attention. If you have any of the following symptoms, go to your nearest emergency room or urgi-care center:Bad blistering
Intense or no pain
Burn covers your entire finger or fingers

, Use a mild soap and water to gently clean the affected finger.Rub the area gently, being careful to not break any blisters. This can minimize the risk of infection.Treat each finger with a blistering burn separately.

, A burn develops for an additional 24-48 hours after contact. Things such as patting it with a towel can make your pain and discomfort worse.Allow your finger to air dry before dressing it with ointments and bandages. This can draw heat from the burn, reduce the chances of bursting a blister, and minimize your pain., Before applying any ointments, let the burn cool. Placing a loose, sterile bandage over your blister allows the area to cool and can protect it from bacteria.Change the gauze if you have any oozing or broken blisters. Keeping the area clean and dry can also prevent infection.

, After 24-28 hours, put on a healing and protective ointment.Do this only if the blisters are still intact and the skin is unbroken.Spread a thin layer of any of the following over the top of the burned and blistered area:Antibiotic ointment
Unscented, alcohol-free moisturizers
Honey
Silver sulfadiazine cream
Aloe gel or cream

, An old wives’ tale suggests using butter on burns. However, butter retains heat and can cause infection.To prevent the burn retaining heat and protect the area from infection, avoid covering your burn with household treatments such as butter and substances like:Toothpaste
Oil
Cow dungBeeswax
Bear fat
Eggs
Lard

, Blistering burns can be very painful and swollen. Taking aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen sodium or acetaminophen may reduce your discomfort from pain and swelling. Follow contraindications and dosing instructions from your doctor or the product labelling., Keep your bandages as clean and dry. Change them at least once every day. If you notice any oozing or wetness, put on a new bandage. This can protect the blistered burn and prevent infection.Soak a dressing stuck to the burn or blister in clean, cool water or saline., Bumping into and touching things as well as putting friction and pressure on your finger can make a blister pop. This can disrupt the healing process and lead to infection. Use your other hand or fingers and avoid wearing anything tight against the area., Blistering burns can become infected, including with tetanus. If you haven’t had a booster tetanus shot in 10 years, ask your doctor to give you one. This may prevent you from developing tetanus because of the burn., Your burn may take some time to heal. In some cases, you could develop an infection, as burns can easily become infected. This could lead to bigger problems such as losing mobility in your finger.

Use over-the counter or prescription wart treatments.,
Apply a chemical called cantharidin to remove the warts.,
Try using a cream containing imiquimod.,
Find a wart removal cream that contains retinoids.,
Ask your doctor about immunotherapy using DCP.,
Get injections of anti-cancer medicines.",How to Remove Flat Warts1," These over-the-counter medications include salicylic acid ointments, glycolic acid, and tretinoin ointments. These medications work to peel away at the warts and reduce their size.


These ointments should be applied every morning to be effective. However, talk to your doctor before using these medications, as he or she may have a prescription medication that is more effective.;
, First wash the area with a disinfectant, such as povidone-iodine. Soak the affected area for 20 minutes and then let the area air dry. Use a towel or pumice stone to remove the dead skin.


Once this process has been finished, apply cantharidin ointment to combat the warts. Repeat this whole process twice a day until the warts go away.

, Imiquimod can be used on sensitive parts of your skin, including your face and genitals. Creams that contain this ingredient act by stimulating your immune system and helping your system to recognize the virus that causes the warts. Your immune system can then attack this virus more effectively., Retinoids are usually prescribed to treat acne, but can also be used to treat these kind of warts. The retinoids disrupt the cells inside the warts, causing them to slough off and shrink.

, This autoimmune method uses your immunity to fight the warts. This treatment involves putting chemicals in your body to initiate a reaction. Diphencyprone (DCP), which is a chemical, is applied to the warts, and causes a mild reaction in the surrounding area that helps to clear the area of the warts.Alternatively, try immunotherapy using interferon. Your doctor will give you an injection of interferon, which will stimulate your immune system, activating your body’s ability to fight the virus.

, These medications can help to shrink and get rid of the warts. They are designed to kill cancerous cells; when they are injected into the warts, they can kill off the cells that have formed the warts.One kind of medication that can be injected is bleomycin. Talk to your doctor about getting a prescription for these injections.

Keep your skin clean and dry.,
Avoid irritating the blister.,
Get medical attention if the blisters don't improve.",How to Treat an Infected Blister," Usually, you should leave an unpopped blister alone to prevent aggravating it and making the infection worse. But, if your blister is on a joint and places pressure on it, you may want to drain it.Draining the pus can relieve the pressure and reduce pain. Keep in mind that you'll need to monitor the blister and keep it bandaged and clean after you drain it.;
, To prevent the spread of infection, wash your hands and clean the blister. Wipe the area around the blister with rubbing alcohol or an iodine solution to kill off any bacteria on the skin.You should also disinfect a needle by swabbing it with the rubbing alcohol or iodine solution or holding it in a flame for about a minute.

, Take the disinfected needle and pierce the skin at the base of the blister. This should be near the bottom of the blister. Make several holes so that the fluid can drain out of the blister. Avoid applying a lot of pressure which could cause the blister to burst open.You might want to take a cotton ball or piece of gauze to dab or wipe up the fluid or pus that leaks out of the blister.
Wash the infected area out with either hydrogen peroxide, saline or soap and water. Do not use alcohol or iodine as they will irritate the wound.

, Once you've drained the blister, you may notice that the overlying skin of the blister looks saggy. Don't pick at this skin which could damage the blister and make the infection worse. Instead, leave the overlying skin as intact as possible. Apply an antibiotic ointment to the drained blister., Since the wound is technically open, you need to apply a bandage. You could also tape a gauze pad onto the blister. Change the bandage or gauze pad every day so the blister has a chance to heal.Always wash your hands before and after you change the dressing.
Remove the dressing daily before bathing, and allow the water to clean it out in the shower. Pat it dry after the shower and reapply the bandage

, Crush a single clove of garlic into a paste. You can also purchase garlic paste, but make sure there aren't a bunch of other ingredients added. Apply the garlic paste directly to the blister. You can also mix the garlic paste with a few drops of castor oil to make it easier to spread.


Garlic has natural antibiotic properties which can kill bacteria or viruses that could be infecting your blister., Apply a few drops of aloe vera gel directly onto the blister. If you're using gel directly from the plant, you may need to squeeze it out of the leaf and gently rub it over your blister. If you purchase aloe vera gel, choose a product that lists aloe vera as the first ingredient and doesn't contain other fillers.


Aloe contains natural anti-inflammatory and antibiotic substances that may help treat the infected blister while moisturizing the skin., Look for a pure tea tree oil and apply it directly to your blister. It may be easiest to drop the oil onto a cotton swab and gently dab it on your blister. You can also choose a blister ointment that contains tea tree oil and apply it to your blister.


Tea tree oil has antibacterial, antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties. More research is needed to determine how effective tea tree oil is against bacterial, fungal and viral infections., Take ¼ teaspoon of thyme or oregano and stir in about a ½ teaspoon of hot water. Let the thyme and oregano leaves soak in the hot water until they swell up. Let the mixture cool apply the thyme or oregano leaves directly onto your blister. Both thyme and oregano are traditionally used to treat infections.If you can find mullein, yarrow or plantain outside, take a few leaves (or flowers from mullein) and crush them into a paste. Add a few drops of castor oil if you need to make the paste easier to spread. Apply the paste directly to the blister. These plants have antibiotic and anti-inflammatory properties., If your blister is infected, it will appear to be filled with a cloudy, yellowish or greenish fluid. The skin around the blister will look red and could be swollen or tender. If you have more than three or four infected, don't try to treat them at home. You may need medical attention.If you see reddish streaks along your skin starting at or around the blister or if you have persistent drainage, pain around the blister, or a fever, you might have a more serious infection (like lymphangitis).If this happens, make sure to call your physician for advice.

, Blisters can be caused by sweat that becomes trapped under your skin. If you exercise or sweat heavily, immediately bathe or rinse the sweat away. Using a mild soap is usually enough to prevent infection. Gently pat your skin dry.


Avoid breaking the skin of your blister. Never rub the blister when washing or drying., If the blister hasn't broken, try to keep it intact. Consider using moleskin, bandages, or petroleum jelly to prevent skin or shoes from rubbing against your blister which can irritate it further. If the blister is on your hand, wear gloves


Even moist skin can create friction and aggravate your blister. You may want to sprinkle aluminum chloride or talcum powder on the skin around your blister to keep the skin completely dry., If you have one or two blisters, you can probably treat them at home. But, if you have several large blisters and they appear all over your body, you should see your doctor right away. Contact your doctor if you have painful, inflamed, or recurring blisters.You may have a more serious health condition that needs different treatment like:


Pemphigus: a chronic skin disease

Switch your shoes frequently.,
Keep your feet dry.,
Keep debris out of your socks and shoes.,
Use a lubricant.,
Tape problem areas of your feet.,
Toughen your skin by building endurance.,
Be prepared when hiking.,
Take precautions when wearing dress shoes.,
Choose and wear athletic shoes carefully.",How to Prevent Foot Blisters," Your shoes should be neither too tight nor too loose.A properly-fitting shoe will leave a half-inch of space between your longest toe (which is not necessarily your largest toe) and the tip of the shoe.Walk around in the shoes before buying them to ensure fit and comfort.
A square or rounded ""toe box"" (the area of the shoe in which your toes go) will provide the best fit and greatest comfort.
Try on shoes before you buy them, even if you know your size. This is because sizing may vary widely from brand to brand. Purchase shoes that fit well, even if the size is different from what you are used to wearing.
Feet may swell up to eight percent in the course of the day, so shop for shoes in the afternoon, as that is the time of day when your feet will be enlarged.By choosing shoes that will fit comfortably even when your feet are at their largest, you will help to prevent blisters at all times.;
, Shoes that squeeze your foot, ones that are too loose, or ones that cause you to walk abnormally subject your foot to pressure and friction that may result in blisters. Try to avoid wearing these types of shoes, which include:High heeled shoes, especially those with narrow toe boxes. These can force the toes into a cramped position, put intense pressure on the ball of the foot, and increase friction on the heel and elsewhere.
Flip-flops, which put pressure on the toes as they squeeze to keep the shoes from falling off.
Any overly tight style of shoe.

, Before wearing new shoes for prolonged periods of time, wear them for just short sessions.For instance, before wearing a new pair of shoes all day long, wear them for just a couple of hours at home. This process, known as breaking in your shoes, gives them time to gradually conform to your exact foot shape so that they will fit most comfortably.


It is especially important that shoes which will be worn for athletic or intensive purposes, such as hiking boots, are properly broken in before they are used normally.

, Cotton socks can absorb moisture; this can help control foot odor, but friction caused by the damp cloth also increases the risk of blisters. Instead, choose socks made of quick-drying synthetic fabrics or wool.Padded sports and hiking socks can be found at athletics and footwear stores. These can help prevent blisters.
Some people prefer to wear two layers of socks to combat moisture and friction: a thin “wicking” sock and a thicker sock over that.

, At footwear stores and many pharmacies, you will be able to find a variety of insoles that can be inserted in your shoe to provide more support, comfort, and a better overall fit.


Make sure to purchase shoes with removable insoles so that you can replace them with more comfortable and/or supportive insoles as required.Replacement insoles may be made of neoprene (foam rubber), memory foam, gel-filled pads, and other materials.Evidence shows that neoprene insoles in particular can reduce the incidence of blisters.Insoles, especially orthopedic ones, may be available in various shapes designed to conform to different foot types. Try out different insoles until you find ones that fits your shoe and foot comfortably.

, For instance, don’t wear the same pair several days in a row; instead, alternate them with another pair or two. By wearing different shoes, you will help to prevent blisters by ensuring that your feet aren’t always being rubbed in the same places., Choose shoes made of material that is watertight but also breathable.This will keep moisture out, but also allow sweat to evaporate from your feet.


Plastic and nylon shoes make it hard for your feet to ventilate. Choose footwear made of leather, canvas, mesh and other breathable materials.
If your shoes or socks become wet, remove them as soon as possible. Let them dry before wearing them again. Dry your feet and put on fresh, dry socks and shoes.

, When foreign material like sand and twigs gets into your socks and/or shoes, it can increase friction as you walk and thus cause blisters.Properly-fitting footwear will help keep debris out.


If you feel anything in your socks or shoes that shouldn’t be there, stop and remove it immediately.

, If you are prone to getting blisters in a certain spot on your feet, coat that area with a lubricant before putting on your socks and shoes. Good options include:


Petroleum jelly.Talcum powder (baby powder)A foot balm such as Badger foot balmAn anti-chafing ointment such as Bodyglide, By placing a small amount of adhesive material over areas of your feet that are prone to friction (known as “taping”), you can protect them and help prevent blisters from forming.Moleskin, available at pharmacies, is preferable to duct tape (which can lose its stickiness when it becomes wet).


Cut a piece of moleskin slightly larger than the area susceptible to friction.
Remove the backing from the moleskin to expose its adhesive surface.
Press the moleskin to your foot, smoothing out any wrinkles from the center to edge.
Put on your socks and footwear.

, If you increase the distance you walk, run, or hike by small amounts over time, the skin of your feet will become tougher. This can help to prevent blisters from forming., Hiking can put extra strain on the feet, because it may involve traveling long distances on foot in less-than comfortable footwear. You can help prevent foot blisters when hiking by following the steps above. In particular:


Make sure your hiking boots are properly broken in and conform well to your feet.
Wear two layers of socks. A thin sock made of a synthetic material will help to reduce friction. Wearing another sock made of a non-cotton, absorbent material such as wool will help to wick away moisture and keep your foot dry.
Lubricate any part of your foot prone to blisters. In addition, keep a supply of lubricant with you in case you feel any blisters beginning to form during your hike.
Apply moleskin patches to any high-friction areas. Carry a supply of moleskin with you in case you need extra protection along the way.

, Dress shoes can be uncomfortable if they are made of stiff material, if they force your feet into unusual positions, or if they are not worn very often or broken in properly. You can take some preventative measures, however:


Apply moleskin patches to any high-friction areas.
Lubricate any part of your foot prone to blisters.
Use replacement insoles for more support and comfort.

, Athletic shoes are work in high-intensity situations that can cause a lot of friction and sweating. To prevent blisters in these situations, make sure to:


Choose athletic shoes that fit your feet very comfortably.
Make sure you properly break your athletic shoes in by wearing them for only for short sessions until they conform to the shape of your feet. Only use them for full sessions after they are properly broken in.
Apply moleskin patches to any high-friction areas.
Lubricate any part of your foot prone to blisters.
Wear non-cotton socks to reduce friction between your foot and shoe.

Wash the open blister with soap and warm water.,
Leave the overlying skin in place whenever possible.,
Apply an antibiotic ointment.,
Apply a clean bandage over the area.,
Trim the dead skin once the blister is no longer tender.",How to Treat Open Blisters1," As soon as the blister pops, tears, or opens, wash it well. Use warm water and soap.Any dirt in the blister should wash away with the soap. If something is lodged in your skin, visit your doctor to have it thoroughly cleaned and treated.;
, If the skin over the blister tears off partially or completely, that’s okay. However, don’t try to pull off the overlying skin.Leave as much skin intact as possible.Don’t pick at the edges of the exposed skin., You can use a plain ointment like petroleum jelly to keep the blister hydrated and comfortable, but using an antibiotic ointment can also help prevent infection. Apply a large enough dab of ointment to cover the whole raw area of the open blister.If you prefer a natural alternative, use calendula cream., Apply an adhesive bandage over the blister or, if the blister covers a large area, a sterile gauze pad held in place with medical tape. Change the bandage every day, or if it gets dirty. Apply more ointment every time you change the bandage.You can also use a hydrocolloid dressing, which may provide more relief than a sterile bandage. You can get these from most pharmacies., Continue to change your dressing daily until the blister stops being tender. Then trim the dried, dead skin.Use small nail scissors or nail clippers that have been sterilized by rubbing them with alcohol, boiling them for several minutes, or holding them over an open flame for about one minute.

Do not pull the dead skin, as this can cause further injury to the tender area. Clip the skin carefully.

Wash the blister and surrounding area.,
Drain it.,
Do not remove the flap of skin.,
Apply an ointment.,
Bandage the area.",How to Treat a Blister2," Wash the blister(and your hands) with warm, soapy water., You may prefer to drain large painful blisters instead of letting them pop on their own. Draining your own blister is a sanitary way to help it heal faster and reduce the pain you might feel from the swollen area.Disinfect a sewing needle by cleaning it with a cotton ball dipped in rubbing alcohol.






Insert the needle into the side of the blister. You shouldn't feel pain when you puncture the blister, since the skin bubble doesn't contain nerves.






Press the blister. Fluid should begin flowing from the puncture hole. Drain the blister completely by pressing it with your finger. Use a cotton ball to wipe away the fluid.







, The deflated blister skin will protect the skin underneath from getting infected. There's no need to tear or cut it off.

, Use a cotton swab to apply polymyxin B or bacitracin antibiotic ointment to the area. This will prevent the wound from becoming infected and keep the bandage from sticking to your skin.Many people are allergic to antibiotic ointments. If the area becomes red and inflamed or itchy, discontinue use of the ointment.
If you're allergic to antibiotic ointment, you can use petroleum jelly to prevent the bandage from sticking to your skin. Make sure you use jelly from a new container; containers of jelly that have been used for other purposes might contain bacteria that can infect your wound.

, Use a Band-aid (plaster) or gauze to loosely bandage the area, so it still gets a little air flow. Make sure the tape doesn't touch the deflated blister.Change the bandage once a day, or every time it gets wet or dirty.
Check the area when you change the bandage. It should heal within a week or so. If it looks swollen, red, or begins leaking pus, seek medical attention.

Take over-the-counter medication.,
Apply burn cream.,
Go to the doctor.",How to Treat a Blister Burn2," Pain relievers can be helpful for blister burn pain. Even if you have run cool water over the burn and covered it, you may still feel pain or throbbing in the blister. Taking OTC pain meds can help reduce the pain. You may want to start taking them as soon as you get the blister burn instead of waiting for the blister to start hurting.Try ibuprofen (Advil or Motrin), naproxen sodium (Aleve), or acetaminophen (Tylenol). Make sure to follow the suggested manufacturer’s dosage guidelines., If you have a blister burn, you can use an antibiotic cream or moisturizing lotion on the burn to help prevent infection. Gently apply a thin layer of cream or lotion. If you are planning on covering the blister burn with gauze or a bandage, do not use a water-based cream.


Common burn creams include Bacitracin or Neosporin. You can also use an ointment like petroleum jelly.You may also try aloe vera lotion or gel., If the burn blister has become infected, it is strongly recommended that you see a physician. Infections of the skin can be deep and serious conditions. If the blister burn is filled with anything other than a clear fluid, there is a chance it is infected.


If you have a fever, have any streaks on the skin around the blister, or the blister is very reddened and swollen, see a physician immediately. These may be signs of an infection.
Any young child or elderly person should always be seen for any blister burns to minimize the risk of infections and scarring.

Identify the causes of blister burns.,
Determine if you have a first degree burn.,
Decide if you have a second degree burn.,
Seek medical attention for any third degree burns.,
Count the number of blisters.",How to Treat a Blister Burn3," Blister burns can occur anywhere on the body. The most common causes of blister burns, also known as second degree burns, are:Touching a hot object
Fires
Scalding from steam or hot liquids such as cooking oils
Electrical burns
Chemical burns

, Blisters occur whenever you burn your skin. The type of burn you have will depend on the severity of the burn. First degree burns affect the topmost layer of skin and appear reddish and swollen.First degree burns are painful but are considered minor. They do not usually produce blisters, but they may peel.
First degree burns are dry, and usually take three to five days to heal., Second degree burns are the next level of severity. They are considered minor as long as they are less than three inches wide in diameter. Second degree burns affect surface layer and the next few under layers of the skin. Blisters are often common with second degree burns.Second degree burns are painful and often form blisters and are red or pink. They may look swollen or have a pocket of clear, wet liquid.
If more severe, a second degree burn can be dry with a reduced level of feeling in the area. If you apply pressure, the skin will not turn white or turn white very slowly.Second degree burns usually heal within two to three weeks.
Blistering burns larger than three inches should be seen at an ER or by your physician as soon as possible. If a second degree burn is on the hands, feet, face, groin, a major joint, or the buttocks, see your physician or go to the ER right away. Older individuals and children should be seen at the ER for any second degree burn because complications are more common in these groups.

, The most severe burns are third degree burns. Third degree burns are considered a major burn because the skin layers are destroyed and should be seen immediately at an ER. These burns affect the deepest part of the skin and cause whitened or blackened skin.The burnt areas may be black or white. They also will be dry and leathery.These burns are often painless at first because the nerves in the skin have been damaged.

, A single or a few blisters are generally not a serious problem. Unless a singular blister is a severe second degree burn or third degree burn, you can treat it at home. However, if you are getting large numbers of blisters and they appear all over your body, see your physician right away.


Many blisters on your body can be a symptom of a serious health concern, such as pemphigus, bullous pemphigoid, and dermatitis herpetiformis.

Have the wart removed using cryotherapy.,
Remove the wart using electrocautery.,
Get laser treatment to remove the wart.,
Ask your doctor to surgically remove the wart.",How to Remove Flat Warts2," This procedure involves freezing the warts off of your body. To do this, your doctor will clean the affected area with a disinfectant like providane-iodine, and then your doctor will apply cryogen, which will freeze off the warts. The whole procedure should take 15 to 20 minutes.


You may feel a stinging sensation during this procedure. If you experience this, you may be given a local anesthesia. As the cryotherapy takes effect, the wart will become white and dry; your doctor will cover it with a band aid.
The bandage should be left on for five days, as new skin develops in the area. This procedure will be repeated once a week until the warts completely heal.

, This is where the warts are burnt off and removed. The procedure involves passing an electric current with high frequency through the warts. The wart is depleted using the heat that is emitted by the electric current.


The area of the skin containing the warts is usually cleaned thoroughly and then a local anesthesia is given. This medicine helps to numb the area and prevent the sensation of pain.
The doctor’s knife is heated by holding it in an electric current. The surgeon will then remove the wart using the knife. The procedure should take approximately half an hour.

, This is where a laser beam is used to burn the warts; it is usually suggested to people who have large warts that form in a cluster. You will be given a local anesthesia to numb the area. The laser beam uses two methods to clear the warts:


The laser can target the hemoglobin that is usually found inside the cells therefore killing the wart.
The laser can be carbon dioxide that is highly concentrated and vaporized and these targets the cells inside the warts.

, This is where the doctor uses a surgical procedure to remove the warts; this can be done with local anesthesia, or with general anesthesia (when you are put to sleep while the procedure occurs). This procedure is generally recommended for people who have warts that are spread throughout their entire bodies.The area is cleaned with an antiseptic like povidone-iodine and then the warts are cut off using a sterile blade, or scraped off using a curette. The area is then stitched up, depending on how big the wart was, or it can be covered with a bandage and left to heel.
This procedure usually results in scarring of the area as new tissue takes the place of the warts.

Apply a slice of raw potato to the wart.,
Cover the wart with a paste of water and baking soda.,
Use aloe gel on the wart.,
Consider using the milk sap found in a dandelion stem.",How to Remove Flat Warts3," Always wash the area using a disinfectant like povidone–betadine; soak the area for at least 20 minutes. The disinfectant helps to keep the area clean and free of infection because it has antiseptic properties. Petroleum jelly can then be applied to prevent irritation in the area.


You can also stroke the wart gently; this helps to remove dead skin.

, Cut a potato into slices and apply one of the slices to the wart. To keep the potato from falling off, apply an adhesive bandage to the area and leave the potato against your skin overnight.Doing this may cause the wart to slough and fall off.

, This paste should be applied on the wart at least three times daily. The baking soda may cause the wart to dry up, slough off and then fall off completely.


Baking soda is thought to have anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties that may help to fight the viruses that usually cause warts.

, Aloe gel has anti-inflammatory and healing properties that are thought to be able to rejuvenate the skin and allow the healing process to begin.Apply the gel twice a day to help dry out the wart and cause it to slough and fall off.

, Rub this milk sap on to the area twice a day. This may help to dry out the wart and kill of cells, thus making the wart fall off.You may be able to buy this milk sap at a natural foods store.

See your healthcare provider if you notice signs that you’ve gotten an infection – you may need antibiotics. Look for:Pus (thick yellow, green, or white fluid in or near the blister)
Redness and swelling in the area
Increasing pain or heat in the area

, If you have blisters that keep coming back or are painful enough to interfere with your daily life, see your doctor. Get your blisters checked if they appear in unusual places like on your eyelid or inside your mouth – they may indicate another medical issue, and may need special treatment., Blisters that are caused by severe burns should be treated by a medical professional. If your blisters are due to an allergic reaction, visit your doctor as well. You can get treatment and discuss taking preventative measures to prevent recurrence., If putting pressure on your open blister makes it hurt, you can apply a layer of moleskin over your bandaged blister.Use a large enough piece to fully cover the blister.

Do not apply the moleskin right on your open blister. It’s important to keep it covered with ointment and a bandage to keep it clean.

, This bandage acts like regular skin, and can provide quick relief for an open blister. You can get a product like Second Skin through a sports medicine company like Medco or School Health Supply. Place a small square of the product over your whole blister. You can then cover it with moleskin for added comfort, or a piece of medical or elastic tape., Apply 1-2 drops of tea tree oil to your open blister four times daily, then cover it again with a fresh bandage.

Wear shoes that fit you well.,
Keep your feet dry.,
Apply moleskin to tender areas.,
Stop the action that caused the blister.,
Wear gloves when using your hands.",How to Treat Open Blisters3," Blisters commonly form on feet, often due to poorly-fitting shoes. Shoes that are either too big or too small for your feet can apply pressure and friction to areas of your skin and cause blisters.Buy shoes in the middle of the day, when your feet have swollen a little bit but not as much as at the end of the day.
Ask a salesperson to help you determine your proper shoe size.

, Blisters often form when your skin stays in contact with moisture. Avoid foot blisters by keeping your feet dry. Wear moisture-wicking socks when you're going to sweat. Change your socks and shoes when they get wet.You can also dust the inside of your socks with talcum powder to absorb moisture.

, If you know an area of your skin is likely to rub on something - your shoe, a piece of sporting equipment, etc. - apply a layer of moleskin over the area. This can help prevent the friction that causes blisters. If you have a mild blister, it can also keep the area protected enough to prevent the blister from popping or tearing., If you already have a blister, stop doing whatever caused it. Wear a different pair of shoes, for instance. Avoid doing the activity that irritated your skin - continuing to do so could make your blister worse or cause it to pop. You can resume the activity when your blister heals., Hands are another common area for blisters. Protect your hands with gloves if you're playing a sport, gardening, using tools, or doing something repetitive with your hands. Your gloves should fit snugly but not be constricting.

Rowers often get hand blisters, and should use gloves or a soft wrap to protect their skin.

Be careful around heat and chemicals.",How to Make a Huge Blister Heal," The majority of blisters will heal naturally, without the need to be drained. This is because the unbroken skin covering the blister forms a protective shield which prevents infection. After a couple of days, the body will reabsorb the fluid inside the blister (known as serum) and the blister will disappear. This is the best option if the blister is not causing you any pain, as it minimizes the risk of infection.


If the blister is on your hand or somewhere it will not be exposed to further friction, you can leave it uncovered as the air will help it to heal. If it is on your foot, you may want to cover it with a gauze or moleskin pad, which will protect the blister but also allow it to breathe.
If the blister bursts on its own, allow the fluid to drain, clean the area well, then cover in a dry, sterile bandage until it heals. This will heal to prevent infection.;
, Although doctors recommend that you avoid bursting a blister if at all possible, in some scenarios it is necessary to drain a blister, especially if is causing a lot of pain or pressure. For instance, competitive runners may need to drain a large blister on the sole of their foot if they have a race coming up. If you need to drain a blister, it is very important that you follow the correct procedure in order to avoid infection.

, The first thing you need to do is clean the skin on and around the blister using warm water and soap. Any soap will do, but antibacterial soap is best. This will help to remove any sweat or dirt from the area before you proceed with the draining.

, Take a clean, sharp needle and sterilize it using one of the following methods: wipe it down with some rubbing alcohol; scald it with boiling water; hold it over an open flame until it glows orange.

, Use the sterilized needle to puncture the blister in several spots around the edges. Use a clean piece of gauze or tissue to gently compress the blister, allowing the fluid to drain. Do not remove the loose skin covering the blister, as this will help to protect it., Once all of the fluid has drained, dab a little antibacterial ointment or cream on the blister. Any over-the-counter antibacterial product will do, like Neosporin, Polymyxin B or Bacitracin. The ointment will help to kill any bacteria around the blister and fight off infection, while also preventing the bandage from sticking to the loose skin., After you have applied the ointment, cover the drained blister with some gauze padding or a gel-based plaster. These will prevent any dirt or bacteria from entering the open blister, and also provide some comfort when walking or running if the blister is on the foot. You should apply a new plaster every day, especially if the existing plaster becomes wet or dirty.

, After two or three days, remove the bandage and use a sterilized scissors to cut away any loose, dead skin. Don't attempt to peel away any skin that is still attached however. Clean the area again, apply more ointment and cover with a clean bandage. The blister should be completely healed within three to seven days.

, In some cases an infection will develop despite your best efforts to avoid one. If this is the case, you should see your doctor immediately. S/he may prescribe a strong topical antibiotic or an oral antibiotic to clear the infection. Signs of infection include skin redness and swelling around the blister, a build up of pus, red streaks on the skin and fever., Tea tree oil is a natural essential oil with effective antibacterial properties. It is also an astringent, which means it can help to dry out the blister. Use a q-tip to dab a little of the oil onto a drained or lanced blister once a day, before applying a fresh bandage., Apply cider vinegar is a traditional home remedy for many minor ailments, including blisters. It can be used to ward off infection, thanks to its antibacterial properties. Apple cider vinegar can sting a lot, so you may want to dilute it to half strength with water before using a q-tip to dab it on the blister.

, Aloe vera is a plant whose sap has soothing and healing properties. It is a natural anti-inflammatory and moisturizer, making it a great option for blisters caused by burns. To use, break off a leaf from the plant and rub the clear, gel-like sap over and around the blister. This is especially useful once the blister has popped, as it will speed up the healing process., Green tea has natural anti-inflammatory properties, so soaking the blistered skin in a bowl or basin of cooled green tea can help to soothe swollen or inflamed skin around the blister.

, It can be found in both oil and cream form at the drugstore. Simply smooth a little over the blistered skin each day to promote healing.

, Chamomile has soothing qualities and can help to ease the pain of a swollen blister. Make a strong cup of chamomile tea, allowing it to brew for five to six minutes. Once it has cooled slightly, dip a clean washcloth into the tea until soaked, then wring out the excess moisture. Press this warm compress against the blister for about ten minutes, or until the pain subsides., Epsom salts help to dry out an unpopped blister and encourage it to drain. Simply dissolve some Epsom salts in a hot bath and allow the blister to soak. Be careful though, once the blister has burst the Epsom salts will sting.

, Many blisters form due to the friction caused by ill-fitting shoes. As the shoes rub or slip against the foot, they pull-the skin back and forth, causing the outer layer of skin to separate from the inner layer, creating a pocket that becomes a blister. To prevent this from happening, invest in good-quality, breathable shoes which fit perfectly.


If you are a runner, think about going to a specialty running store where a professional can make sure you're wearing the best fit.

, Socks are very important when it comes to blister prevention, as they minimize moisture (which encourages the formation of blisters) and reduce friction. Choose nylon socks over cotton socks, as they provide more breathability. Wicking socks, which are a type of wool-blend socks, are another good option, as they draw moisture away from the feet.Runners can also find special athletic socks which provide extra cushioning in areas most prone to blisters.

, There are many products available over-the-counter which can be applied to feet before walking or running to reduce friction and the build-up of moisture. Try using a foot powder, which is sprinkled into the socks before wearing in order to keep the feet dry, or a cream which allows socks and shoes to glide over the skin, rather than causing friction., Blisters often develop on the hands as a result of manual labor, such as using tools or shovels, or gardening. You can avoid such blisters by wearing protective gloves while doing such activities.

, Blisters can easily form on sunburned skin. The best way to prevent this is to avoid getting sunburned in the first place, by wearing a sunscreen with a high SPF, wearing light, long-sleeved clothing, and wearing a sunscreen. If you do happen to get burned, you can ward off blisters with the liberal application of moisturizer, after-sun and calamine lotions.

, Blisters can form after being burned by hot water, steam, dry heat or chemicals, so you should make sure to take the proper safety precautions when handling hot objects, such as kettles or stoves, or using chemicals, such as bleach."

Apply moleskin to areas that normally chafe.Moleskin is a tough, two-layer tape with an adhesive pad on one side and cloth material on the other side.,
Keep your hands and feet dry.,
Keep your hands and feet well protected.,
Make sure your footwear fits properly.,
Wear high quality gloves.",How to Prevent a Blood Blister1," Moleskin is used to prevent and treat blood blisters if they have already formed. Apply a layer of moleskin to the area on your hands or feet that may chafe against tools or your shoes to prevent blood blisters from forming.


You may also apply additional layers of moleskin to the area if one isn't enough by taping one layer of moleskin to another.
If you need a thicker layer of protection, you may also tape the area or use a blister plaster to protect it.;
, The hands and feet are most commonly affected by blood blisters, since you're most likely to encounter friction in those areas. Keeping these areas dry is an important way to prevent blisters. Sweaty and moist skin will encourage the layers of your skin to separate, resulting in blood blisters.


If your hands tend to sweat while you work, try a sprinkling of baby powder or cornstarch to keep them dry.
Keep your feet dry by wearing breathable socks and shoes. You can also use foot powder or cornstarch to absorb extra moisture.

, During tasks or activities that have a higher likelihood of blood blisters forming, use appropriate layers of protections. Any task that involves friction between your skin and another object could put you at risk for developing a blood blister.For example, if you're using a rake or an ax to do yard work, wear gloves to prevent the wooden tool handles from damaging your skin.
If you're planning a long hike, wear socks that won't rub against your skin.

, Wear a breathable shoe that offers support and isn’t too constricting. Give your feet room to move in your shoe, but not too much room as that can cause unnecessary friction. Use gel insoles or liners to help you get a better fit in your shoes if needed.


Insure that your shoe is properly fitted to your foot by assessing its length, width, and adjustability.Avoid cotton socks, as they retain fluid. Synthetic socks work best with wicking away moisture from the skin., When you are working with your hands, wear gloves designed to wick away moisture and to prevent friction or pinching from occurring. Be mindful of wearing a sport- or task-specific glove. Wearing the right gloves for the task can help prevent blood blisters from forming.


Make sure there are no seams where you will be applying pressure or between areas of high friction, such as the curve between your thumb and forefingers."

Pop larger blood blisters.,
Wash the area.,
Use a sterile blade.,
Pierce the top of the blister.,
Leave the blister roof intact.,
Cover the area.,
Know when you shouldn’t pop a blood blister.",How to Pop a Blood Blister1," You should try to refrain from popping blood blisters if possible. However, if it gets too painful, you can pop larger blood blisters. If your blood blister is larger than a pea, or it is causing significant discomfort, pain, or interfering with walking or working, you can carefully pop the blood blister.You should know that this can significantly increase the risk of infection, so be very careful and follow the instructions as closely as possible. It really is best to have a physician do this with sterile instruments, but that is realistically not always possible.;
, Wash the area with the blood blister with an antibacterial soap. Also wash your hands well. Let the soap stay on your hands for at least one to two minutes. Rinse your hands and the area well.Use a clean towel to dry your hands and the blood blister.

, Preferably, you should use a sterile lancet or scalpel blade when you pop a blood blister. If you don’t have either, you can use a sterilized pin or needle. If you have alcohol, soak a pin or needle in the alcohol.Alternatively, soak the pin or needle in a solution of the antibacterial soap for 10 minutes.
You can also boil the pin or needle. Use tongs to take the pin or needle out of the boiling water and use it while it is still warm. You can also hold the tip of the needle directly into a flame for a minute. Make sure you let it cool before use.

, To pop the blister, lance or pierce the top of the blister. You will not need to penetrate deeply because you only have a thin layer of tissue to get through. You can press gently on the blister to help remove the fluid. Use a clean cloth or gauze to sponge up the blood. Apply pressure until any bleeding stops.This is not likely to be very painful because the nerves are usually found deeper in the skin and not on the top of the blister, but prepare yourself just in case.

, After popping the blood blister, make sure you do not remove the blister roof. The flap of skin covering the blister helps prevent infection. Leave it so it can protect the skin underneath., Apply an antiseptic such as betadine, iodine, or an antibiotic cream to the popped blister. Then cover the area with a clean gauze or bandage. Remember to make the bandage thick enough to protect the area from any rubbing or extra pressure.Remove the bandage at night so the blister can air out. This aids in healing.
Check for signs of infection every eight to 12 hours. These signs include redness, warmth, swelling, pain or whitish, yellowish, or greenish pus. Call your physician for advice if this happens.

, Certain conditions make draining a blood blister dangerous. If you have diabetes, HIV, cancer, or heart disease, or if you have a blood clotting problem or are taking blood thinner medications, you should never pop the blood blister yourself. It can lead to infection, which could be dangerous. Instead, go to your doctor and discuss what to do with him.You also should refrain from popping a blister if it arose because of a contagious disease. This can lead to you spreading the disease to others.

Prevent fungal skin infections.,
Prevent incidents that may cause skin abrasion.,
Be mindful of rough surfaces that may come in contact with your skin.,
Prevent your body from getting frostbite in cold weather.",How to Prevent a Blood Blister2," Some fungal skin infections, such as athlete's foot, may result in the formation of blood blisters on the feet (and less commonly, the hands or groin). To prevent fungal skin infections, it's important to keep your skin clean and dry. Wear a new change of clean, dry clothes every day.Change your socks often to keep your feet dry and clean if you perspire heavily. In public areas such as gyms, bathrooms, or swimming areas, wear flip-flops or stand on a clean, dry towel instead of walking around barefoot.
Avoid sharing jerseys and other clothing with other people.
If you have athlete's foot, wear sandals or open-toed shoes whenever possible to help your feet to stay dry. Don't allow the skin to get too dry, however, as very dry, cracked skin gives the fungus an easy entry into your body.

, Any time you scrape your skin, you risk getting a blood blister. If you're in a situation during which you could fall and scrape your elbows, knees, or other body parts, it's best to protect yourself by wearing proper clothing and padding.


For example, wear knee pads and elbow pads if you're going rollerblading or participating in another activity during which you could fall.
Prevent the likelihood of accidents in your home by clearing out hazardous items that may cause you to trip and fall.

, Too much grinding and rubbing up against rough surfaces increases the chances of a blood blister forming. Abrasions can also occur when continuous scratching occurs, so be mindful of how much you scratch your skin.


Avoid scratching too much or too hard when it comes to insect or bug bites and dry skin. Use a medicated or over-the-counter topical cream (such as such as 1% hydrocortisone cream) that will help alleviate excessively itchy skin. If you have excessively dry skin, see a dermatologist to discuss remedies that can help.
Abrasion can also occur when you wear ill-fitting clothes. If your skin tends to chafe between your thighs or in other areas, protect your skin there with coconut oil or another balm.

, Since frostbite may cause blood blisters to form on some areas of your body, wear clothing that covers your bare skin and also provides both ventilation and insulation from the cold.


Since substantial heat loss occurs through your scalp, cover your head with a warm hat or cap. You may also want to wear thick mittens or gloves, as well as thick or layered socks.
Remember to wear socks that wick moisture away from your skin.

For example, remove uncomfortable shoes or clothing that might be causing the blister.
If you are blistering from cold or heat, remove your body from the source of the temperature. If you are out in the sun, go indoors immediately or cover yourself with clothing.;
, To help relieve the pain of the blister, and start healing it, you should protect it. Use a moleskin pad or other bandage to cover and protect a blister.


Protecting the blister is extremely important if the blister is on a weight-bearing area, like your foot. You can cut a cushioning bandage into a donut shape to help cushion the area while leaving the blister untouched.Though you want to cover the blister when you are going to put weight or other objects against it, leave the blister open to the air as much as possible.

, Try soaking the blister if it is bothering you. You can soak the blister in cool water every few hours, especially if it is painful or itchy.Place a rag in cold water, twist out all the water, then place it on the blister for a calming affect.

, Blood blisters are painful and should be left alone to heal. To help reduce the pain, you can apply an ice pack to them immediately after they appear.Keep the ice pack on the blood blister for five to 15 minutes every hour until the pain is reduced.

Apply an antiviral cream.,
Use a styptic pencil.,
Use a drying agent.,
Apply petroleum jelly.",How to Get Rid of a Cold Sore Fast1," Although a cold sore cannot be “cured”, medications and treatments can ease your symptoms and speed up the natural healing process.Probably the quickest and easiest way to treat a cold sore is way a treatment you can get from your pharmacy or drug store without a prescription from your doctor. The three main types of cream are penciclovir, docosanol, and acyclovir.


In a test of their antiviral effectiveness penciclovir came out on top.These creams will only be really effective if you apply them straightaway when the first signs of the cold sore are apparent.You will need to apply the cream frequently, up to five times a day for four or five days.Always check the label before using a cream.;
, An alternative to a cream is to use a styptic pencil. This treatment is less specific for a cold sore but it can have a beneficial impact. You can use a styptic pencil to “draw” over the cold sore area once or twice a day, with the pencil applied directly to the cold sore.The Alum in the pencils causes blood vessels to contract, which helps to speed up the healing process within the sore.If you use this method you may find it a little painful and uncomfortable at first.

, One way to tackle a cold sore is through the application of a drying agent. Rubbing alcohol is one commonly used option. Make sure you get the 70 per cent solution, and apply to the cold sore with a cotton swab. The alcohol dries out the cold sore to help it heal and limits the chances of it becoming infected, which would greatly prolong it.A drying agent is particularly effective when the sores first appear.Zinc oxide and calamine lotion can dry out lesions.

, Another easily available treatment, which works in precisely the opposite way to the rubbing alcohol, is petroleum jelly. The jelly will soften the skin rather than drying it, and it provides a protective layer to guard against infection. Any kind of infection will greatly increase the lifespan of your cold sore, so a protective layer of petroleum jelly can help you get rid of it as soon as possible.When you are applying the petroleum jelly, do it gently and with clean fingers.

, Despite the name, cold cores aren’t caused by colds. The herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is most often the cause. You get it from contact with an infected person’s skin or body fluid. Once contracted, the herpes virus stays with you for life. There is nothing you can do to eliminate the virus, but you can reduce the frequency of outbreaks. The herpes virus damages your skin as it reproduces. That leaves behind weepy sores that last about a week.
Between outbreaks, HSV-1 hides inside nerve cells, so it’s never completely cured. About two-thirds of us have been infected with the HSV-1 virus.
Once the skin turns itchy and red, the virus is present and you can spread it. You’re most contagious when the blisters show – especially just after they burst. You can’t spread the virus skin-to-skin once they’ve healed again, though you can pass it through your saliva at any time.

, The virus usually comes from kisses from relatives or romantic partners – that is, through body fluids. It’s usually present on an infected person’s lip, even if there’s no obvious sore. This is why you need to know how to identify the signs of a cold sore appearance, so that you can avoid passing it along to another person.


Never share eating utensils or beverages with anybody, especially when you have an active cold sore. The virus often lives in saliva, so you can also spread it if you share kitchen utensils or drinking glasses.
Never share towels or razors or toothbrushes.
Never share chap stick, lipstick, lip balm, lip gloss, lip anything.
Avoid kissing your significant other when your cold sore is active. Switch to butterfly and eskimo kisses for a while, until the coast is clear.
Oral sex, especially during an outbreak, can transmit the herpes virus from the lips to the genitals or vice versa.

How painful is the cold sore?
When did you first get cold sores?
How frequently do you get cold sores?

, Some medications are thought to contribute to cold sore outbreaks. Ask your doctor if these might be contributing to your current cold sore outbreak.Medications that are in question include:


Depo-Provera birth control
Steroid-based medications
Nasal sprays such as Fluticasone and Nasonex
Flu shots or vaccinations (rarely)
Medications that weaken your immune system

, Prescription anti-viral creams containing penciclovir and acyclovir are highly effective treatments for cold sores.These are creams that you will apply directly to the cold sore.


Apply the cream as soon as you feel the cold sore coming on. If you catch it early enough, the cream might prevent it from becoming a blister.
The cream can be applied to open sores, too. They should go away within a day or two after application.

, Acyclovir (Zovirax) or valacyclovir (Valtrex), both anti-viral medications, are available in pill form. These can help clear up cold sores more quickly and may also prevent future outbreaks.These medications can reduce symptoms considerably if taken within the first day or two after you first notice the cold sore or accompanying symptoms., A cortisone injection is a steroid injection that is injected at the site of your cold sore. It will cause the site to swell but then the cold sore should disappear within a few hours. Visit your doctor to get an injection of diluted cortisone to quickly get rid of the cold sore.This can be painful, as the cortisone shot is injected into the cold sore itself.It may also be costly. Check with your health insurance provider to see if this procedure is covered by your insurance.

, When you have a cold sore outbreak, you are highly contagious and the virus can be easily spread to another person. Avoid kissing or having your cold sore come in contact with someone else.


Similarly, avoid oral sexual activity during an outbreak. This can risk transmitting the virus and infecting the other person with genital herpes., Do not share drinking glasses, straws, toothbrushes, razors, towels, or other items that have come in contact with someone with cold sores. Similarly, do not share these items with someone else if you have cold sores.Throw away your toothbrush when you have a cold sore outbreak. You can risk continuing the virus if you keep exposing yourself to it through your toothbrush."

Use over-the-counter cold sore creams.,
Use numbing agents.,
Ask your doctor about antiviral prescription medications.",How to Cure Cold Sores With Care2," There are a number of effective nonprescription products on the market. including Abreva, Viractin, Zilactin, and Herpecin-L. These creams can speed the healing process of cold sores – and they may even be able to prevent an outbreak, if you apply them soon enough. Look for cold sore treatments online or at a drugstore.Docosanol 10% (Abreva) is one of the most widely-trusted products on the market. Use the cream to stave off the first tingle of a cold sore outbreak. Abreva was the first nonprescription medication that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved to reduce the duration and severity of cold sore outbreaks.Tetracaine (Viractin) and lidocaine cream (Zilactin-L) are topical anesthetics. Use them to ease pain and itching. Spread these products onto your cold sores as often as six times a day when you're in the midst of an outbreak. Pain and itching usually subside within two to three days after you first use the product.Benzyl alcohol gel (Zilactin) helps soothe cold sore pain. It may also help your sores heal more quickly. As with most treatments, it will be most helpful if you start using it as soon as you notice a budding cold sore.Use dimethicone with sunscreen (Herpecin-L) to moisturize your lip area and reduce the damage from UV rays. This product may help ease pain and itching. It can also help keep cold sores from coming back, particularly when the sore was caused by overexposure to the sun.

, Menthol and phenol are common ingredients in lip balms and ointments. They should help soften your scabs and keep them from cracking. Be aware of the limitations: even though these chemicals can soothe or moisturize your cold sore, they are not clinically proven to heal it., Prescription cold sore creams may shorten the duration of an outbreak by a day or two, and they may even be able to prevent an outbreak if you time it right. These drugs are more powerful than home remedies and over-the-counter treatments, and they may have adverse side-effects – so only go this route if your problem is especially bad.Look for acyclovir (Zovirax), famciclovir (Famvir), and valacyclovir (Valtrex). These oral antivirals work best if you begin using them within 48 hours of noticing an outbreak. Valacyclovir is the most expensive of the three, but it is easier for your digestive tract to absorb – and thus more effective."

Try using vanilla extract.,
Use ice to reduce swelling and ease pain.,
Apply a whole milk compress.,
Rub salt in your wound.,
Use hydrogen peroxide to keep it clean.",How to Cure Cold Sores With Care3," Some people swear by this natural cold sore remedy. Vanilla is alcohol-based, so the presence of vanilla may make it hard for the virus to thrive. This may lessen the length and severity of the outbreak. If you do use vanilla, try to buy it organic so you're sure it's pure. Use a cotton swab to apply vanilla extract to the sore as soon as you feel the telltale tingling.First, soak a cotton pad or swab in vanilla extract until thoroughly saturated. Try to soak a concentrated area to conserve vanilla; you only really need enough surface area to cover the budding cold sore.
Apply the swab directly to your sore. If you can't yet see a sore, then try to find the source of the tingling. Hold the swab or pad in place for a minute or so, until the cold sore has thoroughly absorbed the vanilla.
Re-apply vanilla four times a day until your cold sore is gone. Vanilla extract can be expensive, so only use as much as you need!

, If your cold sore is puffed-up and painful, try holding an ice pack against the area. A single ice cube will suffice, if the sore is small enough. Press the ice gently into your skin until you can't stand it anymore. Pull it away to let your skin rest, then use it again as needed.


Consider using an ice pack (or a plastic bag filled with ice) instead of single ice cubes. This way, when the ice melts, you can refreeze the water in the bag rather than having to find a completely new ice cube. Make sure to wash the outside of the bag with water and antibacterial soap after each use.

, This home remedy can help ease your pain and speed up the healing process. Milk contains immunoglobulins, proteins that fight off and prevent viruses-like herpes. It also contains l-lysine, which may speed up the healing process and inhibit the amino acids that cause outbreaks. Drink whole milk often to help prevent cold sores. To fight cold sores that have already erupted, make a whole milk compress.


Soak a cotton ball in a tablespoon of milk. Make sure that the cotton is completely saturated with milk.
Press the cotton ball gently against the cold sore. Hold it there for a few minutes. Try not to squeeze out the milk; let the sore absorb the proteins gradually.
Dab the milky residue off of your cold sore. Use a clean rag, moistened with water. Consider adding a dab of petroleum jelly to protect the sore while it absorbs the milk.

, This home treatment is more painful than the other methods, but it may help dry out your sore. First, dissolve 1-2 teaspoons of sea salt into a small glass of lukewarm water. Stir the mixture thoroughly, then use a cotton ball to soak up a bit of the saltwater. Dab the salt solution gently onto your cold sore, and let the salt dry onto your skin.

, Hydrogen peroxide disinfects the sore, which speeds up the healing process and makes it harder for the sore to spread. First, soak a cotton ball in a tablespoon of hydrogen peroxide; use more if you feel it isn’t saturated enough. Press the cotton ball gently against your sore for a few seconds, and consider dabbing it around. Once you pull the cotton away, leave your sore alone for five minutes or so. Let the sore absorb the hydrogen peroxide, then rinse it off.

Wait until the cold sore has partially healed or scabbed over before applying makeup.,
Purchase thick, creamy, yellow-based concealer, as well as skin-colored concealer that matches the color of your skin tone.,
Use a disposable makeup sponge to apply the yellow-based concealer directly to the cold sore.,
Use a small, disposable powder brush or cotton ball to lightly dust finishing powder on top of the yellow-based concealer.,
Use another clean, disposable makeup sponge to apply the skin-colored concealer directly to the cold sore.,
Use the powder brush to apply another light dusting of finishing powder to the skin-colored concealer.,
Dispose of the makeup sponges and powder brushes immediately.",How to Cover Up a Cold Sore1," Open cold sores will continue to ooze pus and fluid as part of the healing phase, and can worsen or take longer to heal when covered with makeup before scabbing occurs., Creamy, non-liquid concealers are often sold in small, concentrated amounts and can be purchased from the makeup section at your local drugstore. Yellow-based concealer can help neutralize redness, whereas skin-colored concealer can help hide the appearance of the cold sore.

, Begin with applying a small amount, then add more as needed to complete cover the cold sore.

, Finishing powder will help set the yellow-based concealer, as well as neutralize the color of the concealer.

, Use a gentle stippling motion to apply the concealer so it blends in effectively with your skin.

, This will help set the last layer of concealer.

, This will help prevent the spreading of your cold sore virus.

Make sure you have a cold sore.,
Recognize the signs of an impending outbreak.,
Quarantine your sore at the first sign of an outbreak.,
Treat the fever.,
Ease the pain.,
Seek medical advice if you have a compromised immune system or if you experience a particularly severe outbreak, a fever that won't go down, an outbreak lasting more than 2 weeks, or irritation of the eyes.,
Prevent cold sore outbreaks with a number of different methods.,
Be patient.,
Reduce your stress.",How to Treat a Cold Sore or Fever Blisters1," A cold sore is the same as a fever blister, but it is not the same as a canker sore. Canker sores are mouth ulcers that occur inside the mouth. While cold sores may on occasion develop inside the mouth, they are usually smaller than canker sores, and they start as blisters. Canker sores are not contagious, and they are not caused by a virus, so treatment differs from that for cold sores.;
, Before you can actually see a cold sore, you will probably be able to feel a slight tingling or burning somewhere around your mouth where the cold sore will erupt. The earlier you can detect an outbreak, the quicker you can take action to hasten your recovery.


You may be able to feel a small bump or hardness in the skin in conjunction with the tingling sensation.
Other early symptoms include, itching of the lips or skin around mouth, sore throat, swollen glands, and pain when swallowing, and a fever., The herpes simplex virus is highly contagious, so avoid kissing or other mouth-to-body activities at any time during an outbreak. Also avoid sharing utensils, cups, or straws with other people, and wash dishes and utensils thoroughly with disinfectant soap. Gently washing the blisters with soap and water may also help to prevent the spread of the outbreak.



Wash your hands frequently, and try to avoid touching the sore. If you touch the cold sore, you can then spread it to other people or to other places on your own body, such as the eyes and genitals.

, As the name fever blisters suggests, cold sores are sometimes accompanied by a fever, particularly in younger children. If fever is present, use fever-reducing medications such as acetaminophen, and monitor the fever carefully.


Fight the fever with lukewarm baths; cold compresses on the inner thighs, feet, arms, and neck; warm tea; popsicles; and adequate sleep.

, Over-the-counter cold sore creams may help to ease the pain of cold sores, as may painkillers such as aspirin, acetaminophen, and ibuprofen. It's important to note, since cold sores often affect young children, that aspirin should generally not be given to young children because of the risk of Reye's syndrome, a rare, but potentially fatal disorder.

, Some outbreaks can be serious.


People with already-weakened immune systems are at particular risk of long-term complications or even death from a herpes outbreak.
Herpes infections in the eyes are one of the leading causes of blindness in many countries, so be very careful not to spread the infection to your eyes, and if you have any irritation in the eyes, see your doctor at once.

, Although herpes simplex is still incurable, you can prevent outbreaks before they happen by:


Wearing sunscreen on the lips and other vulnerable areas. Zinc oxide may help prevent outbreaks in people whose outbreaks are triggered by sun exposure.Washing towels, cloths, and linens in boiling water after each use.
Not having oral sex if you have oral herpes. This can spread the herpes the genitals, even if blisters or lesions are not present.

, If left untreated, a cold sore can last from eight to 10 days. Until then, there's not much you can do. Avoid squeezing or picking at a sore, as this will only slow healing.

, Studies show that there may be a correlation between stress levels and an increased likelihood for cold sores. To prevent future outbreaks and reduce the amount of time you have to suffer through a current outbreak, take time to lower your anxiety and stress levels."

Avoid foods that cause outbreaks.,
Eat nutrient-rich foods.,
Reduce your stress.,
Get plenty of sleep.,
Stay hydrated.,
Keep your immune system strong.",How to Get Rid of a Cold Sore6," Many people are sensitive to certain foods that cause cold sores to appear when they are eaten in excess. If you tend to get cold sores easily, limit or stop eating the following foods:


Acidic foods, like tomatoes and citrus fruits. Avoid both raw tomatoes and foods containing tomato-based sauces, and stop drinking tomato, orange and grapefruit juice.
Salty foods, like canned soups, fried foods, and snack foods. Excess salt can trigger a cold sore outbreak.

, Be sure to get plenty of vitamins and nutrients by eating fruits and vegetables. Eat balanced meals, making sure you eat a lot of leafy greens and other nutrient-rich foods. Take a multivitamin if you're concerned you aren't getting enough nutrients.

, Cold sore outbreaks are more common during periods of stress.You might notice an outbreak around the holidays, or during a particularly stressful time at work. Reduce your chances of getting an outbreak by taking care of yourself during stressful times.

, Getting enough sleep every night will ensure that your body is rested. Get at least 7 to 8 hours of sleep every night. If you are having trouble falling asleep, try soothing music or 10 minutes of meditation before going to bed to ensure that your body knows that it’s time to sleep., Drink lots of water every day to ensure that your body is hydrated. This will not only keep your body healthy, but it can also ward off illnesses that can contribute to a cold sore outbreak.

, Cold sore outbreaks tend to occur when your immune system has been compromised.You might see them when you've got a cold or have been under the weather for another reason. Keep your immune system healthy by getting lots of sleep, drinking lots of water, and eating foods rich in vitamins and other nutrients.


Take precautions against getting the flu or a cold. Wash your hands frequently during flu and cold season. Consider getting a flu shot if you're prone to cold sore outbreaks.

Wait until the cold sore has partially healed or scabbed over before applying makeup.,
Choose a lipstick color that matches your natural lip color.,
Gently swipe the lipstick across the back of your hand.,
Dab a cotton swab into the lipstick on your hand, then use the swab to transfer the lipstick to your lips, including the cold sore.,
Dispose of the cotton swab immediately.",How to Cover Up a Cold Sore2," Open cold sores will continue to ooze pus and fluid as part of the healing phase, and can worsen or take longer to heal when covered with makeup before scabbing occurs.

, Using bright or dark unnatural shades of lipstick can accentuate the appearance of your cold sore.


If your cold sore is especially red or dark in color, experiment with using a lipstick shade that best matches the color of the cold sore.

, This will allow you to apply the lipstick using a cotton swab, which can help prevent the cold sore virus and bacteria from contaminating the entire tube of lipstick.

,, This will help prevent the spreading of your cold sore virus.

Ice the sore.,
Use licorice.,
Consume more lysine.,
Avoid arginine.,
Take an oral antiviral medication.",How to Treat a Cold Sore or Fever Blisters2," Ice works jointly to create an environment inhospitable to the virus that causes the sore, as well as to reduce pain that the sore may be causing. Use an ice pack, rather than touching ice directly to the sore, and keep moving the ice around. Do not ice for more than 10-15 minutes at a time.

, A key ingredient in licorice has been shown to increase the healing time of cold sores. Eat regular licorice (made with real licorice and not anise) or take licorice supplements. A bit of the powdered licorice supplement can also be made into a paste with water and dabbed directly onto the sore several times a day.

, A primary protein in the hepatitis virus that causes cold sores can be combated with a protein found in dairy products - lysine. Eat cheese, yogurt, and milk daily and look for lysine supplements at your local health food store.

, Some research has connected herpes outbreaks with the amino acid arginine, which is found in foods such as chocolate, cola, peas, cereals, peanuts, gelatin, cashews and beer. The evidence isn't conclusive at this point, but if you have frequent outbreaks, you may want to try limiting your consumption of these foods and eliminating consumption during outbreaks.

, A few prescription antiviral medications, such as Penciclovir, Acyclovir, and Famciclovir, have been approved for treatment of herpes outbreaks. These medications do not cure herpes, and they have not been shown to be effective in preventing outbreaks, but they can speed up healing and reduce the severity of an outbreak.They are generally most effective if you start taking them as soon as you notice the first signs of an impending outbreak.


If you have very frequent outbreaks, your doctor may prescribe these medications to be taken daily, even in the absence of symptoms, to suppress future outbreaks. Suppression therapy may be effective for some people, but clinical studies have not shown widespread success.
Antiviral medications for the herpes virus work by interfering with the virus's replication rate.The more the DNA replication of the virus is interfered with, the more time your immune system will have fight the outbreak.

Use tea tree oil.,
Dab on some milk.,
Coat it in vaseline.,
Try apple cider vinegar.,
Use hydrogen peroxide.,
Put on a tea bag.,
Chop up some garlic.,
Dab on some salt.,
Soak a cotton swab with Pure Vanilla extract.,
Take a topical antiviral medication.",How to Treat a Cold Sore or Fever Blisters3," Tea tree oil may be used as an effective topical antiviral. Dissolve a bit of tea tree oil in two or three times as much water and apply it intermittently to the area before the cold sore has formed for several hours.This could help prevent the lesion from forming and worsening once it has come up.

, The proteins in milk help to heal the sore, while the cold temperature of the liquid will soothe any pain you may be experiencing. Dab a cotton ball in milk and apply it liberally to the sore several times a day. This can be done at the onset when you realize a sore might be starting up as well.

, Keeping the cold sore covered up with petroleum jelly will help to block out bacteria and viruses that worsen the infection. Apply an ample amount of the jelly to the sore to keep it covered up and moist at all times. Be sure to do this with a clean q-tip or freshly washed hands to prevent the further spread of bacteria from your fingers to the blister., The vinegar works to dry out the blister, kill bacteria, and even out the pH of the sore. Applying the vinegar to an open sore may sting a bit. Use a cotton swab to dab on the vinegar to the sore several times a day.

, This classic antibacterial works to simultaneously kill bacteria that may infect the blister while drying out the skin in the area. Pour a little onto the sore or use a cotton pad to swipe some on multiple times daily.

, The nutrients and antioxidants in green tea work wonders on soothing cold sores and increasing the speed at which they heal. Make a cup of green tea, and then use the tea bag placed directly on the cold sore after cooling. For an extra bit of relief, refrigerate or freeze the tea bag before placing it on your fever blister.

, Garlic is one of those home remedies that seems to have ties to curing many minor ailments. Create a paste out of crushed or chopped garlic and apply it to your cold sore for 15 minutes. The antibacterial properties of the garlic will help to disinfect the area and increase the healing time. Be warned, garlic is potent and may sting a bit when applied.

, Although a slight sting-inducer, salt applied directly to your fever blister will help to speed up the healing process. Leave the salt on for a few minutes so it has time to set in, and then rinse off and follow up with a dab of pure aloe vera. The follow up with aloe will help to soothe the irritated sore and relieve any pain the salt caused.

, Do this 4 times a day until the cold sore is gone. Alcohol is used in the process of making the vanilla extract which could be the reason why vanilla extract helps to heal cold sores.

, Topical medications, such as docosanol and tromantadine can be taken to curb the outbreak. Although doctors do not know precisely how docosanol fights herpes simplex, they do know that it enter the cytoplasm of cells.Tromantadine works by changing the surface composition of skin cells."

Consider relocating.",How to Prevent Eczema," Eczema flare-ups can be kicked off when skin comes into contact with allergens, so it is important that you know what you are allergic to and avoid products with ingredients that irritate your skin.These may include:


Soaps/bubble bath, especially ones that are artificially perfumed and scented
Perfumes
Cosmetics
Laundry detergents (adding time to your machine's rinse cycle can help with this)
Some lotions;
, Many common household items (and even foods!) contain substances that can have a drying, damaging effect on skin. Avoid contact with these sorts of products. If this is not possible, wear rubber gloves to protect your skin (especially if you have hand eczema). Some things to avoid are:Household cleaners
Finger paints
Gasoline
Turpentine
Wool
Pet fur
Juices from meats and fruits
Plants, jewelry, and even lotions can irritate sensitive skin.

, You can prevent worsening your skin's dryness by limiting your bathing activities to 10 or 15 minutes. Water exposure dries the skin. If possible, skip a shower one day per week to give your skin a break. You should also use lukewarm (not hot) water.Consider installing a water softener in your home (especially if you have hard water) to further reduce the drying effect of your showers or baths.
Pat your skin dry with a soft, clean towel after bathing. Do not rub your skin dry, as this will only cause irritation.

, Some soaps, even if they are made to be used on skin, can have a harsh, drying effect. Use soap that is specifically designed to moisturize, and use it sparingly. Avoid soaps with perfumes or artificial coloring, as these can increase the likelihood that your skin will react badly.Soaps with deodorant and/or antibacterial agents have a greater drying effect on skin, so avoid these when possible.
Only use soap on your face, underarms, genitals, hands, and feet; use only water on all other body parts.

, Synthetic fabrics (like polyester), especially those that are rough to the touch may irritate the skin and trigger eczema flare-ups. This is especially true if your clothes are tight-fitting and/or you are moving around in them a lot. You can prevent skin irritation from clothing by avoiding such wardrobe choices.Some clothing dyes might also irritate your skin. If you find that a certain shirt seems to trigger flare-ups of your eczema, stop wearing it and check the label for information about the fabric dyes used in it; add these to the list of things you should avoid.
Cut the tags off of shirts, bras, and underwear so they do not rub your skin and cause irritation.

, Dust mites are a major culprit of eczema flare-ups. In addition to keeping a clean home, you can reduce the likelihood that dust mites may cause extra skin irritation by doing the following:Remove carpets, rugs, and curtains from your home.
Use plastic mattress covers.
Clean your home thoroughly at least once per week; it is especially important to get rid of dust.
Wash all bedding at least once a week.
Allow sufficient air flow through your home by opening lots of windows, especially during cleaning (weather permitting).

, The dryness of the air in your home has a major impact on the dryness of your skin. Use a humidifier (especially if you live in a dry, cold, and/or high-elevation locale) to increase the moisture content of the air inside your home if necessary.Use a hygrometer, a device that measures humidity, to gauge whether your home's air is too dry. Alternatively, some modern humidifiers have hygrometers built into them and can be set to the proper humidity.
Your humidifier will need to be refilled periodically with water.
A sudden drop in atmospheric humidity can rapidly dry your skin, which is a recipe for a flare-up.

, Although evidence for this link is somewhat sparse, some suggest that certain foods might trigger eczema flare-ups, especially in small children (i.e., under one year of age). Mostly, trigger foods seem to be those to which children are already allergic or intolerant.Foods suspected of being common flare-up triggers include:


Dairy products
Eggs
Nuts and seeds
Soy products
Wheat/gluten
If you're not sure if you're allergic to a food, eliminate it from your diet for two weeks. After two weeks without it, reintroduce it into your diet and see if your symptoms return. If they do, you should avoid that food. If they do not reappear, then you can keep eating the food.

, Frequent moisturizing helps to lock in the skin's own natural moisture and prevents dryness and cracking. This serves the dual purpose of preventing the condition from worsening while providing relief from symptoms. There are numerous options for over-the-counter skin moisturizers, most of which can easily be found in any pharmacy or grocery store.Choose thick creams or ointment, as these work best for excessively dry skin.
For children with eczema, use products free of perfumes; petroleum jelly (such as Vaseline) is a good option for this.
Apply moisturizer at least twice a day. Excessively dry skin absorbs moisture relatively quickly, so you will need to reapply more often than a person without eczema.
If you plan to be outdoors for a long period of time, use sun block with a high SPF level (SPF 50 or higher) to prevent additional drying of the skin from sun exposure.
Stay well hydrated by drinking water.

, Hydrocortisone and other corticosteroids can reduce inflammation and some associated symptoms of an eczema flare-up.These creams are for topical application and can be found in low concentration over-the-counter in most pharmacies. For creams with more than 1% concentration, you will need a doctor's prescription.


Follow the instructions on the cream's packaging and do not exceed the recommended daily dosage.
Overuse of corticosteroids can have adverse effects. Corticosteroids are meant only for acute flares, and they should be avoided otherwise. However, if it is peak season (like a dry winter), you can blend a very low dose with moisturizer and apply it for that extended period of time.
Avoid ingestion of hydrocortisone creams; they are intended for topical application only.

, Over-the-counter antihistamines (such as Benadryl) can be found at any pharmacy and are usually taken orally. These should only be used during flare-ups and when itching is severe.Be aware of the potential side effects of antihistamines, a common one of which is drowsiness. It will be up to you to decide whether relief from itching is worth enduring the side effects of your antihistamine. Just be sure to abide by any warnings on the medication packaging.
Severe itching may not be relieved by an over-the-counter antihistamine. Talk to your doctor to discuss alternative options if this doesn't work for you.

, These are needed to clear up infections caused by bacteria getting into breaks in the skin, but can only be prescribed by a physician. See a doctor right away if you suspect you may have an infected wound.Always complete a prescribed course of antibiotics, even if your infection clears up before you have finished your prescription. Failure to do so could result in your infection returning with resistance to antibiotics. You don't want this!
Make sure your doctor explains all the side effects associated with antibiotic medications. If you are taking other medications, tell your doctor about them to avoid the possibility of experiencing complications.

, Although this might sound counter-intuitive because bleach dries the skin, bleach baths help kill off infection-causing bacteria on the skin and reduce the likelihood that you could develop an infection. Talk to your doctor before doing this, though, as your condition could be made worse in some cases.Use half a cup of bleach for a full bathtub of lukewarm water. Use less if your bathtub is not full.
Soak for about 10 minutes and then rinse off with clean water.
Repeat two to three times per week.

, If you live in a dry climate and have severe eczema, it might be worth considering a move to a more humid locale. Geographic locations with moderately high humidity will are likely to be less harsh on your skin because you won't 'dry out' as easily.Choosing to uproot yourself and your family is a serious decision and should be a last-resort option for dealing with your eczema (unless you are already considering moving for other reasons).


Extremely high humidity can sometimes be problematic for eczema sufferers, too; you are best off living in a place with moderately high humidity (such as the northern-central Midwest) rather than a place where humidity is very high most of the year (such as the deep South).
Be sure to consider seasonal variations in humidity. Some places may be humid during the summer, but quite dry during the winter; others are relatively warm and humid all year.
Speak to your physician before deciding to relocate. Some forms of eczema might not be helped much by moving to a wetter climate.

Eat lysine-rich foods.,
Avoid foods that are high in arginine.,
Stay away from acidic foods.,
Take a daily zinc supplement.,
Eat to boost your immune system and help your body to fight off the virus.",How to Heal a Cold Sore Naturally1," Lysine is an amino acid that some studies have shown to help treat and prevent cold sore outbreaks by blocking arginine, which is another amino acid that is required for viral growth.Lysine-rich foods include fish, meat (poultry, lamb, beef), dairy products, mung bean sprouts, and beans.You can also take a lysine supplement. The dosage is usually 500-1000 mg every day taken on an empty stomach. The safe limit of lysine is less than 3000 mg a day, so don’t take any more than the recommended dosage.;
, Arginine is also an amino acid, but one that serves as a building block for the herpes virus, helping it to spread. The highest concentrations of arginine are found in whole grains, seeds, nuts and chocolate.

, This is particularly important if they will come in contact with the cold sore should you eat them. The herpes virus thrives in an acidic environment, so it is important to keep all acid away from the sores. Acidic foods to avoid include citrus fruits, tomatoes and anything with vinegar.

, Zinc may help boost your immune system and help prevent future cold sores. The recommended dose to boost your immune system is 10 mg/day for adult men and women.For children, consult their pediatrician.


There are also zinc creams that you can use. An example is Virunderim gel, which contains 10% zinc sulfate.You can use this for up to twelve days at the first symptoms of a cold sore to help minimize the duration.

, Include plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables in your diet daily. Some of the best choices for boosting the immune system are cauliflower, cabbage, brussels sprouts, broccoli, onion and garlic.

Look at the rash.,
Evaluate what triggers the rash.,
Consider whether you have other symptoms.,
Go to the doctor if you have an unexplained rash.,
Prepare for your doctor’s appointment.,
Allow the doctor to run tests if necessary.",How to Tell Eczema from Butterfly Rash," Eczema and butterfly rash have different characteristics which will help you distinguish between the two:Eczema is a condition in which patches of skin become red, itchy, dry, cracked and sore. It can occur anywhere on your body but it is most common in areas where your skin forms creases, such as your hands and fingers, the insides of your elbows, the backs of your knees, and your face and scalp. As it heals your skin may be temporarily discolored.
Butterfly rash is named this because it often forms the shape of a butterfly, running from the bridge of the nose to both cheeks. It is red, raised, and may be scaly, itchy or painful. The rash may also appear on other areas of the face or the wrists and hands. However, it usually does not cover the nasal folds. Your nasal folds are the areas under the sides of your nose.;
, Eczema and butterfly rash have different triggers. Understanding what brings on each type of rash may help you to differentiate them.Eczema is often triggered by irritants like soaps, detergents, or other chemicals, environmental influences like cold, dry weather, or humidity, allergens like dust mites, pet fur, pollen or mold, food allergies such as milk, eggs, peanuts, soy or wheat, allergies to fabrics like wool or synthetics, or hormonal changes in women during their cycle or during pregnancy.
The butterfly rash may appear without an obvious trigger or after you are exposed to sunlight. If this is the case, you should see a physician, as this may be a sign of lupus.

, Butterfly rash is itself a symptom of lupus, while eczema is not a symptom of an underlying condition.People with eczema often also have allergies, hay fever, asthma, or a family member with these conditions.
People with butterfly rash generally have other symptoms of lupus which may flare up at times. These symptoms include exhaustion, fever, sensitivity to the sun, chest pain, headaches, confusion, memory loss, difficulty breathing, dry eyes, joint pain and swelling, or fingers and toes that turn white or blue in reaction to stress or cold.

, If you are unsure whether your rash is eczema or butterfly rash, the doctor will examine you and diagnose the rash. It is especially important if:You have other symptoms that could be signs of an underlying illness such as lupus. In order for lupus to be diagnosed, however, you will need lab work and other testing from your physician.
You have a rash that shows signs of infection, such as weeping pus, red streaks, yellow scabs, or increasing pain and swelling.
Your skin is so painful or itchy that it interferes with your ability to live your life or to sleep at night.

, By preparing ahead of time you can make sure to get the most out of your appointment, both in terms of what information you want from the doctor and what information you want to remember to tell the doctor. Lupus can have symptoms that are similar to other conditions, so if the doctor suspects lupus, you may need to also go to a specialist to verify the diagnosis.Make a list of questions you have for the doctor. You may want to ask the doctor how long the rash may take to heal, whether there are any self-care techniques that are recommended, or if treatment is needed.
Prepare a list of the symptoms you experience, when they started, and how often they happen.
Bring a list of all prescription medications, over-the-counter medications, natural remedies, supplements, vitamins and herbs that you are taking. Write down how much you take and when. If it is easier, you can also bring the pill bottles and show the doctor. It is important for the doctor to have this information to determine whether your rash could be a response to anything you are taking. In addition, if the doctor prescribes you any other medication, he or she needs to be sure that it won’t interact with anything else you take.

, If you have eczema, the doctor will likely diagnose it by looking at the rash and asking about your medical history. If he or she suspects that you have a butterfly rash, you may need to do several other tests to determine whether you have lupus. There is no specific test for lupus, but depending upon your symptoms, these tests may help the doctor gather the information needed to make a diagnosis:Blood and urine analyses to determine how well your kidneys and liver are functioning.
A chest X-ray. This would help determine whether your lungs have fluid or inflammation, as may occur in lupus.
An echocardiogram. This test uses sound waves to produce images of your heart. It would enable your doctor to look for damage that might have occurred due to lupus.

Avoid any products that contain alcohol, as these can dry out skin.
Avoid using things like fabric softeners or dryer sheets, as these usually have fragrances that can cause irritation.;
,
Wash new clothes before you wear them. This can help remove any agents left over from manufacturing that might irritate your skin., Heat and sweating can make the condition worse, so it is important to be aware of the temperature of your environment.Always rinse your skin off after sweating. In addition to the fluid loss that can cause dry skin, sweating also leaves salts on your skin that can cause irritation and flare-ups., Eczema is known to go hand-in-hand with dry skin, so adding moisture to the environment can help to diminish the severity of symptoms.Keep your humidifier clean. The humidity in a humidifier is a perfect place for mold, mildew, and bacteria to grow. Clean it regularly according to its instruction manual.

, This can help to reduce the sensation of itching.Soak bandages or light towels in cool water. Wring them out until they’re moist but not soaked. Wrap them around your skin in the affected areas.

, Over-the-counter anti-itch soaks containing oatmeal are available at your local pharmacy or drugstore.In general, do not bathe children with eczema more than 2-3 times per week, or you could actually make the condition worse.Another option is to make a homemade anti-itch bath soak for eczema by adding baking soda and oatmeal to a bath. Soak for 10 minutes.You can also try a bleach bath, which will help reduce bacteria on the skin. Add ½ cup of household bleach to a bathtub full of warm water. Soak for about 10 minutes. Do not submerge your face or get the water in your eyes. Rinse with clean water.

Aim to moisturize within 3 minutes of towelling off.Try to moisturize 2 to 3 times per day.
Petroleum jelly is fragrance-free and can often work very well to keep irritated patches moisturized., Longer nails can do damage to skin if you scratch at your eczema. Trim your nails short. If you have children, cut their nails short too.If your child cannot keep from scratching, consider having him or her wear gloves or bandages over the fingers to avoid excessive damage to the skin.

, For some people this is certain foods, dust, soaps, clothes, perfumes, etc.Keep a list of triggers you can associate with flare-ups of your eczema, and avoid these whenever possible.


Prevention is the best medicine, so if you can recognize and avoid triggers it can greatly diminish the severity of your symptoms!

, Stress is also known to be a trigger for eczema, and it has been shown that effective stress-reduction techniques, as well as diminishing the overall stress in your life, can improve symptoms and reduce the amount of flare-ups. Try yoga or tai chi for easy stress relief.You may also find that meditation helps relieve your stress.Avoid excessive caffeine.Caffeine can cause stress-like symptoms such as rapid heartbeat or jittery feelings.

, If you cannot get your eczema under control with lifestyle methods, it is important to consult your physician around appropriate medical treatment. This is because excessive scratching can lead to complications, such as infections, eye problems, and/or permanent skin changes. Potential complications include:


skin infections
permanent changes to the texture and color of the skin (called ""neurodermatitis"")
eye complications (from excessive eye watering, eye discharge, and inflammation that often come hand-in-hand with the eczema rash)
hypopigmentation (decreased skin color) or hyperpigmentation (increased skin color), which may be permanent
""eczema herpeticum,"" which is when the herpes simplex virus (which is the same one that causes cold sores) gets into the open areas of the rash that have been excessively scratched"
"
Ice the cold sore as soon as you feel it forming.,
Apply lemon balm or lemon extract directly to the sore.Soak a cotton ball in the lemon balm and dab it on the cold sore 2 to 3 times a day.

,
Make a salt, milk and lemon juice treatment.,
Put salt on a cold sore.Moisten your finger and then dip it in regular table salt.,
Apply a teabag to a cold sore.Soak a tea bag in hot water, allow it to cool, and then apply the wet bag to the sore for 5 to 10 minutes.",How to Heal a Cold Sore Naturally2," Repeat the application regularly. The herpes virus requires a moist, warm environment to grow. Cool the sore and keep it from warming back up to prevent it from growing bigger and to speed up healing.

,, Add a little lemon juice and milk to salt. The acid in the lemon juice is buffered by the protein in the milk, so it won't sting as much. Roll the mixture into a ball. Dab on the cold sore once a day. After application, dab a little aloe vera on the cold sore.

, Put your salty finger on the cold sore and press gently for 30 seconds to allow the salt time to enter the sore. Wash your hands with hot, soapy water after touching the sore.

, Use a fresh tea bag and repeat the process every 1 to 2 hours.

"
"

"
"
Avoid touching the cold sores.,
Wash your hands often.,
Stock up on toothbrushes.,
Don’t share objects.,
Use an SPF 15 or higher sunscreen.,
Use a moisturizer.,
Make your own moisturizer.",How to Heal a Cold Sore Naturally4," In addition to aggravating the cold sore, touching it can transfer the HSV-1 virus responsible for cold sores to your fingers. This makes it easier to spread the virus by accident due to other contact. The virus can infect the skin cells with which it comes in contact even when they’re skin cells on another part of your own body. Avoid this complication by avoiding contact with the cold sore as much as possible.

, Even when mindfully trying not to touch a cold sore, people often poke at them without thinking. Wash your hands often, especially after realizing that you have touched the cold sore or the general area around your lips and mouth.


This is especially true before and after eating.

, The virus can continue to live on surfaces such as toothbrushes. To avoid potentially spreading the area in which you get cold sores, start using a new toothbrush as soon as you feel symptoms coming on, and throw it away when the cold sore has healed.


As an additional safety measure, ensure that your toothbrush does not come into contact with the opening of the toothpaste tube when applying toothpaste., Avoid sharing towels, razors, eating utensils, or washcloths with anyone. Make sure you wash anything that has potentially come into contact with your cold sore with hot, soapy water.

, One of the known triggers for cold sores is sun exposure.By using a sunscreen with an SPF of 15 or higher, you can help the cold sore heal by minimizing the damaging effects of the sun.


Consistently using sunscreen around the area even without an outbreak will help to minimize the recurrence of future cold sores as well.
Remember to wash your hands both before and after applying the sunscreen.

, You can apply a tiny dab of petroleum jelly or propolis with a Q-tip. Organic moisturizing products that contain lysine are also helpful, such as Basic Organics Lysine Ointment or 100% Pure Lysine + Herbs by Ariva.


Propolis is a natural, nutrient-rich resin made by bees.

, If you prefer to know exactly what goes into your natural moisturizer, you can make your own at home with propolis and essential oils. A 3% propolis ointment has been shown to reduce the pain of cold sores.To make the ointment, take 0.5 ounces of propolis (equal to one tablespoon) and add 48.5 ounces of pure coconut oil, which works great as a moisturizer.From there, add one drop of each of the following:


Camphor oil, which helps with pain reduction
Echinacea oil, which is an antiviral herb that can help boost the immune systemLicorice oil, which has effective properties against HSV-1Andrographis oil, which has both antiviral and anti-inflammatory propertiesSage oil, which also has antiviral properties to help dry out a cold sore and it a good alternative if you have trouble finding andrographis oil"
"
Examine your risk for future outbreaks.,
Examine your potential outbreak triggers.,
Avoid too much time in the sun.,
Eat a balanced diet.,
Get plenty of sleep.,
Avoid stress.,
Boost your immune system.,
See your doctor.",How to Heal a Cold Sore Naturally5," Many of those who test positive for the HSV-1 virus do not experience cold sores, and many more don’t have recurrent cold sores after initial outbreaks.However, those at a higher risk for recurrent cold sores include those with:A weakened immune system, i.e. are immunosuppressed
HIV/AIDS, which is a cause of immunosuppression
Eczema
Cancer who are taking chemotherapy
An organ transplant, which means the patient is taking immunosuppressant drugs to prevent organ rejection
Severe burns

, Certain triggers are tied to the likelihood of a person experiencing future outbreaks as well. These triggers include:


Fever of any kind (whether from another viral or a bacterial infection)
Menstruation
Stress of any kind (physical, mental, or emotional)
Fatigue
Sun Exposure
Surgery

, Since sun exposure is a trigger for cold sore outbreaks, you should minimize your time in the sun. Remember always to wear sunscreen as well to minimize effects when you are outside.

, A balanced, nutritious diet can help reduce triggers like fatigue and stress. The main components of a healthy diet include:


Lots of fresh fruit and fresh vegetables. Include a variety of both fruits (except citrus) and vegetables. Both fruit and vegetables contain vitamins, minerals, proteins, and fiber to keep you as healthy as you can be.
Complex carbohydrates versus simple sugars. This means that you should stay away from processed and packaged foods. They often seem simpler, but during the processing and packaging, all kinds of sugars are added, including high-fructose corn syrup.
These sugars are associated with glucose-intolerance (pre-diabetes), diabetes, obesity, metabolic syndrome, and heart disease as well as alterations in the gut bacteria.Increased amounts of fish and lean poultry in your diet (as well as decreasing the amounts of red meat).
Beans and legumes, which are excellent sources of vitamins and minerals. They do contain phytic acid, but normal cooking should release most of the minerals and allow them to be absorbed by your body.
Don’t forget to keep drinking water and staying hydrated. Drink at least 6-8 8-ounce glasses of water each day.

, Poor sleep schedules have an effect on both stress and fatigue levels. Ensure that you get 7-8 hours of quality sleep each night.

, Though often unavoidable at work or at home, try to avoid stressful situations as much as possible. This can mean walking away from a situation or something as simple as taking a few minutes away from your desk at work. Other steps you can take to avoid stress or at least balance it include:


Spending time with friendsGoing for a walk or to the gymIntroducing deep breathing or meditation techniques into your daily routineYou can find a guide to these techniques at How to Breathe Deeply and How to Meditate.

, In addition to diet and exercise, you can take other steps to boost your immune system as well. These steps include not smoking, drinking only in moderation, avoiding sickness and other infections by washing your hands regularly, and controlling your blood pressure.

, Cold sores rarely lead to any complications, and they don’t typically require a trip to your doctor. However, you should make an appointment to see your doctor if:You get cold sores more than 2-3 times a year
Your cold sores don’t heal within two weeks
You get sick frequently, which may signify a weakened immune system
The cold sores are very painful
Your eyes are irritated when you have a cold sore, which may indicate further infection

"
Use moisturizers.,
Take oral antihistamines if itching is severe.,
Ask your doctor about ""corticosteroid"" creams or ointments.,
Talk with your doctor about acupuncture.,
Consider oral (pill form) corticosteroids for very severe flare-ups.",How to Reduce Eczema Itching2," Any over-the-counter non-irritating moisturizing agent can be helpful in eczema (because, as previously mentioned, eczema tends to go hand-in-hand with dry skin).If over-the-counter moisturizers are insufficient, speak to your doctor about prescription moisturizing options.
Often ointments can be more effective than over-the-counter lotions, as they form a stronger barrier to keep the skin's moisture in. They are also usually less irritating to your skin.

, Over-the-counter antihistamines may provide temporary relief from some of the symptoms of eczema,although they should be used with other treatments such as moisturizing.Stronger antihistamines may need to be prescribed by your doctor.


Antihistamines that are also sedatives, such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl) may help you sleep better, which could help with itching. Consult with your pediatrician before giving antihistamines to children, especially sedatives., An example of this would be hydrocortisone (the most commonly used), although there are also some stronger ones your doctor can prescribe if needed.These work by diminishing the skin's ""immune response,"" which in turn reduces inflammation, the size of the rash itself, and the itchiness.
Corticosteroid creams or ointments applied to the skin are helpful and effective treatments for eczema, but you should always use them only as recommended by your doctor.Improper use of corticosteroids can cause infection, skin damage, or further irritation, among other side effects.Do not share your prescription creams with others, even if they also have eczema.

, Acupuncture is sometimes effective for relieving pain, and studies suggest that acupuncture may help reduce itchiness from eczema.Acupuncture generally does not produce severe side effects, so it may be a good choice if you are having trouble managing the itch with medication alone.


Look for an acupuncturist who is licensed by the National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (NCCAOM).This non-profit agency helps regulate the practice of acupuncture for safety and effectiveness.
Many insurance plans do not cover alternative therapies such as acupuncture. However, they may be more likely to do so if referred by your doctor. Consult with your doctor, who can help you find a licensed practitioner in your area.

, These medications are for short-term use only due to the potential side effects such as cataracts, osteoporosis, lowered infection resistance, high blood pressure, and thinning skin.However, for short-term treatment of severe flare-ups your doctor may recommend briefly taking the pill form to get the rash and itch exacerbation under control.
Other anti-inflammatory agents and immune-modulating pills may be prescribed if your condition is very severe. These treatments may include cyclosporine, methotrexate, or mycophenolate, all of which can have serious risks and side effects.Only you and your doctor can decide whether these treatments are right for you."

Know what can trigger a flare-up.,
Recognize the symptoms of eczema.,
Distinguish between eczema and other skin conditions.,
Know when to seek additional help from your doctor.",How to Reduce Eczema Itching3," Doctors do not know exactly what causes atopic dermatitis, or eczema.The severity of the rash and the itch can range from mild to severe, and it often has intermittent flare-ups that can be random or associated with certain triggers such as soaps, detergents, or other allergens. The following may also trigger a bout of eczema:Skin staph infections
Asthma
Certain foods, particularly if you are allergic
Stress
Sweat
Environmental changes, such as temperature or humidity levels
Tobacco smoke or air pollution

, Symptoms vary widely depending on the person. Most people develop symptoms before age 5. These include:Itchiness, especially at night -- eczema may even disturb your sleep
Severe dry skin that may crack or become scaly
Patchy skin with red or brownish-gray color
Rash
Small bumps or blisters that may burst and crust when scratched
Intermittent flare-ups of rash and itch

, Dry skin on its own, without redness, bumps/blisters, or other symptoms, is usually caused by your environment, rather than a medical condition.Other skin conditions, such as psoriasis, hives and fungal infections of the skin such as ringworm, can also cause dry skin and itching.


Symptoms of plaque psoriasis include thick, red, scaly patches of skin; dry skin that may crack and bleed; itching and burning; changes to your fingernails and toenails; and joint pain. These symptoms are usually cyclical. You should seek medical attention for psoriasis.Symptoms of hives include pink or red swollen bumps; swelling that may appear and disappear; and welts or bumps that may occur over a large area of skin. Hives are often triggered by allergic reactions. You should seek medical attention for hives., You can often control the itch at home, but your should see your doctor if any of the following apply:Your eczema is disrupting your ability to function
You have a lot of pain
Your skin looks infected (redness, pus, scabs, swelling)
Your attempts to manage the itch have not been successful
You believe you are experiencing difficulty with your vision.

Take daily warm baths or showers.,
Moisturize your skin every day.,
Wear cotton or soft fabrics.,
Avoid sweaty activities.,
Invest in a humidifier.,
Wear your fingernails as short as you can.,
Take daily vitamins and supplements.",How to Relieve Discomfort Caused by Eczema1," When you have eczema, a good skincare routine includes having a daily warm (not hot) shower or bath. While in the bath or shower, use a mild soap or a non-soap alternative to cleanse your skin. Apply a good moisturizer all over your entire body immediately after your bath or shower, while your skin is still damp.Keep the length of your showers and baths to 10 – 15 minutes at the most.Avoid using a washcloth, sponge, loofah, or other exfoliating items when you wash your skin as this may irritate it.
Apply any medicated lotions before your overall moisturizer within three minutes of getting out of the water.
It may be helpful to conduct your daily shower or bath at night, instead of in the morning, so your skin has a better chance of absorbing moisture from the water and moisturizer.;
, If you have eczema, your skin is having trouble retaining moisture. To help reduce the symptoms of eczema, you need to help your skin increase and retain its moisture content. In addition to moisturizing immediately after a bath or shower, moisturize your skin several times throughout the day.Moisturize your hands every time your wash them.
Know the three basic types of moisturizers — ointments, creams and lotions — and which ones work best for you. Use a combination of moisturizers throughout the day as part of your regular skin care routine.Some ointments, like petroleum jelly, do not contain any moisturizing ingredients, but simply act as a barrier, not allowing moisture out of the skin.
Some creams may contain ingredients that may irritate your skin. Read the ingredient list carefully before selecting one.
Eucerin is a cream often recommended for those with eczema.
Lotions may be too mild to work for people with eczema as they are primarily water-based, and the water content evaporates very quickly.

, Fabrics with open weaves, including loose fitting cotton fabrics, are the most comfortable on irritated skin. Avoid fabrics made from wool and polyester as well as fabrics that are said to be wrinkle-resistant or flame-retardant, as they have added chemicals that may irritate your skin.Make sure to wash all your new clothes before wearing them the first time.
Use an unscented, mild liquid laundry detergent to wash all your clothing, towels and sheets. And never use fabric softener or dryer sheets. You may also want to set up a double rinse cycle on your washing machine to ensure all detergent residue is removed.

, Sweating irritates your skin, and when your skin becomes more irritated, it becomes itchy. Unfortunately it’s a nasty and unending cycle for those who suffer from eczema. As such, reducing the number of activities you do that cause you to sweat can help reduce skin irritation. This also includes staying inside when it’s really hot outside., Regardless of where you live, you might want to consider investing in a humidifier for drier seasons and conditions. Keeping the air in your home moist will also help keep your skin moist.Some furnaces can have humidifiers installed directly onto them, which allows the moist air to circulate around the entire house.
You can also purchase plug-in humidifiers that can be used in individual rooms and can be easily turned on and off. You might want to consider one of these humidifiers for your bedroom.

, Scratching at your irritated skin feels good initially, but it only ends up making eczema worse. And the more your scratch, the more likely you are to get an infection if you break the skin. One way to help prevent yourself from scratching is to wear your fingernails as short as you can and keep them trimmed.You can also consider wearing gloves and socks at night to help prevent scratching while you’re asleep.

, There are several vitamins and supplements that have been found to reduce the symptoms of eczema.Fish Oil has been known to reduce inflammation. The dosage to take will depend on several factors, so should be discussed with your doctor first. But if you decide to take a high dose of fish oil, select a product without much (or any) vitamin A, as vitamin A can be toxic in high amounts.
Probiotics are known to help boost the immune system and control allergies. The type taken should be Bifidobacterium or Lactobacillus in quantities of 3 – 5 billion live organisms a day.
Evening Primrose Oil can reduce itching, but should not be taken by anyone who is also taking blood thinners or who has a history of seizures.
Borage Oil contains the essential fatty aside GLA which can be an anti-inflammatory. Oil with 500 – 900 mg of GLA should be taken daily, in divided doses.
Vitamin C can work like a antihistamine if you take about 1000 mg up to two to four times a day. Note that vitamin C is known to react with certain medications.
Bromelain is an enzyme derived from pineapples and can work as an anti-inflammatory. Suggested doses are 100 – 250 mg up to two to four times a day.
Flavonoids are the antioxidants found in foods like dark coloured berries. They’re known to have anti-inflammatory effects, and can also help reduce allergic reactions.

"
Use hydrogen peroxide.,
Use petroleum jelly or honey.,
Apply an ice cube to the cold sore.,
Try echinacea.,
Use lemon balm.,
Try applying a natural oil or extract.,
Apply a rhubarb and sage ointment.,
Make a licorice ointment.,
Use cold dairy products.,
Apply some aloe vera gel.",How to Get Rid of a Cold Sore with Home Remedies1," Hydrogen peroxide has antiseptic and antiviral properties that can help reduce inflammation and fight away the viral infection causing the cold sore.Soak a cotton ball or cotton swab in one teaspoon of hydrogen peroxide and hold it directly over the cold sore for five minutes. Rinse your face gently with cold water afterwards, and throw away the used cotton ball.
Make sure not to ingest the hydrogen peroxide as you apply it.;
, Protect your cold sore by covering it with medicated petroleum jelly, such as Vaseline, after it has drained. This will help keep the sore moist and prevent your skin from cracking, essentially providing a protective seal over the sore as it heals.Do not use your fingers to apply the jelly, as you can spread the virus to your fingertips. Instead use a cotton ball or swab to apply the jelly as needed until the sore heals.
If you do not have any petroleum jelly on hand, you could use a little honey. Honey has antiviral and antibacterial properties that can protect the cold sore against additional threats while also fighting the underlying virus.Apply a little honey using a cotton swab and cover the site of the cold sore completely.

, Hold an ice cube or ice pack directly on the cold sore for a few minutes to reduce inflammation and numb pain. If you're using an ice cube, consider wrapping in a towel for your own comfort. Press the icy surface to the cold sore until the cold has numbed the pain and remove it shortly after. Do not leave on for extended periods of time. Repeat this procedure once every one to three hours.Note that you should only do this when the cold sore is new. If the cold sore has already broken open, ice could actually hinder the healing process by slowing down blood flow (with its corresponding healing properties) to the lesion.

, Echinacea tea is believed to strengthen the immune system, thereby assisting your body's natural immune response as it fights the cold sore. Steep 1 bag of Echinacea tea in one cup (250 ml) freshly boiled water for 10 minutes. Drink when ready. Drink this tea once a day until the cold sore clears.You could also take 300 mg of echinacea supplements up to four times a day to boost your immunity.
Do not give echinacea to your child without consulting your doctor or a pediatrician first.
People with autoimmune diseases, diabetes, tuberculosis, connective tissue disorders, multiple sclerosis, liver disorders, HIV or AIDS should use echinacea with caution.
People allergic to plants in the daisy family may also be allergic to echinacea.

, Research widely supports the use of lemon balm as a remedy for reducing redness and inflammation in cold sores while also decreasing the risk of recurrent infections. Lemon balm is also used to help treat insomnia, anxiety and indigestion. Lemon balm contains eugenol which calms muscle spasms, relaxes tissues and kills bacteria. Essential oils made from lemon balm leaves contain plant chemicals called terpenes which may also play a role in the herb's relaxing and antiviral effects. Lemon balm is available as a dietary supplement, topical cream, tincture, and herbal tea at most nutrition and herbal medicine stores.Apply lemon balm ointment to the area affected with cold sores up to three times a day. Alternatively, make lemon balm tea by steeping a ¼ teaspoon of dried lemon balm in one cup of warm water (80–85ºC) for three to five minutes. Strain and drink immediately without adding any sweetener. Additionally, you can put 1 teaspoon of lemon balm tea on a cotton ball and apply to your cold sore.
Topical application of lemon balm cream is considered safe for children. You should speak with your healthcare provider or a pediatrician to determine the recommended usage for your child or infant.

, Certain natural oils and extracts have antiseptic properties, and when applied directly to the cold sore, can combat the virus causing it. Others have astringent properties, so they can dry the area out and prevent infection from setting in and worsening the sore.Peppermint oil can target viruses that escape from the site of infection, making it useful against cold sores.Dip a cotton swab in peppermint oil and apply the oil to your cold sore. Do this twice a day until the sore clears.
Witch hazel oil is an astringent and an antiseptic. Soak a cotton swab in one teaspoon (5 ml) of witch hazel and apply it directly to the cold sore. Do not rinse it off. Apply this cure once or twice a day.
Real vanilla extract is alcohol-based and makes it difficult for the virus to survive. Soak a cotton swab in 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) of vanilla extract and press it directly on the sore, holding it in place for a minute or two. Do this up to four times a day.
Both tea tree oil and garlic oil can help the healing process by keeping cold sores soft. A soft cold sore is less likely to split open. Dab a little of either oil directly onto the cold sore once or twice a day.

, Research suggests that applying a topical cream made of 23mg/g each of rhubarb extract and sage extract is as effective as prescription medications in healing cold sores.Look for this at natural health stores. Simply squeeze a pea-sized amount of the ointment onto a cotton swab or cotton ball and apply to the cold sore.


Ask your doctor if rhubarb and sage are safe for infants and children under 5 years before use.

, Glycyrrhizic acid, which is found in licorice root, is the key ingredient here. It has anti-inflammatory and anti-viral properties and can help relieve symptoms and stop the production of the virus.Combine one tablespoon (15 ml) of licorice root powder or extract with 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) water or two teaspoons (10 ml) of petroleum jelly. Dab this cream onto the cold sore, covering it completely, and let it sit for several hours or even overnight, ideally.
Another option is to mix the licorice root powder with petroleum jelly, which has its own healing properties. In this case, start by mixing one teaspoon of the petroleum jelly with the licorice root. Then, add more petroleum until to get the consistency you want.

, Both cold milk and cold yogurt are believed to have some usefulness against cold sores. Milk contains antibodies that can fight off viruses, and lysine, which can fight arginine, a certain amino acid that can cause cold sore outbreaks. Soak a cotton ball in one tablespoon (15 ml) of cold milk and apply it directly to the cold sore for a couple of minutes.The probiotics in yogurt can help fight the herpes virus causing the cold sore. Dab a little plain yogurt directly onto the cold sore, or eat two to three cups of non-fat yogurt daily during an outbreak., Aloe vera can soothe the pain of a cold sore (among many other skin irritations) and fight the bacteria threatening to infect the sore and worsen your condition. It can also help speed up the healing process.Apply 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) aloe vera gel directly to the cold sore using a cotton swab. Let it stay on. The best gel is the one right from the plant, which is easy to find and lasts for a long time. Break off a fleshy leaf and apply the gel right to your cold sore.
If you can't find an aloe plant, buy a good quality and 100% natural aloe vera gel at a pharmacy or other drug store.

Identify triggers for atopic dermatitis.,
Watch for triggers of contact dermatitis.,
Learn your risk for dyshidrotic eczema.",How to Handle an Eczema Flare Up1," Atopic dermatitis is essentially a chronic allergic reaction. It is most common in children and babies. However, an adult can have this type of eczema as well.Flare-ups of this type of eczema can be caused by irritants, allergens, stress, fabrics, and dry skin, to name just a few.If you have food allergies, you may be more likely to experience eczema flare-ups.Atopic dermatitis is often passed down from one generation to the next, and people who are prone to this type of eczema are also likely to develop hay fever or asthma.This type of eczema in infants often starts on the child's head area, either the cheeks or the scalp, though it can spread to other areas. It can exhibit as small, red bumps that itch or as a scaly rash. When it spreads, it often shows up in the bend of the elbow or knee, though it can be all over the body, especially in babies. It is not contagious.;
, Contact dermatitis is also an allergic reaction, but it's not chronic like atopic dermatitis. Contact dermatitis only occurs when your skin comes into contact with a particular irritant.The most common irritants are certain types of metals, poison ivy, soaps, and even perfumes or make-up. This rash is not contagious, either.Contact dermatitis also shows up as small, red bumps that itch. They may also leak fluid, and turn into scaly, scabbed skin., This type of eczema is less common than atopic dermatitis. It usually only shows up on your hands and feet.Flare-ups for this type of eczema can be caused or exacerbated by stress, allergies, too much time in water, dry skin, and contact with certain metals, such as nickel.This type of eczema begins as a scattering of tiny blisters that itch. Once they burst, the skin takes on a scaly look.Women are twice as likely to develop dyshidrotic eczema than men.People with chronic dyshidrotic eczema are less likely to have flare-ups after middle age."

Learn your triggers.,
Try a special treatment bath.,
Apply a wet wrap.",How to Relieve Discomfort Caused by Eczema2," Most eczema sufferers are allergic to one or more thing, including certain foods and chemicals. One or more of these items may actually cause an eczema flare-up as part of the allergic reaction. If you know what items can trigger a flare-up, avoid them. If you aren’t sure what items are causing your eczema flare-ups, try to keep track of when flare-ups occur, what you were doing, wearing, and eating in the days leading up to the flare-up.Some food items to avoid are those that are commonly known to cause allergic reactions, such as: dairy, soy, citrus, peanuts, wheat, fish, eggs, corn and tomatoes.
You may also want to avoid processed foods, especially those with added sugar. These types of foods can cause inflammation.

, A soak in a warm bath for 10 to 15 minutes will help your skin absorb the moisture it needs. But you can also add other items to the bath for specific treatment purposes.Bleach Baths — Add ½ cup of bleach to a full bathtub, or ¼ cup of bleach to a half-full bathtub, then soak for 10 minutes and rinse off your skin. You can have a bath like this 2-3 times per week. The bleach acts as an antibacterial for your skin and helps decrease the possibility of infections.

Baking Soda or Oatmeal Baths — You can add baking soda or oatmeal directly to the bath water, or you can mix them with water to form a paste to apply directly to your skin. Either method should help to reduce the intensity of itching caused by eczema.

Vinegar Baths — Add 1 cup of vinegar to your bath water before a regular bath. Vinegar also acts as an antibacterial and can help prevent infections.

Salt Baths — If you’re experiencing a flare-up, and you find bathing or showering painful or uncomfortable, add 1 cup of table salt to your bath water. The salt water helps to eliminate the discomfort so you can stay in the water long enough.

, A wet wrap is pretty much exactly what it sounds like — a wrapping of wet fabric around an affected area. Normally wet wraps are used when you’re experiencing a flare-up and are applied after the area has been cleansed and moisturizer is applied. Several layers of wet fabric are placed on top of the skin (and moisturizer), followed by a layer of dry fabric (to keep the moisture in).Wet wraps can create a cool sensation that relieves itching. They also prevent itching because of the multiple layers of fabric.

Apply topical corticosteroids.,
Take antihistamines.,
Ask your dermatologist about phototherapy.,
Consider psychodermatology.,
Use immunosuppressants.,
Take oral antibiotics.",How to Relieve Discomfort Caused by Eczema3," Topical corticosteroids can come in a cream, lotion or ointment and are applied when you’re experiencing an eczema flare-up. This medication can help reduce inflammation and irritation, and relieve the itching.Hydrocortisone products are available as over-the-counter medications and are often used by people without eczema to reduce the symptoms of insect bites, poison ivy, and allergic reactions on the skin. They are usually quite mild and may not work for all levels of eczema.There are many side effects to using topical corticosteroids that should be discussed with your doctor before starting a treatment plan. Do not use steroid creams for too long as overuse of this medication can cause skin irritation and discoloration.Prescription-strength systemic corticosteroids are also available from your doctor to help reduce inflammation and relieve itching. Systemic corticosteroids are taken internally, but have more severe side effects than topical options., Antihistamines are over-the-counter allergy medications that can come in pill and liquid form. Their main purpose is to help reduce the symptoms of allergies like hay fever and are mainly used by people who have seasonal allergies. But they can also help relieve the itchiness of eczema breakouts.Some antihistamines, like Benadryl, can make you drowsy. This may be helpful if you hare having trouble sleeping due the itchiness of your eczema.

, Phototherapy is a treatment for eczema (and other skin conditions) using light. Eczema treatments are usually done with narrowband ultraviolet B (UVB) light. Phototherapy has been known to reduce itchiness and inflammation, increase the production of vitamin D, and can even provide some antibacterial benefits.Phototherapy is normally used if topical treatments haven’t been helpful, and works on about 60 – 70% of patients who have tried it.
Phototherapy can take up to one to two months you experience an improvement in your symptoms.
Risks include premature skin aging and predisposition to skin cancer due to UVB exposure.

, Psychodermatology is the treatment of skin diseases using psychological techniques. Such techniques include: relaxation, biofeedback, hypnosis and meditation. Since many skin conditions can be brought on by things like stress, being able to control your mind can actually have a positive impact on your eczema.Counseling may also be helpful for those who feel self-conscious when suffering flare-ups.

, The intricate details behind what causes eczema are not known. But what is known is that the person’s immune system appears to be attacking itself, which is what causes the rashes, irritation and inflammation. In order to stop these symptoms from occurring, one possible method to employ is immunosuppressants, which literally suppress the immune system and its associated reactions.Because an immunosuppressant is causing your immune system not to function at full capacity, there can be some serious negative side effects. As such, most doctors and patients tend to use this as a last resort option for severe and chronic eczema.

, The itchiness caused by eczema can eventually lead you to scratch so much that you break the skin. And unfortunately when you break the skin, you increase your risk of infection. If one or more sites of eczema on your body have become infected, your doctor may prescribe oral antibiotics to help clear up the infection.Speak to your doctor about what topical treatments you can use on an infected area before applying anything.

Install hardwood or tiles in your home.,
Reduce allergens from your pets.,
Protect yourself from the sun.",How to Relieve Discomfort Caused by Eczema4," This might not be an option for everyone, but reducing the places where allergens can live in your home can help reduce your eczema symptoms. This includes removing or reducing carpets or area rugs. But it also includes replacing fabric curtains with non-fabric window coverings., Pet dander can be the cause of allergic reactions in many people, and could potentially be a trigger for your eczema. There are several things you can do to help reduce the amount of allergens spread by your pets around your house.Create an allergy-free zone in your house where your pets are not allowed to go, possibly your bedroom. Install a HEPA air cleaner in that room to help further reduce allergens.
Bathe your pets once a week using pet-specific shampoo (or as directly by your veterinarian). Just like humans, baths help to eliminate dead skin cells on your pet’s skin, which is the cause of most allergies.

, Skin cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in the United States, yet it is fairly easy to protect yourself from the sun on a daily basis.Reduce the amount of time you’re exposed to the sun during the peak hours of 10 am to 4 pm. This includes days when it’s cloudy, as up to 80% of the UV rays from the sun can get through the clouds.
Wear clothes that will protect as much of your skin as possible if you’re outside, including long-sleeve shirts and pants. Always wear a hat, especially one with a brim, to protect both your head, face and neck.
Wear sunglasses when you’re outside, all year round. Sunglasses protect your eyes and they also protect the skin around your eyes from sun damage. Sunglasses should protect from both UVA and UVB rays, and do not have to be expensive.
Use sunscreen on any exposed portions of skin, including your face, hands and lips. Use sunscreens that are considered ""physical blockers"" (which contain zinc or titanium) rather than chemical sunscreens (which contain benzones, amino benzoic acid or cinnamates) as they are less likely to cause an eczema flare-up.
Select a sunscreen that has at least 30 SPF and protects against a broad spectrum of UV rays. It is also very helpful to select a sunscreen that is water-resistant so it doesn’t need to be constantly reapplied.

Avoid inflammatory foods.,
Follow a Mediterranean diet.,
Avoid arginine-rich foods.,
Consume more vitamin C. Strengthening your immunity against viruses and bacteria will help your body heal faster and avoid future infections.,
Use garlic.,
Use zinc.,
Take lysine supplements.",How to Get Rid of a Cold Sore with Home Remedies2," Certain foods can slow down the body’s healing process, impair the immune system, and increase inflammation. These should especially be avoided by people with autoimmune diseases, people taking medications for heart, lung or digestive conditions and those who have recently had a cold, cough or fever. If you have a cold sore, you should also avoid these foods that can cause chronic inflammation:Refined carbohydrates, such as white bread, pastries and donuts
Fried, fatty foods
Sugar-sweetened beverages, such as soda or energy drinks.
Red meat such as veal, ham or steak, and processed meats such as hot dogs
Margarine, shortening and lard

, While some foods can cause inflammation, certain foods can actually help to reduce inflammation. A Mediterranean-style mainly consists of these inflammation-reducing foods, including:Fruits, such as strawberries, cherries and oranges
Nuts, like almonds and walnuts
Green leafy vegetables, such as spinach or kale which are high in antioxidants
Fatty, Omega-3-rich fish, like salmon, mackerel, tuna and sardines
Whole grains, such as brown rice, quinoa, millet, oatmeal, and flax seed
Olive or canola oil

, The herpes simplex virus requires arginine, an essential amino acid found in many foods, for its metabolism. Experts suggest that reducing the intake of arginine-rich foods from your diet may help control the occurrence and recurrence of cold sores, while also reducing inflammation in existing cold sores..


Arginine-rich foods include chocolate, cola, peas, refined grain cereals, gelatin, peanuts, cashews and beer.

, Research has shown that vitamin C plays a vital role as an antioxidant and promotes immune functions, lowers the risk of developing various diseases, aids in healing, and improves the skin’s natural appearance. Vitamin C can be taken as a dietary supplement (1000 mg/day) or by adding vitamin C-rich foods to your diet. It's very easy to get vitamin-C through food - just eat more fruits and vegetables! Good natural sources of vitamin C are:Sweet red or green peppers
Citrus, such as oranges, pomelo, grapefruit, limes or non-concentrated citrus juices
Spinach, broccoli and brussel sprouts
Berries, including strawberries and raspberries
Tomatoes

, Garlic has antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties that can help speed up the healing process. It is also rich in antioxidants, such as vitamin B6, vitamin C, and manganese, which help boost immunity against infections such as herpes.Garlic is best taken as a raw clove to release alliin. Each clove is approximately one gram. To make it more edible, you can also crush the garlic into a spoonful of honey or olive oil. This natural treatment will help strengthen your immune system and reduce the likelihood of recurrent sores.
For a topical ointment, you can make a paste by crushing two to four cloves of garlic and applying it to your cold sore with a cotton ball for 10 to 15 minutes. This may cause slight stinging and have a sharp smell, but the antiviral properties of garlic help disinfect the site and reduce the healing time.
Note that too much garlic intake may cause bad breath and low blood pressure, so limit your intake to two to four cloves of garlic a day. Garlic should not be used prior to surgery or if you have a bleeding disorder. If you experience side effects such as bloating, fatigue, loss of appetite, muscle aches, vertigo, allergies such as an asthmatic reaction, skin rashes and skin lesions, stop using garlic and see your doctor immediately.

, Zinc is an essential trace mineral found in many foods that you eat on a regular basis to keep your immune system strong. Zinc has antioxidant properties that help protect cells in the body from bacteria and viruses, such as the herpes simplex virus. It’s common to have slightly low levels of zinc, but taking a multivitamin and eating a healthy diet should give you all the zinc you need. The best dietary sources of zinc are oysters, shellfish, red meats, poultry, cheese, shrimp, and crab.You could also try a zinc ointment to sooth the cold sore and speed up the healing process. Simply put a small amount onto a cotton ball and apply to the cold sore for three to five minutes, up to two to three times daily.
Zinc is available as supplement and is in many multivitamin capsules. Speak with your doctor before taking zinc supplements. If you have a digestive problem, such as acid reflux, consider using more easily absorbed forms of zinc such as zinc picolinate, zinc citrate, zinc acetate, zinc glycerate, and zinc monomethionine. The amount of zinc is listed on the product label (usually 30 to 50 mg). To determine the amount to take in supplement form, remember that you can get about 10 to 15 mg from food. The recommended daily allowance for adults is 8 to 11 mg. You should not take high doses of zinc for more than a few days unless your doctor tells you to.

, Lysine is an essential amino acid obtained through dietary sources, such as salmon, tuna, chicken, non-fat milk, parmesan cheese, soybeans, eggs, lentils, sprouts, kidney beans, chickpeas and quinoa. You can also take lysine supplements. People who have more than three cold sores a year should supplement their daily diet with 2000–3000 mg of lysine to reduce the occurrence of cold sores over the long term. Take 1000 mg of lysine three times a day on an empty stomach. Do not take it with milk.Do not take lysine without consulting your healthcare provider, especially if you have high cholesterol or heart disease.

Sleep upright.,
Exercise regularly.,
Use sunblock and lip balm.,
Manage your stress.,
Avoid kissing and oral sex.",How to Get Rid of a Cold Sore with Home Remedies3," If you have a cold sore, prop a few pillows behind your head at bedtime to let gravity help the blisters drain. Otherwise, fluid may settle in sore during the night.The pillow for your head should support the natural curve of your neck and be comfortable. A pillow that's too high can put your neck into a position that causes muscle strain on your back, neck, and shoulders. Choose a pillow that will keep the neck aligned with the chest and lower back.

, Exercising several times a week or - even better - every day can help boost your immune system, thereby reducing the risk of recurring outbreaks of cold sores. Even mild to moderate exercises such as walking, yoga, and stretching have incredible general benefits, in addition to reducing the recovery period and alleviating your cold sore symptoms.Regular exercise also reduces the risk of infection over the long term besides elevating your mood to decrease stress levels. A daily 30 to 45 minute workout with moderate intensity exercises such as brisk walking, jogging and swimming is recommended.
Consider consulting with a physician to help you come up with a personalized exercise plan.

, Moderate sun exposure is beneficial for your immune system due to the increased production of vitamin D. However, one of the most common triggers of cold sores is sunlight, so regularly using sunblock and a lip balm with an SPF (sun protection factor) when you head outside can help reduce the risk of cold sore breakouts. To protect your skin from sun damage, use a non-comedogenic sunscreen with a minimum SPF of 30.Some chemicals in sunscreens may cause allergies, so it's best to consult with a dermatologist to find the sunscreen that’s right for you.

, Cold sore breakouts can increase stress and cause low self-esteem, anxiety and depression. By the same token, stress weakens our immune system and thus makes us more susceptible to developing viral infections, including herpes simplex. Some ways to manage stress include:Try journalling. Set aside time to write down your thoughts every day, even just for 10 to 20 minutes. Keeping a journal can be a great stress reliever in that it helps you to organize your thoughts, offer clarity, and facilitate problem solving.Listening to music is an effective stress reducer in both healthy individuals and people with health problems. Research finds that listening to soothing music can decrease blood pressure, heart rate, and anxiety.
Make time for recreation. Set aside time each week to do things you enjoy and find relaxing, whether it be yoga, reading, cooking, sewing, or what have you.
Try relaxation and meditation techniques, like yoga, deep breathing, and tai chi. Meditation can help reduce blood pressure, chronic pain, anxiety, and lower cholesterol levels, thereby promoting physical and emotional well-being. For a simple meditation exercise, sit with your legs crossed in a quiet environment and take slow, deep breaths for at least five to ten minutes. Try to get at least 5 minutes of meditation time every day to help keep your stress in-check.

, Since the herpes simplex virus is highly contagious, you should avoid kissing or engaging in oral sex during an outbreak (i.e., when you have a cold sore) until it is fully healed. Engaging in oral sex can spread the herpes virus to the genitals and it's possible to contract type-2 herpes simplex from an infected person. Herpes outbreaks are not always obvious and your partner may be contagious without you knowing it.Anyone involved in an ongoing sexual relationship with a partner infected with herpes simplex should get counselling from their healthcare practitioner on how to stay safe.

Avoid touching the sore.,
Wash your hands frequently.,
Do not share food items.,
Use a tissue when coughing or sneezing.,
Keep your toothbrush clean.",How to Get Rid of a Cold Sore with Home Remedies4," When you experience pain due to inflammation, you may want to squeeze or pick at your sore. Touching your cold sore or making skin-to-skin contact with others can cause the viral infection to spread to your fingertips, known as herpes whitlow. Picking at the sore can also slow down the healing process, making it last longer and increasing the risk of the infection spreading to other parts of your body., When you have a cold sore, you should wash your hands carefully before touching your face and making contact with other people, especially babies, as herpes simplex can quickly spread this way.One option is to keep a hand sanitizer or moist wipes with you when heading out of your home or at work so you can keep your hands clean on the go.

, Avoid sharing items such as foods, utensils, towels, lip balm, toothbrushes, and other items that can spread the virus between people when blisters are present. Bacteria and viruses quickly bind to surfaces and are transferred to and from others this way, making your cold sore last longer or making the symptoms worse. Also avoid keeping your utensils and personal items in excessive humidity, as the moist environment allows bacteria to thrive., Use a tissue when you sneeze or cough to avoid spreading germs through the air and avoid letting other bacteria or viruses into your lungs when you inhale.If you don’t have a tissue on hand, sneeze or cough into your elbow rather than cupping your hands over your face, which only spreads germs to your hands.

, Wash your toothbrush before and after every use to keep bacteria from accumulating on the bristles. When you have a cold sore, keep your toothbrush in a separate container if you share your household with others.Never share your toothbrush with anyone as this can spread germs and disease-causing bacteria into your mouth and theirs.
Do not cover toothbrushes or store them in a closed container. Enclosure in a dark, damp environment can promote bacterial growth.
Replace your toothbrush every three to four months, and immediately after you recover from a cold sore, cold, cough or sore throat. For extra precaution, dip your toothbrush in one fluid oz. of hydrogen peroxide or alcohol-based mouth rinse for three to five minutes to kill any remaining bacteria on the bristles.

Don't scratch.,
Take oral antihistamines.,
Ask your doctor about other options.",How to Handle an Eczema Flare Up2," This type of cream can significantly reduce flare-ups, though it may take up to 3 weeks. Your doctor can prescribe a stronger cream than you can get over the counter.The best time to apply the cream is right after you shower. Rub the cream on the affected areas.Make sure you only use the corticosteroid cream as your doctor directs you, as they can have serious side effects if you use them too long on any particular area.

, A lukewarm bath can help relieve the symptoms of eczema, taking the sting out of warm skin. Bath your child with eczema once daily, but not for more than 10 minutes at a time.Add a dash or two of bath oil to the water, and apply a moisturizer or corticosteroid cream afterwards.


Some people find colloidal oatmeal effective. You can find colloidal oatmeal at a drug store. Add it to a warm bath, and sit in the bath 10-15 minutes.When skin is infected, use bath time to soften scabs. Gently rub off the scabs after the bath, as creams should be applied directly to skin.Do not add bubble bath or other such additives to your bath. These will irritate your skin.

, A bleach bath sounds harsh, but it can actually be helpful to kill the bacteria on your skin that cause eczema flare-ups. If your doctor approves it, add a 1/2 cup of household bleach to a lukewarm bath. You or your child can take a bleach bath once a day. Don't soak in the bleach bath for longer than 5-10 minutes.For an infant or toddler bleach bath, add 1 teaspoon of bleach per gallon of water.
Do not apply bleach directly to the skin. This could cause irritation.

, While it can be difficult to isolate what irritants or allergens cause a flare-up, it can be important for dealing with atopic dermatitis. For irritants, everything from bar soap to laundry soap and to perfume and cigarette smoke can cause flare-ups.To isolate what irritants affect the person with atopic dermatitis, try switching out items one at time. For instance, you can start by trying a more natural laundry detergent. If that's not it, you can try switching out the soap used in the bath or shower for another one., If you have atopic dermatitis, you may also be more sensitive to certain allergies, including food and airborne allergens. They may cause normal reactions, as well as causing your eczema to flare up. Try to determine what causes allergic reactions for you by keeping a food journal, so you can track allergic reactions against what you eat.For food allergies, foods such as peanuts, wheat, soy, milk, and eggs can cause allergic reactions, including an eczema flare-up, in children and adults with atopic dermatitis.Some airborne allergens you may be more susceptible to include pet dander, pollen, and dust mites.Ask your doctor about allergy testing if you cannot determine what you or your child may be allergic to.
Some food allergies, especially peanuts, can cause life-threatening reactions. If you believe you or your child is having an allergic reaction to a food, seek medical care immediately.

, Fabrics that scratch the skin, such as wool and even some man-made fibers, can also cause flare-ups. Choose fabrics that don't scratch, and make sure clothing fits properly so it doesn't rub. Natural fibers such as cotton, silk, and bamboo are good choices, but avoid wool.Also, remove tags from clothes or by ones without, as they can rub, as well.Always wash new clothes before wearing them, as they can still have irritating dyes and chemicals in them., Keep your skin moisturized, as it can help keep eczema flare-ups to a minimum. In addition, it can help soften your skin, easing the pain of eczema.Pick a cream that is thick and fragrance-free. Fragrances can irritate skin if you have eczema. In fact, something simple such as petroleum jelly can be effective., Wet therapy is the process of apply wet bandages at night to help soothe eczema. They reduce heat on the skin, block you from scratching, and help moisturize the skin.First apply a corticosteroid cream to the irritated areas of the skin. Use a moisturizer all over the body after the corticosteroid cream. Remember the corticosteroid cream should only be applied to the areas where your eczema is flaring up.Soak cloth towels, clean bandages, or paper towels in water with a small squirt of unscented bath oil. Wrap the wet towels around the skin. Apply them to the areas that are most severe. You may need to completely cover your arms and legs if the eczema is really bad. Try a wet shirt if your chest is irritated.Remove them in the morning. You can also apply them during the day. If you do so, take them off when they are dry.Hold cool, wet towels against the face, but don't wrap them around. Keep them on for 5 minutes., Scratching makes the rash worse. In fact, scratching the rash can cause the skin to thicken in areas and lead to infection.If you have trouble not scratching, cut your nails short or wrap band-aids around your fingertips.

, Oral antihistamines, such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl), can be helpful to reduce the itching associated with flare-ups. Because they can cause drowsiness, take them before bed., If your atopic dermatitis doesn't respond to at-home treatments, she may recommend other topical or oral treatments. She may also recommend a referral to a dermatologist (skin specialist), who can prescribe other medications.If your skin becomes infected, or you develop open sores from scratching, your doctor will likely prescribe antibiotics.
Your doctor may prescribe oral or injected corticosteroids. These suppress inflammation by mimicking the natural effects of your body's hormones in greater doses. They have the possibility of serious side effects and are not recommended for mild cases or long-term use.Another option is skin-repairing creams. A certain class of drugs called calcineurin inhibitors (e.g., tacrolimus, pimecrolimus) alter your immune system when applied to the skin and help reduce atopic dermatitis flare-ups. They can cause serious side effects, so they are usually reserved only for severe cases."

Scratching can make the rash worse, and possibly introduce infection., Because contact dermatitis is an allergic reaction, you can take an over-the-counter oral antihistamine pill, such as loratadine or cetirizine. Take these pills once a day to help manage symptoms., Just like atopic dermatitis, allergens and irritants can cause flare-ups, even if you inhale them or eat them.Try changing out your soaps and detergents to figure out what bothers you, and keep a food journal so you can make connections between what you eat and flare-ups.


Remember that sometimes more than one factor may be causing your dermatitis. You may be affected by both your make-up and your sunscreen. In addition, sometimes the sun plays a factor, causing dermatitis in combination with another irritant., One way to help determine the source of your contact dermatitis is to do a patch test. Your doctor will apply patches of certain allergens and irritants to your skin, which you wear for 48 hours. When you go back to the doctor, she'll determine which ones you've reacted to, which can help you avoid allergens in the future., Once you figure out what causes your contact dermatitis, you will need to avoid that irritant in the future. For instance, if a particular detergent or soap causes your eczema, you will need to switch to other brands, preferably ones that are natural and fragrance-free., Moisturized skin is less likely to develop a flare-up. Additionally, moisturizers can help relieve the pain of flare-ups by softening cracked skin.Apply a thick moisturizer several times a day to your body.

, Like atopic dermatitis, bad flare-ups of contact dermatitis can be treated with wet wrappings. Apply wet bandages or cloth towels over moisturizers at nighttime to help soothe the area., Just like with atopic dermatitis, a steroid cream can help relieve the symptoms of contact dermatitis. Apply this cream to the affected area after you bathe or at nighttime., If your reaction is particularly severe, ask your doctor about corticosteroid pills. These pills can help relieve inflammation on your body.You may also need a round of antibiotics if your rash becomes infected."

If you suspect that you have some form of eczema, see a doctor to get your condition diagnosed and treated. You may have eczema if you notice any of the following symptoms on your hands or fingers:Redness
Itching
Pain
Extreme dryness
Cracks
Blisters;
, Irritant contact dermatitis is the most common form of hand eczema. This form of eczema is caused by frequent and prolonged exposure to substances that irritate the skin. These irritating products may be almost anything that makes frequent contact with the skin, including cleaning agents, chemicals, food, metal, plastic, and even water. Symptoms of this type of eczema include:chapping and redness on the fingertips and in the webbed areas between your fingers
stinging and burning when you make contact with irritants

, Some people suffer from a form of eczema called allergic contact dermatitis. In this case, the eczema is caused by an allergy to a substance such as a soap, dye, fragrance, rubber, or even a plant. Symptoms of this type of eczema are often concentrated on the inside of the hands and fingertips, but they can appear anywhere on the hands. Symptoms include:blistering, itchiness, swelling, and redness soon after exposure to the allergen
crusting, scaling, and cracking of the skin
darkening and/or thickening of the skin after prolonged exposure to the allergen

, Hand eczema caused by atopic dermatitis is more common in children than in adults, but adults can still suffer from this condition. If you have symptoms of eczema on other parts of your body as well as on your hands, atopic dermatitis might be causing your hand eczema. Symptoms of atopic dermatitis include:extreme itchiness that lasts for days or weeks

Eczema generally shows up during childhood and will persist until treated, so you may have had these patches for a long time.The most common places to find these discolored patches include:on the insides of your elbows
on the backs of your knees
on your face, especially on your cheeks
behind your ears
on your buttocks
on your hands and feet
on your ankles and wrists
on your eyelids
on your scalp;
, These bumps often appear on the face and scalp of people who have eczema. This condition on the face and scalp is also called ""cradle cap,"" especially on infants. Avoid scratching the bumps because this will cause oozing and crusting. Eczema on the face and scalp is more common in infants, but they can be present in children and adults as well. Some people compare these bumps to scaly pimples in appearance., Itchiness is a common symptom of eczema and the itching may get worse at night. Do your best to avoid scratching your skin because it will make matters worse and may lead to swelling and increased sensitivity.When this condition worsens, it can cause redness and swelling.You may also feel a burning sensation, particularly when you scratch the patches in an attempt to relieve the itching sensation.
You should avoid scratching because it can cause cracks in your skin and trigger infection.

, Sometimes the discolored eczema patches on your skin may ooze or break open from scratching and then crust over. This is common in eczema, but it is a serious hazard to your health. Any broken skin resulting from eczema puts you at a higher risk of acquiring a virus or bacterial infections, so it is important to get these wounds treated., Eczema causes patches of your skin to take on a leathery or scaly texture. The scaly or leathery texture is caused by chronic scratching or rubbing of the reddened patches of your skin. Touch your skin to see if the texture has changed. If it feels leathery or scaly, then it may be the result of eczema.These scaly patches might also begin to peel. When they do, your skin will look how it does after you get a sunburn.

Get diagnosed by a medical doctor.,
Identify the symptoms of spongiotic dermatitis.,
Be aware of possible irritants and risk factors.",How to Ease the Symptoms of Spongiotic Dermatitis1," If you’re experiencing any of the symptoms of spongiotic dermatitis, it’s important to get diagnosed with the condition by a medical doctor. She will help you take steps to treat the condition either through prevention and home remedies or medication.;
, The symptoms of spongiotic dermatitis vary widely from person to person, but there are some general signs you can look for to help identify the condition. Knowing these signs may make it easier to relieve your symptoms at home. Typical symptoms of spongiotic dermatitis include:severe itching, especially at night
red to brownish-gray patches on the skin
small, raised bumps that may contain fluid and crust over when scratched
thickened, cracked, dry, and scaly skin
raw, sensitive, and swollen skin that occurs as a result of scratching
The most common place for spongiotic dermatitis to occur is on the chest, stomach, and buttocks. It can spread from these areas to other parts of the body., There are some irritants and risk factors that can make you more prone to a flare-up of spongiotic dermatitis. Being aware of these will help you take the proper steps to prevent the condition.


Working with metals such as nickel, solvents, or cleaning supplies, can increase your risk of spongiotic dermatitis.Certain health conditions including congestive heart failure, Parkinson's disease, and HIV/AIDS can also make you more prone to spongiotic dermatitis.Spongiotic dermatitis can flare up if you have sensitive skin and/ or use very harsh and strong soaps that can cause an allergic reaction on the skin.

Soften the skin with hot water.,
Buff the wart.,
Apply an acid treatment.,
Repeat treatment until the wart is gone.",How to Pumice a Wart1," Most wart removal methods require you to soften the skin around the wart before applying any other treatment. This makes the calloused area easier to remove. Start by soaking the wart and surrounding areas in a hot water bath for ten to fifteen minutes prior to removal., While the calloused skin surrounding the wart is still soft from soaking, use a pumice stone or another abrasive surface like an emery board to file down the dead skin. Use a gentle scrubbing or back-and-forth motion to take off the top, whitish layer of skin.Do not pumice too hard or too much. The pumice should not hurt, and you should stop once you buff away the dead skin. Stop if you feel any pain, irritation, or discomfort.
Do not share a pumice stone with others, as this could lead to infection.

, Pumicing, alone, will not get rid of a wart. After pumicing, apply a salicylic acid treatment formulated especially for wart removal. These are available over the counter in both liquid and patch form from most pharmacies and drug stores.If you use a liquid treatment, you may opt to apply a bandage after you apply the treatment to keep the area covered and the acid contained.

, Treating a wart by pumicing and applying acid can take time. Repeat the treatment daily until the wart has disappeared. If the wart is not gone after 12 weeks, contact your doctor to see if continuing treatment is advised."

Use a corticosteroid cream.,
Don't scratch.,
Avoid water.,
Avoid certain types of metals and other irritants.,
Use calamine lotion.,
Try a witch hazel soak.,
Try techniques to help you relax.,
Talk to your doctor about immune-suppressing creams or pills.,
Ask about phototherapy.",How to Handle an Eczema Flare Up4," This is especially helpful for dyshidrotic eczema, which tends to occur on the hands and feet. Choose a moisturizing cream formulated for hands or feet.


Petroleum jelly can also help keep your skin moisturized.
You may also be able to find a barrier cream, such as Tetrix, that can help reduce your exposure to skin irritants. This can be helpful if you handle irritating substances, such as water, cement, or nickel, during your work.

, Corticosteroid creams are effective for pretty much any kind of eczema. Your doctor can prescribe you one that will help treat your flare-up.Use the cream after bathing, or try putting it on before you go to sleep. In fact, you can apply it at night and then put on cotton gloves, which will keep the cream on your hands., Scratching makes the rash worse. In addition, bursting the blisters also makes the rash worse. If you can let them heal instead of bursting them, your skin will likely heal faster., Unlike other types of eczema, water can irritate this rash. Try to keep your hands out of water as much as possible.Sweating can also contribute to flare-ups. If you sweat a lot, your doctor may prescribe a treatment for this to help your eczema.
Additionally, make sure to dry your hands thoroughly when you do get them wet.

, Metals such as nickel, chromium, and cobalt may also cause flare ups. You may be exposed to these metals if you work with concrete.Other chemicals from work or environmental exposure may also cause a flare-up.


To keep your hands from this irritant, try wearing gloves.

, Calamine lotion can help sooth your rash. It can also calm the itching.You can also apply this lotion after washing your hands or bathing.

, You can find witch hazel at the drug store, usually near the rubbing alcohol. Witch hazel is an astringent. Soaking your hands in a bath of witch hazel can provide you with some relief and help the healing process., This type of eczema can flare up when you're stressed out. Try to keep your stress levels down by incorporating calming routines into your life, such as a daily meditation regiment.Identify what causes you stress. Whether it's your job or even the evening news, identifying what makes you stressed out is the first step in dealing with it. Avoid or change what you can, such as skipping the news, and try to change your attitude about the rest.Try meditation. One simple way to meditate is pick a mantra. A mantra can be any simple phrase that calms you, such as ""Life is good,"" or even just ""om."" Close your eyes, and repeat the phrase, letting your mind fill up with it. Continue until you feel calmer., Because this type of eczema is an immune response, immune-suppressing creams or pills can be effective. Some drugs in this class are tacrolimus and pimecrolimus.Your doctor will decide whether creams or oral treatment will be more effective for you.

, This type of light treatment can help decrease the severity of a flare-up, especially when used in combination with medications to help you absorb the ultraviolet light used.Usually, this treatment is only used when others do not work."

Determine what type of eczema you're experiencing.",How to Treat Eczema Naturally," Triggers are different for everyone. One person can be sensitive to wool while another is sensitive to a chemical in perfume. Since we don't really know what causes an individual to have a flare-up of their eczema, you will have to try to figure these out. You can try a variation of a food diary by writing down the products you use and see what happens when you eliminate one.


It may take a bit of work to figure out what affects you, so many people just go all-natural and all-organic. Then they begin to add back products to see if the new products affect their eczema.;
, Wear loose clothing wherever possible and avoid items made from itchy, scratchy fabrics like wool. Smooth-textured clothing made from cotton, silk and bamboo are the least irritating on your skin.Also be wary of your washing detergent. It may be leaving a slight residue on your clothes that's contributing to eczema flare-ups. Try using a natural washing powder, or simply switch to a different brand.


When washing your clothes, use less detergent than what is recommended on the label. Most laundry detergent products are concentrated, which means that they are stronger. Of course, this can irritate your skin. Try using a quarter of what is recommended (your laundry will come out cleaner as well).Try double-rinsing your laundry. Anything that comes in contact with your skin should be double rinsed (e.g. clothing, bedding, towels). Advanced washing machine models may have an option that is called double/extra rinse. This gives your load an additional rinse to remove any detergent residue that may cause irritation.For more basic models without this feature, simply repeat the rinse cycle (some machines will require you to turn back the knob to rinse). Note that doing this can use more water. Cold rinse is perfectly fine.
When exercising, wear proper sports clothing designed to keep your skin cool. This will prevent you from sweating excessively, which can aggravate eczema., Irritants like soaps and detergents, shampoos, dishwashing liquids, disinfectants and any product with added perfumes can irritate your skin. Try using natural vegetable based soaps and cleaning agents instead.Avoid any products containing sodium lauryl sulfate and parabens. These are commonly found in hygiene products and are known to irritate and dry the skin. Sodium lauryl sulfate also breaks down your skin's natural proteins, making skin more vulnerable to outside contaminants. Medical studies have linked parabens to endocrine disruption, cancer, and reproductive problems., Dry air in your bedroom and home can exacerbate skin conditions such as eczema, causing the skin to become dehydrated and flaky. You can remedy this situation by investing in an air humidifier which will add moisture to the air and to your skin. Portable home humidifiers, along with humidifiers you can attach to a furnace, are easily available and can be found in a range of styles and price ranges.It is also possible to humidify the air in a room without buying a humidifier. House plants naturally increase the amount of moisture in the air through a process known as transpiration. The Boston Fern is a popular natural humidifier., Allergy causing agents like dust mites, pet dander, seasonal pollens, molds and dandruff are all eczema triggers. Use a vacuum cleaner with a good filter and vacuum often.Try to avoid bacteria, fungi and viruses. People that are obviously sick should also be avoided, since this could be contributing to your eczema.

, Eczema and other skin conditions have been strongly linked to stress, both psychological and physical, so taking some time out to work on stress-relief can be extremely beneficial. Try to do whatever relaxes you: visualization techniques, hypnotherapy, meditation, yoga, listening to music, or painting.


Set aside time for yourself every day to relax and unwind. While the exact cause of eczema is unknown, stress has been shown to make eczema worse., Bathing too often can actually strip moisture from the skin and make eczema worse. Try to limit your baths and showers to every 1 to 2 days if possible. Avoid steamy or cold showers and limit each session to 15 to 20 minutes, tops. Use a clean, dry towel to gently pat yourself dry.Make sure to moisturize after the shower, preferably while your skin is still damp as this locks in more moisture. Use moisturizers with no additives and which are based on coconut oil, olive oil, shea butter, avocado or castor oil. Be aware that while these oils tend to be better tolerated by people with eczema, everyone is different and you may have to experiment to find what works best for you.
Try not to stay in the tub for too long. Sometimes the water can wither your skin. You do not want your eczema to be disturbed, since disturbed skin results in higher chance of the eczema to itch.

, Use aloe from the actual plant, rather than purchasing an aloe product. Snap off a leaf and squeeze out the clear, gel-like substance. Smear this gel over the skin affected by eczema and leave to soak in. You can store the leaf in the refrigerator for multiple uses. Pure aloe vera is not associated with any negative side effects when used topically, so it is safe to use as often as necessary.The gel-like sap from the Aloe vera plant has been used for thousands of years as a moisturizing and anti-inflammatory treatment.Many people have found it effective in the treatment of eczema, as it soothes itching and moisturizes the dry, flaky skin.

, You can apply calendula liberally all over your skin, since there are no known side effects when applied topically, or you can mix it with aloe vera gel before rubbing over the skin. Calendula is a marigold-like flower whose extract is commonly used in skin lotions and salves to reduce pain and inflammation.Many calendula products, such as soaps, oils, lotions, salves and creams can be found at health food stores. These products are preferable to those found in drug stores, since they usually contain a higher percentage of pure calendula and less potentially irritating ingredients.

, Fill an old cotton sock or nylon knee-high sock with organic steel-rolled oats and tie it over the tap of your bathtub, letting the water run through the oats. Oats contain anti-inflammatory and anti-itching compounds that can be very soothing.Try oatmeal paste. All you have to do is just mix some oatmeal and water together until it forms a paste. Then apply it directly to your eczema!
Stinging nettle also works the same way and can be used just like oats in the tub. It's believed that they act to interrupt the body's pain and itch signals., Chamomile is a popular natural treatment for eczema, as it is said to soothe itchiness and calm inflammation. You can make chamomile tea by brewing dried chamomile flowers in boiling water for approximately 15 minutes. Strain the flowers and allow the tea to cool slightly. Then, make a warm compress by soaking a clean cloth in the chamomile, wringing out the excess moisture. Press it against the affected skin for 10-15 minutes.


You can also massage the oils directly onto the skin or add a few drops to a warm bath. But be aware that some people develop on allergic reaction to chamomile, so you may want to test it on a small patch of skin before using., Organic cold pressed virgin coconut oil is often used as a moisturizer which many eczema sufferers claim to be far more effective than expensive store bought creams. It can be found in health food stores, online and in select supermarkets. Apply the oil (which looks like a solid but quickly melts) on eczema patches all over the body and allow the oil to sink in.


Cold pressed means that the oil was processed at temperatures below 116 degrees, allowing all of the oil's nutrients, enzymes and minerals to be preserved.

, Sweet almond oil is often used in the treatment of eczema as it contains ursolic and oleic acids, which are believed to reduce inflammation and help repair the skin. It can be applied liberally all over the body as a moisturizer, or it can be spread all over the skin before baths and showers, creating a barrier that protects the skin from the drying effects of hot water., Just cut the lemon in half and put that baby right on your eczema. You should see some changes. Expect a burning sensation. It only burns when you scratch it. It burns because the lemon is removing the inflammation trapped under your skin. The burning mostly occurs when you have broken skin on the eczema.

, Avoid processed foods as much as possible. If you can, go organic and as natural as you can. In other words, choose fresh fruit and vegetables, cook your own beans and legumes, snack on nuts, berries, seeds, fruit and vegetables and minimize the red meat in your diet.


Make sure you get lots of sources of omega-3 oils (fish, leafy green vegetables) to help keep your skin moist and soft.

, Cow's milk is one of the most common dietary trigger for eczema,so it is worth cutting it out of your diet (at least temporarily) to see if you notice an improvement. Cow's milk can be quite acidic and is often filled with hormones and chemicals, which may be aggravating your eczema. Try eliminating all cow's milk for at least two weeks and see if you notice any difference.


There are many, many substitutes for cow's milk, so don't worry about having to drink your coffee black. Goat, sheep and buffalo milk are all great creamy alternatives.
If you want a non-animal substitute you can always go for soy, hazelnut, almond, oat, or rice milk., Wheat is also believed to be a common dietary trigger for eczema.If possible, eliminate gluten from your diet as it may be triggering your skin condition. Cut out bread, pasta, cereals and other processed, carbohydrate rich foods.

, Try keeping a diet diary. Every day, write down everything you eat and try to notice any changes in your symptoms when you eat the food. Sometimes, you may notice something right away or within a few hours. You should begin to notice some patterns with certain foods. Then, eliminate those foods from your diet for a minimum of 2 weeks (better if you can eliminate the food for 4-6 weeks) and see if there is any change in your skin.


In addition to dairy and wheat, eczema may also triggered by soy, eggs, nuts, and seeds.If you notice that these foods aggravate your eczema, avoid them.

, There are plenty of dietary supplements you can which may help reduce eczema symptoms. Some of the best ones include:



Fatty Acids: Fatty acids have been shown to relieve dry skin and reduce inflammation, making them effective for treating eczema. Use Omega-3s which are anti-inflammatory. Take the DHA and EPA forms of this. Omega-6s can be pro-flammatory. One study showed that 1.8 grams of EPA (an Omega-3 fatty acid) taken daily for 12 weeks reduced eczema.Vitamins A, D and E: These help the skin to retain hydration, improve its texture, boost collagen production and protect it from free radicals.

Gamma-linolenic acid: This is a type of fatty acid found in evening primrose oil, borage oil and blackcurrant oil. It is believed to help relieve skin inflammation and to correct the balance of lipids in the skin.Zinc: is an essential mineral that has many functions in our body. Studies show mixed results, but many with eczema report that it improves when taking zinc. It certainly can't hurt if you don't go over the upper limit (40 milligrams).Note that taking zinc can cause a copper deficiency. You may need to begin supplementing with a small dose of copper as well.

, Eczema is actually a term for a group of conditions where the skin is inflamed and irritated. All types of Eczema have itchiness as a symptom. Scratching these areas leads to “weeping” sores and the crustiness and scaliness that is so often seen in the atopic dermatitis form of eczema.


While the direct cause of eczema is unknown,stress has been shown to make eczema worse. Eczema commonly starts in infancy or childhood, though it does start in some people after the age of 30.

, The most common symptoms of eczema are itching, dry and scaling skin and rashes on the face, behind the knees, on the inside of the elbows and on both hands and feet. In adults, though it only happens in about 10% of eczema patients, the rash most often appears in the elbow and knee crease and on the nape of the neck.In infants, eczema generally starts as a rash usually on the scalp (cradle cap) and face (especially the cheeks) and can begin when the baby is 2-3 months old. In children between 2 years of age and puberty, the rash usually begins in the elbow creases of the arms and/or the back of the knees., While inflammation and itchiness is a common symptom, you can differentiate between eczemas depending on the location or type of inflammation.


If you're experiencing allergic or contact eczema, this could be a response to touching some substance. You'll notice inflammation on your skin where the clothing, jewelry, or substance came into contact.
If you notice eczema on your palms and soles or have blisters filled with clear liquid, you probably have dyshidrotic eczema.
If you experience one or more coin-shaped patches of inflamed skin mainly along your arms, lower legs and buttocks, you have nummular eczema.
If the skin on your scalp and face becomes yellowish, oily, or scaly, you most likely have Seborrheic dermatitis.

See a professional.",How to Decrease Eczema Flare Ups1," This could be dry skin, itching, redness, rashes, scaly skin, oozing, crusting, swelling, and/or dark colored patches of skin.Make an appointment to see your doctor to make sure you don’t have any complications or related conditions. They can also prescribe a treatment plan for your individual symptoms. In the meantime, however, there are steps you can take to decrease your flare ups.;
, Have you just bought a new shower gel? Does your new job require to wash your hands more than you usually would? If nothing has changed recently in your life that you think could have caused a flare up, it may be that some of the ingredients in products you use every day have changed.


Take a thorough look through all of your household items, and see if at least one of them could be causing or exacerbating your eczema. Does anything make it better or worse if you eliminate something, like your lotion or your face wash?

, If your flare up is located on a patch of skin covered by clothing, there is a good chance that might be the cause. If you find that clothing is causing eczema because of the way it is washed, you only need to change your laundry detergent. If it is due to the fabrics and materials themselves, you may need to get rid of that article of clothing.


Next time you wash your clothes, make sure they are rinsed of detergent completely. If you still have skin problems, the problem could be with a certain article of clothing.The rivets or buttons may be giving you eczema. Check clothing for rivets or snaps that may contain nickel.
Your skin may have a sensitivity or allergy to a blend of fabric. If changing detergents did not help, you may need to quit wearing that article of clothing.

, Have you been exposed to abnormal levels of poor air quality, bacteria and viruses, heat or humidity, chemicals, or dust and pollen? Have you been sweating or had higher levels of stress than normal? Are you in the midst of a season change? If any of these are true, it is possible that returning to a normal lifestyle will allow your eczema to subside., Eczema is a symptom of some food allergies, such as dairy, nuts, and shellfish. If you have persistent eczema with no identifiable environmental risk factors, see a doctor. They will be able to test you for food allergies and determine if that is the cause of your eczema., You should not hesitate in making an appointment with an allergist or dermatologist if your eczema is negatively affecting your life. A professional will be able to help you determine what's causing your eczema and how you can treat it.

Look for common symptoms.,
Know the causes of eczema.,
Determine your risk factors.,
Avoid hair and skin care products that contain alcohol.,
Do not scratch itchy patches.,
Expect eczema to return.",How to Heal Scalp Eczema1," Scalp eczema can cause problems for your scalp or any affected areas of your skin. Common symptoms include flaky skin (dandruff), itching, red skin, scaliness or crusting of the skin, greasy patches, and hair loss.Inflammation leads to red patches and high fatty acid content, which can make the skin greasy and yellow in some people.In infants, it is common in the scalp and can present as red, dry scaly plaques, or in more severe cases as thick white or greasy yellow scales.
Other skin diseases such as fungal infection, psoriasis, dermatitis, and lupus may resemble scalp eczema. However, these differ based on the location and layers of the skin involved.If you aren’t sure whether your symptoms match those of scalp eczema, see your doctor. S/he can help you determine the cause of your symptoms and whether they are severe enough to require treatment.;
, In addition to decreased oils and moisture present, doctors believe that a certain kind of yeast, Malassezia furfur, has a role in causing seborrheic eczema.Malassezia yeast is usually present on the outer surface of the skin. In those with scalp eczema, this yeast invades the superficial layers of skin and secretes substances that increase fatty acid production. This leads to inflammation and enhances production and dryness of skin, which causes the skin to flake.


If your eczema is atopic, meaning that your family has a tendency to develop eczema, yeast may not be the culprit. Doctors believe that many people with atopic eczema have a faulty skin barrier due to a changed gene within the skin’s structural proteins., While doctors are not certain why some people develop seborrheic eczema, and others don’t, there do appear to be some factors that increase your risk, including:Being overweight or obese
Fatigue
Environmental factors (such as dry weather)
Stress
Other skin issues (such as acne)
Certain medical conditions, including stroke, HIV, Parkinson’s disease, or head injury

, Alcohol removes protective oils from the skin surface, causing the scalp to dry out. This can make the flaking and itching worse and may be a contributing cause of seborrheic eczema.Be gentle with washing your skin and scalp. Do not scrub! Gently massage your skin with your fingers when washing your hair. The goal is to clean your hair without stripping the oils from your scalp.

, Though it can be difficult to avoid scratching when a part of your body feels dry and itchy, you should try not to scratch the affected areas because the skin can become irritated and bleed.


You could even cause a secondary infection if you scratch excessively.

, It is unlikely that you will be able to completely “cure” your disease with an effective treatment. Scalp eczema appears and then disappears when it is treated. However, it usually comes back and will require continuous treatment. Luckily, many of the treatments can be continued for long periods."

Your doctor can help you decide on the best course of treatment and may even refer you to a specialist if your hand eczema is severe. , To determine the cause of your eczema, your doctor can have your skin patch tested to check for possible allergies. If you suspect that your hand eczema might be caused by an allergen, talk to your doctor about getting patch tested. The results of the patch test will help you to know what substance or substances are causing your eczema so that you can avoid them.During the patch test, your doctor will apply a substance to a patch and apply the patch (or patches) to your skin to determine which ones are causing your eczema. The test itself will not hurt, but it may cause some pain and irritation due to the substances and how they react with your skin.Nickel is a common irritant that can cause eczema flare-ups. Patch-testing can check for a nickel allergy.
It may also be helpful to compile a list of the products you use on or near your hands on a regular basis. This list may include soaps, moisturizers, cleaning products, and any special substances that you may come into contact as part of your work or home routines.

, Your doctor may recommend that you use a 1% hydrocortisone ointment to help treat your eczema. This ointment is available over the counter and by prescription. Ask your doctor for recommendations if you are not sure what to look for.


Most hydrocortisone ointments are meant to be applied while skin is still damp, such as after a shower or after washing your hands. Make sure to follow the product instructions for the hydrocortisone ointment that your doctor recommends.Stronger topical corticosteroids may be needed in some cases as well, but will require a prescription from your doctor. , Eczema often causes extreme itchiness, but it is important that you do not scratch your hands to relieve the itching. Scratching can cause eczema to get worse and you may also break the skin in the process, which can lead to infections. If your hands are itchy, use a cold compress to soothe them instead.To make a cold compress, wrap a hand towel or a paper towel around an ice pack or plastic bag filled with ice.
You can also try keeping your nails trimmed and filed to help prevent yourself from scratching and making your eczema worse., In some cases, over the counter oral antihistamines can help treat occasional hand eczema. Keep in mind that these drugs may cause drowsiness, so you might not want to take them during the day or when you have lots of things to do. Ask your doctor if taking over the counter oral antihistamines might be a good solution to your hand eczema., Eczema can sometimes cause infections due to the openings caused by blisters, cracks, and lesions on your skin. If your skin is red, hot, swollen, and/or painful or if it does not respond to eczema treatments, you might have an infection. Be sure to ask your doctor if you might need an antibiotic to treat an infection caused by your eczema.Do not take antibiotics unless your doctor prescribes them. Using antibiotics when they are not needed can make them less effective when you do need them.
Take the full round of antibiotics that your doctor prescribes. Even if your infection seem to be cured, the infection may come back and be more difficult to treat if you do not take the full prescription., In some cases, hand eczema might not respond to over-the-counter topical creams and making lifestyle changes. In cases like these, your doctor may need to prescribe a systemic (rather than topical) corticosteroid or an immunosuppressant drug. These options should not be considered until you have tried to control your eczema by other means because the drugs may have negative side effects., If your eczema does not respond to any of the other treatment options, you may consider talking to your doctor about a prescription topical immunomodulator cream. Elidel and Protopic are prescription creams that have been approved by the FDA to treat eczema. These drugs change the way that your immune system responds to certain substances, so they may help if nothing else works.


These creams are usually safe, but may have severe side effects in rare cases, so they should be reserved as a last resort., Some skin diseases, including eczema, respond well to phototherapy, or exposure to controlled ultraviolet light. It is best used after traditional topical approaches have failed, but before systemic approaches.The treatment is effective in 60-70% of patients, but may take several months of consistent treatment before improvement is seen."

Switch to a different type of household cleaner, ask someone else to handle the food that is causing your eczema, or wear gloves to create a barrier between your hands and the substance., Eczema of the hands may also be caused by dyes and perfumes in soaps and moisturizers. Steer clear of any soaps and moisturizers that include artificial fragrances or colors. Look for products meant for sensitive skin or all natural products. If you know that a certain soap or moisturizer causes your eczema to flare up, do not use it.Consider using plain petroleum jelly in lieu of a moisturizer; it is less likely to cause a reaction and may even be more effective at moisturizing.Don’t wash your hands too frequently. While it is important to remove irritants from your hands if you are exposed, frequent hand washing may cause your eczema to get worse. Avoid washing your hands except when they are soiled., Hands that are often wet or damp are at increased risk for hand eczema. If you spend a lot of time washing dishes by hand or doing other things that keep your hands wet, try to cut back on these activities or reduce hand wetness any way that you can.For example, you could use a dishwasher to wash dishes instead of hand washing them or at least wear gloves to keep your hands dry while you are washing dishes.


Dry your hands immediately after washing them or getting them wet. Make sure that they are completely dry.
Take shorter showers to reduce the amount of time that your hands are wet., A good moisturizer is essential to preventing eczema flare-ups. Make sure that you use a moisturizer that does not irritate your skin. Ointments are usually the best options for hand eczema, they moisturize better and cause less stinging and burning when applied to irritated skin. Keep a small bottle of moisturizer with you at all times to make sure that your hands are always well moisturized. Moisturize your hands anytime that you wash them or whenever they begin to feel dry.You may want to ask your doctor about a prescription moisture barrier such as Tetrix.This can be far more effective than store-bought moisturizers.

, If you cannot avoid using chemicals and other substances that irritate your hands, get some cotton lined rubber gloves to protect your hands from exposure to these substances. Wear the gloves any time that you will be exposed to the substances that irritate your hand.


Wash the gloves with perfume and dye free soap when they need it. Turn them inside out and hang them up to dry completely before using them again.If you need the gloves for both cleaning and cooking, make sure that you have separate pairs for these activities.

, Rings can cause substances that make your eczema worse to get trapped right next to your skin. As a result, you may have more flare ups in the areas under and around your rings. Try to remember to remove your rings before exposure to your triggers and before washing or moisturizing your hands., Using a highly diluted solution of bleach and water may help to reduce the amount of bacteria on your hands, which helps some people with their eczema. Of course, if bleach is an eczema trigger for you, then you should not try this treatment. Talk to your doctor before you decide to incorporate bleach hand soaks into your routine.Remember that the bleach you use in a hand soak should be diluted in plenty of water. Only use about 1/2 teaspoon per gallon of water.
Be careful not to get the bleach on your clothes, carpet, or anywhere else that it might harm the color., In some cases, eczema flare-ups may be caused or intensified by stress. To help eliminate this factor, make sure that you incorporate relaxation techniques into your daily life. Exercise daily and set aside some time each day to relax. Some relaxing activities you might try include practicing yoga, doing deep breathing exercises, or meditating."

Make an appointment with your doctor.,
See an allergist and get tested for allergies if necessary.,
Seek immediate medical attention in severe situations.",How to Know if You Have Eczema2," If you have noticed symptoms of eczema, then it is important to make an appointment with your doctor to get a diagnosis. Your doctor will perform a thorough health history to determine if anything else might be causing your symptoms.Tell your doctor about your symptoms including:when you first started to have the symptoms
whether you have undergone any treatments for skin problems in the past
any recent stress you have been dealing with
any cosmetics that irritate your skin
any scented soaps, lotions, or detergents that irritate your skin
any history of asthma or allergies

, After talking to you and examining your skin, your doctor may decide to refer you to an allergist. An allergist can perform allergy tests to determine if an allergen may be causing your symptoms. If no allergen is found, then your doctor may try a treatment for eczema to see if it helps. If your skin condition improves, then that will confirm that you have eczema.Some common allergy tests include:


RAST testing. RAST testing, or radioallergosorbent testing, is a low risk test to determine allergies. To conduct this test, the immunologist draws blood from the patient. Then, the suspected allergen (such as peanut protein, pet dander, etc.) is combined with the patient’s blood in a lab. After that, radiolabeled IgE human antibody is added to the patient’s blood. The antibodies will combine to the allergen. The severity of the response indicates the severity of the allergy.Skin prick test. Skin prick tests are performed under the supervision of a skilled allergist and immunologist. Since they will be exposing you to a potential allergen, anaphylaxis is possible. During the test, you will receive small doses of what you are allergic to (pollen, mold, dander, etc.) either via shots or placed under the tongue., Sometimes eczema can have severe side effects that require immediate medical treatment. Often, these side effects are the result of an infection due to broken skin. If you have been dealing with eczema on your own for a while, then you should see a doctor as soon as you can. You should also seek immediate medical attention if you:are losing sleep as a result of your eczema or you cannot concentrate because of the itching
are experiencing pain on your skin
think you might have an infection because you have noticed pus, yellow scabs, and/or red streaks
you are having trouble seeing because patches on your eyelids

Understand that age plays a factor.,
Watch out for triggers.,
Keep your environment in mind.,
Be aware that stress can bring on an eczema outbreak.",How to Know if You Have Eczema3," Infants and children are more prone to developing eczema than adults. The condition may clear up by the time a child reaches adolescence or it may only flare up now and then.However, it is good to remember that a person of any age can develop this skin condition, it just happens to be more prevalent in younger children.One study found that about 70% of eczema cases resolve by adolescence., You may be able to reduce the severity of your eczema by knowing what triggers it and taking steps to prevent flare ups whenever possible. While triggers will be different for everyone, some of the most common triggers of eczema include strong soaps or detergents, synthetic clothing, and perfume. Extreme temperatures, like very hot or very cold days, can also cause eczema.Food can also trigger eczema, particularly in children. Common foods that children are allergic to and may cause eczema include eggs, peanuts, soy, milk, wheat, and fish.

, Individuals are also more likely to develop this condition if they live in urban areas with high level of pollutants. Some allergens when inhaled such as molds, dusts, pollen, pet dander or cigarette smoke can aggravate the condition. Do your best to avoid exposure to cigarette smoke and other environmental irritants.Here are some factors that might also exacerbate eczema in individuals:


Wool or synthetic clothing
Specific soaps, detergents, antiperspirants, and chemicals
Preservatives in topically applied products
Perfumed products
Latex
Dust mites
Tree and grass pollen
A microbial infection or colonization
Temperature extremes
Humidity
Hard water
Cooking with gas
Proximity to road traffic, Stress may compromise the immune system. It is believed that immunosuppressed individuals are prone and may easily get diseases due to overworking or lack of rest. One of these diseases is eczema. Try your best to manage stress and reduce your risk of having stress-related flare-ups.Some good ways to reduce stress include:


doing deep breathing exercises
practicing yoga, meditation, or tai chi
regular exercise, such as walking, swimming, or biking
engaging in hobbies, such as knitting, reading, or cooking

Identify what triggers your spongiotic dermatitis.,
Don’t scratch.,
Keep your skin well hydrated to reduce irritation.,
Stay hydrated by drinking water.,
Apply a cold compress to relieve itching and inflammation.,
Protect your skin.,
Apply calamine lotion or anti-itch cream.,
Take over-the-counter antihistamines to reduce your inflammation and itching.,
Use over-the-counter corticosteroid creams to help reduce itching and inflammation.",How to Ease the Symptoms of Spongiotic Dermatitis2," This skin condition often flares up because of a specific irritant. Knowing what triggers your spongiotic dermatitis can help you prevent and relieve it.


The trigger could be an allergen, food allergy, cosmetic, environmental factor, insect bite, or harsh soap or detergent.
If you suspect a specific trigger, try to limit your exposure to it and see if it relieves your symptoms.
Certain external factors can worsen spongiotic dermatitis including dry skin from taking baths or showers that are too hot, stress, sweat, wearing wool, exposure to tobacco smoke and pollution.Certain foods can also worsen spongiotic dermatitis including eggs, milk, peanuts, soybeans, fish, and wheat.Use mild or “hypoallergenic” soaps and laundry detergents. These contain fewer harmful chemicals that can irritate your skin. Rinse clothes twice after washing to ensure that the detergent is well removed.
Any product marked “hypoallergenic” has been tested for sensitive skin and will likely not irritate your skin.

, No matter what treatment you seek for spongiotic dermatitis, do not scratch the patches on your skin. Scratching the rash can open any sores you may have and cause further problems, including infection.If you cannot avoid scratching the irritated areas, occasionally apply bandages to any areas seriously affected by spongiotic dermatitis. This will limit exposure to irritants and keep you from scratching.Do not cover the areas frequently, as this may actually cause more irritation.

, Maintaining your skin’s natural hydration will prevent dryness and help prevent further irritation. You can help keep your skin hydrated by different means including moisturizing, avoiding temperature extremes, and using a humidifier.Use a gentle cleanser made for sensitive skin when you bathe or shower. Recommended choices include Dove, Aveeno, and Cetaphil. Don't use overly hot water, as this can dry out and irritate skin.
Apply moisturizer to your skin at least twice a day. The best time to apply is after a shower or bath while your skin is still damp. Later in the day, consider using an oil to moisturize your skin.Make sure to use unscented and uncolored moisturizers that will not irritate your skin.If you aren't sure what moisturizer is best for your skin, ask your doctor or pharmacist. Use creams or ointments, as they are usually thicker and more effective than lotions, and they're usually less irritating to the skin.
Taking a 10-15 minute bath in warm water sprinkled with baking soda, uncooked oatmeal or colloidal oatmeal will help your skin stay moisturized. Make sure to moisturize your skin with a cream or oil after the bath.Keeping a humidifier in your home will ensure that the air is moist and won’t dry out your skin.Avoid temperature extremes, which can dry out skin.

, Making sure that you drink enough water will help your skin stay hydrated as well. Drink at least eight glasses of water every day to help your skin retain previous moisture and prevent dehydration., The itching and inflammation from spongiotic dermatitis comes from histamine in your blood. Cold packs or compresses can help relieve itching and inflammation associated with spongiotic dermatitis by constricting blood flow and cooling the skin.Histamine is produced when an allergen enters in the body. It is involved in all of the symptoms of allergic reactions, including itching and inflammation.
You can place a cold compress on your rashes intermittently for 10 to 15 minutes, once every 2 hours or as needed., You can prevent and relieve spongiotic dermatitis by protecting your skin. Clothing, bandages, and even bug spray will protect your skin.


Wear cool, loose, smooth textured clothing such as cotton or silk to keep yourself from scratching and prevent excess sweating.Do not wear wool, as it can irritate your skin.
Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants to keep yourself from scratching your skin and protect it from external irritants.You can also apply bug repellant to areas that do not have rashes when you go outside where you are at risk of being bitten. This will prevent insects from getting too close to your skin and causing further allergic reactions.

, Applying a calamine lotion or non-prescription anti-itch cream can relieve the symptoms of spongiotic dermatitis. You can purchase these creams at grocery and drug stores both in-store and online.


A nonprescription anti-itch, or hydrocortisone, cream, can help relieve itching. Make sure to purchase a cream with at least 1% hydrocortisone.
Apply these creams to the affected area before you moisturize your skin.Follow the specific product instructions for how often you can use the cream on your skin.

, These drugs will block the histamine that causes allergic reactions and help relieve itching and skin inflammation. There are many different over-the-counter antihistamines that are available at drug and grocery stores both in store and online. Before taking any new medications, consult with your doctor, as some may interact with other medical conditions or current medications.


Chlorpheniramine is available in 2 mg and 4 mg tablets. Adults can take 4mg every 4 to 6 hours. Don’t exceed 24 mg per day.
Diphenhydramine (Benadryl) is available in 25 mg and 50 mg tablets. Adults can take 25 mg every 6 hours. Don’t exceed 300 mg per day.
Ceterizine (Zyrtec) is available in 5 mg and 10 mg tablets. Adults can take up to 10 mg every 24 hours.
These drugs (chlorpheniramine and diphenhydramine in particular) often have sedative effects so do not drive, drink alcohol, or operate any machinery (including driving) when taking them. Cetirizine is less likely to cause sedation, but you should try it a few times to ensure it doesn't cause drowsiness before you attempt to drive or operate machinery.
If you are treating a child, consult your doctor or pharmacist for appropriate medications and dosages.

, Corticosteroid creams can reduce inflammation, thereby reducing itching and scratching. They should be applied once or twice a day on the affected area.


You are advised to apply the cream in the morning after showering so that it stays on throughout the whole day.
An example of a corticosteroid cream is 1% hydrocortisone cream.

Visit your doctor if your condition worsens.,
Use light therapy.,
Use prescription corticosteroids.,
Get an antibiotic prescribed to combat infection.,
Use a calcineurin inhibitor cream to help repair the skin.",How to Ease the Symptoms of Spongiotic Dermatitis3," If your blisters and rash don’t go away after a week, or you become very uncomfortable, see your doctor. The doctor may prescribe oral medications, steroid creams, or light therapy to treat your spongiotic dermatitis.


See your doctor if: you're so uncomfortable that it disrupts your sleep or ability to function daily, your skin is painful, self-care and home remedies haven’t worked, or you suspect your skin is infected., A doctor may prescribe phototherapy (light therapy) to help heal spongiotic dermatitis. This very effective treatment can be as simple as limited sun exposure or may use artificial light, but it does not come without risks.Phototherapy exposes the skin to controlled amounts of natural sunlight or artificial ultraviolet A (UVA) and narrow band UVB. This treatment can be used alone with in conjunction with medications.Light exposure increases your risk for premature aging and skin cancer., If the itching or rash is not relieved by applying an over-the-counter topical corticosteroid, your doctor may prescribe either a stronger topical or oral corticosteroid such as prednisone.Oral steroids and strong topical steroids can have serious side effects when used long term. Follow your doctor's instructions and don't use these medications for longer than advised.Continue to moisturize your skin while using oral and topical corticosteroids. Not only will they keep your skin hydrated, but they will help prevent flare-ups when you discontinue use of the steroids., In case your blisters or rash area is infected, you can get an antibiotic to help make sure you remain healthy. Talk to your doctor if you see signs of infection, such as redness, swelling, warmth, or pus.


The type of antibiotic your doctor prescribes may vary. Common antibiotics include erythromycin, penicillin, dicloxacillin, clindamycin, or doxycycline., When no other treatment works, get a calcineurin inhibitor cream that will help repair your skin. These drugs, which include tacrolimus and pimecrolimus, will help maintain normal skin, control itching, and reduce flares of spongiotic dermatitis.


Calcineurin inhibitors directly affect the immune system and come with potential side effects including kidney problems, high blood pressure and headaches. Serious but rare side effects include an increased risk of certain cancers.These drugs are prescribed only when other treatments have failed and are approved for most people over the age of 2."

Soak your skin for ten to fifteen minutes.,
Pumice the wart gently.,
Cover the wart overnight.,
Cover the wart with duct tape.",How to Pumice a Wart2," Just as with any other wart treatment, you will want to soak the thick, hardened skin around the wart in hot water for up to fifteen minutes. Allow the tissue to soften so that it is more readily removed with the pumice stone. Towel dry the wart before using the stone., Use a pumice stone immediately after soaking to gently remove the softened layers of dead skin near the wart. Do not press too hard, as this could cause cracking and infection. Instead, use a gentle back-and-forth motion over the area around the wart, and stop when you notice healthy, live skin., After pumicing, use petroleum jelly or another moisturizing cream to cover the wart overnight and allow it to soften. In the morning, wash off any residual jelly or cream and towel dry the site., There is no medical proof that duct tape is an effective treatment for warts, but many claim to have great success with this home remedy. After pumicing the wart, cover it with a small piece of duct tape. Change out the tape every six or so days to peel away the wart a few layers at a time.Repeat the soaking and pumicing process every time you change out the duct tape.
Continue this process for no more than two months. If the treatment is not working, try another over the counter treatment, or contact your doctor for further care instructions."
"
Avoid contact with other warts.,
Cover current warts.,
Be careful sharing grooming tools.",How to Pumice a Wart3," This goes for warts on your own body, as well as other’s warts. Avoid direct contact between a wart and areas where you do not have warts. Touching unimpacted areas may only spread the virus.If you do come into contact with warts or with surfaces that have been touched by someone with warts, make sure to wash your hands and any other exposed areas carefully with soap and hot water.

, Help keep warts from spreading elsewhere on your body or to others by covering your current warts with a bandage or clothing. This can help minimize direct contact with the wart while it heals., Tools including pumice stones, razors, nail files or trimmers, and any other object that comes into contact with an infected area could spread the virus. Be careful sharing or borrowing tools from someone currently treating warts."

Establish a healthy diet.,
Use detergents designed for sensitive skin.,
Use soaps and shampoos designed for sensitive skin.,
Use moisturizers designed for sensitive skin.,
Don't scratch the itch.,
Avoid direct sunlight exposure to skin.,
Keep skin moisturized throughout the day.,
Reduce and manage stress.",How to Decrease Eczema Flare Ups2," While doctors and scientists do not believe a poor diet can cause eczema, healthy foods go a long way in promoting total body health.Opt for foods rich in vitamins and nutrients over those loaded with preservatives and empty calories. Eating good foods will improve much more than your skin health.


Try adding fish oil capsules to your diet. Check sensitivity to pork and food dyes. Seafood has also been known to incur an allergic reaction.

, Bargain brands often contain harsh chemicals that can strip away the skin's protective oils. Use only the recommended amount to ensure that your washer will be able to rinse it all out. Try to buy new clothing without tags, and make sure you wash it before the first wear., If you are treating a flare up, alternative bathing methods may be necessary. When the flare up subsides, look for soaps and shampoos designed to promote healthy, moisturized skin. Stay away from soaps and shampoos containing dyes and perfumes., When treating an eczema flare up, look for moisturizers that are designed to control itching and inflammation, repair the skin, and fight infection. When the flare up subsides, switch back to an everyday sensitive skin moisturizer. See this guide for more on choosing the right moisturizer., This includes licking your lips as well, if that is the affected area. There are several ways to reduce itchiness from eczema. Make sure your skin is moisturized by keeping the house humid and applying moisturizer throughout the day. Keep your fingernails short and smooth so that absent-minded itching is less harmful to your skin – but keep an eye on your hands!, In normal circumstances, a degree of sunlight is beneficial for your skin as a source of vitamin D. In fact, many eczema patients report that sunlight helps their symptoms in general. However, prolonged exposure to sunlight can also make your rash worse. If you're going to be outside for a long time, cover affected areas with clothing, if possible, to minimize damage from sunlight.


Be especially careful about the sun if you're using corticosteroid-based cream. If you use this cream, your skin will be especially susceptible to sunburn, so you should keep your affected skin out of direct sunlight.

, Remember to reapply moisturizer as often as recommended on the packaging. Make sure to moisturize at bedtime to get your skin prepared for the next day. You should also reapply moisturizer after getting out of the shower, as that process can remove your skin’s oils that keep you moisturized. For more on moisturizing, see .

, While stress may not cause eczema, it can contribute to its worsening and persistence. Try to reduce pressure in your life. Learn how to meditate or use relaxation exercises. Make sure you reach out to those around you to help you manage your stress."

Take oatmeal baths.,
Consider alternate bathing methods.,
Take oral medication or apply creams.",How to Decrease Eczema Flare Ups3," This method is the most famous and time-honored for a reason. Soak in a bath with oatmeal for 10-15 minutes daily to reduce your eczema flare up. Kits for oatmeal baths are available in most pharmacies. Make sure to follow the instructions and amounts recommended on the packaging., While the oatmeal bath is the most widely accepted and practiced way to reduce itching, some experts prefer other methods. Make sure you consider the risks of the more alternative methods, and consult your doctor if you are unsure. Depending on your skin type and other factors, some methods make work better than others.


Bleach baths are the most debated method for treating eczema because of the assumed harshness of the chemical. Make sure to use 6% bleach. Add ½ cup for a full bathtub and ¼ cup for a half bath.Add vinegar (between a cup and a pint), salt (one cup), or baking soda (maximum of ¼ cup) to your bath. Vinegar kills bacteria, salt makes water less painful to enter, and baking soda can relieve itchiness.Specially designed bath oils can help reduce symptoms of eczema. Follow the instructions on the packaging.

, These can reduce the symptoms of eczema to allow it to heal properly. Look for over-the-counter oral medications that contain antihistamines to reduce itching — but beware, they make you drowsy. Prescription or over-the-counter creams that contain hydrocortisone can help with itching as well. Make sure you are also moisturizing because they do not always do both jobs."

Remove scales by massaging your child’s scalp.,
Use a mild baby shampoo.,
Rub oil on the scalp.,
Bathe your child daily.",How to Heal Scalp Eczema3," In many infants and young children, scalp eczema will clear up on its own within a few weeks. It could take a few months to clear in some cases. Although it may look uncomfortable, most children are not bothered by the condition.If the condition does not clear up, consult with your pediatrician to discuss treatment options.
Like adult scalp eczema, the condition may clear up after treatment and reappear later., The treatments for infants and children younger than two years old differ from treatments for adults.

Try shampoos with corticosteroids.,
Take other prescription treatments.,
Try light therapy.,
Talk with your doctor about other treatment options.",How to Heal Scalp Eczema4," Patients who do not respond to over-the-counter treatments or who are unhappy with the results may need prescription medication. Doctors can prescribe stronger treatment regimens including creams, lotions, shampoos, and even oral medication if OTC shampoos are ineffective.UV light treatments may also be an option.Prescribed antifungal shampoos and topical corticosteroids are beneficial, but can be expensive and may have adverse side effects with long-term use. These and other prescribed shampoos are only used when over-the-counter treatments are not effective.

, The most common type of prescription shampoo used for scalp eczema is antifungal shampoo. Most antifungal shampoos have a concentration of 1% ciclopirox and 2% ketoconazole.The most common side effects of these shampoos include irritation, burning sensations, dry skin, and itching.
These shampoos are used daily or at least twice weekly during the prescribed period. Always follow the directions on the package or prescription.

The common corticosteroids shampoos include ingredients such as 1.0% hydrocortisone, 0.1% betamethasone, 0.1% clobetasol, and 0.01% fluocinolone.Side effects usually occur after long-term use and may include thinning of the skin, itching, a stinging sensation, and skin hypopigmentation (the loss of the color pigments of your skin, which results in lightening of the skin). Most people who use these shampoos for only a short period should not experience negative side effects.These prescription shampoos contain steroids, and a little of the medication can be absorbed into the bloodstream. If you have diabetes or sensitivity to steroids, you should be sure to discuss these complications with your doctor.
Be aware that corticosteroid shampoos tend to be more expensive than other treatments.
These shampoos can be used daily or twice daily during the prescribed period.

You can also try creams, lotions, oils, or foams that contain one or more of the above medicinal ingredients.


Prescription antifungal agents called azoles are a highly effective treatment for scalp eczema. Ketoconazole is the most commonly prescribed agent and has been proven effective in many clinical trials.Another common prescription treatment uses Ciclopirox, a type of hydroxy pyridine antifungal. It is available as a cream, gel, or solution.Corticosteroids may also be prescribed as a cream or topical ointment., Light therapy, or phototherapy, can sometimes help cases of scalp eczema.It is commonly combined with medication such as a psoralen.Because Light therapy involves exposure to ultraviolet light, it carries an increased risk of skin cancer developing.This type of treatment is usually reserved for people whose scalp eczema is caused by atopic dermatitis, or whose seborrheic dermatitis is extensive.It cannot be used on infants or young children., There are a few other ways of treating scalp eczema, but they are reserved as last-resort treatments as they can cause serious side effects. However, if no other treatments have worked, you may want to consult with your doctor about other treatment options.Creams or lotions containing tacrolimus (Protopic) and pimecrolimus (Elidel) may be effective for treating scalp eczema. However, they carry an increased risk of cancer and are more expensive than corticosteroids.Terbinafine (Lamisil) and butenafine (Mentax) are oral antifungal treatments for scalp eczema.They can interfere with specific enzymes in the body or cause allergic reactions or liver problems.This limits their use for the treatment of scalp eczema."

Apply a salicylic acid pad or gel.,
Use over-the-counter freezing products.",How to Get Rid of Warts on Fingers1," Salicylic acid is a nonprescription wart removal option you can find at your local drugstore or pharmacy. It helps to dissolve the protein of the wart and the dead skin around it. Look for wart removal pads, plasters, gels or drops that contain 17 percent salicylic acid solution or patches that contain 15 percent salicylic acid.You will need to apply these products once a day for several weeks. For optimal results, soak your finger or fingers with the warts in warm water for 10 to 20 minutes. This will soften the skin of the wart. Then, file away at any dead skin on or around the wart with an emery board or a pumice stone. Once you have filed away the dead skin, apply the salicylic acid pad, gel, plaster or patch to the wart.
You can then file away at the dead skin that appears on and around the wart between treatments with an emery board or a pumice stone. Do not share the board or pumice stone with anyone else and throw it away once the wart is removed.
You may need to apply the salicylic acid for 12 weeks or more until the wart flattens and fades away. If the wart becomes irritated, sore, or red, you should stop using the salicylic acid product and talk to your doctor.;
, You can also use freezing products on the warts to try to remove them. Aerosol wart treatments can be purchased over-the-counter at your local drugstore or pharmacy. These sprays will freeze the warts at a temperature of minus 90°F (minus 57°C).Keep in mind over-the-counter freezing products will not work as well as liquid nitrogen agents applied by your doctor to the warts. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advises caution when using wart removers, as they are flammable and should not be used around fire or any heat sources.

Understand how genital warts are spread.,
Wear condoms.,
Use dental dams.Dental dams also provide protection during sex, especially oral sex.,
Get vaccinated.,
Seek treatment for the symptoms.",How to Prevent the Spread of Genital Warts1," The main way genital warts are spread is when infected skin comes in contact with non-infected skin. This skin-on-skin contact spreads the virus from one person to the next. It most often happens during sex or foreplay.You cannot catch HPV from a surface such as a toilet seat or even a door or sink handle.You also won't get HPV from sharing towels with an infected person.;
, One of the best ways to protect against the spread of genital warts is to use condoms, both the latex and female types. You can find condoms at drug stores or big box stores, and agencies such as Planned Parenthood or county health departments often give out condoms for free. However, condoms won't protect you completely, as genital warts can be on nearby skin, not just the genitals.Latex and polyurethane condoms have been tested for effectiveness. If you or your partner has a latex allergy, choose a polyurethane condom.Don't choose novelty condoms. Pick a package that says it is meant to prevent infection or disease, as they are intended to offer protection., Dental dams are basically like a flattened condom; they are a thin sheet of latex originally used in dental work. You use it as a barrier between you and another person's body part.You may have more trouble finding dental dams. Some Planned Parenthood locations have them, and you can sometimes find them at specialty sex stores. You can also find them online.If you're desperate, you can cut off the ring at the end of a condom, then slice down one side to produce a flat piece of latex like a dental dam., Girls and boys who are 9 to 26 are eligible to get vaccinated for HPV. Two vaccinations exist, though only one of them is appropriate for men. The vaccines not only protect against genital warts, they also protect against cancers that can develop from the virus.Ask your healthcare provider about the vaccination for you or your children.It takes three shots to be fully vaccinated., Being treated for the symptoms can reduce the number of warts you have. Though the virus can be spread even when warts aren't present, reducing the number of warts does reduce your chances of spreading it. Always seek treatment if you suspect an outbreak—even if symptoms are not especially present."
"
Get a prescription for chemical treatment from your doctor.,
Ask your doctor about cryotherapy.,
Consider laser removal of the warts.",How to Get Rid of Warts on Fingers2," Your doctor can suggest the use of prescription chemical treatments to try to kill off the skin cells of the warts. These treatments usually contain chemicals such as formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, and silver nitrate.


The side effects of these chemical treatments include the skin around the wart being stained brown, and burns to the skin surrounding the wart.Your doctor may also suggest prescription-strength wart medication that contains salicylic acid. This medication will remove layers of the wart over time and is often more effective when used in combination with freezing or cryotherapy.

, Cryotherapy is a procedure where your doctor applies liquid nitrogen to your wart, which causes a blister to form under and around your wart. The dead tissue can then be removed seven to ten days after the freezing. However, this method can trigger your immune system to fight viral warts and you may need repeat treatments done to remove the wart completely.Cryotherapy sessions usually take five to 15 minutes and can be painful. If the warts on your hands are large, they may need to be frozen several times before they are fully removed.
There are several side effects of cryotherapy, including pain, blistering, and discolored skin around the wart.

, Your doctor may suggest that you try pulse-dye laser treatment to burn off tiny blood vessels in the wart. The infected tissue will then die and the wart will fall off.Keep in mind the effectiveness of this method is limited. It can also cause pain and scarring around the affected area.

Try a duct tape treatment.,
Use raw garlic.,
Soak the warts in apple cider vinegar.,
Apply basil leaves.",How to Get Rid of Warts on Fingers3," Studies have been mixed on the effectiveness of duct tape as a removal treatment for warts. Many physicians believe the duct tape treatment to be no better than a placebo and not a very effective way to remove warts. However, there has been some documented success with the use of duct tape on warts.You can try the duct tape method by covering the wart in duct tape or electrical tape for six days. After six days, you can soak the wart in water and then gently remove any dead skin on or around the wart with a pumice stone or an emery board.
You will need to then let the wart be exposed to the open air for 12 hours and repeat the process again until the wart is removed.

, This home remedy claims that the caustic effect of garlic can make the warts blister and fall off. Keep in mind this is not a medically verified treatment and may not work as effectively as medical treatments for warts.Crush one to two cloves of garlic in a mortar and pestle until it forms a paste. Apply the garlic to the warts and cover them with bandages so the garlic can interact with the warts.
Re apply fresh garlic to the warts once a day but avoid putting the garlic on any of the healthy skin surrounding the warts. You can smear the healthy skin with petroleum jelly so the garlic does not stick to the skin.

, Apple cider vinegar will not kill the HPV that is causing the warts but it has a high acidity content that can help the skin on the wart to peel off and fall away. You may experience some soreness and swelling on the warts once you apply the apple cider vinegar, but this should fade after a few days. Keep in mind this is not a medically proven removal method for warts.Soak one to two cotton balls in two tablespoons of apple cider vinegar. Squeeze out any excess vinegar from the cotton balls but make sure they are thoroughly soaked.
Apply the cotton balls to your warts and secure each cotton ball with gauze or medical tape. Leave the apple cider vinegar on the warts overnight. Repeat this every night with fresh cotton balls for one to two weeks. After several days, the warts may appear darker or black, which is a good sign the apple cider vinegar is working. They will eventually fall off on their own.

, Fresh basil contains several anti-viral components and can help to speed up the removal process of the warts. Be aware this is not a medically proven method for wart removal and should be used at your own discretion.Use clean hands or a mortar and pestle to crush 1/4 cup of fresh basil leaves until they appear mushy and wet. Gently apply the crushed basil to your warts and cover the warts with a clean bandage or a clean cloth.
Re apply the basil for one to two weeks until the warts fall off.

Do not pick at the warts and avoid direct contact with other people’s warts.,
Practice good hand and nail hygiene.,
Wear flip flops around public pools and in public showers.",How to Get Rid of Warts on Fingers4," The virus that causes warts can be passed from person to person if the warts are touched or picked at. Leave the warts on your hands alone and avoid picking or scratching at the warts.You should also never share the emery board or pumice stone that you used to file down your warts with someone else. Only use the emery board or pumice stone on your warts and nowhere else on your body to avoid spreading the virus.

, If possible, avoid biting your fingernails. Broken skin, such as skin that has been bitten or chewed, is more susceptible to the development of warts.You should also avoid brushing, clipping or shaving any areas that have warts as this can irritate the warts and spread the virus.
Keep your nails and hands clean. Always wash your hands well after touching your warts or any shared surfaces, such as exercise equipment at the gym or the handle on a bus.

, Reduce your risk of developing warts or passing them on to others by always wearing plastic flip flops in the change rooms and the public areas of public pools or showers..If you have warts and are planning to go swimming in a public pool, put a waterproof plaster over the warts to prevent the spread of infection.

Recognize that 90% of genital warts are caused by two strains of the HPV virus.When a person gets genital warts, it's usually because they have contracted a form of HPV.,
Recognize what genital warts look like.,
Recognize the more rare symptoms of genital warts.,
Let a doctor examine you if you think you have genital warts.,
Recognize that many cases of HPV and genital warts will clear up on their own, although this is not always the case.,
Use ointment to treat the genital warts.,
Discuss other options with your doctor.,
Choose a doctor-recommended treatment.,
Give your treatment time to work.",How to Get Rid of Genital Warts," While there is no cure for HPV yet, the body can clear itself of HPV over time.Not all kinds of HPV will lead to genital warts. Some HPV varieties cause the plantar warts that most people are familiar with.
Genital warts may appear anytime from 6 weeks to 6 months after sexual contact, although they may not be noticed for years.
Be aware that certain types of high-risk HPV strains can lead to cervical or anal cancer, although these strains are more rare. The strains of HPV that cause warts are not the same as those that cause cancer.;
, Genital warts are soft growths on and around the genital and anal area. Genital warts are usually flesh-colored and can be either raised or flat, larger or smaller, and look like the tops of cauliflower.Genital warts can appear in different places depending on the gender of the patient.


Genital warts in females can be found:

Inside the vagina or anus
Outside the vagina or anus
On the cervix, inside the body


Genital warts in males can be found on the:

Penis
Anus
Scrotum
Groin area, including the thighs



, Rarely, genital warts can cause symptoms not commonly associated with genital warts. These symptoms include:


Increased moisture in and around the genital area
Bleeding after sex
Increased vaginal discharge
Itching in the genital area, A doctor—usually gynecologist—will need to diagnose genital warts before treatment. The doctor will diagnose through a visual exam and a pelvic examination in women. Several pap smear tests might need to be taken if an abnormal test appears, which is often the case with genital warts., Many men who are exposed to HPV never show any symptoms or problems associated with genital warts.Men and women who are exposed to HPV and do not show signs can still pass on the infection through unprotected sexual contact.

, After obtaining a diagnosis from your doctor, you may receive one of several common topical creams used to treat genital warts. Use as directed to treat the symptoms of your infection as effectively as possible. The following are some of the common topical treatments you may receive. Note that cremes are generally expensive and not covered by insurance.


""Podofilox."" Podofilox, or Condylox, is a solution usually in gel form that is applied to the affected area. It is used for several weeks until the wart falls off. It clears about 45% to 90% of warts, although research shows that warts may reemerge in 30% to 60% of cases.""Imiquimod."" Imiquimod, or Aldara, is a topical immune response cream. It is applied to the wart and it causes less irritation compared to podofilox. In 70% to 85% of cases, the initial warts are removed, but in 5% to 20% of cases the warts come back.""Veregen"" and ""Polyphenon E."" These are ointments extracted from green tea and other components. They are approved by the FDA to fight against genital warts., If your genital warts don't respond to topical creams, your doctor might want to opt for several different strategies. Creams seem to respond better to warts that are on moist surfaces, while the following generally work better for warts on dry surfaces:


Cryotherapy. Using liquid nitrogen, cryotherapy freezes the wart so that it eventually falls off. It helps remove warts, but there is no guarantee they will not come back.
Surgical removal. Minor surgery is conducted by an expert physician and administered with the use of local or general anesthesia. The surgeon cuts off the cells of the wart with a scalpel.
Trichloracetic acid. This is the most frequently used medication for genital warts. Trichloracetic acid is also used for for chemical peels and tattoo removal, trichloracetic acid is a chemical applied to the wart, effectively burning it off.
Electrocautery. This procedure, less common than the other procedures, involves using an electric current to burn off warts.
Laser surgery. Not advisable for use in all areas, laser surgery is often the last resort of none of the methods work.

, Your doctor might give you two or more options to remove genital warts.You’ll have to consider the discomfort that comes along with the procedure. Whatever treatment it may be, it is still better than not having any treatment at all. Have it done before it gets worse.

, As stated previously, many of the above treatments, along with a little bit of patience, will see the genital warts removed.If, however, three separate courses of treatment by your doctor, or six doctor-approved home treatments fail to remove your genital warts, your doctor will want to re-evaluate your course of treatment.

Recognize the limits of home remedies.,
Prepare your plantar wart before treatment.,
Try a salicylic acid treatment.,
Try duct tape.Duct tape should be cut to the size of the wart and placed over the top of it for up to six days.,
Investigate home freezing compounds.,
Determine if it’s time for a physician’s care.",How to Get Rid of Plantar Warts (Verrucas)1," Although treatments at home are effective, they will usually take many months to be effective. If you want your warts to disappear faster, it’s best to seek the care of your doctor. Permanent eradication may still take a long time, even when warts are treated by a doctor.


Plantar warts will often disappear on their own and will not leave a scar; however, this can take several months to happen. The warts may be painful and it will be difficult to walk in the meantime.;
, Soften the top of the wart by soaking your foot in warm water for several minutes. Then take the excess skin off the top with a pumice stone or nail file. Be sure that you don’t use this stone or file for anything else, ever, as you can transfer the virus to other areas of the body.


Removing the top layer of dead skin will help the product to go deeper into the wart.

, There are a variety of topical (on the skin) over-the-counter products, such as Compound W, that treat plantar warts using salicylic acid. Treatments come as liquid, gel or patches. Follow the directions on the package to successfully remove your plantar wart.


Salicylic acid treatments are not painful but it can take several weeks for full results to appear.

, On the seventh day, remove the tape, soak the foot for five minutes in warm water to soften the dead skin on the top, and then use a pumice stone or nail file to buff off the top layers of the wart. Replace the duct tape for another six days.


Do not use the pumice stone or nail file for any other purpose.
This process can take several weeks to see results.
It is not known why this process is thought to work, but many have good results using this method.

, The freezing process works to close off the blood supply to the wart. There are over-the-counter medications you can use at home to freeze the wart, including Compound W Freeze Off and Dr. Scholl’s Freeze Away. Follow the directions on the product you are using.


Freezing at home will be uncomfortable and some will consider it painful. A doctor can use a local anesthetic to freeze the wart deeper.

, While plantar warts are often treated successfully at home, there are times when you may need treatment from your physician.Visit your doctor if any of these complications occur:


If the wart does not go away after treatment or if it appears to go away but returns quickly.
If the wart grows larger quickly or appears to cluster. In this case it may be a Mosaic wart.
If the wart starts bleeding or you have more pain after treatment.
The area becomes red, swollen, or starts draining pus. This indicates that the area has become infected.
If you are a diabetic, have peripheral vascular disease or coronary artery disease. If you suffer from these medical conditions it is important that you do not treat your plantar warts at home but get them treated from a podiatrist who will monitor your peripheral vascular supply to the feet. These conditions increase the risk of infection or tissue death because of poor blood supply.

"
"
Be patient.,
Use salicylic acid or 100% Trichloroacetic Acid (TCA).Salicylic acid is the ingredient of most over-the-counter wart removers, including Compound W and Occlusal.,
Use duct tape.,
Apply cantharidin.,
Try liquid nitrogen.,
Burn the wart off.,
Have your doctor cut it out.,
Consider immunotherapy.,
Ask your doctor about Veregen.,
Use imiquimod.",How to Get Rid of Warts1," Warts are caused by HPV (human papillomavirus) and as such, can take quite a bit of time to eliminate naturally by one's immune system. Some warts will disappear over time, without treatment. However, ""time"" could mean anywhere from a couple weeks to a couple of years, so you may wish to choose a more active method. Whichever method you choose, allow it time to work. Some methods are faster acting than others. The fastest method to removing warts permanently is using 100% TCA. With this method results are often seen in less than 10 days and are permanent. It is also the cheapest and is discussed later.;
, It's effectiveness varies and it can take weeks for it work.


Soak the skin in water for 5 minutes or longer, apply the acid liberally using the brush and let it dry. Leave it for a day. You can either peel or file it off and then file remaining dead skin. Do this every two or three days.

, Several studies have tried to assess the effectiveness of duct tape in removing warts. Duct tape occlusion therapy (DTOT) is supposed to localize medication in the general wart area as well as ""choke"" the wart itself. One study found that duct tape following the application of imiquimod 5% cream was an effective treatment against the common wart. However it takes a long time (can take up to 6 months) and usually people don't see success with this., Ask your doctor about using cantharidin, a fast-acting chemical that will burn away the wart. Unfortunately, It can be really expensive, upwards of $500. There is some pain involved, but you may see results in just a day.


The doctor applies cantharidin directly on the wart, then applies a bandage. The next day, the bandage is taken off and the dead skin is removed. If it doesn't work in one treatment, you may need another method—your doctor will make appropriate recommendations.

, Another remedy your doctor may try is liquid nitrogen—or cryotherapy—to freeze the wart.It may cause some discomfort, and can take a few treatments to completely remove a wart, but can be very effective. If it's not then the wart will usually come back bigger with bigger blood vessels and be almost impossible to remove. Alternately, many drug stores carry OTC freeze treatments to zap the wart. If using an OTC wart freeze treatment, keep the following tips in mind:

Follow the direction on the wart removal package. Your skin should turn from white to red in a matter of minutes, and a blister should begin to form underneath the wart.
Small black dots should appear beneath the wart after a few days. This is a sign that the treatment is working. Resist the urge to pull the wart off.
The wart should fall off on its own. If it doesn't, treat again after two weeks. Do not treat a wart that has been unsuccessfully treated three times; see a doctor.



, When other methods fail, burning the wart off may be what's needed. There will be some pain involved, and burning can lead to scarring, so the best recommendation it to let your doctor handle it. However, you can try this at home, if you're brave enough.


See your doctor. They can use a laser to burn the wart away. This is sometimes effective, but best recommended after other methods have failed.
Try it at home. Light a match, blow it out, and while the match head is still hot, touch it to the wart. This causes blistering that initiates a healing response. Peel the layer of infected skin off, and cover with aloe and a strip bandage. Repeat as necessary. Try this at your own risk. Very dangerous.

, When in doubt, have your doctor remove the wart by cutting it out surgically. This is something best left to a doctor, to prevent infection, and so that a local anesthetic can be used to mitigate the pain. A doctor will either do this by:



Electrosurgery and curettage. This is where the doctor burns the wart with an electrical current and cuts it out afterward. The wart may still return because the blood vessels are still intact.Laser surgery. This is where the doctor burns the wart with an intense beam of light., Your doctor will be able to counsel you on this treatment, which uses your body's own defenses to attack the wart.

, This is a new medication that is used to treat genital warts as well as other warts.

, This is a topical cream that is used to treat some types of warts and skin cancers by stimulating an immune response. It does not cure warts, but it may help, in concert with other treatments. Ask your doctor for guidance.

Talk about sexual histories with your partner.,
Limit your number of sexual partners.,
Try using sex toys.,
Don't have sex with high-risk partners.",How to Prevent the Spread of Genital Warts2," Though it may seem like a mood-killer, it's important to talk about your and your partner's sexual history before you have sex. If your partner has had unprotected sex, that puts you at a higher risk of contracting the HPV virus from him or her.It is important if you have had an infection in the past that you tell your sexual partner(s).

, If you only have one sexual partner whom you know is virus-free and only having sex with you, you cannot get the virus. If that's not an option for you, try reducing the number of sexual partners you have, as the more sexual partners you have, the more your risk of infection increases., If you're unsure of your sexual partner's history, try using sex toys instead, which can limit skin to skin contact. However, make sure to clean sex toys in soap and water, though make sure your toy is built for it first. However, the safest way to use sex toys is to put a condom on the toy., If one of your sexual partners has unprotected sex with other people, you should stop having sex with that person. Doing so will lower your risk of contracting the disease.If you suspect a partner may be having unprotected sex with others, do not hesitate to cease having sex with him or her. It is better to lose a sexual partner than to risk your health.

Watch for the development of genital warts.,
Ask your doctor for a diagnosis.,
Use at-home treatments.,
Ask about skin treatments.,
Understand the complications.",How to Prevent the Spread of Genital Warts3," Most of the time, your immune system will kill the virus if it enters your body. You won't develop symptoms. However, other times, it will develop into genital warts, which must be treated by a doctor.Nicotine weakens your immune system. Because of this, smokers are at higher risk of developing genital warts. Stop smoking to help your immune system recover., It actually takes quite a while for warts to develop from the virus, which means you or someone you have sex with could have the disease without knowing it. In fact, you can still pass the disease even if you don't have warts. It can take anywhere from 3-6 months for warts to develop; occasionally, it takes even longer.Genital warts will be the same color as your skin, but they may have the texture of cauliflower.The bumps will not be hard; rather, they will give a little when pushed., If you're a woman and you suspect you have genital warts, your gynecologist will perform a pelvic exam, including a pap smear. She should be able to diagnose warts on sight, though a pap smear helps confirm the diagnosis. For men, your doctor will make the diagnosis primarily made by sight, though genital warts can be biopsied to confirm the disease.Your doctor may also perform a DNA test on the virus, though the CDC does not deem it necessary because it won't affect treatment.This test can determine whether the kind of HPV you have is one that puts you at risk for cancer.It is important to get genital warts examined. Certain kinds of precancerous lesions on the vulva may look like genital warts, but could progress to cancer if not treated.

, Your doctor will likely prescribe a cream for you to use at home. Ask your doctor how often you should apply the treatment. Be sure to follow all instructions for use of medication, including finishing all medication, or you may be at risk of becoming re-infected.These medications may be expensive, so your doctor may recommend burning off the warts instead.
Podophyllotoxin is most often used for smaller warts closer together. You use a stick to drop the liquid on the warts, though you can also apply it as a cream. You use it for a couple of days, then take the rest of the week off.For bigger warts, you'll likely use imiquimod. You use it 3 times a week for at least a couple of weeks by applying it and then rinsing the area about 8 hours later., Like other types of warts, your gynecologist will employ in-office skin treatments to remove major outbreaks. Those treatments may include burning or freezing the warts off.Your doctor may burn off genital warts by applying trichloroacetic acid (TCA). For very hard, small warts, your doctor may give you trichloroacetic acid. Because it can damage your skin, your doctor's office will apply it. It actually burns the wart, so you will likely feel the burning.Other options are laser therapy and even surgery for particularly bad outbreaks., The HPV virus can cause other complications besides genital warts. Knowing the risks will help you understand why you need to protect yourself.Certain strains of the HPV virus can put you at risk for cancer later in life. In particular, you may be at a higher risk for cervical cancer, cancer of the vulva, cancer of the mouth and throat, cancer of the penis, and cancer of the anus.
HPV can also cause problems for you if you become pregnant. For instance, warts can bleed when you deliver or limit how much your vaginal wall can stretch. Although it is rare, you may also transmit the warts to your baby during delivery, resulting in a syndrome called juvenile onset respiratory papillomatosis. This condition must be treated by a doctor."

Many users main complaint about these is that it just takes too long. Generally, you'll be looking at at least a few weeks before you start noticing results.If you have the time, these are pain-free and FDA approved.;
, This is one of the safest, most popular treatments -- but it can take months.Compound W and Occlusal are two products that use salicylic acid to soften the warts, aiding in their eventual non-existence. It's the same stuff used in most acne medications.


With salicylic acid, it's best to soak the wart in water first, apply the acid, and leave it overnight. Cover the area with a bandage or cloth so it doesn't rub off on your sheets., When they said it was all-purpose, boy, did they mean it. In 2007, USA Today featured an article on this tool being used for genital wart removal -- and it worked for 20% of subjects. 1 in 5 is better than nothing, right?With this method, you place duct tape over the warts and leave it for six days. After that length of time has passed, remove the tape and file away at the warts with an emery board. Repeat until the warts are gone., This stuff has been used for ages for numerous medical purposes. If you can't stand the smell (it's rather potent!), mix it with a better smelling oil, like peppermint. There are a couple different ways to go about this method:


Soak a cotton ball in the stuff and tape onto the wart. Change it three times a day, or as desired.Make a paste with baking soda and apply to the wart. Reapply every few hours. To avoid getting the mixture on your clothes, cover with gauze or a bandage., If you've heard of it working in the fight against acne, it works similarly on genital warts -- with less of a burning sensation than apple cider vinegar. The research is still being done, but it's promising.


Apply it just like the castor oil -- a soaked cotton ball should be left on the wart throughout the day (and night) until the wart has completely disappeared. The length of time is determined by the size of the wart -- weeks to a few months, usually."

Talk to your doctor about surgery.",How to Get Rid of a Wart at the Bottom of Your Foot," Because the source of pain in most plantar warts is the overlaying callous (thickened layer of skin), removing it with something abrasive may make the symptoms disappear.A pumice stone is an inexpensive natural choice for removing dead and calloused skin, but keep in mind it won't entirely remove the plantar wart, most of which lays underneath the skin. Before using the pumice stone as an exfoliator, soak your foot in warm water for 15–20 minutes to soften up the callous.


People with diabetes or peripheral neuropathy should not use a pumice stone on their feet because they have reduced sensations and may damage surrounding tissue.
Most plantar warts aren't considered a medical concern and may not require treatment, especially if they're not painful — sometimes they disappear on their own.;
, Another technique to remove the overlaying callous of a plantar wart is applying an over-the-counter salicylic acid preparation, which is widely available at pharmacies. Salicylic acid is a type of keratolytic, which means it dissolves the keratin (protein) of the callous and the wart;however, keratolytics also destroy/irritate healthy skin, so take care when you apply the liquid, gel or ointment. Before application of the salicylic acid (up to two times per day), soak your foot and file down the callous with a pumice stone or emery boards so the medication can better penetrate into the wart. It can take several weeks to get rid of a plantar wart using salicylic acid, so patience is the key.


Salicylic acid products sometimes contain dichloroacetic (or trichloroacetic) acid.
Plantar warts tend to grow on the heels or balls of the feet, areas that experience the most pressure.
A common feature of plantar wart are small black pinpoints (commonly called wart seeds), which represent clotted blood in the small blood vessels surrounding the wart.

, Apple cider vinegar has anecdotal reports of numerous health benefits, and one of them is combating warts of all types.Apple cider vinegar contains a high percentage of acetic acid, which has antiviral properties (kills HPV and other viruses). However, acetic acid also irritates healthy tissue, so be cautious with application. Try soaking a cotton ball in vinegar and applying it to the plantar wart, then cover it with a bandage overnight and replace the next day. It may take several days to notice significant improvement.


White vinegar is made of acetic acid also, but it doesn't seem to have the impact on warts that apple cider vinegar does.
Other natural compounds with antiviral properties that you can experiment with at home include tea tree oil, oregano oil and fresh garlic.

, There are many anecdotal reports that claim that applying regular duct tape to plantar warts (over the course of a week or so) is an effective treatment, although how it may work is still a mystery.As such, due to its low cost, ease of application and lack of risk, it may be worth a try. Clean the bottom of your foot with rubbing alcohol and securely attach a piece of duct over the plantar wart. Leave it on for 24 hours at a time before replacing it with a fresh piece of tape and repeat this cycle for two to six weeks. This tape method can be used in conjunction with the application of natural antivirals mentioned above.


There is no scientific evidence or study backing up the use of duct tape to get rid of warts.
Some people have reported that other nonporous tape, such as electrical tape, works as well as duct tape for plantar warts.

, Since plantar warts are a manifestation of a viral infection (HPV), it infers that your immune system wasn't strong enough (even temporarily) to fight it off. So focusing on ways to boost your immune system is a logical and sensical approach to naturally getting rid of plantar warts. As such, see a nutritionist, naturopath, practitioner of traditional Chinese medicine or chiropractor about ways to boost your immune system. Getting more sleep (or better quality sleep), eating more fresh fruit and veggies, cutting back on refined sugar (especially soda pop), reducing alcohol consumption, quitting smoking and practicing good hygiene are all proven ways to boost your immune response.Supplements that can boost immunity include vitamins C and D, zinc, echinacea and olive leaf extract.

, Homeopathy is a well-established approach to treating various symptoms and conditions in all ages of people based upon taking minute (very small) amounts of plant compounds that essentially work on a vibrational level.You can schedule an appointment with a certified homeopath or purchase the appropriate over-the-counter homeopathic pills or ointments at a health supplement store.


Compounds commonly recommended for plantar warts include: thuja occidentalis pills, podophyllin ointment, natrum muriaticum pills and nitricum acidum pills.

, Although it might sound strange, an old indigenous Chinese remedy involving treating plantar warts in a ""smoke box"" filled with smoke from burnt leaves of the Populus euphratica tree has been shown to be as effective as conventional medical therapy, such as cryotherapy.The Populous euphratica is a type of poplar tree found in many parts of the world, particularly China and the Middle East. Burning its leaves creates smoke filled with antiviral compounds (salicylates).


Find or purchase Populus euphratica leaves, dry them out and light them on fire in a controlled environment. Let them burn for a few minutes and then cover them so the lack of oxygen snuffs out the flames. Carefully place your feet about six inches over the smoldering leaves and let the smoke infuse the bottom of your foot where the plantar wart is for at least 15 minutes.
Take care not to burn or blister the soles of your feet by making sure the flames are extinguished and you don't get too close to the embers.

, Cryotherapy (performed by your family physician, dermatologist or podiatrist) involves destroying warts by freezing them with liquid nitrogen, which is sprayed on directly or applied with a cotton swab.The liquid nitrogen causes a blister to form over the wart, which turns black and falls off a few days later. Cryotherapy may require several sessions in order to get rid of a plantar wart and it's usually not used on young children due to the pain involved. As such, your doctor may have to numb the area before applying liquid nitrogen.


Cryotherapy, if done correctly, should leave no scarring. Normal skin grows and fills in the void left by the destroyed wart.
Never attempt to apply liquid nitrogen to your skin at home — only under the care or supervision of a doctor. However, there are various ""freeze-off"" compounds available over-the-counter that are more appropriate for home use.

, Prescription medications with salicylic acid work more effectively than over-the-counter products because they are stronger preparations. Your doctor or podiatrist will apply it to your plantar wart at her office initially, but she may suggest you take it home and use it regularly, which removes the layers of the wart little by little. Studies show that salicylic acid is more effective when it's combined with cryotherapy.Because prescription salicylic acid products are more powerful, be careful not to apply too much of it to the healthy skin surrounding the plantar wart, as it might lead to redness and irritation.

, A very common topical preparation applied to plantar warts is cantharidin, a compound that comes from many species of blister beetles.Cantharidin is a terpenoid — a poisonous blistering agent — that burns the wart off. It's often used in combination with salicylic acid compounds. Your doctor will apply the liquid combination of cantharidin and salicylic acid directly to the plantar wart and cover it with a bandage for a week or so. A blister forms, which eventually peels off, although multiple treatments may be needed to fully get rid of the wart.


Cantharidin is fatal if swallowed and not typically given to patients for home use.
The blisters or skin lesions formed by cantharidin typically heal without scarring.

, The advancement of new technologies have enabled doctors to use a variety of lasers in efforts to destroy plantar warts. For example, pulsed-dye laser treatment involves burning and destroying (or cauterizing) the tiny blood vessels that surround and nourish the wart, which causes it to die and eventually flake off.Some lasers can also burn the wart off directly, although topical anesthesia is required.


Laser therapy tends to be expensive, although the evidence for its effectiveness on plantar warts is somewhat limited and not well proven.
Laser therapy can be painful and cause scarring on the foot.

, If home remedies, alternative therapies and various medical treatments fail to get rid of your plantar wart, then talk to your doctor about removing it surgically. Wart removal is considered minor surgery and involves your doctor either cutting away the wart with a scalpel or destroying it by using an electrical or ultrasonic device (called electrodesiccation and curettage).Desiccation is the destruction of the wart tissue and curettage is the scraping away of the dead tissue with a little metal curette. This procedure is painful, so topical anesthesia is given first.


Surgical wart removal techniques invariably leave a scar, and it's not unusual for warts to return in the scar tissue at a later time.
Cutting into the tissue around a plantar wart sometimes causes the wart to spread to other areas of the foot, particularly in people who are immune-compromised.

An accurate diagnosis can help you to develop the best care plan and help ensure that you don’t damage your skin with unnecessary treatments.A doctor will diagnose the warts by examining them.;
, Plantar warts will often disappear on their own without treatment.If your mosaic warts are not painful, consider leaving them to heal without treatment.Mosaic warts, which appear on the feet, are often very painful and you may want to treat them as soon as possible.The only way to ensure that you do not experience a recurrence of mosaic warts is to ensure that they are completely removed.If you decide to not treat your wart, it’s important to understand that you can transmit them to other people. Plantar warts are very contagious., Salicylic acid, which is the active ingredient in aspirin, is an over the counter treatment that is applied to the wart to remove it. Salicylic acid comes in different forms such as gels, liquids, or even patches.You can get salicylic acid treatments for plantar warts at most drug stores and many grocery stores.
Apply salicylic acid every day after soaking your foot to soften the warts.The treatment shouldn’t cause you any pain.Salicylic acid treatments can take weeks to work and remove the warts.Only use salicylic acid on your skin. If you get it on your eyes or in your nose or mouth, rinse it off with water right away.Salicylic acid is not a good treatment option for those with neuropathy, as the numbness makes it difficult to determine tissue damage.

, Although doctors are not sure why this home remedy works, covering your warts in duct tape can help treat and remove mosaic warts. In between treatments, you should file off the dead layers of the wart with a foot file.Apply the duct tape directly over the wart and leave it there for six days.When you remove the duct tape, file off the dead wart layers with a foot file or pumice stone, which you can get in any drugstore.Expose the wart to the air for 12 hours after filing off the layers of dead skin. Reapply the duct tape after this.Continue this treatment of duct tape and filing until the wart is completely gone., Cryotherapy, or using a freezing treatment, can also effectively treat and remove warts. This over the counter medication can be painful and comes with other dangers.You can purchase freezing treatments at most drug stores or some grocery stores.
Freezing is a safe treatment for warts if used according to the package directions. There is minimal risk, though freezing treatments can cause pain.Freezing treatments can be flammable and shouldn’t be used near any fires, flames, heat sources such as curling irons, or lit cigarettes.Freezing treatments are not ideal for treating warts on children, as the process can be too painful.

, Getting rid of the dead or dying skin on a wart may help it to heal faster, especially if you opt to forgo other treatments. Use a pumice stone, emery board, or foot file to gently remove the layers of dead or dying skin from a wart.It’s important that you gently file off the skin on a wart or around it. If you don’t you could damage your skin and potentially spread the warts to other parts of the affected area.

, Grind up 4-5 Vitamin C tablets and make a paste to apply to the warts. This very acidic mixture can help dissolve the warts and fight the virus that causes warts.You can get Vitamin C tablets at most drug and health food stores.
Mix the ground up tablets with distilled water and dab the paste onto your warts. Cover the area with a bandage or duct tape., Soak a cotton ball or bandage in vinegar and administer to your skin with a band aid or elastic tape. Using this treatment daily may help to dissolve your wart.You can use any type of vinegar, though many sources suggest using apple cider vinegar.Leave the compress in place for one to two hours daily., One of the best ways to treat warts is to not get them. There are several options to not spread the virus from wearing proper shoes to not picking at warts.Avoid direct contact with your plantar warts as much as possible and wash your hands after applying treatments.Clean and dry your feet and change your shoes and socks daily.Wear shoes or sandals to places such as pools or gyms, where the risk of contracting warts is high.Don’t pick at your warts, which may spread the virus that causes them., In the case that your mosaic warts don’t heal or get worse with home treatments, consult your doctor. You may need a stronger treatment, such as a laser procedure, to completely remove the warts."

Understand how to freeze a wart.,
Identify the type of wart you have.,
Know when to see a dermatologist.",How to Freeze a Wart With Liquid Nitrogen1," Over-the-counter cold kits use dimethyl ether and propane to freeze the wart and the tissue around the wart. Realize that the wart will not instantly fall off after treatment. It may take several treatments and up to 3 or 4 weeks before the wart gradually disappears.


Warts are caused by a virus that causes the cells in your skin to grow abnormally.Freezing a wart effectively kills the virus.;
, Certain kinds of warts may respond better to freezing treatments than others. Note that if you have warts in the genital region, never attempt to freeze them off at home. They're caused by a virus that your doctor must treat. Other types of warts include:Common warts: These are small, hard bumps that are normally gray or brown. They're typically found on fingers, hands, knees, and elbows and have a rough surface.
Planter warts: These are hard warts located on the bottom of the foot. They're very uncomfortable to walk on.
Flat Warts: These tiny warts are smooth with flat tops. They can be pink, tan, or yellow. You can find them on the face, arms, knees, or hands. Usually, flat warts show up in clusters.

, If you can't get rid of a wart by treating it at home, have several warts increasing in size, or have painful warts, see your doctor or dermatologist. You should also see your doctor if you think the growth isn't a wart, the wart is on your face or genitals, your immune system is weakened, or you are diabetic and have a wart on your foot. Dermatologists will probably be able to diagnose your wart just by looking at it, or may need to run tests. Your dermatologist might do a biopsy where a bit of the tissue is removed from the wart. This allows your dermatologist to study the virus causing your wart.Understand that the virus causing most warts can return. You may notice warts reappear in the same spot or in a new location. If you're having trouble treating recurring warts, don't hesitate to talk with your doctor."

Talk with your doctor about stronger acid peels.,
Discuss cryotherapy with your doctor.,
Talk with you physician about laser treatments.There are two laser procedures used for wart removal.,
Discuss the use of immunotherapy with your doctor.In this process, the doctor will use an intralesional injection of antigens into the wart.,
Discuss surgical options if your wart has not responded to other types of treatments.Podiatrists may choose to use a technique that involves cutting away the wart.",How to Get Rid of Plantar Warts (Verrucas)2," Salicylic acids sold over-the-counter are peeling agents used to reduce the size of the wart. When home treatments are not effective, your physician can use stronger acid peels including bichloracetic acid or trichloroacetic acid.These treatments require several return visits and you may be asked to use salicylic acid between doctor treatments.

, Similar to using a freezing compound at home, cryotherapy uses liquid nitrogen to freeze the wart tissue. After the treatment, a blister forms, heals, and then falls off, taking with it all or part of the wart.


This option is painful and not generally used on young children. Your physician may use a local anesthetic depending upon the size of the area being treated.
Cryotherapy can require several sessions with your doctor for full effectiveness.

, In the the first, the laser cuts the growth away from the skin and in the other, the laser cauterizes the blood vessels that feed the wart, killing it.


Laser surgery can be painful and may require a more longer time period for healing. It is done on an outpatient basis using local anesthesia.

, In other words, they inject toxins into the wart that stimulate your immune system to fight the virus.


This treatment is reserved for warts that are stubborn or have been very resistant to other treatment modalities.

, The doctor uses electric needles to kill the tissue around the wart and entirely remove the wart. The process can be painful and often results in scar tissue; however, it is effective and often has successful long-term results.


NEVER try to cut away a wart at home. This can lead to bleeding and infection when it isn’t done with the proper tools and in a sterile environment.

Figure out if you are at risk of acquiring plantar warts.,
Look at the area you suspect is a plantar wart.,
Assess secondary symptoms.,
Watch for spreading.,
Prevent another infection of plantar warts.,
Avoid spreading your warts to others.",How to Get Rid of Plantar Warts (Verrucas)3," The wart is the result of exposure to human papillomavirus (HPV). There are over 120 different strains of HPV, only five to six of which are responsible for plantar warts.The virus is caught through exposure to skin scales that are infected by the virus.Athletes who shower in common areas are at higher risk due to the increased number of people who use an area, usually without protection over the feet. For instance, swimmers, both indoor and outdoor during the summer months, are at increased risk if they use communal showers and tiled areas around the pool; however, this includes all individuals who use a gym area locker room, shower cubicles, or hot tub areas where people normally walk barefoot.
Individuals who have cracked or peeling skin on the feet give the virus good entry into the body. Also, individuals whose feet remain moist or sweaty throughout the day will have an increased risk as the skin breaks down from overexposure to moisture increasing the risk the virus can gain entry to the body.
Individuals who have had plantar warts once are at higher risk for having them again.For instance, individuals who pick at a wart can spread the virus more easily to other parts of the body.
Individuals who have a compromised immune system from illnesses such as mononucleosis, Epstein-Barr virus, cancer, cancer treatments used for individuals with psoriatic arthritis, or individuals with HIV or AIDS., It should be a small area of skin that is hard and flat with a rough surface and defined boundaries. Although a plantar wart may start out looking like a callus, warts are caused by an infection. There are two ways the plantar wart may infect your foot: either as a solitary wart or as a cluster, called mosaic plantar warts.A solitary or single wart will increase in size and may eventually multiply into several solitary warts that are satellites of the original wart.
Mosaic plantar warts are a cluster of warts without clear skin between them. They are not satellites of each other, but rather grow very closely together and appear to be one rather large wart. Mosaic warts are more difficult to treat than solitary warts.

, Is the area painful? While plantar warts may look like calluses on the bottom of the feet, they are painful when standing and are painful when they are squeezed.


Look for black specks inside the thickened skin. These are often called wart “seeds” but are actually small clotted blood vessels inside the wart., Warts are contagious between people and on your own body. Three small plantar warts on the bottom of your foot can quickly spread to 10 satellite warts, making the situation more difficult to treat.


As with most medical conditions, the earlier you find a wart and start treatment the easier it is to experience successful results.

, After treatment and resolution you are more at risk for another infection with HPV, which causes plantar warts. To begin with, wear flip flops or other waterproof shoes in public areas, showers, locker rooms, saunas, pools and hot tubs. Also, keep your feet clean and dry. Change your socks daily and use a foot powder if your feet are sweaty.


Use coconut oil on your feet in the evening before bed to prevent cracked and peeling skin. Use a pair of clean socks after applying a dime size amount of coconut oil to each foot.

, Do not scratch or pick at a wart you already have. This can spread it to other parts of your body or to others.


Do not touch other people’s warts and do not wear socks or shoes that belong to other people.
Wear flip flops or other waterproof shoes in the shower at home when you have warts to prevent the spread to other family members.
Keep clothing, towels and socks off the floor of public locker room and pool areas.

By introducing the virus to your bloodstream, you help your body see the wart and fight against it, which can lead to its disappearance from your body. This method is very effective for some people, especially for those with several warts, as even the poking of one wart on your body can help your body discover the others and destroy them.

, Apply it to the wart and then cover it with a bandage.Leave it on for the day then at night let it breathe (take off bandage)

, Cover it with an adhesive bandage. Remove the bandage at night to let it breathe, then start over with the oil in the morning. Repeat three times a day.

, Soak the wart in hot water until it softens. Scrape it down with a piece of coarse exfoliating pumice until you reach level with the skin. Take bleach on a cotton swab and hold it against the wart for 15 minutes (this may sting a bit). You must wash the area well after applying bleach.

, Dab a little on the wart and cover with a strip bandage. Do this for up to three weeks.

, The acid in castor oil irritates the wart and works best on small, flat warts on the face and back of hands. Apply castor oil to the wart with a cotton swab twice a day.

, Take a few aspirins and crunch them up, adding a few drops of water. Take the mixture and put it onto the effected wart areas, then apply an adhesive bandage.. Leave on overnight. Aspirin is the ingestible form of salicylic acid, but much cheaper than most commercial lotions.

Refresh the peel every day or so and keep the wart covered for as long as possible. After about a week or so, the entire wart will come out completely.

, Tape crushed, fresh basil to your wart using waterproof first-aid tape. Do this daily for up to a week. The virus-killing compound in the basil leaf will kill your wart.

, Do this twice a day for at least several weeks. Warts should start peeling off in one or two weeks, but take the garlic until the wart disappears. You can also cover the wart with garlic oil once or twice daily for a month., Garlic, sweet potatoes, whole-grain breads, sunflower seeds and rice are all examples of this.

, Soak your wart in pineapple juice. It has a dissolving enzyme.

, The potassium may help speed the disappearance of the wart.

, Cut out a section of the peel so it's slightly smaller than the tape you'll be using. Rub the inside of a banana peel onto the wart and then secure with duct tape. Keep it on the wart for a day before removing. Repeat until wart is fully removed.

, Curcumin is a turmeric extract that can be found in health food stores. Combine curcumin, papaya extract (Papain. It may have to be purchased in pill form and crushed into powder), and vitamin E oil.


Dab the wart and surrounding area with alcoholic extract of golden seal. This will stimulate local immune activity.
Take a sharp needle or pin and dip it into the curcumin paste. Press the needle as deep into the wart as possible. Continue injecting more of the paste into the wart, poking several holes if necessary.
Spread the remaining paste over the wart area and cover with medical tape. This technique is effective against flat warts, which are found on the face and hands. Flat warts are notoriously stubborn and will often remain on the skin after the body has acquired resistance to the virus. This will finish the warts off in lieu of freezing.

, Take a cotton ball (only enough to cover the wart) and soak it in the vinegar. Secure with a band aid overnight. Keep in mind that this might be very painful. Change the cotton pad daily and keep it on every night if you can. After one week, the body of the wart will start to peel off and you can gently scrape it away to reveal healthy flesh beneath. Let the area heal once this is done.

Moisten the wart and apply a large flake of sea salt to it.


Put a band-aid or tape over the wart to hold the salt in place and observe for several days, replacing it after you shower or if it falls off.

, Mix baking powder and castor oil into a paste, then apply it to the wart at night by covering it with a bandage. Remove the bandage the next morning. Repeat as necessary.

, Soaking plantar warts in very hot water is helpful because it softens the wart and may kill the virus. Make sure the water is not hot enough to cause burns—keep it under 140°F (60°C).

, Pick a fresh dandelion and Break the stem. Apply the milky sap that oozes from the stem onto the wart. Repeat this three or four times a day. Scrape the wart with pumice to remove dead layers of skin. Continue doing this until the wart fades away.

Take an oatmeal bath.",How to Get Rid of Genital Warts at Home2," After a quick trip to the grocery store, you're ready to start treating those bad boys. If you can stomach it, simply apply a bit to a cotton ball (just like with the castor oil) and leave it on the wart overnight. Wash it off in the morning. The warts should be completely gone (and with a noticeable difference in hours) in 2-3 weeks.This method can be rather painful. If you've tried to leave it on overnight but can't handle the very literal burn, apply it to the wart in 15 minute increments throughout the day.

, It's official -- garlic is the duct tape of the kitchen. If you want to stay away from western medicine (and vampires), garlic is how you do it. As for vitamin E oil, a good substitute is fish oil (super high in Vitamin E).


For this method, rub the wart with the oil generously. Then, cover the area with crushed garlic. Place gauze over the wart (and garlic spread) and leave for up to 48 hours. After that window of time has passed, take it off and reapply., Second in command to the all-powerful garlic is the onion. Though science may beg to differ, grandmas and housewives alike swear by the stuff. Take a few onion slices to the wart and cover with a bandage, letting the juices do their magic. Reapply every few hours., If you didn't already know of the wonders of oatmeal for your health (super food to the rescue!), it's great for your skin, too. It won't get rid of the warts, but it will lessen the irritation, pain, and constant itchiness.If immersing your entire body in a warm bath isn't down your hygienic alley, make a scrub from 1 tablespoon oatmeal and water to use as an exfoliate.

Be careful where you apply your remedies.,
Don't scratch or itch at your warts.,
Keep your genitals dry.,
Stick to a healthy diet.,
See your doctor.",How to Get Rid of Genital Warts at Home3," If you're using creams and products dedicated to wart removal, make sure to only use them on the wart itself. If you get them on unaffected areas, it's no party. Your skin can blister, redden, swell, and otherwise add to your laundry list of woes.


That being said, make sure you have genital warts before you go treating these as genital warts! Applying apple cider vinegar to your genitals and spending the night moaning in a fiery agony is not the price you should pay for a particularly bad ingrown hair.

, If you do, you risk bursting the warts open, causing the virus to spread and more warts to spawn. Now there's a pretty picture. Try the oatmeal bath, a bath with calming bath salts, or applying a cold compress to relieve the itching.Spreading the virus is a concern you should have. Consider washing your under garments separately and in hot water, along with not wearing the same ones for longer than 6-8 hours., A moist environment is a breeding ground for bacteria. If you don't dry the area, you could be exacerbating the problem. Allows thoroughly dry down with a towel or use a blow dryer. If the warts are dry, they'll heal more quickly.If you do use a blow dryer, use the low heat setting. You don't want to hurt yourself!, As with any infection, your body has to fight it off. In most cases, HPV will actually go away on its own.However, if you choose to do nothing, your case may get much, much worse before it goes away -- if it goes away. Cover your bases and keep your immune system top notch.


Eat a healthy diet. That means loading up on fruits, veggies, whole grains, and getting plenty of vitamins and minerals. The better you feel, the quicker your body can restore itself.
Take efforts to ward off sickness by always washing your hands and keeping good hygiene. The fewer viruses your body has to fight off, the more it can concentrate on the issue at hand, clearing up the warts sooner rather than later.

, The absolute best way to treat genital warts is through a prescription, like Aldara, Efudex and Podofilox.These are proven to fight off warts in a safe and timely manner. What's more, your doctor is a wealth of information on how to handle the whole situation -- mentally and emotionally, this circumstance can be very draining.


Furthermore, there are still no medical claims that have approved these home remedies. A visit to the doctor is highly recommended because even when you are successful in getting rid of the genital wart, there is no guarantee the virus is completely gone.

This can help ensure that you get the most effective, least invasive, and most painless treatment for your warts.

, Your doctor may decide to treat your warts topically with a mixture of cantharidin and salicylic acid. You may see results within a week to a few months.Your doctor will apply the mixture directly to your wart and cover it with a bandage.The treatment will cause a blister to form under the wart, which may peel off the wart.Cantharidin treatment is painless when administered, but often becomes painful after 24 hours., Similar to over the counter cryotherapy, your doctor may opt to freeze off your wart with liquid nitrogen. This can be a painful treatment that requires multiple applications.Your doctor will apply the liquid nitrogen directly to the wart. Like cantharidin, this will cause a blister to form under the wart and help peel it away., Your doctor may choose a chemical peel to treat your wart. She may apply it in the office or give it to you to do at home.In general, your doctor will use a higher concentration salicylic acid to peel away the wart than is commercially available., In this often very painful treatment, your doctor will shave away the surface of the wart and apply a bichloracetic or trichloroacetic acid to the affected area. This type of treatment requires frequent doctor’s visits.You will need to return to your doctor’s office weekly for treatments with this method.Your doctor may ask you to apply salicylic acid to the wart in between visits.Shaving and applying acid can cause burning and be very painful., If your warts are especially acute or persistent, you doctor may treat them with laser therapy. Laser treatments cauterize tiny blood vessels, causing infected tissue to die and the wart to fall off.There is little evidence for the effectiveness of laser therapy.Laser treatments can cause pain and scarring.For this reason, they are often used as a last resort for treatment., If other methods of medical treatment do not heal your warts, your doctor may try immunotherapy. They may inject your warts with antigens or apply creams to the warts.The goal of immunotherapy is to stimulate your immunotherapy to destroy the wart.Immunotherapy can be painful and cause scarring and is used less often than other treatments."

Prepare the area and your supplies.,
Assemble the spray kit.,
Charge the canister.,
Apply the freezing compound to your wart.",How to Freeze a Wart With Liquid Nitrogen2," Take care to wash the wart area and your hands. Most OTC spray kits will come with a canister that contains the cryogen, or very cold compounds. It should also come with a foam applicator. Treatments don't take very long, so make sure you have all the supplies on hand.


Always read and follow the specific instructions that came with your kit.

, Take the applicator, usually a stick with a foam tip, into its handle. Set the spray can so that it sits level on a sturdy surface. You'll want to insert the handle into the top of the spray can.Take care not to hold the spray can near your face. The spray compound is very cold, so take precautions to keep it from accidentally spraying.

, Keep the spray can on the table and hold it with one hand. With your other hand, press down on the handle till you hear a hissing sound. Keep pressing it for another 2 to 3 seconds. This will soak the applicator with the cryogen. You can now take out the handle with the applicator. Wait 30 seconds.When you look at the applicator, you should see that it's saturated and looks frosty. You might smell the dimethyl ether.

, Gently press the applicator against your wart. Don't rub, just press. Most kits recommend pressing the applicator against the wart for 20 seconds or less, depending on the size of the wart. Remove the applicator, taking care not to touch it. Throw it away and wash your hands.If the wart is on the top of your finger or toe, slowly move the finger or toe while you're applying the compound. You'll probably feel aching, itching, or stinging.

Let the wart rest.",How to Freeze a Wart With Liquid Nitrogen3," Liquid nitrogen should not be used at home, since it can cause tissue damage if you apply it incorrectly. If you want to treat your wart at home, use a different method.


Freezing with liquid nitrogen is poorly tolerated in young children due to pain and discomfort.
Liquid nitrogen must be used carefully to avoid nerve damage and neuropathy.
Never use liquid nitrogen the face. Use it cautiously when treating dark pigmented skin colors so as not to cause discoloration of the skin.

, The doctor will pour a small amount of liquid nitrogen into a polystyrene cup. This keeps the liquid nitrogen sanitary, especially if several people are using it. A cotton swab is then soaked in the substance and applied to the wart. The swab should be applied directly to the middle of the wart with light pressure. This is repeated until a frozen zone appears. It should be white in color. The doctor will gradually apply more pressure to finish freezing the wart.


EMLA cream may be used to decrease pain and discomfort.
The frozen tissue will become hard, and if you pinch from the sides you will feel that there is frozen tissue between your fingers.

, While the wart should be mostly white, the color will slowly return. If you think it may not have been frozen deeply enough, you can repeat the process. There will be some minor spikes of cold pain.


Major pain is a sign that healthy skin has been damaged by the liquid nitrogen.

Use bandages.,
Leave the wart alone.,
Re-treat if needed.",How to Freeze a Wart With Liquid Nitrogen4," You may not want or need to cover the treated wart with a bandage if it's not causing you discomfort. But, if you have a planter wart on your foot, you'll probably need a special cushioned bandage to make walking more comfortable.


Most bandages for planter's warts are circular and cushioned around the edges. The center of the bandage isn't as cushioned, so it takes pressure off the wart. This is what makes walking more comfortable.

, You may notice a blister or blood blister form a few hours after freezing the wart. The area may burn a bit and the wart might look irritated. Healing usually takes four to seven weeks. Don't break the blister or scrape off any dead skin. This can expose the tissue underneath the the virus, making the wart grow back.

, If the wart doesn't look like it's getting smaller, you may need to re-apply the freezing compound. Wait 2 to 3 weeks and repeat the freezing process for OTC kits. If you received a liquid nitrogen treatment, make an appointment with your dermatologist to reassess and see if another application is necessary.


Warts can be sometimes hard to remove. Sometimes the doctor might want to try a couple of methods at one time in for to facilitate removal.
Understand that since OTC compounds don't get as cold as the liquid nitrogen used by doctors to freeze warts. Because of this, it may take several treatments and more time before your wart falls off."

Examine your risk factors.,
Distinguish your symptoms from other infections/conditions.,
See your doctor.",How to Cure Genital Warts in Men1," Some behaviors put you at a higher risk for an HPV infection. Ask yourself the following questions since your doctor will most likely ask the same questions when you go in for testing:How many sexual partners do you have? The more partners, the more likely you can acquire the virus.
Do you use condoms? This barrier helps reduce sexually transmitted diseases, including HPV.
How old are you? Genital warts have a prevalence with adolescents, teenagers, and young adults.
Do you have a severe infection or cancer, or are you taking drugs that damage your immune system? Infections such as HIV/AIDS reduce the body's ability to fight infections. Blood cancers such as leukemia alter our immune cells and cause them to be dysfunctional. Drugs such as steroids reduce our immune system over time.
Did you notice any skin damage to your genitals? Breaks in your skins such as cuts give the virus an opportunity to enter your body.
Do you have an uncircumcised penis? Men who have not had their foreskin of the penis removed are more likely to acquire HPV and pass it along to their partners.;
, You may confuse warts for other conditions. It is best to schedule an appointment with your doctor for proper diagnosis. Look for the following characteristics to help you distinguish at home.


HPV warts are flesh-colored lesions. Redder, fluid-filled blisters are more likely genital herpes.
HPV warts are not fluid-filled and do not burst open. Genital herpes blisters are painful and can open—forming a sore—and spill fluid before healing. An ulcer (open skin lesion) on your penis can also signify the first stage of syphilis. Lesions caused by syphilis are usually painless;
Though not always painless, pain and itchiness is more associated with herpes and genital warts.
Other symptoms—including a red rash on the palms and soles, white patches in the mouth and genitals, fever, hair loss, and sore throat—in addition to genital warts may be secondary stage syphilis.
Multiple small bumps circumferentially around the base of tip of the penis that are either flesh colored, red, yellow, pink, or translucent could be a condition known as pearly penile papules and are completely harmless. This is considered a normal variant of penile skin and is not contagious.HPV warts are not dimpled. A dimple on the top of the wart can indicate a viral infection known as mulluscum contagiosum. Mulluscum can be a sign of HIV infection as well.

, Ultimately, a visit to your doctor is the best way to identify potential HPV warts. Your doctor will also help to determine the best treatment option. Usually HPV warts clear up within a few months and about 90% within two years without any treatment.Sometimes a doctor will not provide treatment except to wait see if the warts regress or if you develop more bothersome symptoms. If you decide not to visit the doctor, observe the warts for:


Increase in size
Increase in number
Developing more in new places on your body
Developing more specific symptoms such as itchiness, pain, bleeding from the wart, hair loss, fever, white patches on mouth or genital area, sore throat, and an ulcer on the penis. As previously mentioned syphilis can cause warts and early detection and treatment with antibiotics is warranted. Syphilis can eventually lead to neurological problems over time if left untreated.
Age & cancer — HPV is responsible for approximately 63% of penile cancer in the USA. The median age of diagnosis is 68 years old but can be as early as in your 30s.If you observe other symptoms such as fatigue, weight loss, blood from your penis, lumps on your penis, velvety rash, hardened penile skin, and smelly discharge, then a visit to the doctor is urgent."

Avoid touching warts as much as possible.,
Learn the different wart types.",How to Get Rid of Warts5," Warts are small growths on the body, and are caused by the human papilloma virus (HPV), and can spread to other parts of your body.


It's also possible to spread the HPV virus to others through cuts, open sores, or sexual activities.

, They come in various shapes and sizes, and usually present themselves as a raised round or oval growth on the skin.

Common warts. These can appear anywhere on the body. Most often they are seen on the hands. They are rough in appearance, rounded, and are grayish-brown.






Flat warts. These are usually found on the face, legs, and arms. They are small, flat (as the name implies), and can be spread by shaving.







Plantar warts. These grow on the soles of your feet, and look like thick patches of skin with dark speckles. They can be extremely painful.







Genital warts. These are found on and around the genital region, between the thighs, and can also appear in the vagina and anus.






Subungual and periungual warts. These appear under fingernails and toenails. They are rough bumps with an uneven surface.






Filiform warts. These generally appear around the mouth and nose. They are skin-colored, and have thready growths sticking out of them.

Avoid over-the-counter treatments.,
See your doctor.,
Inquire about immune response modifiers.,
Ask about cytotoxic drug options.,
Look into home remedies.",How to Cure Genital Warts in Men2," It is advised not to apply any over-the-counter remedies to the genital area. The genital skin is very sensitive and delicate and applying chemicals without proper knowledge and training can lead to damage.

, Your doctor will perform a routine visual examination of the warts and the rest of your body looking for any additional warts. The doctor may apply a small solution of trichloroacetic acid to the area, which will whiten the warts to make them more visible and which can be used as a treatment to remove the warts. You will want to talk to your doctor for recommended treatment options.


Treatments are based on many factors, including size and number of the warts, the area affected, previous treatments administered, and whether the outbreak is recurrent or not.
Remember also that there is no cure for the virus only the wart itself.

, These medications will boost immune proteins in your body to help it get rid of the wart. These medications are available in various types, including:Imiquimod — Your doctor will apply a 5% imiquimod cream to the area using protective gloves and a pad. They will prescribe a prescription for the cream afterward. At home, apply the cream before bed using disposable gloves or disposable pads. After waking up in the morning (six to 10 hours after applying treatment), wash the area with soap and water to remove it. Apply three times per week for the next sixteen weeks.
Interferon alpha — At the base of each wart, your doctor will inject 3 million international units (IU) of interferon. You will repeat this process with the doctor three times per week for the next three weeks. For bigger warts multiple injection may be done. The warts should disappear after four to eight weeks. If the warts remain after 12 – 16 weeks, your doctor may suggest a second treatment course.

, These drugs can destroy the warts and prevent the spread of them. However, they can also damage normal skin areas. If spilled or accidentally applied to an unaffected area, immediately remove the drug on the area(s) with water and soap. Side effects can include be pain, irritation, itchiness, and redness. Options include:Podofilox — This is the preferred treatment for lesions less than 10 cm². To ensure correct usage (0.5 ml or 0.5g), your doctor will show you how much and how to apply the medication. Apply to the area using a cotton swab if liquid or finger if gel. Repeat for three consecutive days twice a day followed by four days of no treatment. Repeat this process for up to four weeks.
Trichloroacetic acid (TCA) and bichloracetic acid (BCA) are both physician-applied treatments. Your doctor will apply the acid to the warts on a cotton ball. Your doctor may advise weekly treatment for up to four to six weeks. This is one of the most common treatments.
Podophyllin — This is a physician-applied medication for warts less than 10 cm². Your physician will apply to the affected area sparingly. Your doctor will advise you to air dry the affected area to prevent it coming in contact with your clothes. Initial treatment should be left on for 30 – 40 min. Subsequent treatments can be from one to four hours, after which remove with soap and water. This treatment can be applied weekly for up to six weeks.
This drug must not be used in pregnancy or possible pregnancy. Limit exposure to a female partner.
5-Fluorouracil — Your physician may apply the first dose or provide a prescription. Using a cotton swab apply it to the clean, affected area one to three times per week. Use sparingly. Let the cream air dry to prevent contamination of your clothes. After three to 10 hours (specified with your prescriptions), wash the area with soap and water to remove it.
Sinecatechins — Your doctor may prescribe this green tea extract. Use your finger to apply a small layer of 15% ointment to the affected area sparingly. Repeat three times daily with your finger for up to sixteen weeks or till warts have disappeared. Do not wash off and avoid sexual contact.

, There are a number of home remedies targeted for wart removal, though clinical studies are lacking. According to naturopathic physicians, you can use many plant-based creams such as aloe vera, as well as vitamin A, C, and E supplements.Discussing a proper treatment with a naturopathic physician would be advised.


The concept of these treatment options is to correct for any nutritional deficiencies, which in turn will help your immune system fight off the warts. In addition, many of these treatments contain antioxidants that can fight infections.

Consult your doctor about surgical options.,
Ask about cryosurgery.,
Inquire about electrosurgery.,
Determine if surgical excision is the right option.,
Ask your doctor about laser surgery.",How to Cure Genital Warts in Men3," Your doctor may suggest these options when large numbers of warts are present or a large area is affected. Your doctor may also recommend one of these options if you’ve had several recurrences of HPV warts.

, An application of liquid nitrogen solution freezes the water found inside the warts, causing destruction of the cells that make up the warts.The provider will clean the area of the warts with an alcohol swab. An applicator tip containing liquid nitrogen will be applied to each wart until up to a 5mm margin of surrounding skin is frozen. An additional thirty seconds of freezing will be done until the skin turns white followed by a thawing period where the white area disappears. If the pain is bearable another period of freezing will be done.


Within 24 hours, a small fluid filled sac (bulla) forms over the treated area. An additional course of treatment can be applied in one to two weeks as necessary.After two to four treatments within six to 12 weeks, 75-80% of patients experience a complete clearing of warts.Store kits are available for this procedure, but healthcare professionals recommend having a doctor administer it.

, This uses a high-frequency electrical current needle to cut the warts. Your doctor will apply a local anesthetic to the area first.Following the procedure your doctor may prescribe pain medication if needed.


Electrosurgery has been found effective for a small number of lesions on the shaft of the penis., For this option, your doctor will cut the wart out with a scalpel. For a minimal number of small warts, your doctor will inject 1% lidocaine anesthesia to numb the area. However, general anesthesia may be used for more extensive cases. Your doctor may suture the two sides of healthy skin back together depending on the size of the excised wart., This method uses a carbon dioxide laser to evaporate the wart and is especially helpful in recurrent cases. This is an outpatient procedure done at your doctor's office (usually a dermatologist). Your doctor will administer a general or regional anesthetic to prevent any pain or discomfort from the laser.Your doctor will likely prescribe pain medication for after the procedure since most patients report significant discomfort after the surgery.It is extremely important not to move while the laser is targeted on your skin as this may lead to damage to normal tissue.

Know doctors’ recommendations.,
Assess your circumstances.,
Do not pop blisters from a sunburn or other burn.,
Leave blood blisters alone.,
Wash your hands.,
Wash the blistered area with soap and water, rubbing alcohol, or antiseptic.Antiseptics such as betadine are available at most pharmacies.,
Prepare the needle or blade.,
Pop it on the sides.,
Drain it.,
Do not tear away the skin.,
Apply antibiotic ointment and cover with a bandage.,
Soak your body, feet, or hands periodically after the blister has been popped.,
Watch for signs of infection.,
Prevent further blisters.",How to Pop a Blister," Doctors usually caution against popping a blister because that blister is technically padding an area of damaged skin underneath and covering a sterile environment. Popping the blister opens up your skin to infection., Ask yourself if you should pop this blister in this circumstance.Where is your blister located? Popping a blister on your foot is generally safer than popping a cold sore on your lip or inside your mouth. Cold sores and blisters inside your mouth should be evaluated by a doctor.
Does it look infected? If your blister has yellowish pus oozing from it, it is likely infected and you should see a doctor.Is the blister interfering with your daily life, such as preventing you from walking? If the answer is yes, and you can safely pop it, this might be the right circumstance.

, If you have sunburn blisters, this is a second-degree burn and is severe enough that you should see a doctor. Do not pop sunburn blisters – they are protecting the skin underneath as it regenerates after the burn. See a doctor for treatment and protect your skin from the sun while it heals.Second degree burns such as those that result in blisters are to be treated gently, with a prescription burn cream. See your doctor for the prescription and to learn how to care for the sunburn blisters., A blood blister, sometimes called black heel or black palm, is a reddish-purple-black discolouration under the skin from broken blood vessels below the epidermis in the dermal layer of skin. Friction over bony prominences, such as the back of the heel, lead to shearing of the blood vessels and the release of blood into the skin.Blood blisters indicate a deeper level of injury. They generally resolve on their own but some people mistake them for melanoma so, if you are unsure, consult your doctor.

, Use soap and warm water, lathering your hand for 20 seconds before rinsing.Use regular unscented soap to wash your hands. This will prevent any chemical irritants from exacerbating the blister site and prevent transmission of any bacteria from your hands to the fragile skin area once the blister is popped.

, However be careful with betadine as it can temporarily stain the skin and can stain clothing and other surfaces.
Gently pour the betadine or rubbing alcohol over the blister and surrounding area. If you are washing the site with soap and water, use a regular unscented soap, lather your hands, gently wash the affected area but be careful to not apply pressure so you do not pop the blister, and rinse well.

, It is best to use a single use, pre-packaged, sterile needle or scalpel blade, often found in pharmacies and medical supply stores.If you choose to use a sewing needle from home, soak it in rubbing alcohol first.
Do not insert the needle or blade into a flame, which gives off carbon particles that would irritate the skin and possibly increase infection., Lance the blister in 2 or 3 places where gravity will help it drain. Do this by popping the blister on each side, near its bottom edge.Do not try the blister-threading method, which proposes literally threading a needle and thread through your blister. This method offers an increased risk of infection.

, Let the blister drain naturally with gravity or gently apply pressure in a downwards fashion, from the top of the blister to the bottom where you lanced it, letting the fluid drain through the holes.Do not push forcefully or tear at the blister to release the fluid. You may cause trauma to the skin underneath.

, Pulling at the dead skin that was once your blister can irritate surrounding healthy skin and leave your skin open to infection. Simply wash the site with soap and water or antiseptic, then cover with a bandage., This prevents bacteria from entering the site and allows for a relief of pressure on the blister area.Reapply the ointment and change your bandage every day until the skin has completely healed, which may take about a week.If you're not too concerned with infection, you can apply Vaseline or Aquaphor instead of an antibiotic ointment.

, Epsom salts help to further draw out fluid. For the next few days, put a half a cup of epsom salts in warm water and soak your foot or have an Epsom salt bath for 20 minutes once a day., Any increase in redness, swelling, pain, or pus indicate a possible infection and you may need to see your doctor and get antibiotics.You may have an infection if the area around the blister increases in redness and swelling. You may have a fever above your normal temperature of 37C. If the area is more painful than having the blister itself and accompanies any of these other symptoms, you may have an infection.
Pus is a yellowish discharge that oozes from an infected site. If your blister or popped blister is weeping this yellowing discharge, see a doctor for a potential infection.

, Remove pressure from bony areas. Use doughnut hole pressure pads as needed. If you are a runner, you may need to consider getting a new pair of shoes or socks that fit appropriately to reduce friction and have moisture management properties.If you are a rower, wear gloves specific for water sports or fashion an oar grip out of tape to decrease friction against your oar."

Remove pressure from the blood blister.,
Apply ice to the blister if it is painful immediately after the injury.,
Under normal circumstances, do not pop the blood blister.",How to Treat a Blood Blister1," Start by eliminating any pressure and exposing the blister to the air. You want to make sure nothing rubs against it, or presses down on it. Exposing it to the air allows it to start healing naturally. If it is not under any pressure, it will stay intact and the chances of it tearing or bursting and becoming infected are lessened., Ice packs can be applied to the area for 10 to 30 minutes at a time.You can do this to reduce the pain and to cool it if it is warm and throbbing. Icing the blister can be done regularly too, not just immediately after the injury.


Don't place ice directly on the skin, since this can cause a cold burn. Instead, place a towel between the ice and the skin to protect the injured area.Gently applying Aloe vera gel to the blood blister can ease pain and swelling., It may be enticing, but popping the blister can lead to infection and delay the body's natural healing process. If the blood blister is in a place that normally gets pressure, try not to put extended pressure on it.

"
"
Leave the blister alone if it has not popped and you can endure the pain.,
Soak the affected area in warm water.,
Cushion the affected area with moleskin.,
Let your blister breathe.",How to Heal Blisters1," It is better to avoid exposure to bacteria by letting the blister heal naturally without trying to pop it. If you feel like you must drain the blister read the medical warnings and instructions below.;
, One method is to simply soak the affected area. Use a clean bowl or sink and fill it with enough warm water to cover the area (your foot or hand, for example). Soak for 15 minutes. The warm water will soften the skin at the top of the blister, which can help the blister drain on its own., If your blister is in a spot that receives pressure, such as the bottom of the foot, you might want to cushion the area with a piece of moleskin. Moleskin is a soft cotton fabric, typically with an adhesive backing. This will relieve some discomfort. It can also help protect the blister.


Cut a piece of moleskin a little bigger than your blister. Cut away the center so that it fits around the blister like a donut. Stick this to the blister.
You can also try other adhesives like Blist-O-Ban and Elastikon.

, For most blisters, especially smaller ones, exposure to air will help the healing process. Give your blister some air. If the blister is on your foot, take care not to let dirt get on the blister.You may need to wait until bedtime before you uncover your blister. Let the affected area air out overnight while you’re sleeping.

"
"
Apply a moleskin pad.,
Wear a loose-fitting bandage.,
Use a blister plaster.,
Assess the blister.",How to Heal Blisters from Rowing1," Some people believe it's best to leave a blister as it is until it heals because the skin over the blister is like a natural band-aid that provides a barrier against infection. Draining a blister increases the risk of infection, especially if you have a chronic condition like diabetes, HIV, cancer, or heart disease.If you can avoid draining it, the best way to let a blister heal is by applying a moleskin pad to it and leaving it undisturbed.


Use a doughnut-shaped moleskin pad. This will leave the area directly over the blister open so it can breathe and heal.Moleskin pads reduce friction to the surface of the blister, allowing it to heal on its own.
Change the padding daily, and keep the area clean.;
, A bandage will provide similar protection as a moleskin pad, but will completely cover the blister (instead of leaving the top area open). A simple adhesive bandage will do, and it should help keep the skin intact while also reducing some of the friction.A bandage is more protective, but may not reduce friction as well as a moleskin pad.
You can use clean gauze and medical tape to cover larger blisters.Change the bandaging every day, and keep the area clean.

, Blister plasters are not actually made of plaster. Instead, the blister plaster acts as a second layer of skin, and protects the blister even when your skin is wet.Rub the blister plaster gently between your hands (provided your hands are clean). This can help improve the blister plaster's ability to stick to your skin.
Apply the plaster taut over the skin, covering the entire blister. This will help reduce pain while allowing the blister to heal.
Change the plaster daily, and keep the area clean.

, If you can keep the blister covered and it is not causing you any problems, it's best to let it heal on its own. However, if the blister is swollen, filled with fluid, and making it difficult to row or perform other tasks, then you may want to consider lancing and draining the blister in a sterile procedure.Only you will be able to accurately assess how functional your blister is.
If you are unsure of how to proceed, or do not feel capable of safely draining the blister in a sterile manner, talk to your doctor about how to treat or manage the blister.

Surgically remove the blood blister.",How to Diagnose and Treat Blood Blisters in Cats," The single most noticeable symptom of blood blisters is bumps that appear just below the skin. If you notice your cat developing bumps, you should investigate them. When looking at bumps, look to see if:


The bump is raised slightly.
If there are multiple bumps in the same area.;
, One of the hallmarks of a blood blister is its reddish color. The blood blister is red because it reflects the blood that is pooling just below the skin. In the end, the darkness of the bump is one of the best indications that it is a blood blister and not another type of blister or growth.


Don’t confuse blood blisters with other hematomas. For instance, other hematomas may be yellowish or a much lighter color red., Larger blisters or ones in problematic locations may cause your cat pain. However, it is important to note that not all blisters are painful and blisters are not the only type of growth that may cause pain.


Try to notice if your cat experiences pain when you or they touch the blister.
Blisters around the neck or in your cat's ear may cause your cat significant discomfort.
Blood blisters on the pads of your cat’s feet may cause your cat to limp., After noticing evidence of blood blisters, you need to make an appointment with your vet. As a trained professional with substantial experience, your vet can properly identify and diagnose blood blisters.


The vet will question you about your cat’s history of blood blisters, possible trauma, or any other symptoms.
If you’ve noticed changes in the blood blister, such as bleeding from it, let your vet know.

, Your vet may need to run tests to find out the cause of blood blisters or to determine if the growth is in fact a blood blister. Without testing, you and your vet will have incomplete data and won’t be able to arrive at a proper diagnosis.


Your vet may take a biopsy of the blister and send it off for a pathological analysis. This analysis will test to see if the bump is a blood blister or if it is some sort of cancer, fungus, or growth.
Your vet may order a blood platelet count test to see if your cat has any blood disorders., When diagnosing blood blisters, you need to make sure you rule out other conditions that may show similar symptoms. This is important, as other conditions may pose a much more serious threat to your cat’s health.


Be aware that blood blisters are sometimes confused with modular melanoma – a potentially life threatening cancer if left untreated., Blood blisters are caused by a variety of conditions. By thinking about the underlying causes of blood blisters, you’ll be better able to diagnose them and to understand why your cat develops them. Some major causes include:


Excess friction or pressure on a specific part of your cat’s body. For example, your cat may develop a blood blister underneath their collar.
Trauma to a part of the body.
Blood diseases., Most blood blisters will be slowly absorbed by the body. While the blister might be unsightly for a while, it is best to follow the advice of your veterinarian and to allow it to resolve itself.


Blood blisters may take between a month and a month and a half to disappear.
You will likely see the bump slowly reduce before discoloration disappears.
Avoid irritating the blood blister if your vet recommends leaving it alone.
If your cat seems intent on licking the blister, you may need to purchase an Elizabethan collar from a pet supply store near you. The collar will prevent your cat from getting to the blister., In some cases, a veterinarian may recommend aspiration of the blister. When this happens, the veterinarian will puncture the blister and allow the blood – or other fluid – to drain.


Aspiration may not be effective as the blister may refill with blood.
Your veterinarian may recommend aspiration if the blister has not gone away on its own over a month or two., While most blood blisters are benign and should not cause any health problems for your cat, in rare circumstances your vet may recommend surgical removal.


Blisters in problematic locations, such as under a cat’s collar or in their ear, may require surgical removal.
Depending on the severity of the blister, surgical removal might not require full anesthesia.
Your vet may send the blister off to pathology, if they have any concern that it is in fact a melanoma or another type of cancer."

Protect blister-prone areas.",How to Deal with a Blister when Running," If you start feeling skin irritation while running, stop and check your shoes for debris right away. Even the tiniest pebble can rub against your skin, causing a painful blister.It's always a good idea to check your shoes for debris before you go running.;
, You will typically experience hot spots, which are characterized by pain and redness, before a blister forms. If you can, it's best to take action to prevent further skin irritation at this point. If you need to continue running, you can apply a protective covering to the affected area, such as moleskin, a water-based gel-pad dressing, a liquid bandage, or even duct tape. These will all help prevent further friction from damaging your skin and creating a blister.You can also try applying petroleum jelly, but this will only provide temporary relief, as the heat and moisture in your shoe will eventually cause it to dissolve.

, Moist feet are susceptible to blisters, so if you're starting to feel some friction and your feet are wet, do whatever you can to dry them out before you continue running. Carrying an extra pair of socks with you while you run is a great idea, as you can quickly slip off the damp socks, put on the dry ones, and keep running.You can also try applying a foot powder that is designed to keep your feet dry.

, Most minor blisters don't need much treatment, particularly if they are in a location where they are unlikely to burst. The best way to care for this kind of blister is to cover it with a breathable bandage and wait for it to heal on its own.Keep the bandage on until the blister has healed.
Change your bandage daily, or more often if it becomes wet or dirty.
If the blister is too large to be covered with an adhesive bandage, you can cover it with some gauze and surgical tape.
You can also cover it with a special blister pad, which is specifically designed to protect the area from further friction., Popping a blister increases your chances of infection, so it shouldn't be done unless it's really necessary; however, if your blister is causing you severe pain or making it difficult to walk, you may have no other choice. To pop it safely, use a sterilized pin or needle to puncture the blister in several different spots around the edge. Then soak up the fluid with a sterile cotton swab, apply an antibiotic ointment, and cover with a bandage.Keep reapplying antibiotic ointment and changing your bandage every day for several days.
Once the blister begins to heal, you can trim off the dead skin around it with nail clippers.
Make sure to wash your hands thoroughly before you do this.

, If you have any reason to believe that your blister has become infected, it's best to see your doctor right away. This can become serious quickly, so don't ignore the symptoms.Early symptoms of infection include swelling and yellow or green pus.
You may also notice red streaks on your skin in the area near the blister or a fever. These indicate a more serious infection, so get medical attention right away., Ill-fitting shoes are one of the most common causes of foot blisters. When you're shopping for your next pair of running shoes, take some extra time in the store to make sure they are truly comfortable. If it is pinching or rubbing your foot in any way, it's not the right shoe for you.It's important to buy running shoes, as they are specifically designed to support your feet during this activity.
Never buy shoes that are too tight in the hopes that you will break them in. This will only lead to pain!
When you are standing up straight, you should have enough space between your longest toe and the front of the shoe to fit your thumb nail in between.
Your foot should feel secured in place, but not squeezed, when the shoe is laced.
To get the best fit, shop for shoes later in the day, as your feet tend to swell as the day progresses., If you're a runner, you'll need to get new running shoes every six months or after every 500 miles you run (whichever comes first). Continuing to run in old shoes can increase your chances of developing blisters, as well as other sports-related injuries.Don't wait until your old shoes are completely worn out to buy new ones. You should start wearing the new shoes gradually to give your feet time to adjust to them.

, Caring for your shoes is just as important as purchasing the right ones in the first place. Make sure you store them properly if you want to extend their life and keep your feet happy.Make sure your shoes are totally dry before you store them.
If you won't be using your shoes for some time, put some newspaper in them to help them keep their shape.
Avoid leaving them near sources of heat, like radiators or campfires, as this may cause the shape to become deformed., Blisters are more likely to form if your feet are wet when you're running, so it's important to wear socks that will keep them nice and dry, even when you're sweating. Instead of cotton socks, try breathable nylon or moisture-wicking wool.You can also try wearing sock liners or two pairs of socks to reduce the friction against your skin.
Just like your shoes, your socks need to fit correctly. They should be nice and snug with no bunches., If you are prone to blisters, it's very important use the correct products to prevent them. There are two different ways to prevent blisters: by lubricating or by drying. You may need to try both approaches to discover which one works best for you.There are a variety of anti-chafing lubricant gels available for the feet. Try applying one of these under your socks before you run. Petroleum jelly also works, but will need to be reapplied more often.
Alternatively, you can try applying an antiperspirant spray or powder to your feet before you run. This will keep your feet from becoming wet from sweat, which should prevent blisters.

, If you tend to develop blisters on certain areas of your foot, you can help prevent them from recurring by applying a protective barrier on that section of your foot. Do this every time you run to protect sensitive areas.There are a variety of self-adhesive pads that are designed to prevent blisters.
You can also purchase liquid products that adhere to the skin and create a protective layer.
Moleskin and lambswool are also options, but you will need to use a liquid adhesive with them.
Tape may also work to provide a barrier, although it will not provide as much cushion as some of the other options.

Wash your hands thoroughly.,
Wash the area thoroughly with gentle soap and water.,
Allow the blister to dry.,
Leave the skin flap intact.,
Apply an antibacterial ointment or cream to the area.,
Apply a clean bandage over the blister.,
Use a special bandage for a raw or especially painful blister.,
Change the bandage on your blister frequently.,
Manage itching caused by a healing blister.,
Remove the skin flap once the wound is no longer sore.,
Watch for signs of infection.,
Seek medical attention for blisters.,
Wear shoes that fit.,
Wear thick socks to protect feet from blisters.Moisture-wicking socks are a particularly good choice, as blisters are more likely to develop when your skin is damp.You can also help protect your feet by wearing tights or hose if thick socks are not an option for your outfit.

,
Keep skin dry.,
Wear gloves.,
Stay sun-smart.",How to Care for a Burst Blister," Use a mild soap and warm water to wash your hands before touching the blister site. Wash your hands for 15-20 seconds.


This will help prevent the spread of germs, which could cause an infection in the blister area.;
, Don’t scrub the blister; this could tear the skin further.Do not use alcohol, iodine, or hydrogen peroxide, as these can irritate the exposed skin., Let it air dry, if possible, or blot gently with a towel. Don’t rub the blister area with a towel, as this could tear the skin., The skin flap that formed the top of the blister may eventually come off, but will still help protect the raw skin underneath while it heals. If possible, leave it intact, and smooth it down over the raw skin underneath.If the blister has torn, or if there is dirt under the skin flap, you may need to trim it away to prevent infection and keep it from ripping further and damaging healthy skin.
First, wash the area thoroughly. Then, disinfect a pair of small scissors (nail or first aid scissors work best for this) using rubbing alcohol. (You can also sterilize scissors by placing them in boiling water for 20 minutes, or holding them over an open flame until the metal turns red, and then letting them cool.)Carefully clip away the dead skin. Don't clip too close to the healthy skin. It is better to leave a bit of excess than risk further injury to your skin., This will help prevent infection, which is the biggest risk with burst blisters.Common over-the-counter antibacterial ointments and creams include Neosporin and “triple antibiotic ointment,” both of which contain neomycin, polymyxin, and bacitracin., For smaller blisters, a regular bandage should work fine, but for larger blisters, you may need to use a nonstick gauze pad held in place with first aid tape.Be sure to only use non-stick bandages and gauze pads on an open blister. Regular gauze will stick to raw skin!
Hydrocolloid bandages may help accelerate healing.They will adhere to skin, but not to the blister., If the skin over the blister has come away, or if the blister is on your foot or another sensitive area, you may want to use a special bandage designed for blisters.


There are numerous brands of special blister cushion bandages that are padded to protect delicate skin.
You can also use moleskin on blisters. Moleskin is a soft, felt-like substance that often has an adhesive backing. Cut two pieces of moleskin slightly larger than your blister. Cut a circle roughly the size of your blister in one of the pieces. Apply this piece over the blister, positioning it so that the “window” is directly over the blister. Apply the second piece of moleskin on top of the first.Resist the urge to use a liquid bandage like New-Skin. These are more suited to cuts or lacerations, and could cause further irritation or infection if used on a blister.When in doubt, ask your pharmacist or call your doctor for a specific recommendation.

, You should change the bandage daily, or anytime it becomes wet or soiled. Each time you change the bandage, gently wash and dry the area, and reapply antibiotic ointment to the site.Continue to bandage the blister until the skin has healed completely.

, It is common for a blister to itch as it heals, especially if it is allowed to dry out, but it is important not to scratch it and risk further skin damage. Keeping the area cool and wet is one way to decrease itching. Soak a clean cloth in ice water, and apply it to the site, or soak the area in a tub of cool water.Be sure to clean the area, reapply antibiotic cream and bandage it again afterwards.
If the skin around the bandage becomes red, bumpy, or itchy, you may have an allergy to the adhesive in the bandage (or the bandage itself). Try a different brand, or try nonstick sterile gauze pads and medical tape. You can apply hydrocortisone 1% ointment to the irritated skin around the blister to help with itching, but don’t apply it to the blister itself.

, Once the skin underneath the blister has had a chance to heal and is no longer tender, you can safely trim away the skin flap over it using a pair of clean, sanitized scissors., Open blisters can become infected easily, so pay close attention to them as they heal. If you notice any signs of infection, or if your blister isn't beginning to recover within a few days, seek medical attention. Signs of infection include:


Increased pain around the blister.
Swelling, redness, or warmth near the blister.
Red streaks on your skin heading away from the blister; this is a sign of blood poisoning.
Pus draining from the blister.
A fever.

, Many blisters will heal naturally on their own, given a little time. However, there are some cases in which you should see your doctor for a blister as soon as possible. You should seek prompt medical attention if your blisters:Are infected (see the previous step for signs of infection)
Are causing a lot of pain
Keep returning
Occur in unusual places, such as the inside of the mouth or on the eyelids
Are the result of burns, including sunburn or scalding
Are the result of an allergic reaction (for example, to an insect bite)

, Friction is a very common cause of blisters, especially on the feet. Wearing properly fitted shoes will help reduce your likelihood of developing blisters on your feet.You can also attach moleskin or special blister prevention tape to the inside of your shoes’ heels, where rubbing often occurs.,, Blisters are more likely to form on the moist skin. You may be able to find a gel or “friction block stick” to apply to areas that are likely to form blisters. These products can help keep skin dry and prevent rubbing.


Try dusting the insides of your shoes and socks with a talc-free baby or foot powder. Avoid talcum powder, since some studies, show it may be a carcinogen. Some powders also have odor-killing agents in them.You can also try a foot spray to help reduce sweating., Wearing gloves, especially during manual labor such as manufacturing, gardening, or construction, will help prevent the development of blisters on your hands.You should also wear gloves while doing activities such as weight-lifting, which can also cause blisters on the hands.

, Severe sunburns can also cause blisters. Protect yourself in the sun by wearing protective clothing, hats, and sunscreen lotion.Blistering is a sign of second-degree sunburn.It can take 10-21 days to heal."

Keep it exposed to the air.,
Reduce any friction or pressure.,
Protect it with a bandage.,
Continue your blood blister treatment until the area heals completely.",How to Treat a Blood Blister2," Most blood blisters will heal on their own over time, but keeping the area clean and dry will allow the healing process to proceed as quickly as possible.Keeping it exposed to the air helps the healing process, but also limits the chances of infection.

, If your blood blister is in an area that would normally be rubbing up against something, such as your heel or toe, take precautions to limit the friction against the blister. It is more likely to tear or burst if it is subject to a lot of friction, which is caused when it rubs up against another surface, such as your shoe. Using a donut-shaped moleskin or felt pad is the most straight-forward way to do this.You can get donut-shaped pads made of thick adhesive felt or moleskin to reduce the friction while still leaving the blister exposed so it heals more quickly.Make sure that you position the blister in the center of the pad to relieve the pressure and friction., Blisters that rub against something regularly, such as those on the feet or fingers, can be covered with a loose bandage for additional protection.Bandages lower the pressure on the blister and reduce the friction, the two key things in helping a blood blister heal and lowering the chances of infection. Be sure to use a sterile dressing, and change it regularly.Before applying a dressing clean the blister and surrounding area.

, If the blister is extraordinarily large, make an appointment with your doctor. These blisters do sometimes need to be drained, and it is best to do so under professional supervision to prevent infection.

Decide if it is best to drain the blood blister.,
Prepare to lance the blood blister.,
Lance and drain the blood blister.,
Clean up and dress the drained blood blister.",How to Treat a Blood Blister3," Although blood blisters will heal on their own, and should be left to do this in most cases, there are times when draining them might be the best option. For example, if it is collecting a lot of blood and causing a lot of pain. Or if it is getting so big it is likely to tear anyway.Think about if you really need to drain it, and err on the side of caution.


This is especially the case with blood blisters, which require more careful treatment than normal blisters.
If you do decide to drain it, you have to careful and methodological in order to limit the chances of infection.
Due to the risk of infection, you should never drain a blood blister if you have a condition such as HIV, diabetes, heart disease or cancer.

, If you have decided that you need to drain the blood blister you need to ensure you do not infect it. Wash your hands, and the area where the blister is, thoroughly with soap and water before you begin. Next sterilize a needle with rubbing alcohol. You are going to use this needle to lance the blister. (Never use a straight pin - they are less sharp than a needle, and sometimes have bur on the end.) , Carefully and gently puncture the edge of the blister with the needle. The fluid will begin to drain out of the hole you have made. You can apply very gentle pressure to help it on its way if necessary., Now apply an antiseptic (assuming you have no allergies) such as betadine, to the blister. Clean around the blister and dress it with a sterile dressing. Once you have done this you should avoid pressure or friction on the blister as much as possible. To ward off potential infection you should observe it closely and regularly change the dressing."
"
Drain it carefully.,
Clean it and apply an antiseptic.,
Leave the skin intact.,
Dress it with a clean bandage.",How to Treat a Blood Blister4," If the blister bursts or tears as a result of pressure or friction you need to act quickly to clean it up in order to prevent infection. Begin by carefully draining the fluid from the blister if it has burst., Washing the area thoroughly should be followed by the application of an antiseptic ointment (allergies permitting), just like if you had drained the blister yourself.Avoid using alcohol or iodine directly on the blister, because these substances could delay the healing process.

, After draining the fluid take care to leave the extra skin intact, carefully smoothing it over the raw area of skin. This provides additional protection for the blister and facilitates the healing process. Don’t pick away at the skin around the edges of the blister., Applying a clean bandage to the blister is very important in the prevention of infections. The bandage should provide sufficient pressure to avoid further blood vessel ruptures, but should not be so tight that it impedes circulation to the area. Change the bandage daily after cleaning the area. You should allow your blister around a week to heal.

Watch carefully for signs of infection while caring for your blood blister.,
Look for increased pain, swelling or redness around the blister.,
Look for red streaks extending from the blister.,
Look for drainage of pus and fluid from the blister.",How to Treat a Blood Blister5," If you develop an infection, your doctor may prescribe oral antibiotics to treat the infection completely. It is important to clean and dress the blister well in order to lessen the chances of suffering an infection.


If you begin to feel generally unwell with a fever or high temperature this could be an indicator of an infection., Signs of an infection include redness and swelling around the site, or soreness that develops long after the blister occurs. Keep a close eye on the blister for these symptoms and take appropriate measures., If you can see red streaks moving away from your blister this could be an indicator of a serious infection that has spread to the lymph system. Lymphangitis often occurs when the viruses and bacteria of an infected wound extend into the channels of the lymphatic system.Other symptoms of lymphangitis include swollen lymph nodes (glands), chills, fever, loss of appetite, and a general malaise.If you are experiencing these symptoms contact a doctor immediately.

, Pus discharge is another indicator of a potentially infected blood blister. Look out for yellow and green coloured pus or cloudy fluid gathering in the blister or draining out from it. Use your judgement when dealing with your blister and use good hygiene to prevent infection."

You can use gel straight from the plant itself, or you can purchase aloe gel in a natural foods store.

, Apple cider vinegar has antibacterial propertiesand can help a blister heal more quickly. Make a paste of apple cider vinegar and castor oil by mixing a half-cup of vinegar with three teaspoons of castor oil.Apply this mixture to your blister a few times per day. Cover your blister with a bandage.

, Tea tree oil has antibacterial properties and also works as an astringent. Soak a cotton ball or piece of gauze in tea tree oil. Gently apply this to your blister. Cover the blister with a piece of gauze and adhesive tape., Green tea has antibacterial properties and contains tannic acid that helps harden skin.When you harden the skin at a blister site that has begun to heal, a callous may form and your skin won’t be as prone to blisters in that area.


Soak a green tea bag in water for a few minutes. Squeeze it gently to remove excess water. Lay the teabag on the affected area for several minutes.

Do not drain a blister if you have a serious health condition.,
Watch for signs of infection.",How to Heal Blisters3," If your blister is large, painful, or is getting irritated, you may decide to drain the fluid out if it. It’s always better to leave the blister alone, but you may find that relieving the pressure from the blister will help reduce pain and irritation.


Don’t drain the blister if you have diabetes, HIV, cancer, or other conditions that make you susceptible to infection.

, Use plenty of soap and warm water to wash your hands. You don’t want to introduce any additional bacteria or dirt to your blister while you’re draining it.

, You’ll need a sharp object to puncture the blister. Ensure that it is clean by wiping the needle or pin with a piece of gauze soaked in rubbing alcohol.

, Choose a spot on the blister near the edge. Gently push the needle or pin into the blister. When you see fluid start to emerge, remove the needle.


You may want to puncture more than one spot on the blister, especially if it is a big blister. This may help relieve pressure that builds up in the blister., Wipe away excess fluid with a clean piece of gauze. When there is no more excess fluid draining from the blister, gently clean the blister with soap and water. Cover your blister with a piece of gauze and adhesive tape.You may want to use some antibiotic cream on the blister for the first day or two. If your blister starts to itch or develop a rash, stop using the cream.
If there is a flap of skin from the blister, don’t trim it. Leave it alone, letting it lay flat over the blister.
Clean and re-bandage the area every day. If the area gets wet, change your bandage.
Let the area breathe at night by removing the bandage. Replace the bandage in the morning if the blister still needs to heal. This will help protect it from getting dirt into it.

Choose your socks carefully.,
Buy shoes that fit well.,
Use moleskin as a preventative measure.,
Use talcum powder in your socks.,
Avoid contact with blister-causing plants.",How to Heal Blisters4," Many people get blisters because their socks rub against their feet. Runners are especially prone to this problem. Avoid cotton socks, which absorb moisture and are more likely to cause blisters. Instead, choose nylon or wicking socks, which do not absorb moisture. These are more breathable and will help protect your feet., Many blisters are caused by shoes that don’t fit properly, especially shoes that are too small. You may find that your shoe size can vary a half-size in one day. Try on shoes when your feet are most swollen during the day to ensure that the shoes will be big enough to comfortably fit your feet., Moleskin can be used to cushion and protect a blister and you can also use it to prevent blisters if you are prone to them. Cut a small piece of moleskin and stick it to your shoe or foot at the spot where you may start to get a blister., Reduce friction on your feet by using talcum powder. This will help soak up moisture that may otherwise cause blisters.Sprinkle a bit of talcum powder inside your socks before putting them on.

, Certain plants, such as sumac and poison ivy, can give you blister rashes. If you need to handle these types of plants, take precautions by wearing gloves, long pants, long-sleeved shirt and shoes."

Consider leaving the blister alone.,
Wash your hands thoroughly.,
Disinfect the blister's surface.,
Sterilize a clean, sharp needle.,
Puncture the blister.,
Let the fluid drain out.,
Apply ointment and cover the blister.",How to Heal Blisters from Rowing2," Most blisters will heal on their own without being drained, so you might want to just leave it alone. Your body will reabsorb the fluid in the blister as it heals. If the blister is infected or extremely painful, then it may need to be drained.

Do not drain your blister if you have HIV/AIDS, cancer, or heart disease.

, Before you touch your blister, it's important to have clean hands. This will help reduce the chances of your blister becoming infected.Wet your hands with clean, running water.
Lather soap between your hands by rubbing them together.
Scrub your hands for a minimum of 20 seconds. Be sure to apply soap under your fingernails, between your fingers, and on the fronts and backs of both hands.
Rinse your hands free of all soap and dirt/debris under clean, running water.
Dry your hands with a clean paper towel, and use the towel to turn off the faucet to avoid touching any unclean surfaces.
If you do not have access to clean, running tap water, you can use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer to disinfect your hands. However, this will not be effective in removing dirt and grit from your hands.
Apply enough hand sanitizer to cover both hands, then rub it over every surface of your hands and fingers. Let it air dry when you're finished., Even though you've washed your hands, it's a good idea to disinfect the blister itself. This is to prevent any outside bacteria from being introduced into the blister once you puncture the surface.Apply iodine to a clean cotton swab or a clean piece of paper towel.
Swab the blister, including the area immediately surrounding the blister, until it is completely covered.
Let the iodine air dry.

, Now that your hands are clean and the blister has been swabbed with iodine, you'll need to sterilize the needle. It's very important that the needle be clean, sharp, and sterilized, because a dirty, rusty, or dull needle can cause injury or infection if you lance the blister with it.


You can buy a sterile lancing needle from most drug stores, or sterilize a clean, sharp needle at home.
There are numerous ways to sterilize a needle. Some people hold the needle over a flame, while others pour boiling water over the needle.The safest way to sterilize a needle is to simply pour some rubbing alcohol onto a clean cotton swab, wipe the needle down, and let it air dry., Using the now-sterilized needle, carefully puncture the blister near its edge (where it meets the rest of your finger or hand). Be careful not to stab the muscle or the deeper skin layers underneath your blister; you merely want to penetrate the outer layer of skin on the blister itself.Larger blisters may require multiple punctures. Be sure to insert the needle close to the edge of the blister for each incision.

, Getting the serum (fluid) out of your blister is the most important part of the process. You may need to gently massage some of the fluid out if it does not drain well on its own. Be gentle and do not rush through it. Take the time to ensure you get all the serum out of your blister.


Leave the overlying skin from the blister in place. Removing it will cause a large, open sore that could easily become infected.

, Your skin may be stressed from the injury and subsequent punctures. Applying a thin layer of ointment, such as Vaseline or Neosporin, to the blister can help your skin return to its normal, elastic state. An antibacterial ointment has the added benefit of cleaning the wound while it's covered.Don't apply too much ointment. The wound will need to be able to breathe, and excess ointment may reduce the flow of oxygen to your skin.
Cover the blister with sterile, non-stick gauze, and use medical tape to keep it fixed in place.
Be sure that you do not accidentally apply tape to the blister itself, as this may cause significant pain when you remove it.
Change the dressings every day, and keep the area clean. Use more ointment as needed.

Wash the area clean.,
Keep the flap of skin in place.,
Apply ointment and a clean bandage.,
Take an over-the-counter pain reliever.",How to Heal Blisters from Rowing3," Whether your blister has torn open or you lanced and drained it, it's important to keep the area as clean as possible. You should wash the area once each day, and any additional times as needed if the area is exposed to dirt or bacteria. This is particularly important if you continue to row, as river and lake water is full of bacteria that could easily cause an infection.


Use soap and water. Do not use alcohol, peroxide, iodine, or any other wound cleanser, as these will irritate the skin and prolong the healing process.Follow the same guidelines for washing your blister wound as you would for washing your hands.

, If the flap of skin covering the deflated blister gets very dirty or if there is still pus remaining under it, you may need to remove the skin flap. It's best to let a doctor do this, as she will be able to ensure your injury does not get infected. Otherwise, leave the skin flap in place so it will help protect the open sore underneath.If the skin gets bent out of place, gently smooth it back into position over the open sore.
Do not attempt to cut or pull away the skin at home, as this will drastically increase the risk of infection and prolong the healing process.

, Once you've washed the blister wound and smoothed the skin back in place, you'll need to protect the wound. Apply enough antibiotic ointment to sufficiently cover the blister, then cover it with a clean bandage.If your blister grows itchy or develops a rash, stop using the ointment and see your doctor as soon as possible.
Change the bandage every day, and any time it gets dirty or wet. Keep the area clean.
Remove the bandage at night to allow the wound to breathe.

, You can take acetaminophen or ibuprofen to relieve some of the pain caused by the blister. Read the manufacturer’s instructions to find the proper dosage, or talk to your pharmacist or doctor if you are not sure how much to take."

Maintain a proper handle grip.,
Keep your oars clean.,
Wear non-slip gloves.,
Tape up your hands.,
Toughen up your skin.",How to Heal Blisters from Rowing4," A common cause of rowing blisters, especially for those just starting out, is improper handle grip on the oars. If your grip is too tight, you're likely to develop blisters. If it's too loose, though, you could lose your hold on the handle altogether.


Maintain a loose, relaxed grip, but keep proper form and a correct grip on the handle.It can take a long time to learn how to properly hold on to the handle. Don't get discouraged. Just keep with it, and ask your coach or a more experienced rower for advice on your technique.

, A dirty or greasy oar handle will not necessarily cause blisters in and of itself. However, it can make it difficult for you to maintain the proper grip on your handles, which in turn may cause blisters.Use an abrasive cleaning product and clean paper towels to scrub down the oar handles after every workout.

, If you're comfortable rowing in gloves, a good pair of non-stick rowing gloves can help you keep on top of your rowing without the risk of blisters. You can find these at many sporting goods stores, or by searching online., If you're not comfortable wearing non-slip gloves while you row, you can try taping your hands instead. Use regular, store-bought duct tape for this, but make sure the tape is clean to prevent irritation or infection.


Use a pair of scissors to cut a piece of duct tape. It should be slightly larger than the spot on your hand(s) that is prone to getting blisters.
Apply the piece of duct tape to your palm. Press down in the center and smooth the tape in outward strokes to remove any lumps or wrinkles., It may be painful and frustrating in the meantime, but eventually your hands will get tougher in the spots that are most prone to blistering. This can take time, and it's important to be patient while your skin toughens. Do not let it deter you; it's important to keep rowing until your skin builds up a tolerance to the motion.Increase your rowing time or intensity gradually. If you rush to lengthen the time you spend rowing or your intensity, you will easily cause blisters.Figure out a schedule for yourself that will allow you to increase your time and intensity slowly over several days or weeks. This is something you will have to determine for your own abilities and endurance.
Don't be afraid to push yourself, but know your own limits.

Keep your feet dry.",How to Lance and Drain a Blister," Not every blister needs to be lanced. In fact, some experts recommend that you should only drain blisters that are exceedingly painful, in weight-bearing or high-contact areas, or larger than 0.8 inches (2 centimeters) in diameter.If the blister is intact and manageable, try to keep it intact.
Apply a piece of moleskin, adhesive felt, or tape. Make sure this stabilizing adhesive is 1.5 to 3.25 inches (3.8 to 8.3 centimeters) larger than the blister with a central hole that can fit the entire blister.
Apply antibiotic to the blister through the hole in your moleskin/felt/tape.
Use adhesive tape to fix a large piece of clean gauze over the moleskin/felt/tape to completely cover the blister.;
, Having clean hands and a clean wound site are vital to prevent infection. Make sure you wash your hands before you touch the blister or attempt to drain it, and make sure the skin on and around the blister is also clean and dry.Wet your hands under a stream of clean, running water.Apply soap while your hands are still wet and work it into a thick lather. Spread the soap on every surface of your hands, including the backs of each hand, between the fingers, and under the fingernails.
Scrub your hands with the soap for a minimum of 20 seconds, then rinse away all the soap under clean, running water. Use a clean, disposable towel to dry your hands, or let them air dry.
Gently wash the blister and surrounding area with clean, running water. If you can position that appendage under the faucet, lather some soap onto the blister and thoroughly rinse it away., Even though you should have washed the site of the blister under clean, running water, there may still be residual bacteria that could cause an infection. Since you will be breaking the skin with a needle, it's best to sterilize the area with a disinfectant and keep it clean.Apply iodine or rubbing alcohol to the skin directly on and surrounding the site of the blister. Clean the blister area with the cotton ball or Q-tip soaked with iodine or rubbing alcohol. Start from the center of the blister and clean in a in circular motion to the outer edge. Repeat. Make sure the skin is clean and dry before application.
Let the disinfectant air dry before you proceed.

, Before you attempt to lance the wound, you'll want to make sure you have a sharp, sterile needle. Since environmental bacteria may have contaminated the needle, you'll want to sterilize the needle before piercing the skin with it.Choose a clean, sharp needle. A dull needle will not lance well, and a dirty or rusty needle will raise the risk of an infection.
If you are using rubbing alcohol to sterilize the needle, soak a clean cotton swab in alcohol and wipe the needle down.
If you prefer, you can also sterilize the needle with a lit flame.To ensure a more sterile needle, you may wish to wipe the needle with alcohol and then hold it over a flame.

, When you puncture the blister, make sure you insert the needle along the edges of the blister. Try to keep the needle parallel to your skin, and don't pierce too deep to avoid injuring the delicate tissue underneath.Try to insert the lancing needle several times, all along the blister's edge. This will help facilitate draining by opening up more outlets.
Generally speaking, two to four lance holes should be enough to drain the fluid out.Try to space the lance holes out evenly around the edges of the blister.

, Once you've lanced the blister, it's important that you drain out all the fluid inside.If you don't get the fluid out, the blister will remain large and potentially painful.


Gently massage the blister to help work the fluid out if it will not drain on its own.
Make sure the overlying skin remains in place through all of this. Dislodging the skin flap will be very painful and may delay healing or leave you susceptible to an infection.
Gently wipe the blister and its surrounding skin dry with a clean disposable towel.

, Once the blister has been drained, you'll want to make sure the wound doesn't get infected and doesn't dry out. A dry wound can lead to broken skin and a prolonged healing period, and may even cause an infection.An antibacterial ointment will protect the wound from infection, but if you don't have anything with antibacterial properties you can use petroleum jelly or Vaseline to keep the wound from drying out.Make sure you apply extra antibacterial ointment at the sites of the lance punctures., Apply a clean bandage that fully covers the blister to protect it from getting infected. Make sure the skin flap is covering the wound before applying the bandage. You can either use an adhesive bandage (if it adequately covers the blister), or you can tape a clean piece of gauze in place over the wound.

, It's very important that you change the dressings and wash the blister wound every day until it is fully healed. Follow the same procedure you used to wash the blister prior to lancing it, and make sure you take precautions so the wound doesn't become agitated or infected.Use clean, running water and a mild soap. Do not use hydrogen peroxide or rubbing alcohol, as these may delay the healing process.
Be very gentle as you wash the wound. Scrubbing or any other rough contact could peel back the overlying skin or irritate the lance wounds.
Keep the wound moist with antibacterial ointment or vaseline. Cover it with clean dressing to speed up healing.

, Sometimes infections can form on a wound in spite of your best preventative measures. Cleaning the wound and changing the dressings will dramatically reduce the chance of an infection developing, but you should still check to make sure the skin looks healthy on and around the wound each day.Some signs to look for include:


increased pain
swelling/redness/warmth at the site of the blister
red streaks in your skin that radiate out from the blister
production and drainage of pus under the blister
a fever with a body temperature over 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit (37 degrees Celsius)

, Use clean bandages/gauze each time you wash the blister. You should do this at least once a day and any time the dressings get wet or dirty. This can help reduce the risk of infection and speed up the healing process.Make sure you continue to apply ointment to the sites of the lance wounds. An antibacterial ointment is ideal to help prevent infection, even after you've drained and dressed the wound.

, One way to prevent future blisters is to toughen the skin where blisters have formed or may form. This is best done when no blisters are present, as any friction on an existing or healing blister will be very painful.Spend a few minutes every day working the skin with whatever activities you fear will cause a blister. For example, if you row on a crew team and want to toughen your palms, spend some time rubbing an oar handle against the palms of your hands.
Don't overdo it as you try to toughen your skin, or you may inadvertently form a blister.

, Friction is one of the biggest causes of blister formation. Friction is frequently caused by poorly-fitting footwear or lack of protection on the hands.Wear shoes that fit well and aren't too big or too small.
Tape up any ""hot"" spots that you notice on your feet, as these are likely to develop into blisters if they're not given attention. You can also use moleskin on hot spots before they become blisters.Wear thick work gloves any time you will be working with tools like shovels or picks.

, In addition to poorly-fitting footwear, wet feet are often a major source of blisters. Some people are more prone to sweaty feet, while others may work outdoors where stepping in water is unavoidable. Whatever the cause, there are steps you can take to help keep your feet as dry as possible throughout the day.Wear moisture-wicking socks to keep your skin dry and change your socks as needed throughout the day to ensure you don't have wet cloth rubbing against your feet.
Use a spray-on foot deodorant to help keep your feet from getting too sweaty.

Cover your blister.,
Use antibiotic ointment or vaseline.,
Try powders and creams to reduce friction.,
Care for your feet while the blister persists.,
Protect a burst blister from infection.",How to Treat a Foot Blister1," Foot blisters should be covered to reduce irritation and cut back on the risk of infection. Cover your blister with a soft dressing, like gauze or a loose bandage. If the blister is very sore, cut your dressing into a donut shape and place it around the blister to avoid putting pressure directly on it.Your dressing should be changed each day. Always wash your hands before touching the dressing and the area around the blister.;
, Antibiotic ointment helps prevent infections in a blister. You can buy antibiotic ointment at a pharmacy. Apply it to the blister as directed, especially before you put on your shoes or socks.Just vaseline may also be used.


Remember to wash your hands thoroughly before touching the blister.

, Friction can make a blister worse and increase pain. In order to reduce friction on a foot blister, pick up a powder designed for your feet at a local pharmacy. Pour it into your socks before putting on your shoes to reduce pain.Not all powders work for everyone. If a powder causes your blister to become irritated, stop using it.

, Take extra precautions to keep your feet comfortable while a blister is healing. Wear an extra pair of socks and loose-fitting shoes as the blister persists. This will cut back on pain and help the blister heal.You should also try to stay off your feet as much as possible while the blister is healing.
Try changing your socks twice a day to help decrease the possibility of blisters, usually cotton socks are better than polyester.

, Unless a blister becomes extremely painful, it's best not to drain it yourself. This can increase your likelihood of developing an infection. Let the blister's skin peel on its own. Avoid touching or irritating the blister to prevent it from popping prematurely.Use a moleskin over the blister to protect it if you must walk on it.

Apply an ointment.,
Cover the blister.",How to Treat a Foot Blister2," In rare cases, you can pop an extremely sore blister on your own. You should only do this if the pain becomes debilitating. Before popping a blister, wash your hands thoroughly with antibacterial soap and water. You should never touch a blister with dirty hands., Before popping your blister, clean the area around it with water. Using alcohol, hydrogen peroxide or iodine can slow healing., You will use a sewing needle to pop the blister, but this should be sterilized first to prevent infection. Wipe the needle down with rubbing alcohol, which you can purchase at a local drugstore.You can dab rubbing alcohol from a bottle onto a cotton swab or use rubbing alcohol pads.


Alternatively you can sterilize the needle by running it through an open flame until it turns red. Use something to grasp the needle when you do this like Kelly clamps, since the needle will become very hot.

, Take the needle and gently insert it into the blister. Puncture it several times, near the edge of the blister. Allow the fluid to drain out naturally while you leave the skin covering the blister in place., Once you've drained the blister, apply an ointment to it. You can use Vaseline or Plastibase, both of which can be purchased at a drugstore. Use a clean cotton swab to rub the ointment over the blister.Some ointments may irritate a blister. If you notice any signs of a rash, cease use of your ointment.

, Place a piece of gauze or a bandage over the blister. This will protect it from infection while it heals. Change the dressing twice a day and, when you change it, add new ointment.Remember to wash your hands before touching your blister.

See a doctor if you notice complications.,
Rule out underlying conditions.,
Follow your doctor's treatment plan.",How to Treat a Foot Blister3," Most blisters heal on their own. However, complications warrant a trip to the doctor. If you notice any of the following complications, make an appointment with your doctor:A painful, red, and hot blister or a blister with red streaks
Yellow or green pus
A blister that keeps coming back
Fever
Having diabetes, heart conditions, auto immune disorders, HIV or undergoing chemotherapy can make your blister rapidly become worse, causing sepsis or cellulitis.

, Most foot blisters are benign. However, some blisters can be caused by underlying conditions like chicken pox and should be treated differently. Depending on your other symptoms, your doctor may want to run some tests to rule out underlying conditions before addressing your blister. If an underlying condition causes your blister, your doctor will advise you how to treat it., Depending on the cause of the blister, your doctor will form a treatment plan for you. Follow all of your doctor's instructions closely and ask your doctor any questions you have before leaving the office."

Avoid wearing the shoes that caused a blister.,
Add moleskin or padding to your shoes.,
Wear moisture-wicking socks.",How to Treat a Foot Blister4," If your blister came in response to a new type of shoe, or a very uncomfortable shoe, stop wearing the shoes that caused it. Purchase shoes that leave your feet with some wiggle room and fit comfortably. Wearing the right shoes can prevent a future blister.

, Attach a small bit of moleskin or padding to the inside of your shoes, particularly areas where your shoes rub against your feet. Moleskin can provide some padding and cut back on friction and irritation that causes blisters., Moisture can cause blisters or make existing blisters worse. Invest in a pair of moisture-wicking socks. These will absorb sweat from your feet and cut back on blisters and other injuries."

The more overweight you are the more likely you are to suffer from heart disease. To have a healthy heart you need to achieve and maintain a healthy weight. The first step is to assess whether or not you are overweight and then determine how much weight you should lose.


You can use an online BMI calculator to determine if you are overweight
You will need to input your height and weight.
For some BMI calculators you may also need to measure just above your waist and around your neck.
A BMI under 18.5 is considered underweight, between 18.5 and 29.4 is normal, between 25 and 29.9 is overweight, and 30 or higher is considered obese.;
, Despite all the various diets and weight-loss techniques out there, the basics are quite simple. You need to use more calories than you consume in order to lose weight. Sticking to a healthy diet and being active will help you to lose weight and lower your chances of heart disease.


As a general rule, you should aim to cut 500 calories from your daily intake to lose a pound a week.
It's not completely straightforward, however, as you will be losing water and lean tissue as well as fat, so pay attention to your body.Remember that once you lose weight you will have to maintain a balance in your diet and exercise so you do not consume excess calories and regain the weight.
To maintain your weight, daily calories burned will have to be approximately the same and calories consumed.

, You might begin fired up and ready to exercise and make changes, but after a time that enthusiasm may wane, and it may become difficult to stay motivated. Setting specific goals makes it more likely you will stick with your plan to lose weight and be heart-healthy. For this to work, your goals need to be more concrete than just ""Get healthy"" or ""Have a healthy heart."" Try setting a goal that is specific, timely, and achievable. Your goal might be ""I want to lose 5 lbs. by the end of October,"" or ""I want to be able to run a nine-minute mile by June.""

Write down your goals, and be sure to make smaller goals along the way (such as ""Lose two pounds in September"") and revisit them to stay motivated.

, Exercising regularly is important for anyone trying to lose weight or maintain a healthy weight. Being active also has great benefits for your heart health, as those who are generally inactive are more likely to develop heart problems. Being inactive can increase your chances of suffering from high blood pressure and diabetes, which are major factors in heart disease.


Aim to incorporate 30 minutes of moderate to intense activity at least five days a week.
Once you have managed this, try to up it to 30 minutes every day.Examples of moderate-intense activity include walking fast, cycling, swimming, and playing basketball., Having plenty of fruits and vegetables in your diet is an important part of eating healthily and looking after your heart. They are rich in vitamins, minerals and dietary fibre, while being low in calories. Substituting fruit and vegetables for high-fat foods and snacks can make a big difference if you are trying to achieve and maintain a healthy weight.


Choose fresh or frozen vegetables, rather than canned vegetables. The canned ones tend be have added salt. If you do get canned veg, make sure it is marked as low-sodium or low-salt.
Try to limit the amount of fried or breaded vegetables you eat.
Choose fresh fruit rather than frozen fruit with added sugar, or canned fruit that comes in a heavy syrup., If you consume a lot of saturated fats, you can raise the level of cholesterol in your blood, which can lead to heart disease. Avoid eating too many foods that are high in saturated fats to help keep your heart healthy and reduce the chances of you suffering from heart disease.


Make changes to your diet by choosing leaner cuts of meat, and 1% fat milk.The average person consuming around 2,000 calories a day should not have more than 20g of saturated fat each day.Check food labels for information on the amount of saturated fat you are consuming.
If you have high blood pressure or heart disease the amount of saturated fat you consume will be different. Consult your doctor for advice., One of the ways you can help to prevent and control high blood pressure is by lowering the amount of salt and sodium you consume. You should aim to consume no more than around a teaspoon of salt throughout the day (about 2,300mg of sodium). It is even better if you can get yourself down to two-thirds of teaspoon of salt (1,500mg of sodium). There are a number of ways you can take steps to lower your salt consumption,


Use products that have no-added salt, or are reduced-sodium.
Flavour your food with herbs and spices rather than salt.
Eat fresh meat and poultry, rather than canned or prepared meat which will generally have high a salt content.
If you do eat canned fish or vegetables, rinse it under the tap before you eat it.
Get into the habit of reading the nutritional information on food packaging, and choosing food that has lower amounts of salt or sodium., Eating plenty of fibre will improve your diet and can help lower your risk of heart disease. You should aim to consume at least 30g of fibre a day. You can get fibre from a variety of sources, including wholemeal bread, oats, bran, wholegrain cereals, and fruit and vegetables.


Try to incorporate lots of fibre into your regular diet by making some alterations to your shopping and eating habits.
For example, regularly having a bowl of a bran cereal for breakfast will help you get enough fibre.
Swap white bread for wholegrain bread to up your fibre intake., If you smoke, the absolute best thing you can do for your heart is to quit. Smoking can lead to serious heart problems, and it is one of the main causes of coronary heart disease. The impact of quitting is significant. A year after you have stopped, the danger of you suffering a heart attack will drop to about half that of somebody who still smokes., If you drink alcohol, drinking in moderation should not cause problems for your heart health. In fact, people who drink only in moderation may be less likely to have a heart attack than people who drink nothing at all. Drinking a lot, however, will increase your risk of heart problems including raised blood pressure and a heightened risk of suffering a stroke.


Moderate drinking is defined by the US Government as no more than one drink a day for women, and two for men.
One drink is equivalent to 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or 1 ½ ounces of liquor.
Remember that alcohol contributes to wide range of health problems, including increased risk of stroke, raised blood pressure and triglyceride

, A good night’s sleep can be beneficial for your heart, so try to get into good sleeping habits. Research has shown that people who slept for 7 hours a night had less calcium in their arteries than those who slept for 5 hours. Calcium in the arteries is an early sign of heart disease.Getting enough sleep will also help to avoid stress and give you the energy to live and full and active lifestyle.

, Stress has been linked to heart disease, and an emotionally upsetting event is often cited as a trigger for a heart attack. The direct links between stress and heart health are uncertain, but often the ways people cope with stress can be damaging for their heart. For example, drinking alcohol, overeating and smoking are all common ways to respond to a stressful situation which harm you heart.


Try to manage stress and choose alternative ways to relax that are more healthy, like progressive muscle relaxation or deep breathing exercises.
Exercise is a great stress-buster, so next time you are stressed out go for a walk, jog or bike ride.
Learning to meditate, or practicing yoga are also great ways to manage stress and look after your heart., Blood pressure is a key indicator of your heart’s health. You should get your blood pressure checked whenever you have a check-up with your doctor, especially if you think you have a heightened risk of heart problems.


Many different factors influence your blood pressure, such as weight, diet, stress, alcohol consumption, and smoking.
There are often no symptoms of high blood pressure, so it’s important that you get it checked regularly.Blood pressure is typically recorded with two numbers, systolic and diastolic. The systolic number is recorded when the heart beats, and the diastolic number is the pressure between beats.
A normal blood pressure reading would have a systolic value of less than 120, and a diastolic value of less than 80.
Anything above this indicates prehypertension, or high blood pressure and you should seek medical attention.Losing weight, quitting smoking, and/or decreasing alcohol consumption may help improve your blood pressure.

, Controlling your blood sugar is an important part of lowering your risk of heart disease and diabetes. If you’re 45 or older you should get your blood sugar tested every three years. If you are overweight you should get tested more frequently. If you have a family history of diabetes, your risk may be increased.


If you are at risk of diabetes it’s important that you act quickly and talk to your doctor so you can devise a treatment plan.
This may involve changes to your diet and lifestyle to help you lose weight and reduce the chances of heart problems and developing type 2 diabetes.Normal blood sugar levels are 100 mg/dL after not eating for eight hours, and less than 140 mg/dL 2 hours after eating., You need some cholesterol, but too much can increase your risk of heart disease. It is recommend that everyone over the age of 20 get their cholesterol levels checked every four to six years. This should be a feature of your overall cardiovascular health programme, and is a good way to monitor your general health.


The test is a simple blood test, which often follows a nine to 12 hour fast.
Genetic factors can increase your risk of high cholesterol, but you can reduce this risk with a healthy and active lifestyle.A test of your cholesterol will give you a total blood cholesterol level, as well as high-density lipoprotein (HDL) value and a low-density lipoprotein (LDL) value. You should looks at all of these figures with your doctor.
Your total blood cholesterol should be below 200 mg/dL. 240 is high-risk, and between 200 and 240 is borderline.
An HDL level that is less than 40 mg/dL is considered high-risk. Exercise can help raise your HDL levels.
An LDL level that is 190 mg/dL or above is classed as high-risk."

Talk to your doctor about wrist surgery.",How to Look After a Sprained Wrist," Minor wrist sprains are often caused by repetitive tasks or hyperextending the joint by falling on an outstretched hand.Take a break from repetitive tasks if that's what you think led to your wrist injury. Talk to your boss about switching to a different activity for a week or so. If the sprain is exercise related, then you may be working out too aggressively or with bad form — consult with a personal trainer.


A mild wrist strain is often categorized as a Grade I sprain, which implies that ligaments are stretched a little too far, but not significantly.Tolerable pain, mild inflammation or swelling, and some loss of movement and/or strength in the wrist are common symptoms of Grade I wrist sprains.;
, The application of ice is an effective treatment for essentially all minor musculoskeletal injuries, including wrist sprains.Apply the ice to the most tender part of your wrist in order to reduce the swelling and pain. Ice should be applied for 10-15 minutes every 2-3 hours for a couple of days, then reduce the frequency as the pain and swelling subside.


Compressing the ice against your wrist with an elastic wrap will also help control the inflammation, but don't tie it too tight because complete restriction of blood flow could cause more damage to your hand and wrist.
Always wrap ice or frozen gel packs in a thin towel in order to prevent frostbite on your skin.

, Wrapping your wrist in an Ace or tensor bandage, surgical tape, or a simple neoprene wrist support will offer a small degree of joint support and allow you to compress ice to your wrist easier, but the biggest benefit is likely psychological — essentially it's a visual reminder to take it easy with your wrist for a short period of time.Wrap your wrist from your knuckles all the way up to the middle of your forearm, overlapping the elastic wrap as you go.The wrist wrap, tape or neoprene wrist support should be snug, but not cutting off your circulation — make sure your hand doesn't turn blue, get cold or start to tingle.

, After the pain and inflammation have subsided, do some light stretches if your wrist feels stiff. Mild strains and sprains respond well to some light stretching because it relieves tension, promotes blood flow and increases flexibility.In general, hold stretches for about 30 seconds and do them 3-5x daily until the mobility returns to your wrist.


You can stretch both wrists at the same time by forming the ""prayer pose"" with your hands (the palms of both hands together in front of your face with your elbows bent). Put pressure against your hands by raising the level of your elbows until you feel a nice stretch in your injured wrist. Check with your doctor, trainer, or physical therapist for more wrist stretches if needed.
Consider applying some moist heat to your wrist prior to stretching it — it will make the tendons and ligaments more pliable.

, Non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen, naproxen or aspirin can be short-term solutions to help you deal with significant pain or inflammation in your wrist.Keep in mind that these drugs can be hard on your stomach, kidneys and liver, so it's best not to use them for more than 2 weeks at a stretch. Do not give aspirin to children under 18


Talk to your doctor before starting new medications if you have medical problems, take medications, or have allergies to medications.
Alternatively, you can rub a pain relieving cream or gel directly into your sore wrist.
Keeping your wrist elevated can also help reduce swelling.
Moderate wrist sprains, usually called Grade II sprains, involve significant pain, inflammation and often bruising due to ligament tearing.
Grade II wrist sprains may feel more unstable and lead to more hand weakness than Grade I wrist sprains.

, A moderate or Grade II wrist sprain involves greater swelling because ligament fibers are torn, although it's not completely severed.As such, you'll need to be more diligent with your icing routine in addition to taking some anti-inflammatory medication. The sooner you can apply cold therapy to a Grade II sprain the better, because blood vessels will contract in diameter and restrict blood flow and subsequent swelling. For a more serious sprain, ice should be applied for 10-15 minutes every hour for the initial day or two, then reduce the frequency as the pain and swelling subside.


If you don't have any ice or gel packs, then use a frozen bag of veggies from your freezer — peas or corn works great.

, Since instability and weakness is more of a concern with a Grade II wrist sprain, a more supportive wrist splint or brace should be worn.A splint or brace is not primarily psychological, as it will restrict movement (immobilize) and offer substantial support if you need to use your hand for something.


Check with your doctor on which type of splint or brace is recommended.
Make sure you position your wrist in a neutral position when your tighten the wrist splint or brace.
Grade II sprains may need to be immobilized with a brace or splint for 1-2 weeks, which can result in stiffness and reduced range of motion when you take it off., Once your Grade II wrist sprain starts to heal after a few weeks, you may need some rehabilitation to gain back your strength and mobility. You can do this at home or you can see a physical therapist, who will show you specific and tailored strengthening exercises for your wrist and hand.To build strength once your wrist feels better, try squeezing a ball: with your arm outstretched and your palm facing up, squeeze a rubber ball (a racquetball works well) with your fingers for 30 seconds at a time and repeat 10-20x per day.Other activities that will help build strength in your wrist include lifting light weights, bowling, playing racket sports and working in your yard (pulling weeds etc.). Don't start these types of activities until your doctor or therapist tells you to do so.

, In instances of significant wrist trauma that leads to severe pain, swelling, bruising, and/or loss of hand function, it's best to see your family physician or emergency department immediately so that the correct diagnosis can be made. Grade III wrist sprains involve completely severed ligaments, which will need surgery to repair.Other serious wrist conditions that your doctor should consider are fractures, dislocations, inflammatory arthritis (such as rheumatoid arthritis or gout), carpal tunnel syndrome, infection and severe tendonitis.


X-rays, bone scans, MRI and nerve conductance studies are modalities that your doctor may use to help diagnose your wrist issue. Your doctor may also send you for a blood test to rule out rheumatoid arthritis or gout.
You should also see your doctor if you still have symptoms after treating a sprain at home for more than 2 weeks or if the symptoms are getting worse.
Other symptoms that many be signs of a fracture include significant swelling, bruising, tenderness, deformity, and causes of the injury like falling onto your wrist and sports injuries.
Children tend to have more fractures than sprains of the wrist.

, Chiropractors and osteopaths are joint specialists who focus on establishing normal motion and function of the spinal and peripheral joints, including the wrist. If your wrist sprain primarily involves a jammed or slightly dislocated carpal bone, then the chiropractor / osteopath will use manual joint manipulation, also called an adjustment, to unjam or reposition the affected joint. You can often hear a ""popping"" or ""cracking"" sound with an adjustment.


Although a single adjustment can sometimes completely relieve your wrist pain and restore full range of motion, more than likely it will take a few treatments to notice significant results.
Wrist adjustments are not appropriate for wrist fractures, infections or inflammatory arthritis.

, An injection of steroid medication near or into a ligament, tendon or joint can quickly reduce inflammation and allow normal, pain-free movement of your wrist again.Cortisone injections are only indicated for serious or chronic wrist sprains. The most common preparations used are prednisolone, dexamethasone and triamcinolone.


Potential complications of corticosteroid injections include infection, bleeding, tendon weakening, local muscle atrophy and nerve irritation / damage.
If corticosteroid injections fail to provide adequate resolution for your wrist, then surgery should be considered.

, Surgery for chronic wrist pain is the last resort and should only be considered after all other noninvasive therapies are proven ineffective, although if you experience a traumatic Grade III sprain, then surgery will be your first option to repair the severed ligaments.Wrist surgery involves reconnecting the severed ligament to the associated carpal bone, sometimes with pins or plates for stabilization.


Wrist ligament surgery takes from 6-8 weeks to heal, although several months of rehabilitation may be needed to regain normal strength and range of motionPossible complications from wrist surgery include local infection, allergic reaction to anesthesia, nerve damage, paralysis and chronic swelling / pain.

Take some time to examine the object that you will move.,
Map out a safe route.,
Stand close to the load that you have to carry.,
Drive up with your heels.,
Carry or hold the item.,
Put the item down.",How to Lift a Heavy Object Safely," Test the item's weight by picking up one corner of the item, or push it with your foot to gauge if you need another person, dolly or other form of equipment to pick up the object. Will it be too heavy for you to lift without help?






Take some time to examine boxes you might be moving for holes or other weak spots that might fall out while you're carrying. Is there anything that might shift, causing an imbalance?
Is the object slippery, or difficult to get a grip on? You might consider using some tacky-grip moving gloves to help make the move safely, with a secure grip on the object.;
, If you're carrying the item somewhere, make sure there's nothing in your way. Remove any obstacles, toys or other objects you may trip over on the route to your destination. Be aware of stairs or uneven floors, as well.

Even if you're not having someone help you carry the object itself, it's helpful to have a spotter, who can tell you when you're getting close to doorways or other obstacles, especially if the object obscures your vision in any way.

, With your feet placed shoulder-width apart, tighten your abdominal muscles and bend your knees and hips to get into a squatting position. Look straight ahead, keeping your head back to complete the proper lifting form.





Arrange or gather the object so that it will not slip, move, or change its balance when you lift it. Grip the object while in squatting position.

, When you've got a hold of the object, keep it close to your body, and push up, straightening your knees into a standing position, maintaining a straight back.





It's very important to keep your back straight and to drive up from your heels, not from your toes or the balls of your feet, which can cause you to lose your balance, as well as putting strain on your knees.
Look up while lifting. By looking up, you will position your spine in a way that reduces the opportunity for injury.
Never jerk upright, or yank on the object to lift it. Go slowly. You can seriously injure your back, knees, or arms by trying to go too fast.

, Depending on the situation, you may need to carry the object to a new location or hold it in one position for a length of time.





Bend your knees slightly as you carry the item. Take small steps and change direction by pivoting your feet. If you're standing, keep your knees bent and control your breathing with deep, rhythmic breaths so you don't get dizzy.

, Return to the squatting position using your leg muscles, not your back muscles. Keep your back straight.





Make sure to continue holding the item close to your body as you lower it in its place. You can strain your arm muscles and lose your balance, or drop the object, if you start letting it shift around as you prepare to set it down. Set it down gently.

Incorporate a dumbbell.,
Join a class.,
Practice balancing in your downtime.,
Get stronger.",How to Improve Balance," The first step to improving your overall balance is to strengthen the muscles in your legs, calves, and thighs. This can be done through doing squats on a weekly basis.


Stand with your hips and knees wide apart. Keep your arms out, abs tight, and your back straight.Bend your knees and hips and slowly lower yourself until your thighs are parallel to the floor. If you're not used to doing squats, you may not be able to get your thighs quite parallel so just get as close as possible.Slowly rise back up, contracting your glutes. Try to do three sets of 10, with a one minute break after each set.;
, Weight shifts are another exercise that address improving balance. It's a good exercise to start with if you're just beginning to work on improving your balance.


Stand, keeping your feet hip-length apart, and distribute your weight equally between both legs. Shift your weight to the right and lift your left foot off the floor. Hold this position as long as you can, aiming for around 30 seconds.Return to the original position and then repeat the exercise on the other side. Do as many repetitions as you can without getting sore. As time goes on, you should be able to gradually increase the number of repetitions., Once you get used to doing squats and weight shifts, move on to move complicated exercises. A single leg balance will help you work on strengthening your lower body and improving overall balance.


Begin in the same position you used for the weight shifts, with legs hip-length apart and weight equally distributed.Place your hands on your hips, lift your left leg to the side, and bend your leg back at the knee. Hold this for 30 seconds and then return to the starting position.Repeat on the other side. Do as many repetitions as you are comfortable with and, with time, increase the number of repetitions., You can add strength training aspects to your exercises, which should further improve your balance and form. Using a dumbbell, you can do bicep curls.


The weight of the dumbbell depends on your fitness level. If you're not used to lifting weights, pick something in the five to 10 pound range to start off with. You can always add weight with time if this feels too easy.Hold the dumbbell in your left hand, keeping your palm facing upward. Stand with your legs hip-length apart and weight equally distributed. Lift your right leg off the floor and bend it back at the knee. Hold this pose for about 30 seconds.Return to the original position and then repeat on the other side. You can increase the number of repetitions and amount of weight as you become more fit., There are a variety of activities that promote good balance. Joining a yoga, Pilates, or tai chi class can help you improve balance.


Tai chi is a form of movement training that promotes coordination, strength, and balance. Many fitness and community centers offer tai chi classes. See what's available in your area by browsing the yellow pages, checking online, and looking for ads in the local paper. If there aren't classes offered in your area, you can buy or rent DVDs or find videos on YouTube that teach basic tai chi poses.Yoga and Pilates are both forms of exercises that promote strengthening core muscles by moving between a variety of poses. Yoga has the added benefit of teaching mindfulness and meditation. In addition to improving balance, yoga could reduce overall stress. Like tai chi, fitness and community centers may offer yoga and Pilates classes. You can also buy or rent DVDs or find instructional videos online., While you're doing day-to-day activities, practice balancing. Try to stand on one foot while brushing your teeth, waiting for a bus or train, doing your makeup or brushing your hair, and other daily activities., Your balance will improve greatly if you strengthen your buttocks, hamstrings, and quadriceps. Aerobic activities, like running and jogging can help. You can also engage in low impact weight training, like lifting weights at home or doing push ups, sit ups, squats, and other easy exercises to do without heavy equipment.Try incorporating a medicine ball into your workouts to build core strength.

Understand why it is important to get rest when experiencing angina pain.,
Stay in a cool, quiet room.,
Lie down with your head elevated.,
Think of non-stressful things.,
Practice deep breathing.",How to Get Rid of Anginas1," Rest is necessary to relieve angina. It improves blood flow by relaxing the blood vessels in your body. It also reduces the workload of the heart muscles thereby preventing fatigue.It is important to call for help when angina sets in. While you wait for help, it is important to rest. The following steps discuss how to get the rest you need.;
, Noisy and hot rooms could leave you more irritated. Emotional disturbance raises the heartbeat and may worsen angina.

, Use two pillows to do this. Elevate your head for at least five minutes. Angina triggers panic that could then lead to high blood pressure. Uncontrolled high blood pressure may result in other medical complications such as stroke. Head elevation keeps the blood pressure at bay., Think of happy thoughts such as your favorite vacation destination. Relaxing the mind can help your body to relax. This can then improve blood flow by opening up your blood vessels.

, Inhale through your nose and exhale slowly through your mouth in a calm, controlled manner to relax your blood vessels and keep you calm.

,
Waist twists. Do the waist twist, with your hands on your hips, with your arms swinging or with dowel on your shoulders. Rotate your spine just a little, instead rotate you body around your spine.
Standing, alternating elbow to knee crunch. If balance is a problem, hold on to something, and do one side at a time.

,


Do a forward bend and back bend. Forward bend from the hips, return to the upright position and bend backwards like doing the limbo. When bending forward: either reach downwards or keep your arms to your sides. To keep your balance when bending back - look forward and not up.
Break down the forward and back bend. To have a full stretch with the standing back bend, try it separately from the forward bend. Hold on to something solid and bend backwards with your spine and your neck (cervical) spine. It is very important to exercise the spine both ways.

, It is very important to have a strong foundation for your back. Also do lunges to stretch your front thigh muscles and to have a lower back curve. Squat flat footed and on the balls of your feet. Lunges are not an alternative to the squat but a supplementary exercise.

Try taking nitrates.,
Take Nitroglycerin (NTG).,
Consider taking Isosorbide Mononitrate (ISMN) ISMN is given as an oral tablet or skin patch.,
Try Isosorbide Dinitrate (ISDN).,
Talk to your doctor about beta-blockers.,
Try taking calcium channel blockers (CCB).",How to Get Rid of Anginas2," Nitrates relax and open up the blood vessels in the body. This helps more oxygen reach the various parts of your body. This helps to relieve heart muscles of the heavy pumping they have to do when you don’t have enough oxygen, which then relieves chest pain.#*Some examples of nitrates include nitroglycerin, isosorbide mononitrate (ISMN), and isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN). These will be discussed in detail in the following steps.

, Nitroglycerin is the oldest known nitrate. NTG’s reputation of rapid symptom relief has led to its use for more than a century. NTG is taken sublingually. The tablet is placed under the tongue. Sublingual medications go into the blood system faster than typical oral tablets; consequently, it gives faster relief.The medication will melt on its own and directly reach the heart blood vessels faster.


The typical dose is 0.3 or 0.6 mg tablets placed under the tongue when angina sets in., The recommended dose is 30 to 60 mg once daily for oral tablets as maintenance.The recommended dose is 5 to 25 mg/day for patches., ISDN is also given as oral tablet or skin patch. The recommended dose is 10 to 60 mg two or three times a day for oral tablets as maintenance. The recommended dose is 5-25 mg/day for patches., Beta-blockers slow down the heart rate and reduce the intensity of your heart muscle contractions. This prevents the heart muscles from tiring out and indirectly prevents chest pain. Some examples of beta-blockers are metoprolol and propranolol.


The recommend dose for metoprolol is 50 to 200 mg twice daily. The recommended dose for propranolol is 80–120 mg twice daily., Calcium channel blockers act by reducing the role of calcium in heart contractions and arteries thereby causing relaxation. CCBs are second-line treatment for angina when nitrates and beta-blockers do not provide symptomatic relief. Some of the examples are amlodipine and verapamil.


The recommended dose for amlodipine is 5 to 10 mg once a day.The recommended dose for verapamil is 80 to 160 mg three times a day."

Jog frequently.,
Stop smoking.,
Try meditating.",How to Get Rid of Anginas3," Jogging opens up the blood vessels of the muscles and heart. Just be sure to get a medical clearance from your doctor prior to exercising to know your limitations and to make sure that you do not overexert yourself., Smoking narrows down the opening of the heart arteries and promotes fat deposition in the walls of the blood vessels. This in turn can lead to angina, so try your best to quit.


You can talk to your doctor about ways that you can make quitting easier for yourself. Your doctor may prescribe a patch or even going to a support group.

, Mediation can help you to relax by allowing you to reflect upon the stressors in your life in a collected manner. This can help you to control your stress levels, which may help you to prevent angina from occurring in the future.


Find a quiet space and try to clear your mind and find inner peace for at least 15 minutes each day.

Make the switch from refined grains to whole grains.,
Eat peanuts for a snack.,
Avoid fast food joints.,
Eat small meals throughout the day rather than eating three large meals a day.,
Stay hydrated.,
Reward yourself.",How to Get Rid of Anginas4," The additional fiber in your diet will help prevent clogging of heart arteries. Whole grain alternatives include:


Whole grain pasta products, brown rice, oatmeal, and barley.

, A handful of peanuts are high in protein and monounsaturated fatty acids. Protein keeps you full longer while the mono-unsaturated fatty acids are good for your heart.Just be sure to keep it to a handful a day. Anything in excess is bad for the body.

, Fast food meals should not be an integral part of your daily diet. These foods are high in sodium and “bad” fats which can both lead to heart problems.

, Five frequent meals are recommended to optimally absorb the nutrients in each meal, while also managing your weight.Smaller and more frequent meals keep your caloric intake at a reasonable range.

, Fruit juices and sodas contain lots of sugar. Hydrate with water instead. It is calorie-free and keeps your mind functioning well to sustain healthy food choices. It also helps cleanse the digestive system daily.


If you are not a fan of water, try homemade flavored water. Cut up slices of orange, lemon, or any citrus fruit and mix it with a liter of clean drinking water. Let the fruit slices sit for at least 30 minutes to enjoy the added flavor. As a bonus, you get Vitamin C from the fruit.

, Eating sensibly should not equate to depriving yourself of all treats. Schedule a cheat meal every week. The cheat meal allows you to eat whatever you want. This may help to fight off cravings during the rest of the week.

Monitor chest pain or discomfort you experience.,
Take note of any left shoulder and arm pain you feel.,
Keep track of jaw pain.,
Monitor any ache in your stomach.,
Take note if you find that you are fatigued.,
Talk to a doctor if you faint.",How to Get Rid of Anginas5," Chest pain or discomfort occurs between 30 seconds to 5 minutes. Chest pain is the most common symptom people with angina experience.


The pain is located over the center of the breastbone. Patients will often press a clenched fist against the area of pain which is known as the Levine’s sign.
The pain occurs after mild physical exertion. It may occur at rest in some cases. Resting usually relieves the angina after a few minutes.
Chest discomfort can be described as a heavy chest. It is often likened to an elephant sitting on the chest.

, This is the second most common symptom of angina. The pain is described as a tingling sensation that starts from the left shoulder and travels down to the left arm.


The pain is produced because the nerve of the heart also supplies the skin of the left shoulder and arm.
Sometimes, the pain may be felt simultaneously in the left and right shoulder.

, The pain is often felt in the left jaw. The nerve that supplies the heart and skin of the jaw are the same; hence, pain is felt in the jaw when angina sets in.

, This tummy ache often occurs in the upper abdomen, and generally manifests in the elderly.


The pain is reproduced because the nerve supplying the heart and upper abdomen skin are the same.
Elderly individuals who complain of tummy ache should be brought to a physician in order to rule out angina.

, Fatigue is caused by a deficit in oxygen supply to the different parts of your body. The heart itself cannot receive sufficient oxygen, so it cannot pump oxygen elsewhere.

, Passing out occurs because of a lack of oxygen flow to the brain. The brain is very metabolically active and needs blood and oxygen flow to function optimally. Insufficient oxygen leads to a power shortage and the eventual shutting down of brain function.

If it is very sore, it may be too painful to even have a sheet over it.;
, This will help reduce inflammation and take the edge off the pain.


Apply ice for 20 minutes and then give your skin time to warm up. This will prevent the cold from damaging your skin.
If you do not have ice available, you can use a package of frozen peas or corn.
Always wrap the ice or frozen vegetables in a thin towel so the ice isn’t applied directly onto your skin.

, These drugs may help reduce the inflammation and pain. Take them immediately during the attack and for two days afterwards.Possible medications include ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB) and naproxen sodium (Aleve).
These medications are not recommended for people with stomach ulcers or bleeding, kidney problems, or blood pressure conditions.
Don’t take aspirin. It can increase your uric acid levels.If you are currently on other medications, consult your doctor to avoid any possible interaction effects.

, When you digest purines, your body produces uric acid which can build up into urate crystals in your joints. By reducing the amount of purines in your diet you lower the amount of purines your body must process.Eat less red meat like steaks.
Don’t eat gamey meats like rabbit, pheasant, and venison.
Avoid organ meats like liver, kidneys, heart, and sweetbreads.
Reduce your seafood intake, especially caviar and shellfish like mussels, crab and shrimp. You should also steer clear of oily fish like sardines, anchovies, mackerel, sprats, whitebait, herring, and trout.
Yeast and meat extracts are also high in purines. This includes marmite, bovril, and many commercially manufactured gravies.
Low-fat dairy products may decrease your risk of gout attacks.

, Alcohol, especially beer and spirits, is high in purines.An occasional glass of wine is ok and may even be beneficial.Binge drinking can provoke a gout attack.

, These drinks can aggravate gout.Drinks flavored with cherry extract are an exception, as long as they aren’t artificially flavored and packed with other sugars. Cherries and cherry extract may help lower your levels of uric acid., Your kidneys are crucial for producing urine and getting rid of uric acid through your urine.The amount of water you need will vary depending on your body size, activity levels, and the climate you live in. But you should drink at least eight glasses per day.Once you are thirsty, you are already dehydrated and should drink quickly. If you urine infrequently and pass dark or cloudy urine, those are signs that you may be dehydrated.

Aim for about 30 minutes of moderate exercise, like walking, or 15 minutes of more strenuous exercise, like running, five days a week.Swimming is a great way to get exercise without putting stress on joints that might be hurting.

, However, it is important to follow a healthy, sustainable dieting plan.


Using crash diets that aim to make people lose lots of weight quickly are often high in protein and low in carbohydrates. These diets are likely to be high in purines and may aggravate your gout.

, Vitamin C helps uric acid be excreted through your kidneys into your urine, and may be protective against gout.Talk to your doctor before adding supplements to make sure it is right for you.
Vitamin C only reduces uric acid a little bit, so while it may help prevent new attacks, it is unlikely to be a cure.

, Both caffeinated and decaf coffee may help reduce uric acid levels. However, this evidence is tenuous because studies have not been able to identify how this might be occurring.

, Gout can damage joints and it is best to begin treatment as soon as possible. This will also help reduce your pain as quickly as possible.Symptoms may include severe pain, inflammation, and redness in the affected joint for several hours and less severe pain lasting for days or weeks afterwards. The hand and foot joints are affected most often.While gout can be managed with lifestyle changes, treatment usually requires medications.
See a doctor immediately if your gout attack is associated with a fever or if the joint is hot. These symptoms may indicate that you have an infection that needs quick attention., Your doctor will help you come up with a treatment plan that is tailored to your needs and your medical history. Your doctor may prescribe:Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. If over-the-counter drugs were ineffective and managing your pain, the doctor can describe something stronger.
Colchicine. This drug decreases the inflammatory reaction of the joint lining in response to the crystals.
Corticosteroids. These medications may be given as an injection directly into the joint for fast relief and may be especially helpful for those who cannot tolerate NSAIDs. However, these corticosteroids can’t be taken long-term.
If you have a history of gout, your doctor may prescribe medications to reduce your uric levels by either reducing the amount of uric acid your body produces or by increasing the amount that your body excretes., Some people are more prone to gout than others. Factors that raise someone’s risk include:A diet with lots of meat, seafood, sweet drinks, and beer.
Being overweight.

There may also be numbness, tingling or sharp pains radiating down the neck and into the arm, shoulder or hand, because the bulge is being compressed into the nerve., This has been shown to reduce swelling and decrease pain by numbing the area. Ice periodically for twenty minute periods throughout the first day or two., These include ibuprofen, aspirin or Aleve. Begin immediately after the pain starts. Take the anti-inflammatory regularly for a few days, but do not take more than 2400 mg per day.

, After the first day or two switch from icing the affected area to heating it. Use a bath, shower or hot towel to apply moist heat. This can help to calm the muscles. When a disc herniation occurs, the muscles surrounding the cervical spine often seize up. , Typically a bulging disc will improve in a few days if allowed to recover. Bed rest is not required, but limiting rotation or bad posture for a few days and resting the neck by lying down occasionally should help.

Strive for good posture.,
Sleep on a supportive mattress.,
Wear only quality shoes that fit properly.,
Be active and move your body more.,
Eat foods rich in minerals and vitamins.,
Get screened for scoliosis.,
Consult with your doctor or medical specialist.,
Talk to your doctor about spinal surgery.,
See a chiropractor or osteopath.",How to Have a Straight Back," Maintaining good posture while you sit and walk is crucial for the shape, function and overall health of your spine.Good posture doesn't mean completely straight, but it does mean balanced and aligned, such that the normal shape of your spine isn't compromised. Slouching is a classic sign of poor posture, so keep your shoulders pulled back, head up and low back slightly arched when you sit and walk. Good posture is often a reflection of confidence and good health.


While at work, make sure your office chair is height-adjustable and has lumbar support for your low back. At home, use small cushions to support your back while watching TV.
Make sure your computer is at eye level and centered in front of your chair, otherwise you risk straining your neck and triggering headaches.
Practicing walking with a book balanced on your head may sound old school, but it's still a great way to learn good posture.;
, Your sleeping position is another important element of body posture. You spend about 1/3 of your time in your bed, so pay more attention to the quality of your mattress and your sleeping posture.For many people, firm mattresses are the best choice in order to provide the necessary support for their spines. Memory foam top covers may also be of benefit and provide more comfort. You should consider changing spring mattresses every eight to 10 years, whereas memory foam mattresses may have a shorter life span — rotate them on a weekly basis to increase longevity. The thickness of your pillow should roughly match the width from your shoulder to your ear, which helps to keep your neck aligned during sleep.


Most medical / health authorities feel that the best sleeping posture is laying on your side with hips and knees slightly flexed, and with a small pillow wedged between your thighs.Don't read in bed with too many pillows behind your head because it will put strain on your neck and act to reverse the normal curvature of your cervical spine.

, Your feet are important for good biomechanics (movement) and posture because they are the foundation or base for your body. Problems in your feet are translated up the chain, including to your spine. Thus, wear sturdy shoes with supportive arches, slightly raised heels (between 1/2 – 3/4 of an inch) and enough room for your toes so that you can wiggle them. Avoid regularly wearing narrow high-heeled shoes because they create foot problems and affect the body’s center of gravity (pushing you forward), which leads to compensatory alignments in the pelvis and spine.More specifically, wearing high heels leads to excessive curvature in the low back, a condition called hyperlordosis of the lumbar spine.
If you are overweight, have flat feet or a short leg, then consult with a podiatrist or chiropractor about getting custom-made orthotics (shoe inserts) or heel lifts. Orthotics promote an aligned and functional pelvis / spine by supporting your arches and compensating for any leg-length discrepancy.
Causes of anatomically short legs include a fractured ankle, leg or pelvis that doesn't heal perfectly, knee surgery, bone malformation during childhood and some bone diseases.

, Mild-to-moderate exercise has numerous health benefits, including potential weight loss and increased muscle strength, which help prevent the spine from becoming overly stressed.Obesity puts too much pressure on spinal and peripheral joints, making them more prone to wearing out (osteoarthritis) and becoming misaligned. Furthermore, strong muscles (via tendon connections) help keep bones and joints in their optimal positions, assuming you train properly. As such, be careful not to overwork certain muscle groups with resistance training while ignoring their antagonist muscles, as that can trigger musculoskeletal imbalance and poor spinal posture. Ask a personal trainer, physiotherapist or chiropractor about important postural muscles before you start a training regimen at home or at the gym.


Exercises that strengthen your spine include using the rowing machine, doing reverse sit-ups and lifting weight in the military press position — all promote better upper body posture.
If lifting weights isn't your thing, then pilates and yoga can certainly stretch, strengthen and align your core muscle groups (abdomen, pelvis, low back), which create the foundation of good posture. Stretching the chest muscles can open up the tight muscles in the front of the body.

, In order to maintain strong, straight and healthy bones, you need to eat enough minerals and vitamins in a regular basis. Calcium, phosphorus and magnesium form the mineral matrix of your bones (including your spine) and a dietary deficiency in any of these can lead to weak and brittle bones (osteoporosis) that are susceptible to breaking. Vitamin D is also important for strong bones because it's needed for normal mineral absorption in the intestines.A lack of vitamin D leads to ""soft"" bones (rickets or osteomalacia) that are easily deformed with weight bearing. Vitamin K, well known for its blood clotting function, is not as well recognized for its importance for strong bones. A lack of vitamin K also contributes to weak bones.


The best food sources of calcium include: collards, kale, spinach, sardines, tofu, almonds and sesame seeds.Vitamin D3 is produced in the body in response to summer sunshine and is the best one to supplement with. Good food sources include fatty fish (salmon, tuna, mackerel), fish liver oil, beef liver, hard cheese and egg yolks.
Vitamin K2 is made in small amounts by the bacteria that line your gastrointestinal tract and is also the best supplemental choice. Good food sources include fermented natto, hard cheese, egg yolk, butter, chicken liver and salami.

, Scoliosis is a medical term for an abnormal lateral curve in the spine (typically in the thoracic or mid-back region) that can cause deformity, chronic pain and reduced range of motion.For reasons not well understood, some babies are born with scoliosis (congenital), while other people develop it during their adolescent years (idiopathic). Scoliosis screenings are typically conducted on middle-school kids by resident nurses, but medical doctors, chiropractors and physiotherapists are also qualified to screen you for scoliosis. Screening involves flexing forward at the waist and looking for shoulder blade alignment. If one blade sticks up significantly more than the other, then a thoracic spine scoliosis is very likely.


Scoliosis screening is most important for adolescents because some relatively effective treatments exist during this developmental stage (such as bracing or implantation of metal rods), which can slow or stop the progression of the deformity.
Adolescent girls have a greater risk of developing aggressive forms of scoliosis compared to boys.
Lateral curves can occur virtually anywhere in the spine, but they are most common in the thoracic region.

, If it appears you have a lateral curve (scoliosis) in your spine, due to a positive screening or because your body looks lopsided in a mirror, then consult with your doctor or a medical specialist such as an orthopedist. As noted, mild scoliosis doesn't often cause symptoms, but the greater the deformity the greater the chances of spinal pain and dysfunction.Your doctor or orthopedist will thoroughly examine your spine and probably take spinal x-rays to better understand the extent of your issue. If appropriate, your doctor will also look for common adulthood causes of scoliosis, such as osteoarthritis, osteoporotic fractures, osteomalacia and herniated discs.Your doctor may also recommend a CT scan, MRI or bone scan to better diagnose your spinal problem.
Scoliosis runs in families and likely has a genetic component. As such, kids who have parents, brothers or sisters with scoliosis should have regular checkups and screenings.

, Spinal surgery should be considered as a last resort for the vast majority of people who have issues and pain in their spines, but it can be the first choice for an adolescent who has a rapidly progressive scoliosis. Surgery for scoliosis often involves fusing together two or more vertebrae with bone grafts and inserting a metal rod or other device for structural support.. The goal is to realign and fuse together the curved vertebrae so that they heal into a straight, solid segment. Keep in mind that surgery is used mainly to correct a curve or stop it from progressing while an adolescent is still growing, and not for adults who may have some scoliosis. However, spinal fusion surgery is appropriate for elderly adults who have osteoporotic fractures of the thoracic spine, which often gives them a hunchback appearance.


Metal rods (stainless steel or titanium) are used to hold the straightened spine in place until the bone fusion is complete. They are attached to the spine with screws, hooks, and/or wires and then often removed when the child becomes an adult.
Potential complications from spinal surgery include infection (osteomyelitis), allergy to anesthesia, nerve damage / paralysis and chronic pain.

, Chiropractors and osteopaths are spinal specialists who tend to use natural, hands-on methods for treating spinal problems and other musculoskeletal issues. They can check your spine for any abnormalities such as unusual curves, restricted or malpositioned spinal facet joints and/or tight paraspinal muscles. If there is an issue in the spine, a type of physical manipulation called a spinal adjustment is used to reposition the facet joints and restore normal mobility. Spinal adjustments can't reverse moderate-to-severe scoliosis, but they can be important for maintaining normal spinal alignment and function.


Regular spinal treatments (perhaps monthly) from a chiropractor or osteopath is helpful for most causes of spinal pain and it promotes better posture.
The popping or cracking sound of spinal adjustments is caused by pressure change in the joints, which results in nitrogen gas bubbles being released and imploding.

Tests may include palpitation, x-rays and range-of-motion tests. Your doctor may do the following:


Your doctor might prescribe additional medication, including steroids and muscle relaxers like Robaxin and Soma.Prescribe a neck brace if there is severe pain and muscle weakness. This can be provided by a medical supply company in the area.Prescribe an imaging study after a few weeks or months, or if you show signs of neurologic compromise (numbness, tingling, weakness, clumsiness), to verify and better understand the injury. Possible imagining techniques include MRI, Myelogram, CT, or EMG., Physical therapy includes stretches and straightening exercises, which strengthen the muscles that support the neck. It also is likely to include traction, which gently relieves the stress on the neck for short periods of time.Building strong abdominal muscles and lean body mass will also be important for preventing future re-injury., Occupational therapy may be necessary if the way you work or your daily routine has caused or aggravated the disc herniation. These therapists may be able to improve the way you walk, sit or stand to help reduce pain. Special care should be exercised when performing heavy lifting., Chiropractic care may also be necessary in order to restore mobility in the neck and to open up the joint in order for the disc to return to its normal position. You do not need a doctor's referral in order to go to a chiropractor., Consider surgery only if conservative treatments were attempted and failed to produce results after a period of at least six weeks or if you have a large herniation with neurologic compromise. Your general practitioner will refer you to a specialist for advice about these procedures. Procedures include an anterior cervical discectomy or artificial disc replacement.Procedures typically require the disc to be removed."

Know the common mechanisms of shoulder injuries.The most common way to get a crooked (dislocated or subluxed, meaning partially dislocated) shoulder is from a sports injury, a fall, or another accident.,
Understand that repeat injuries are very common.In other words, if you have already dislocated your shoulder (i.e.,
Recognize the symptoms of a shoulder dislocation.,
See a doctor for definitive diagnosis and treatment.If you suspect you may have a shoulder dislocation, it is best to see a doctor to have your shoulder re-aligned.",How to Identify and Adjust a Crooked Shoulder1," There is usually one precipitating event, and most people feel a significant amount of pain around the shoulder area at the time of their injury.


Shoulder dislocations (partial or complete) are quite common, as the shoulder is a very mobile joint. It is essentially a ""ball-and-socket"" joint, where the top of the arm bone (the ""ball"") fits into the shoulder (the ""socket"").
Because the shoulder facilitates such a great range of motion for the arm, the joint is looser than most other joints in the body, making you more prone to dislocation or subluxation.
Examples of ways you can dislocate your shoulder are falling on an outstretched hand, falling on the shoulder itself, a forceful blow from the front pushing your shoulder backwards, or a vigorous twisting of the upper arm. You should also avoid carrying a heavy bag (like a backpack, purse, diaper bag, or messenger bag) on one side of the body. Consider lightening your load or carrying things in a backpack — with both straps on and properly adjusted.;
, had a crooked shoulder) once or more in your life, the probability of it occurring again is significantly higher.

, Common symptoms include:Pain
Swelling and/or bruising around the shoulder area
Difficulty (and likely pain) when attempting to move your arm
Deformity of the shoulder
Possible numbness, tingling, or weakness in your arm or hand (if you have this, it warrants immediate medical attention and a prompt visit to the emergency room)., If you are on a sports team with trained personnel such as physiotherapists who are comfortable re-aligning your shoulder, you can let them give it a try. However, it is a risky procedure if done by someone who is inexperienced, so your best bet is to go to your local emergency room for help from a doctor.


If your shoulder is not dislocated but your it still looks crooked, or one shoulder is higher than the other, you may have overactive muscles in the upper neck area on one side. Talk to your doctor about stretches and exercises to release the muscle. This may be caused by cold drafts, posture with shoulders hunched up, sitting a computer, a seat that is too high, or muscle knots and trigger points.

Undergo shoulder reduction.This is when a doctor does some pulling and tugging maneuvers to strategically re-align your shoulder joint.,
Immobilize your shoulder.After your shoulder has been re-aligned, it will need to be immobilized for the first part of the healing period (generally three to four weeks).,
Exercise your shoulder.,
Take pain medications as needed.Since a dislocated shoulder can be quite a painful injury, you will likely need pain medications as you recover.,
Ice your shoulder.Another strategy to help with recovery after a shoulder dislocation is icing the area.,
Use surgery as a last resort.For severe and/or repeated shoulder dislocations, surgery may be used as a last resort treatment.",How to Identify and Adjust a Crooked Shoulder2," You will sometimes be given muscle relaxants first, and occasionally a sedative as well depending upon the severity of your pain. Once your shoulder joint is re-aligned, the pain you feel should significantly improve.

, This is usually accomplished using a sling.


After initial immobilization, your physician will recommend a specific rehabilitation program for you as your shoulder begins to feel better.
Following through with the rehabilitation plan is key for recovering full range of motion. It is especially important if you are an athlete and if returning to optimum sports performance is your goal.

, Your rehabilitation will likely involve doing specific exercises and stretches to strengthen your shoulder. Exercises that your doctor might suggest may include isometric exercises, which strengthen the muscles without moving the joint, internal and external rotations, and/or band exercises.Perform an internal rotation by attaching an exercise band to a sturdy point about waist-high. Hold the band in your hand, bending your elbow to 90 degrees and resting it against your side. Keep your elbow steady against your side and pull the band across your body. Lay your forearm flat against your stomach if possible (but only pull as far as is comfortable). Then slowly release.Try an isometric adduction. Place a small item, like a rolled up newspaper, between your injured arm and your torso. Squeeze the item and try to hold it in place for five seconds. Repeat five to ten times.Check with your doctor before performing any exercises to avoid further injury.

, Depending upon the severity of your injury, your doctor may offer you prescription pain meds for the first few days. Alternatively, you can opt for over-the-counter pain meds such as Acetaminophen (Tylenol) and/or Ibuprofen (Advil), which may be sufficient to keep the pain under control.

, Icing helps to diminish inflammation and it can also temporarily ease the pain.

, The risks of surgery are higher, so it is generally reserved for exceptional cases.

Maintain a healthy and active lifestyle.The best thing to do for scoliosis is to continue living an active life and to keep your body fit and healthy.",How to Identify and Adjust a Crooked Shoulder3," A common cause of a ""crooked shoulder"" (and crooked spine) that is ongoing in nature is scoliosis. Scoliosis is often first detected in younger children. It may worsen as one grows, or it may cause no significant problems, depending upon the severity of the problem. Signs that you may have scoliosis include:Uneven shoulder heights
An uneven waist with one hip higher than the other
A curve in your spine when examined from behind
One shoulder blade that protrudes more than the other
Although scoliosis is fundamentally a spine issue, it sometimes manifests as a crooked shoulder that appears to need adjustment.

, The most important thing to do if you suspect that you may have scoliosis is to see your physician sooner rather than later. It is most often a condition that can be monitored over time and does not require immediate treatment. However, in very severe cases, it may warrant braces to reposition your spine and shoulders, and/or surgery to correct the alignment., Although this will not alter the alignment of your spine and/or shoulders, it will strengthen the muscles of your back and shoulders and thus may help to keep your mobility as good as possible.

Severe back pain can come on quickly, but it can sometimes go away quickly also (without any treatment whatsoever) because the body has a tremendous ability to heal itself. As such, be patient for a few hours if you experience a bout of bad back pain, avoid any strenuous activities and keep a positive attitude.


Signs and symptoms for which you should seek immediate medical attention include: muscle weakness and/or loss of sensation in your arms or legs, loss of bladder or bowel control, high fever, sudden weight loss.Total bed rest is not a good idea for most types of back pain because some movement (even just brief, leisurely walks) is needed to stimulate blood flow and healing. If you are in a lot of pain, wait two to three days before resuming normal activities.If your back pain is exercise related, then you may be working out too aggressively or with bad form — consult with a personal trainer.
If you think your back pain is work related, then talk to your boss about switching activities or altering your work station — such as a more supportive chair or a cushioned mat for underneath your feet.;
, The application of ice is an effective treatment for essentially all acute (occurring in the last 24 – 48 hours) musculoskeletal injuries, including back pain.Cold therapy should be applied to the most painful part of your back in order to reduce the inflammation and numb the pain. Ice should be applied for 10 – 15 minutes every hour, then reduce the frequency as the pain and swelling subside.


Compressing the ice against your back with a stretchy bandage or elastic support will also help control the inflammation.
Always wrap ice or frozen gel packs in a thin towel in order to prevent frostbite on your skin.
If you don't have any ice or gel packs, then use a frozen bag of veggies from your freezer.
Ice is not be appropriate for chronic back pain — moist heat may provide more relief.

, Soaking your back in a warm Epsom salt bath can significantly reduce pain and swelling, especially if the pain is caused by muscle spasm or strain.The magnesium in the salt helps the muscles relax. Soaking in a warm bath or applying heat directly to your back likely isn't a good idea if you're experiencing lots of inflammation, which is often the result of joint, ligament and nerve injuries of the back.


Don't make the water too hot (to prevent scalding) and don't soak in the bath for much more than 30 minutes because the salty water will pull fluid from your body and start to dehydrate you.
Alternatively, apply moist heat to your back pain — microwaved herbal bags work well and are often infused with aromatherapy (such as lavender) that has relaxing properties.

, Non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen, naproxen or aspirin can be short-term solutions to help you deal with bad pain or inflammation in your back.Keep in mind that these medications can be hard on your stomach, kidneys and liver, so it's best not to use them for more than 2 weeks at a stretch.


Alternatively, you can try over-the-counter analgesics such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) or muscle relaxants (such as cyclobenzaprine) for your back pain, but never take them concurrently with NSAIDs.
Pain relieving creams and gels applied directly to your sore back are another option, especially if the pain is more muscle related. Capsaicin and menthol are natural ingredients in some creams that act to distract your brain from the pain by making your skin tingle.

, Rolling on a piece of firm foam is a good way to massage your spine and potentially relieve mild-to-moderate discomfort, especially in the mid back (thoracic) region. Foam rollers are commonly used in physiotherapy, yoga and pilates.Pick up a foam roller at a sporting goods or big-box store — they're very inexpensive and nearly indestructible.
Place the foam roller on the ground, perpendicular to where you're going to lay your body. Lie down on your back so that the foam roller is beneath your shoulders and begin to roll back and forth. Repeat as many times as necessary, although your muscles might be a little sore after the first time you use a foam roller.

, Lie down on your back and place a ball between your shoulder blades. Roll around until you find a tender spot. Hold that position for at least 30 seconds, or until you feel the pain going away. Move on to other tender spots.


Repeat this every day until the pain improves. This may be used as a preventive measure since these trigger points, most commonly known as muscle knots, have a tendency to appear again due to bad posture or overuse.

, While your back pain may make you reluctant to move or exercise, stretching and strengthening your body can reduce back pain. Before starting exercise, consult with your doctor or a physical therapist about which exercises are appropriate for your specific condition.Exercises such as squats, planks, or simple, gentle stretches can help reduce back pain. Get more ideas by reading the following articles: Treat Lower Back Pain and Treat Upper Back Pain.

, Mattresses that are too soft or pillows that are too thick may contribute to back pain. Avoid sleeping on your stomach as it can cause your head and neck to twist in ways that aggravate back pain and it can also compress and irritate lower back joints.The best sleeping positions for back pain are on your side (similar to the classic fetal position) or on your back with a pillow elevating your legs, which takes some pressure off the low back joints.


Although even waterbeds can be comfortable for some people, most people seem to benefit from a firm orthopedic mattress.
Spring mattresses typically last about eight to 10 years with constant use, depending on the weight of you and your partner.

, Bad back pain can often be aggravated by improper lifting posture. When you need to lift something, make sure it is not too heavy for you to carry alone (and ask for help if it is). Keep the load close to your body, turning with your entire body instead of twisting or stretching at the waist.


There is some disagreement about the very best way to lift a heavy load, but if you want to lift without putting stress on your back, you should squat, bending at the hips and knees but keeping your back straight, and lift from this position. This will allow you to lift with your legs and not your back.

, Chiropractors and osteopaths are spinal specialists who focus on establishing normal motion and function of the small spinal joints that connect the vertebrae, called spinal facet joints. Manual joint manipulation, also called an adjustment, can be used to unjam or reposition facet joints that are slightly misaligned, which triggers inflammation and sharp pain, particularly with movement.


Although a single spinal adjustment can sometimes completely relieve your back pain, more than likely it will take 3-5 treatments to notice significant results. Your health insurance may not cover chiropractic care.
Chiropractors and osteopaths also use a variety of therapies tailored more towards muscle strains, which may be more appropriate for your back issue.
Traction techniques or stretching of your spine with an inversion table may also help your back pain. Some chiropractors have inversion tables in their offices, which allows you to turn yourself upside down in a controlled and easy way, enlisting the help of gravity to decompress your spine. Consider buying an inversion table for home use.

, A strained muscle occurs when individual muscle fibers tear, which leads to pain, inflammation and some degree of guarding (muscle spasm in attempts to prevent further damage). A deep tissue massage is helpful for mild-to-moderate strains because it reduces muscle spasm, combats inflammation and promotes relaxation.Start with a 30 minute massage, focusing on your entire spine and hips. Allow the therapist to go as deep as you can tolerate without wincing.


Always drink lots of water immediately following a massage in order to flush out inflammatory by-products and lactic acid from your body. Failure to do so might cause a headache or mild nausea.

, Acupuncture involves sticking very thin needles into specific energy points within the skin / muscle in efforts to reduce pain and inflammation.Acupuncture for back pain can be effective, especially if it's done when the symptoms first occur. Based on the principles of traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture works by releasing a variety of substances including endorphins and serotonin, which act to reduce pain.


There is mixed scientific evidence that acupuncture is helpful in relieving chronic back pain, but there's lots of anecdotal reports that many people find it extremely helpful.Acupuncture points that may provide relief to your back pain are not all located near where you feel the pain — some can be in distant areas of the body.
Acupuncture is practiced by a variety of health professionals including some physicians, chiropractors, naturopaths, physical therapists and massage therapists — whoever you choose should be certified by the National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine.""Dry needling"" is another type of therapy involving acupuncture needles, but without the Chinese traditional medical techniques. It may be helpful to relieve pain., Stress-relieving practices like meditation, tai chi and breathing exercises have been found to help alleviate musculoskeletal pain and help prevent injuries in many people. Yoga is also great for relaxation and involves practicing specific postures or poses and helpful breathing exercises.Yoga poses can stretch and strengthen muscles and improve posture, although you might need to modify some poses if they aggravate your back pain.
Try mindful meditation. Mindful meditation is a form of pain management that can be done anywhere at any time.One study found that three 20-minute meditation sessions over the course of three days not only reduced pain, it also appeared to have a lasting effect far beyond the 20 minutes spent in meditation., If diligent home care and alternative therapies are not effective for alleviating your back pain, then make an appointment with your family physician in order to consider any potentially serious spinal issues such as a herniated disc, nerve entrapment, infection (osteomyelitis), osteoporosis, stress fracture, rheumatoid arthritis or cancer.X-rays, bone scans, MRI, CT scan and nerve conductance studies are modalities that your doctor may use to help diagnose your back pain.
Your doctor may also send you for a blood test to rule out rheumatoid arthritis or a spinal infection such as meningitis.
Your doctor may refer you to medical specialists such as an orthopedist, neurologist or rheumatologist in order to better figure out your back condition.

, If your back pain is recurring (chronic) and caused by weak spinal muscles, poor posture or degenerative conditions such as osteoarthritis, then you need to consider some form of rehabilitation. A physical therapist can show you specific and tailored stretches and strengthening exercises for your back.Physiotherapy is usually required 2-3x per week for 4-8 weeks to positively impact chronic back problems.


If need be, a physiotherapist can treat your sore back muscles with electrotherapy such as therapeutic ultrasound or transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS).
Good strengthening exercises for your back include swimming, rowing and back extensions, but make sure your pain is under control first.

, An injection of steroid medication near or into spinal joints, muscles, tendons or ligaments can quickly reduce inflammation and pain, and allow normal movement of your back again.Corticosteroids are hormones that display powerful anti-inflammatory properties. The most common preparations used are prednisolone, dexamethasone and triamcinolone.


Potential complications of corticosteroid injections include infection, bleeding, tendon weakening, local muscle atrophy and nerve irritation / damage.
If corticosteroid injections fail to provide adequate resolution for your back pain, then as a last resort, surgery should be explored.

If your back pain, however, persists for more than two weeks, see an internist and get a referral to specialist to diagnose the pain. Lower back pain, as commonly referred to, is pain in the lower back, widely diffused. Lower back pain is usually not spinal pain or pain in the spinal muscles.


Lower back pain can be caused by any number of factors:Aging
Arthritis
Herniated disk
Compression fractures
Illness, such as scoliosis


If you are unsure about what is causing your lower back pain, or you think any of the above conditions may be manifesting in lower back pain, see your doctor. A doctor will be able to prescribe pain killers that ease discomfort while helping you devise a physical rehabilitation routine.;
, You use your lower back muscles directly while bending forward and back, and also indirectly, while exercising and moving around. Although your lower back muscles are strong, they require rest. Sometimes, the onset of pain will significantly diminish when the lower back muscles are given the proper rest.


Consider whether you might have injured your lower back while sleeping. There are a couple things that you can do to ease lower back pain while you sleep:

Sleep on your side.Try sleeping with a small pillow tucked between your legs. A small pillow will give your lower back extra support by straightening out the legs while you sleep.
Consider switching to a medium-firm mattress. According to some sources, a medium-firm mattress may put the least stress on your lower back., If you have bad posture, it may be causing or contributing to your lower back pain. The lower back is particularly susceptible to pain caused by bad posture because it supports a good deal of your weight.


Good posture is having the spine curved slightly inward at the lower back, slightly outward at the upper back, and slightly inward again at the neck (so the neck is upright but tilted slightly forward).
If your shoulders tend to slouch, pull them back a bit so they are centered. Do not expand your chest out and pull your shoulder excessively back like a preening bird.
Throughout the day, periodically perform posture checks. Check to see if:

Your chest is upright and elevated.
Your head is elevated and centered over your torso.
Your shoulders are at a comfortable position, creating minimal strain by being lowered.



, Let's face it: we spend countless hours at work, toiling away, often not in a very good position for our lower and upper back, our legs, and our hands. Correct your workstation to improve your posture and ease lower back pain.


Keep your feet flat on the floor. This will often depend on how high your chair is, so don't be afraid to tinker with it to achieve good results.
Change your posture regularly. Sitting in one position for long periods of time is not healthy. So switch it up. Sit upright for most of the time. Sit reclined for some of the time. Sit declined for a little bit.
Find time to stand. Every hour, take a 5 minute break if you can and walk around. Inspect the sky. Talk to a coworker. Figure out the 11th decimal of pi. Whatever it is, break up the monotony of being seated for hours on end.

Consider using a standing workstation. Check out standing desks, or think about the feasibility of a treadmill desk.



, Muscle spasms occur when smooth muscle in your body contracts as a result of the autonomic nervous system. They are often painful and are a symptom of muscle strain or tear.Gently stretch the lower back, moving back and forth to break the spasm cycle. If stretching causes excessive amounts of pain, stop and see a doctor. Stretching should help resolve the muscle contraction., NSAIDs are a group of pain killers, like ibuprofen and aspirin, that ease inflammation and stop pain by blocking certain enzymes on a chemical level.Take OTC ibuprofen as directed by the package. Ibuprofen will help ease any inflammation and help control the pain on a chemical level.
Aspirin may be taken by adults, but it should not be given to children. Aspirin has been linked to Reye's syndrome, which causes acute brain and liver function damage in children.One added benefit of aspirin, however, is that it lessens the likelihood of blood clotting, and so could be helpful in staving off heart attacks., Ice helps constrict the blood vessels underneath the skin, dulling pain and easing swelling. If you want to use ice on your lower back, there are a number of ways medical practitioners advice to apply it:


Use an ice-towel. Wet a towel with cool water, wring out most of the moisture, and place into a plastic bag. Put the bag into the freezer for 15 to 30 minutes, remove towel from bag, and place over lower back.Use a homemade ice-pack. Put one pound (0.45 kg) of ice into a plastic bag. Pour in just enough water into the bag to cover the ice. Squeeze excess air from the bag, seal it, and apply to lower back.Use a frozen bag of vegetables. Peas work particularly well.
Use a homemade slush pack. Mix three cups of water and one cup of denatured alcohol into a freezer bag. Wait until slush forms (but before it becomes completely frozen), remove, and apply to lower back., Heat can also be an effective source of comfort and pain relief for lower back pain. For effective temperature therapy, try alternating between heat and cold treatments.


Use moist heat on the lower back for 15 to 20 minutes at a time. Moist heat (baths, steams, heat packs) tends to work better than dry heat.Purchase and use an all-day heat wrap, available OTC at most pharmacies.
Try not to fall asleep with an electrical heating pad on. Set your heating pad to low or medium, never to high, and set an alarm if you think you may fall asleep while the heating pad is still on., Lower back pain can be a vicious cycle. Your back hurts, so you don't want to make it worse by stretching or exercising. But by not stretching or exercising, you weaken the muscles in the lower back, leaving them more susceptible to pain and less supportive of the weight they are designed to hold. Try some of these exercises for lower back pain relief. Stop if any of these exercises causes pain.



Butterfly. Sit down on a mat with your knees bent and bring your feet together. The sides of your thighs should try to reach the ground. With your hand clutching your feet, slowly lower your torso down over your feet, keeping your thighs and backside on the ground. Stay in this position for 15 seconds and move slowly back up.

Happy baby. Begin by lying flat on your back on a mat. Bring both legs back, bend your knees so that your thighs are parallel to the floor and your legs are perpendicular, and grab onto the outside of your feet with your hands. Use your upper body strength to press both knees down closer to the floor. Stay in this position for 15 seconds and slowly release.

Pigeon. Sit with your left leg crossed in front of you and the right leg extended fully behind you. Make sure your right hip is pointed down to the ground. Keeping your hands on your hips, arch your back gently for a stretch. Then, move your hands out in front of you and move your torso down over your crossed knee. Stay in this position for 15 seconds before moving slowly back up.
Avoid the following stretches while back pain is present:Straight leg sit-ups
Bent-leg sit-ups, crunches, or curl-ups
Leg lifts
Biceps curl or military press
Standing toe-touches



, If you can, walk around for a good hour on the treadmill, or outdoors, where there are natural inclines and declines. Don't push yourself, and stop whenever there's significant pain. Walking is considered by some doctors to be ""the best exercise"" for back pain,as it promotes healthy circulation and naturally strengthens the lower back muscles.

, While sitting at a desk, push your back firmly against the back of the chair. Take a cold water bottle and lodge it between your lower back and the chair. This will make you sit properly, and the cold will ease inflammation and pain.

, In addition to walking, back stretches, and core stabilization, other treatments can offer targeted pain relief and even treatment. Explore which of these options may work for you:


Massage. There are numerous kinds of massage, some of which are good for the back (Swedish massage) and others that may not be good for a back injury (Shiatsu massage). Talk to your doctor or masseuse about options.
Spinal manipulation. Many people who benefit from spinal manipulation see results pretty much right away.Many chiropractors or physical therapists who practice spinal manipulation will work with your doctor to devise the best course of treatment.
Acupuncture. Acupuncture is the ancient Chinese medicine using needles and pressure points to access the chi. If that sounds dubious, just consider: several tests have demonstrated that people suffering from lower back pain experienced decreased pain and increased mobility after acupuncture., Try to remove as many stressors from your life as possible. In addition to simply feeling better, stress reduction might help your ability to recover from lower back pain. Studies show that people who are depressed may have a harder time recovering from back pain, which in turn makes them more depressed."

See your doctor if your back aches last longer than a few weeks.",How to Get Relief from Sudden Morning Back Aches," One of the major causes of morning back pain is a poor sleeping position during the night. Like sitting with poor posture in a chair all day, sleeping in a poor position all night will cause your back to become stiff and tense, leading to back pain in the morning (think about it: that's eight hours in a position that strains your back). Though it may be difficult to train your body to embrace a different sleep position than customary, it is worth doing as a way to prevent morning back pain.Try to sleep on one side with your legs bent and tucked towards your chest. You can also place your hands by your head or under your pillow. This fetal sleeping position will put very little stress on your back and help to prevent stiffness and discomfort in the morning.
You may also want to place a pillow between your legs while you lay on your side to help release tension in your lower back. Tuck the pillow between your knees and let your legs relax.;
, If you tend to get the best sleep when sleep on your back, slide a pillow or a rolled towel under your knees before going to bed. This will help to relieve any stress or tension on your back as you sleep., If you are a light sleeper and tend to wake up throughout the night, make an effort to shift your sleep position so your back is better supported.This could mean moving from sleeping on your back to sleeping on one side in the fetal position. Or, you may place a pillow on either end of the bed to prevent you from rolling around onto your stomach or your back during the night. Over time, your body may adapt on its own to a sleep position that is better for your back.

, You should make sure you are sleeping on a good quality mattress that is not sagging in certain areas or lumpy. A good mattress can help to provide good support for your back as you sleep, especially if you tend to sleep on your back.You may want to invest in a mattress pad that you can place over your mattress to make it more comfortable and smooth, or consider getting a new mattress if your mattress is getting old and starting to sag.

, Sometimes, the wrong temperature can have effects on back pain and tightness. For example, workers in cold environments are at greater risk of developing low back pain.Pay attention to room temperature and make sure you sleep in a comfortable setting. If your room is cold, try to increase the size of the comforter or blanket. Cold temperature at night can tighten up the muscles and lead to muscle aches in the morning.


You may also want to see if your room is damp or too hot also.
Not everyone will react to the same temperature the same way.

, This simple stretch can help to release tension in your lower back and ease any aches or pains in your lower back.To do this stretch, bend your knees to your chest and wrap your hands around your shins. Grasp both knees and gently pull them towards your chest. Try to keep your lower back on the bed as you pull your knees towards your chest. Hold this stretch for eight to 10 deep breaths.
You can also try a modification of this stretch by squeezing one knee at a time to your chest. Lie on your back with both legs extended on the bed. Slowly bring one knee to your chest, making sure your lower back is pressed firmly on the bed. Use your hands to pull your knee towards your chest. You can also try to bring your forehead to touch your knee. Hold this stretch for eight to 10 breaths and then repeat it with the other leg.

, Your glute muscles run through your buttock and can lead to back and leg pain if they are tense or stiff.Begin by lying on your back on the bed. Bend both legs so your feet are planted on the ground a few feet from your hips. Lift your right leg and cross it over your left thigh, resting your right ankle over your thigh. Your right leg should make a 90 degree angle or close to a 90 degree angle.
Loop your hands through your bent leg and try to wrap your hands around your left shin. If you cannot reach your left shin, you can wrap your hands around your knee or your foot. Breathe in as you gently use your hands to pull your left shin towards you. Keep your lower back on the floor. You should feel a stretch in your right piriformis muscles and your right hip flexor.
Hold this stretch for eight to ten breaths and then repeat with the other leg.

, This stretch will help to strengthen your abdominal muscles without putting too much strain on your back. Strong abdominal muscles will help to keep your back strong, making it less prone to aches and pains.To do a pelvic tilt, lie down on your back with your knees bent a few feet away from you and your feet flat on the bed. Your lower back should be hovering slightly above the bed in this position.
Breathe in and tighten your abdominal muscles so your lower back is pressed flat against the bed or the ground. Hold this for five seconds, or one breath, and then relax your abdominal muscles. Do this three more times, holding for five seconds each. Try to build up to ten repetitions a day.

, A gentle twist can help to reduce back pain by stretching out your spine and releasing any knots in your spine or lower back.To do a gentle twist, lie on your back with your legs bent a few feet from you. Breathe in as you gently let your legs lower to the right side. Keep them bent and relaxed, with your hips dipping towards the right side. Spread your arms on either side of you so they form a T-shape and slowly turn your head so you are looking to your left. Hold this stretch for eight to ten breaths.
Bring your legs back to the center and then let your legs fall to your left side. Hold the twist on your left side for eight to ten breaths.

, The hamstring muscles can often be tight, in turn tightening up the low back. Stretching the hamstrings can reduce stretch on the low back.Lie on your back with both legs straight. Bring one leg up and bend it 90 degrees.
Reach behind your thigh and pull your leg towards you as you straighten out the knee.
The goal is to bring the leg up 90 degrees. Hold this position for 20 to 30 seconds. Repeat three to five times on each side.
To get a better stretch in the hamstrings, try pointing your toes towards your head. This allows you to stretch the hamstrings and calves together.

, If your back aches badly enough that you feel you cannot move, you should stay in bed or contact your doctor. But if you can move around, even with the back pain, you should try to stay mobile and get out of bed. Bedrest can actually make your back pain worse and prolong your back issues. Focus on small movements like walking around your bedroom or going down a flight of stairs slowly and carefully. Staying mobile will help your back to recover.Be careful not to lift any heavy objects or strain your back by trying to pull or push anything that is heavy or weighty. You want to give your back time to recover by making gentle light movements rather than forceful or stressful movements. Most back pain injuries occur in the morning, when the body has not had enough time to warm up. To avoid this, never lift right away without warming up the back through movement.

, If you are really suffering from morning backaches and are looking for fast pain relief, take OTC pain medication, such as ibuprofen or paracetamol. Always take the recommended dosage specified on the label.If available, you may also try rubbing ibuprofen gel on your back to relieve aches and pains. Look for ibuprofen gel at your local drugstore., Ice can help to reduce any inflammation and soreness on your back. Use an ice pack or a bag of frozen peas wrapped in a towel. Place the ice pack at the base of your spine for five minutes. You can do this while sitting or lying in bed.You should follow up the ice pack with twenty minutes of heat. This could be a heat pack that you warm up in the microwave or a hot water bottle wrapped in a towel. Place the heat pack at the base of your spine to help reduce inflammation.

, You can get topical treatments over-the-counter at your local drugstore or through a prescription from your doctor. Popular topical treatments for back pain include products like Tiger Balm, BenGay, and Icy Hot. You should not use topical treatments if you are pregnant, nursing, younger than 10 years of age, or have sensitive skin. Senior citizens should also use caution when applying topical treatments to their skin.You should also never use topical treatments on open wounds or broken skin as you can develop mild to serious chemical burns due to the ingredients in some topical treatments.
Topical treatments can come in several forms, from gels and foams to creams and roll on sticks. Talk to your doctor if you have any concerns before using topical treatments on your back aches.

, Most back pain will go away after within a week, though you may experience bouts of back pain if you do not make lifestyle changes (such as doing exercise) or sleep position changes.If your back aches do not subside in the mornings despite the use of stretching and home remedies, you should see your doctor. Your doctor may recommend that you try physical therapy or massage therapy for your back pain. She may also run tests to determine if your back pain is a symptom of a more serious medical issue.Your doctor may also be able to recommend a chiropractor. You can then make an appointment with a chiropractor to help release the stress and tension in your back.
Back pain that occurs after a night of sleep may also be due to trigger points or muscle knots. You may want to see a health professional who is trained in trigger point therapy. The health professional will poke and prod your back muscles to see if any of those knots are contributing to your pain."

Rest your back.,
Take anti-inflammatory medications.,
Treat sharp pains with cold.,
Use heat to soothe dull pain.,
Stretch your lower back.,
Make an appointment to see your doctor.",How to Fix Bad Sciatic Pain1," For the first day or two following the onset of your sciatic pain, you should feel free to take it easy. This should grant you some relief from the pain, allowing your muscles to relax and avoiding agitating your sciatic nerve with too much activity. However, you should not remain in bed for longer than a day or two. Prolonged inactivity will weaken the muscles responsible for supporting the bones in your back making it easier to further irritate your sciatic nerve, and leading to increased pain over time.While it is important to remain active following your initial resting period, be careful not to agitate your sciatic nerve. Avoid strenuous activities such as lifting heavy objects, or sharply twisting your back.;
, Irritation of the sciatic nerve can lead to inflammation, which can worsen and prolong sciatic pain. Many over-the-counter anti-inflammatory drugs are available, and may help you reduce your sciatic pain. Ibuprofen and naproxen are two popular and effective choices. Be sure to follow the dosage instructions on the products packaging., Most patients find that cold therapy is most effective in reducing sciatic pain when the pain is sharpest, usually 2-7 days following the onset of sciatic pain. Apply an ice pack (or an alternative source of cold such as a zip-lock bag of ice cube, bag of frozen peas, etc.) to the location of your pain for 20 minutes at a time, repeating every two hours.Make sure to wrap your ice pack in a cloth or towel. Applying the ice directly to your skin may cause discomfort similar to a burn.

, Many patients find that their pain becomes less sharp 3-7 days after the onset of sciatic pain. Heat, rather than cold, may be more effective in reducing your pain during this phase. Apply heat to the location of your pain using a hot water bottle, an electric or microwaveable heat pad or by taking a warm bath. Apply the heat for 20 minutes at a time, repeating every two hours.Make sure to follow all manufacturer's instructions for your heat source.
While many patients report a preference for cold therapy during the beginning of sciatic pain, and heat during the later stages, this is by no means universal. If one or the other does not seem to be effective in reducing your pain, try alternating hot and cold therapies every two hours.

, Gentle stretching of your legs, butt, and lower back muscles will help reduce tension, leading to decreased irritation of your sciatic nerve. It is best to consult your doctor or physical therapist for guidelines on safe and effective stretches. While many variations are available, the simplest and most popular stretch for alleviating sciatic pain is a simple knee-to-chest stretch:Laying flat on your back, lift up one knee until you can wrap your hands around the front of your knee or behind your knee or thigh, gripping it with interlocking fingers.
Gently pull your knee towards your chest until you feel a gentle tugging in your butt and lower back.
Hold for 20 seconds, being sure to breathe deeply.
Slowly release your leg, allowing it to return to its starting position on the floor.
Repeat the stretch up to three times, then stretch your other leg in the same way.

, Most sciatic pain dissipates on its own after a couple of weeks. If your pain does not reduce on its own, or if the pain is very intense and at-home methods have failed to alleviate it, make an appointment to talk to your doctor about treatment options. Rarely, more serious symptoms will develop which require immediate medical attention. Contact emergency medical assistance if you experience:Numbness in one or both legs
Pronounced weakness in one or both legs
Sudden loss of control of the bladder or bowels or inability to urinate or have a bowel movement

Consult your doctor.,
Treat pain and inflammation with prescription medication.,
Receive steroid injections for more severe or debilitating pain.,
Consider surgery for severe cases.,
Visit a physical therapist.,
Visit a chiropractor.,
Explore alternative treatment options.",How to Fix Bad Sciatic Pain2," Sciatic pain can be caused by many conditions of the lower back and spine. Your doctor will know how to test you for these conditions. The types of tests and examinations your doctor chooses will depend on your symptoms and state of health, but may include both simple physical examinations, as well as imaging techniques such as an X-ray or MRI. Be as detailed as you can when describing your symptoms to your doctor, as this will help them determine which tests to perform.Common causes include: herniated or slipped disc, piriformis syndrome, spinal stenosis, or spondylolisthesis., Normally, sciatic pain dissipates after a few weeks. If your doctor determines that surgery is not needed, they may still recommend medications to provide relief from the pain while you recover from your sciatica. Typical choices include:Oral steroids, which provide powerful anti-inflammatory effects, reducing inflammation and irritation in the region surrounding the sciatic nerve.
Muscle relaxants or narcotic pain medication to reduce pain.

, Steroid injections work much like oral steroid medications, temporarily reducing inflammation and irritation surrounding your sciatic nerve. Injections are more invasive than regular medication, but are also more effective. Your doctor may recommend steroid injections if your pain is sufficiently severe., Sciatic pain can be caused by a variety of factors and conditions, most of which do not require surgery to fix. When sciatic pain is due to discs or bones in the spine physically contacting and ""pinching"" the sciatic nerve, however, your doctor may recommend surgery to correct the problem. Two types of surgery are most common:For herniated discs (this is when the discs that cushion the important movements of the spine develop a weak area and the inner core pushes out), microdiscectomy may be performed. In this procedure, the piece of the herniated disc which is in contact with, and irritating, the nerve is removed.
For lumbar spinal stenosis (narrowing of the discs of the spine causing them to ""pinch"" the nerve), lumbar laminectomy may be recommended. This is a more serious surgery in which the disc is reshaped to allow the nerve to rest comfortably once again.

, After your doctor has recommended medication, and potential surgical solutions for your sciatic pain, they may recommend that you begin working with a physical therapist. Your therapist will help you learn exercises and stretching routines to strengthen your core, and support your spine. Creating strength and stability in the lower spine is the first step to permanent relief from sciatic pain., Many sufferers of sciatica find that treatment by a chiropractor helps to relieve their pain. Although more research is required to confirm the effectiveness of chiropractic care, recent studies have shown promising results for many patients with sciatica., If traditional treatment methods have failed to alleviate your sciatic pain, talk to your doctor about less typical options. Here are some suggestions of alternative therapies to talk to your doctor about:Therapeutic massage to relieve tension and inflammation
Yoga classes, to promote core strength and flexibility
Cognitive behavioral therapy to teach strategies for pain management
Acupuncture, or other traditional therapeutic methods

Consider acupuncture.",How to Get Rid of a Nerve Pinch in Your Neck Quickly," Pinched nerves in the cervical spine (sometimes also called a kinked neck) usually occur suddenly and are related to awkward neck movements or trauma such as a whiplash-type injury.If caused by an unusual movement, the neck pain may quickly disappear on its own, without any treatment whatsoever. As such, be patient for a few hours to a few days and hope for the best.


The risk of neck injury is greater if the muscles are chilled and tight, so don't move your neck too vigorously until it warms up via normal blood flow or by covering it up with a scarf or turtleneck if the ambient temperature is cool.
Continuing with normal neck movements, despite the pain, may reverse a pinched nerve naturally.;
, If your neck problem is caused by conditions at your job, then talk to your boss about switching to a different activity or altering your work station so your neck doesn't suffer more abuse. Blue collar jobs such as welding and construction have relatively high incidence of neck pain, but so can office jobs if the neck is constantly in a twisted or flexed position. If the neck pain is exercise related, then you may be working out too aggressively or with bad form — consult with a personal trainer.


Complete inactivity (such as bed rest) is not recommended for neck pain — muscles and joints need to move and get ample blood supply in order to heal.Practice better posture at work and at home. Make sure your computer monitor is at eye level, which will help prevent neck strain / sprain.
Examine your sleeping conditions. Pillows that are too thick may contribute to neck issues. Avoid sleeping on your stomach as it can cause the head and neck to twist in aggravating ways.

, Non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen, naproxen or aspirin can be short-term solutions to help you deal with pain or inflammation in your neck.Keep in mind that these medications can be hard on your stomach, kidneys and liver, so it's best not to use them for more than two weeks at a stretch. Never take more than the suggested dosage.


Dosage for adults is usually 200-400 mg, by mouth, every four to six hours.
Alternatively, you can try over-the-counter analgesics such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) or muscle relaxants (such as cyclobenzaprine) for your neck pain, but never take them concurrently with NSAIDs.
Be careful not to take any medications on an empty stomach, as they can irritate the lining of your stomach and increase the risk of ulcers.

, The application of ice is an effective treatment for essentially all minor musculoskeletal injuries, including neck pain.Cold therapy should be applied to the most tender part of your neck in order to reduce the swelling and pain. Ice should be applied for 20 minutes every two to three hours for a couple of days, then reduce the frequency as the pain and swelling subside.


Compressing the ice against your neck with a wrap-around elastic support will also help control the inflammation.
Always wrap ice or frozen gel packs in a thin towel in order to prevent frostbite on your skin.

, Soaking your upper back and neck in a warm Epsom salt bath can significantly reduce pain and swelling, especially if the pain is caused by muscle strain.The magnesium in the salt helps muscles relax. Don't make your bath too hot (to prevent scalding) and don't soak in the bath for much more than 30 minutes because the salty water will pull fluid from your body and potentially dehydrate you.


If swelling is a particular problem in your neck, then follow-up the warm salt bath with cold therapy until your neck feels numb (about 15 minutes or so).

, Stretching your neck might reverse your neck condition (either take pressure off the nerve or unjam the cervical facet joint), especially if you address the problem during its early stages.Use slow, steady movements and take deep breaths during your stretches. In general, hold stretches for about 30 seconds and repeat three to five times daily.


While standing and looking straight ahead, slowly laterally flex your neck, bringing your ear as close to your shoulder as possible. After a few seconds of rest, then stretch the other side.
Stretching directly after a warm shower or the application of moist heat is recommended because your neck muscles will be more pliable.

, Medical specialists such as an orthopedist, neurologist or rheumatologist may be needed to rule out the most serious causes of your neck pain, such as herniated disc, infection (osteomyelitis), osteoporosis, spinal fracture, rheumatoid arthritis or cancer.These conditions are not common causes of neck pain, but if home care and conservative therapies are not effective, then more serious problems need to be considered.


X-rays, bone scans, MRI, CT scan and nerve conductance studies are modalities that specialists may use to help diagnose your neck pain.Your doctor may also send you for a blood test to rule out rheumatoid arthritis or a spinal infection such as meningitis.

, Your neck pain may be caused by chronic joint inflammation. A facet joint injection involves real-time fluoroscopic (X-ray) guidance of a needle through the neck muscles and into the inflamed or irritated spinal joint, followed by a release of an anesthetic and corticosteroid mixture, which quickly relieves both pain and inflammation at the site. Facet joint injections take 20 – 30 minutes to do and the results can last from a few weeks to a few months.Facet joint injections are limited to three within a six-month time frame.
The pain relief benefits from facet joint injections typically begin on the second or third day post treatment. Until that time frame, your neck pain may get a little worse.
Potential complications of facet joint injections include infection, bleeding, local muscle atrophy and nerve irritation / damage.

, Traction is a technique to open the spaces between your vertebrae. Traction can come in many forms, from a therapist using his hands to manually traction your neck, to a traction table. There are also homemade traction devices. Always remember to traction the neck slowly. If there is any pain or numbness radiating into the arms, stop right away and see a doctor. Before using a home made traction device, it’s best to seek the advice of your physician, chiropractor, or physical therapist so he can help you pick the right one.

, Surgery for neck pain is the last resort and should only be considered after all other conservative therapies are proven ineffective and if the cause warrants such an invasive procedure. Reasons for neck surgery may include to repair or stabilize a fracture (from trauma or osteoporosis), to remove a tumor, or repair a herniated disc.If the nerves in your neck are truly involved, then you should also notice shooting pains, numbness and/or muscle weakness or wasting in your arms and/or hands.


Spinal surgery may involve the use of metal rods, pins or other devices for structural support.
Repairing a herniated disc often involves fusing two or more bones (vertebrae) together, which usually reduces range of motion.
Possible complications from back surgery include local infection, allergic reaction to anesthesia, nerve damage, paralysis and chronic swelling / pain.

, A strained muscle occurs when individual muscle fibers are taken beyond their tensile limits and subsequently tear, which leads to pain, inflammation and some degree of guarding (muscle spasm in attempts to prevent further damage). As such, what you're calling a ""pinched nerve"" might actually be a strained neck muscle. A deep tissue massage is helpful for mild-to-moderate strains because it reduces muscle spasm, combats inflammation and promotes relaxation.Start with a 30 minute massage, focusing on your neck and upper back areas. Allow the therapist to go as deep as you can tolerate without wincing.


Always drink lots of water immediately following a massage in order to flush out inflammatory by-products, lactic acid and toxins from your body. Failure to do so might cause a headache or mild nausea.
As an alternative to professional massage therapy, use a tennis ball or vibratory device on your neck muscles — or better yet, ask a friend to do it. Roll the ball slowly around the neck tenderness for 10-15 minutes a few times daily until the pain subsides.

, Chiropractors and osteopaths are spinal specialists that focus on establishing normal motion and function of the small spinal joints that connect the vertebrae, called facet joints. Manual joint manipulation, also called an adjustment, can be used to unjam or reposition cervical facet joints that are slightly misaligned, which triggers inflammation and sharp pain, particularly with movement. Traction of your neck may also help relieve your pain.


Although a single spinal adjustment can sometimes completely relieve your pinched nerve, more than likely it will take 3-5 treatments to notice significant results.
Chiropractors and osteopaths also use a variety of therapies tailored more towards muscle strains, which may be more appropriate for your neck issue.

, If your neck problem is recurring (chronic) and caused by weak muscles, poor posture or degenerative conditions such as osteoarthritis, then you need to consider some form of rehabilitation. A physical therapist can show you specific and tailored stretches and strengthening exercises for your neck.Physiotherapy is usually required 2-3x per week for 4-6 weeks to positively impact chronic spinal problems.


If need be, a physical therapist can treat your sore neck muscles with electrotherapy such as therapeutic ultrasound or electronic muscle stimulation.
Good exercises for your neck include swimming, certain yoga positions and weight training, but make sure your injury is resolved first.

, Acupuncture involves sticking very thin needles into specific energy points within the skin / muscle in efforts to reduce pain and inflammation. Acupuncture for neck pain can be effective, especially if it's done when the symptoms first occur.Based on the principles of traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture works by releasing a variety of substances including endorphins and serotonin, which act to reduce pain.


It's also claimed that acupuncture stimulates the flow of energy, referred to as chi.
Acupuncture is practiced by a variety of health professionals including some physicians, chiropractors, naturopaths, physical therapists and massage therapists.

Find outlets.",How to Cope With Biastophilia," It's important to work with a therapist who is experienced with biastophilia and equipped to help you create coping mechanisms, immediately. Your number one concern should be seeking someone who understands the paraphilia, can work openly and honestly with you, and can help you keep all your sexual acts safe and consensual.;
, Being a biastophiliac does not mean you have committed a rape. It means you have a desire to commit a rape. Even if rape is not the word that you would use, know that wanting to forcibly have sex with another human being of either gender (independent of your own) is a rape.

, Know that, even if you do have urges to rape someone, it does not mean you will or have to. Know that, even because you do want to rape someone, that it does not make you a bad person. Considering that 1 in 6 women are raped globally during their lifetimes, the biastophiliac is not alone. This ratio does not include men that are biastophiliac yet restrain themselves from going out and raping others.

, One of the key motives of rape is sexual objectification. Meaning, the person you are having sex with is not your ""sexual partner,"" rather an object to be used by you to gain sexual gratification. If you can sympathize with the group you lust after, see them as human beings with equally complex emotions and histories with families and friends, you will find it much more difficult to actually want to do anything to them. Understand that these people have pain and that rape is humiliating and life-changing. People who are rape survivors never behave the same again, or at least for very long periods of their life in which they cope with losing their control over their life.

,


Bondage, BDSM, and fake-rape porn may seem like jokes, but to find a partner interested in these kinds of things will bring you a lot of happiness and a significant ability to cope with them. There are websites available that try to help like-minded partners come together. A surprising number of women are interested in BDSM and rape play. Although it is not advised you ask a woman on a first date if she's into any of this, functional couples are very willing to try these kinds of things at some point.
Hentai, or drawn pornography (especially from Japan), have a lot of rape in them. Depending on the artist, the facial expressions can be very genuine and tap into and ultimately satisfy the biastophiliac side. This is different from Snuff films as it's not only legal, but there are no injured parties -- the victim is entirely fictional.

Be prepared to deal with some medical professionals who might be dismissive about hyperacusis.,
Work with medical professionals to accurately diagnose hyperacusis.",How to Cope With Having Hyperacusis1," An important part of coping with hyperacusis is educating yourself about this condition so you are better able to deal with it and pursue treatment options. While it’s a good idea to also conduct your own research from reputable websites and publications and talk with medical professionals about hyperacusis, here are a few points to keep in mind:Hyperacusis is often described as having a reduced tolerance for everyday or ordinary sounds.
It is considered a rare condition, with an estimated 1 in 50,000 people experiencing hyperacusis.
The condition can occur suddenly or worsen over time.
Hyperacusis affects both children and adults.
Some people report that only one ear was initially affected, but most individuals experience hyperacusis in both ears.;
, The main symptom of hyperacusis is an increased and very painful sensitivity to noises that other people are not affected by. People with hyperacusis often find these types of noises excruciating and unbearable:Clanking silverware and dishes.
Barking dogs.
Automobile noises.
Alarms, sirens, and bells.
Loud music and musical instruments.
Machinery, electronic noises, equipment, and household appliances.
Screaming, whistling, laughter, clapping, and shouting.
People with hyperacusis also commonly suffer from tinnitus, or ringing, buzzing, humming, or beating in their ears.Because it can be so painful to interact with people and the outside world, individuals with this condition often experience anxiety and feelings of isolation, which can make it challenging to cope with hyperacusis., While there’s much we don’t know about hyperacusis, recognizing potential risk factors and common causes of this condition will help you better understand and cope. It can also be useful to know about potential causes and triggers so you are prepared when doctors ask you detailed questions about your case history. Here are some of the common conditions and risk factors associated with hyperacusis:Noise injury or acoustic trauma such as an airbag explosion, gunshot, fireworks, or other loud noise.
Head injury, neck injury, or whiplash.
Chronic ear infections.
Post-traumatic-stress disorder (PTSD).
Migraines.
Autoimmune disorders.
Autism.
Down’s syndrome.
Reaction to central nervous system surgeries or certain types of medications.
Lyme disease, a bacterial infection spread by tick bites.
Addison’s disease, a disease that affects the adrenal glands.
Meniere’s disease, a disorder of the inner ear.

, People suffering from hyperacusis often find the process of diagnosis and treatment frustrating because there is much we don’t know about this condition. It’s hard for doctors to determine what exactly caused the condition, and there is no single test to diagnose hyperacusis.There are other auditory conditions that can affect your hearing and have symptoms similar to hyperacusis or even in addition to hyperacusis. This is why it is important to work with medical professionals who will also be able to rule out, diagnose, or treat whatever conditions you might be experiencing., Since there’s a lot scientists and researchers don’t know about hyperacusis and much of the research on it is recent or ongoing, some doctors and medical professionals you deal with might be insensitive and dismissive about this condition.

, In spite of the challenges, it’s important to work with medical professionals if you believe you might be dealing with hyperacusis. To cope with this condition, you need to receive an accurate diagnosis and information about treatment plans.Since there is no single test to determine whether someone has hyperacusis, you might have to work with several different doctors and undergo numerous tests.
Usually, people with hyperacusis are first referred to an ear doctor or ENT who performs a thorough examination to rule out other potential causes.
A doctor of audiology or a hearing disorders specialist usually administers audiological assessments to evaluate whether someone might have hyperacusis. One of the most common tests is a LDL test or loudness discomfort level test, which compares your loudness discomfort level against the normal range for human ears.

Don’t be embarrassed or feel abnormal.,
Be prepared for people not to understand.,
Explain what you experience to your friends, family members, or colleagues so they can better understand what you are going through.,
Connect with other individuals who have hyperacusis.,
Don’t isolate yourself.,
Invest in protective equipment.,
Seek medical attention to help you cope with anxiety, depression, or sleeplessness.",How to Cope With Having Hyperacusis2," Although it might be challenging, try not to feel embarrassed about experiencing hyperacusis or feel that your condition makes you abnormal.While this is a rare condition, research suggests that the number of people experiencing and being diagnosed with hyperacusis is actually increasing. This means you are not alone.
You didn’t ask to deal with this condition, and shouldn’t feel that you are to blame.

, Part of coping effectively with hyperacusis is being prepared for some people to have a hard time understanding your condition. Since some definitions of hyperacusis describe it as a “sensitivity” to loud noises, people with hyperacusis are often dismissed as being overly sensitive or dramatic. Unfortunately, people who don’t suffer from this condition have a hard time realizing how difficult and painful it can be to live with hyperacusis.


Although people can be insensitive and make hurtful comments, try not to take these personally. Recognize that their lack of understanding and empathy comes from a place of ignorance.
If people continue to be insensitive, it’s probably best to distance yourself from these individuals. You will be able to more effectively cope with hyperacusis if you are surrounded by supportive people.

, If you don’t tell people about what it feels like to live with hyperacusis, they won’t know.


Invite those who are close to you to attend your medical appointments and counseling or treatment sessions, so they can learn more about this condition and take an active role in helping you.

, Since people who don’t suffer from hyperacusis might find it difficult to understand what you are going through, it can be helpful to cope with your situation if you can connect with other affected individuals.


Join or establish an online hyperacusis support group, so you can meet and talk with other individuals who are dealing with the same condition. Many of these groups are designed to help people learn about their conditions, discuss different treatment options, and locate excellent medical care.Write about your experiences or post on hyperacusis forums and websites so that your friends, family, and other individuals can better understand hyperacusis and offer support. Your story might also help other people with hyperacusis cope with this difficult condition. Researchers have also reported that patient stories help them better understand hyperacusis., Although many people with hyperacusis are tempted to withdraw and isolate themselves, this often results in increased depression, anxiety, and loneliness, which makes coping more difficult. Try not to cut yourself off from friends, family, and the outside world.


Your friends and family care about you and want to support you, so work with them to find ways to interact that are not painful. For example, encourage them to visit you or pick a place where you feel comfortable.

, Many people living with hyperacusis have reported that protective equipment such as earplugs, earmuffs, noise-canceling headphones, and sound machines have helped them cope with their condition and continue their daily activities.These devices range in price from very affordable to very expensive options, so it’s a good idea to do research online and talk with other people who suffer from hyperacusis to see what they found useful.
Audiologists can also recommend and order special equipment that might best suit your unique needs.

, Many people with hyperacusis report that they suffer from anxiety, depression, and difficulty sleeping as a result of their condition, which can make coping with hyperacusis even more challenging. Talk with your doctors and medical professionals about how to manage and treat these symptoms so that you feel better as soon as possible.

Treat the medical condition causing hyperacusis.,
Try sound therapy or retraining therapy.,
Work with a therapist experienced in cognitive behavioral therapy.,
Don’t expect results overnight.,
Be prepared for relapses.,
Don’t give up.",How to Cope With Having Hyperacusis3," If a specific medical condition such as migraines, an autoimmune disorder, or an ear injury is suspected to cause hyperacusis, treating this underlying condition might relieve hyperacusis or improve symptoms.Since the causes of hyperacusis are not well-known, it’s best to work with a doctor or medical professional to determine if it’s appropriate to treat for a potential underlying condition.

, Many therapists recommend that patients with hyperacusis undergo sound therapy to slowly reintroduce sound to their lives so they can resume their daily activities. This method of therapy is designed to desensitize the ear by listening to machines that emit pink noise, a specific frequency of noise.Retraining therapy is often performed with hearing-aid type equipment or bedside sound generating machines that emit a specific frequency of noise. Patients are often exposed to this noise for two to eight hours per day.
Many hyperacusis patients have reported that this treatment improves their noise tolerance levels.Work with a therapist or counselor your audiologist recommends so that you can make sure he has experience treating patients with hyperacusis.

, Cognitive behavioral therapy, or CBT, is also recommended for patients with hyperacusis because it helps desensitize you to the uncomfortable sounds so that you can live a more normal life. CBT therapy can also help hyperacusis patients deal with the anxiety and depression that is often a product of their condition.CBT therapy emphasizes relaxation and mindfulness techniques that have been shown to help hyperacusis patients cope with their condition.
CBT therapy is often used in conjunction with retraining therapy.
Your audiologist should be able to recommend a therapist or counselor experienced in using CBT with hyperacusis patients.

, Treatment for hyperacusis is a process, so don’t expect immediate results. If you feel better with a timeline, ask the medical professionals you are working with about when you might expect to see improvement in your condition.

, While many hyperacusis patients report that retraining and CBT significantly improved their condition, experts warn that there is a potential for relapse when exposed to new noises or different noise levels. Talk with your medical team and therapists about the potential for relapses and how best to cope with them.

, Coping with hyperacusis is challenging, but many people are working to research this condition and develop more effective treatment options.

Have an ultrasound done if necessary.In the majority of cases, the doctor will be able to diagnose a hernia through a simple physical exam.,
Discuss your options with your doctor.,
Learn what happens during an open hernia surgery.The vast majority of hernia surgeries are open surgeries.,
Consider getting laparoscopic surgery.Only about 10% of all hernia surgeries are done laparoscopically.,
Discuss which surgery is best for you with your doctor.Open surgeries are more common, and surgeons may be more comfortable with them.,
Prepare for your surgery.Make sure the doctors have an updated list of all drugs (both prescription and over-the-counter) and supplements you're taking.,
Stay in the hospital for monitoring, if necessary.If you had a complicated hernia or surgery, the hospital may want to keep you behind for a few days after surgery.,
Rest and care for yourself during the recovery period.It will likely take about four to six weeks to recover from an open hernia surgery.,
Take a light walk the day of your surgery.Although you’ve just had surgery, it's important to get up and moving as soon as you feel ready.,
Limit intense physical exertion during the recovery period.,
Ease back into a normal diet.There are technically no restrictions on diet after hernia surgery.However, some patients feel nauseous for a few days after surgery.,
Care for your surgical incisions.In both types of surgery, your incision will be covered in surgical dressing or steri-strips.,
Keep a post-operative appointment with the surgeon.,
Take stool softeners.During the procedure, the surgeon uses an anesthetic that paralyzes the bowel.,
Contact the doctor if you observe signs of complication.",How to Cure a Hernia," Though hernias can also occur after surgery, inguinal hernias are by far the most common type of hernia. This is the hernia in which a weak point in the abdominal muscles allows internal organs to bulge out of the abdominal cavity. Although anyone can get a hernia, there are certain at-risk groups that are more likely.


Men are nine times more likely to get a hernia than women.Men between the ages of 40 and 59 are particularly at risk of hernia.
People who regularly do heavy lifting, like weightlifters and manual laborers are also at increased risk.;
, Although women are at a lower risk of hernia, you should still know the categories of women who most often get them:


Taller women
Women with chronic cough
Pregnant or obese women who may get an umbilical hernia""Femoral hernias"" tend to cause bowel blockage in women.

, Surprisingly, obese and overweight men are not at risk of inguinal hernia. This may be due to a sedentary lifestyle that avoids heavy lifting. Tobacco and alcohol use also have no effect on inguinal hernias., Activities that can worsen the bulge include constipation, lifting heavy objects, manual labor, or coughing and sneezing. This bulge is actually the organs in your abdomen poking out through weakened muscle tissue. Usually, you can manually push them back into the abdomen by applying pressure. Trouble starts when you can no longer “reduce” the hernia or push it back behind the abdominal muscles. Other symptoms of hernia include:


Pain that can be described as pulling, tugging, or burning. It can feel worse after physical activity.
Pain relief when lying on your back, when organs are restored to their rightful place.
Possible gurgling sound when bowels are in the hernia.
Rigid bulge: If you can't push the hernia back in, the bowels may have become trapped, or ""incarcerated."" Incarcerated hernias require emergency medical care.

, He'll have you lay back to see if the bulge recedes on its own when you lay down. He may manipulate the bulge manually to see if the hernia can be pushed back behind the abdominal wall. If the intestine is present in the hernia, the doctor will be able to hear gurgling with a stethoscope.

, He will press a gloved finger up through the loose scrotal sac. Then, he'll ask you to cough or bear down like you're making a bowel movement. If you have a hernia, he will feel it hitting his finger firmly. The doctor will check both sides of the scrotum to be confident in the diagnosis.

, In some cases, though, the hernia may be difficult to diagnose. If he's not confident in his diagnosis, the doctor may order an ultrasound that will visually confirm the hernia. The procedure is relatively cheap and non-invasive.

, If you have a small, asymptomatic hernia, the doctor may just send you home with instructions on how to monitor the hernia's status.In most cases, the hernias resolve on their own without surgery. If you observe worsening symptoms, you may need to get surgery. Surgery is recommended for patients with large hernias that present with multiple symptoms. People who have recurrent hernias after an initial surgical repair also need surgery. Pregnant women and women who've previously given birth are at higher risk for recurrent hernias.


Incarcerated hernias are a surgical emergency and need immediate attention. When this happens, the bowel gets blocked and strangulated, cutting off blood flow.

, During this procedure, the surgeon will first separate the hernia from its surrounding tissues. Then, he will remove the hernia sac or push the intestines back into your abdominal cavity. The weakened abdominal muscles are closed with strong stitches.


Because this surgery opens the abdominal muscles, some people experience further muscle weakness and hernia after surgery. To prevent this, surgeons often sew a piece of mesh into the abdominal wall. This helps strengthen the wall and prevent a recurrence.

, Instead of making a large cut to your abdominal muscles, potentially weakening them further, the surgeon makes three to four smaller cuts. He uses a laparoscope — a tiny camera mounted on a long, thin tube — to see inside the body instead of opening the patient up. The laparoscope and surgical tools are inserted through the small incisions, but otherwise, the surgery is the same as open surgery.

, They also provide a clearer view of the tissue being manipulated. This is why they’re recommended for large or complicated hernias. However, a laparoscopic surgery heals faster with less scarring, and causes less pain.

, On the night before the surgery, you must fast after midnight. This includes both food and liquids. Ask the doctor if you will be released from the hospital on the same day as the surgery. Make sure you have a ride home from the hospital if you will.

, Specifically, they will monitor your diet to make sure you ease back into normal amounts of food. In some cases, an abrupt return to a normal diet can cause intestinal paralysis.

, Laparoscopic surgeries have a much shorter recovery time of one to two weeks. Your medical team will give you detailed instructions on when you can resume normal activities. Until then, rest so you don’t further weaken the fresh cuts in your abdominal muscles.

, This jumpstarts the recovery process, but more importantly, it prevents blood clots.

, Both types of surgery will allow you to return to normal activities after two to three days. But you should not engage in any strenuous activity or lift anything over 20 pounds for one to two weeks.After open hernia surgery, you should avoid strenuous activity of lifting anything over five to ten pounds for three weeks.In both cases, defer to the judgment of your doctor when deciding when you can resume heavy lifting.

, In that case, begin with a liquid diet of water, juices, smoothies, and broths/soups. Transition to soft foods like bananas or mashed potatoes, and work your way back to a normal diet. Also start with smaller meals and work your way back up to normal sized meals.

, If they're covered with gauze or Band-Aids, refresh them as needed. If the surgeon used steri-strips, leave them to fall off on their own.


Keep the incisions dry for 24–48 hours after surgery. Cover them in something like a ""press 'n seal"" kitchen product to keep them dry in the shower.
After 48 hours, expose the incisions to running shower water, and pat dry gently. Then reapply fresh dressing.
Do not allow the incisions to soak (bathtub, pool, ocean) for 10–14 days after laparoscopic surgery or four to six weeks after open hernia surgery., Even if you are feeling well and appear to have no complications, it is important to make — and attend — a post-operative appointment with your doctor. This helps ensure that things are progressing well and minimizes risk for post-operative complications.

, As a result, you may be constipated for about a week after the surgery. The last thing you want to do after hernia surgery is strain during bowel movements and possibly do more damage. To prevent this, use an over-the-counter stool softener like milk of magnesia or Metamucil.


If you don't want to use stool softeners, the best thing you can do is stay hydrated. Drink at least eight to ten 8 oz. glasses of water per day.
Drink prune juice and apple juice to naturally soften stool.

, Though hernia surgeries are very common, all surgeries come with a risk of complication. Contact your doctor if you have a fever over 101.5 °F (38.6 °C), pain or swelling in your calf, or have trouble breathing. Increased drainage from an incision and altered skin color should also be reported. But you should get to an emergency room immediately if you observe any of the following:


Excessive bleeding from an incision
Vomiting
Change in mental status (fuzziness, wooziness, loss of consciousness)
Inability to breath

Symptoms of epilepsy can be dangerous and seeing your doctor may help you minimize them. In addition, seizures themselves can be dangerous and need to be controlled with medications. Treatment may also help you more effectively cope with the disorder.Your doctor may order blood tests to determine if infections, genetic conditions, or other underlying conditions are causing your epilepsy.Sometimes seizures are a sign of an underlying problem in the brain, like a tumor, and therefore need to be evaluated by a doctor.
Your doctor may conduct a neurological examination that tests behavior, motor skills, and mental function.Your doctor may also order imagining tests such as electroencephalogram, computerized tomography (CT) scans, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), or single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT). These can help your doctor examine your brain in greater detail.Make sure to find a doctor who you like and with whom you feel comfortable. She can help you more effectively and comfortably deal with your epilepsy.;
, In many cases, you may always have epilepsy and even as much as you can control it, it will remain a part of your life. Learning to embrace the place of the disorder in your life can help you cope with it more effectively.Although having epilepsy may feel overwhelming at times, you can still still live a full, active, and rewarding life.Consider giving yourself daily positive affirmations to help yourself cope with epilepsy. You might want to say something like “I am strong and can handle this.” This may boost your confidence and also help you more readily accept your epilepsy.Part of embracing your disorder is learning to not constantly worry about having a seizure. You’ve likely taken all of the steps to help control seizures and avoiding constant worrying may help control how often you have them., As much as it is possible, stay as independent as you can. This can help you cope with the disorder and not feel like you’re beholden to others.Keep working if you can. If not, consider doing other activities that can keep you busy and engaged with others.If you are unable to drive, take public transportation. You might even consider moving to a more urban area with better infrastructure to help you maintain your independence.Schedule social activities as often as you want or are able. This can help you stay engaged with others and may even help you momentarily forget your disorder., The old truism that knowledge is power can be an important way for you to cope with your epilepsy. Educating yourself as well as family members and friends about the disorder may help everyone understand what you’re going through, provide you the support you need, and more effectively cope with it.You can use online resources to teach you and your loved ones more about epilepsy and give you ideas on how best to cope with the disorder. For example, the Epilepsy Foundation offers several courses and resources on epilepsy and the ways in which to best cope with self-esteem issues related to it.There are online forums from the Epilepsy Foundation and Mayo Clinic that offer educational tools and programs to inform anyone with whom you are in contact about epilepsy. Many of these are specific to groups such as children, the elderly, transportation, and bereavement., Talking with people about your epilepsy can be an important part of dealing with the disorder. Being open about your epilepsy may minimize the risk of uncomfortable situations, questions, or looks. This in turn may put you further at ease.Being open about your epilepsy is an excellent method of coping rather than getting discouraged about it. If other people realize that you're okay with your disorder, then they will likely be, too., Most people are socialized, but there are still lingering social stigmas attached to epilepsy. These stigmas, which often arise because of lack of information, may evoke feelings of shame, stress, anxiety, or depression in you. Learning to ignore social stigmas and negative reactions can help you to move forward and have an full and active life.Epileptics often feel shame and embarrassment when they have seizures in public. However, unless you avoid going out altogether, you may likely have a seizure in public. Not worrying about how other people may react and ignoring any negative reactions can help you more readily cope with the disorder.You may even find that people are genuinely helpful, concerned and eager to learn more about your condition.At the root of worrying about what people think is that you attach yourself to an outcome you can’t control. Repeating the mantra “what other people think about me is none of my business” may help you gradually disconnect from social stigmas.Rechanneling the negative energy may also help. Simply take a deep breath, repeat your manta and think of something positive, like doing an activity you love.Practice self-love and self-acceptance. For example, tell yourself “I may have epilepsy, but it doesn’t have me. I can go out and walk and laugh with others.”Seeing a counselor, doctor, or even talking to a close friend can also help you work through your feelings., Joining a support group for epileptics can offer you unconditional support from other people who can truly understand what you’re experiencing. A support group may also help you more effectively cope with various aspects of the disorder.Fellow epileptics may help boost your confidence and accept your disorder.There are support groups for different groups who suffer from epilepsy. This includes the elderly in children.For example, the Epilepsy Foundation offers overnight camps for children suffering from epilepsy.The Epilepsy Foundation offers various resources to find affiliate support groups at http://www.epilepsy.com/affiliates. You can also call their national office twenty-four hours a day, seven days at a week at 1-800-332-1000., Not taking your medication as instructed by your doctor can cause you to have more seizures or even endanger you.Speak to your doctor if you are experiencing any issues with your medication.Don’t adjust your medication dose or skip it until you speak to your doctor.If you have any questions or concerns about side effects or how you’re feeling, speak to your doctor as soon as possible.In some cases, a pharmacist may be able to answer any questions or address concerns you may have.

, You may want to wear a bracelet that alerts emergency medical personnel or even good Samaritans about your condition. This can help others know how to treat you correctly if you have a seizure.You can get medic alert bracelets from many pharmacies, medical supply stores, and even some online retailers.

, Stress may exacerbate epilepsy and promote feelings of anxiety and depression you have. Stay away from stressful situations as much as you are able and this can help relax you and may minimize your epileptic episodes.Organizing your day with a flexible schedule that incorporates time to relax can reduce your stress.Avoid stressful situations if possible. If you cannot, take deep breaths and don’t react, which may exacerbate anxiety and your symptoms of epilepsy., A lack of sleep or fatigue can trigger seizures. Getting 7-9 hours of sleep every night and taking naps when needed may help minimize the number of seizures you have.Not getting enough sleep can also cause tension and stress and pain.Short naps of 20-30 minutes help you to stay fresh and alleviate fatigue.Get up and go to bed at the same time every day to establish a pattern for your body., Getting regular exercise can keep you healthy and minimize symptoms of depression associate with epilepsy. Do some kind of sport daily, which may minimize your seizures.Try and get at least 30 minutes of exercise every day.Exercise releases chemicals called endorphins. These may improve your mood and help you sleep., Eating unhealthy foods may increase stress and anxiety and make your seizures worse. Consuming healthy foods can improve your health and may help you manage your epilepsy more effectively.Eat healthy, balanced, and regular meals.
Consume between 1,800-2,200 calories per day, depending on your activity level. Eat nutrient-dense whole grains, fruits and vegetables, dairy, and lean proteins.In addition, certain foods contain nutrients that can enhance your mood and may also relieve stress. These include asparagus, avocados, and beans.It’s also important to your health to stay hydrated. Women should drink at least 9 cups of water a day. Men should have at least 13 cups. You may need up to 16 cups of water a day if you are very active or pregnant., Reduce your caffeine and alcohol intake consumption and quit or limit tobacco use. These substances not only can increase stress and anxiety, but may make your seizures more frequent or worse.Most people can ingest 400mg of caffeine daily. This is the equivalent of about four cups of coffee or ten cans of soda.Women should drink no more than 2-3 units of alcohol a day and men no more than 3-4.A bottle of wine, for example, has 9-10 units of alcohol."

, If you take multiple medications, keep a pill organizer at your desk, in your briefcase, or in your car. This can help you stay organized and remember to take your pills throughout the day.Be sure to include an over-the-counter or prescribed pain medication to take if you have uncomfortable flare-ups.
Keep your medications in a safe location that others cannot access, especially if you work with children.

, Smoking, sun exposure, and stress are common triggers at work that can cause psoriasis flare-ups.Adjust your habits to protect yourself from triggers:


Quit smoking, and stay away from second-hand smoke. If your co-workers are smoking, excuse yourself for some fresh air.
Cover sun-exposed areas with pants and long-sleeved shirts made of light, breathable material. Wear a wide-brimmed hat to protect your face from the sun. Always wear sunscreen when outdoors.
Reduce your stress at work by doing short meditations at your desk. If you work outside, take five minutes out of every few hours to do gentle stretches and deep breathing. If you work in a high-stress environment, practice mindfulness or see a counselor to learn stress management skills.

, Make time to sit down with your supervisor to discuss how psoriasis affects your work. Explain that you may need to schedule doctor’s appointments during work hours, and that you may struggle with pain and discomfort. Be honest and specific, and tell them you want to problem-solve together., First, educate yourself as much as possible about the illness. Ask your doctor any questions you have. Then educate your coworkers. Often, helping people understand your struggle makes them more sympathetic.They may also be glad to know that the disease is not contagious.


If you don’t feel comfortable speaking with your coworkers directly, approach your manager or supervisor for help. Say something like, “I’d like my coworkers to be aware of and educated about my psoriasis. Could you help me come up with a plan?”

Consider a medical cause.,
Rule out health problems initially.,
Check your medications.,
Obtain a diagnosis.,
Ask your doctor about Chronic Fatigue Symptom.",How to Combat Fatigue1," Fatigue itself can be a symptom of a number of medical conditions.While fatigue as a symptom is not particularly serious, it can indicate a serious health problem. If you experience serious, long-term fatigue, see your doctor. Some conditions that may cause you to feel fatigued include:


Diabetes.
Heart, liver, or kidney disease.Anemia or sleep apnea.
Obesity.
Thyroid disease.
Autoimmune diseases or fibromyalgia.;
, If you have one of the listed medical conditions—or suspect that you might—and treat fatigue as the root problem, you will be curing the symptom instead of the disease. See your doctor to rule out health problems as a possible cause for your fatigue.


If you have a medically induced fatigue, getting more sleep or changing your diet are unlikely to provide long-term help.

, Some medications can also cause you to feel fatigued, so it is a good idea to check the side effects of any medications you are taking. You should also talk to your doctor about any side-effects you are having from a medication, including fatigue.Over-the-counter medications can cause fatigue as well, such as antihistamines and cough medicines., Once you are in communication with your doctor about your fatigue, it can still be difficult to arrive at a correct diagnoses. Fatigue can be a result of medical, psychological, or physiological causes, and it can often be a time-intensive process to diagnose a medical cause. Work closely with your doctor to speed up the diagnostic process., Any individual who has suffered from fatigue for over 6 months is likely to be diagnosed as suffering from Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS).CFS is often accompanied by other symptoms, such as muscular or joint pains, poor concentration, and poor sleep patterns.Treatment of CFS focuses on managing the problematic symptoms, and improving the patient’s sleep and diet.
Statistically, certain groups of individuals have a higher probability of being diagnosed with fatigue. These include:
Women.
People who live in poverty.
People who suffer from physical or mental illness.

Avoid excessive consumption of caffeine throughout the day.,
Lower your thermostat so your sleeping room is cooler than normal.,
Put down the computer, phone, and tablet at night.,
Assess your daily schedule.,
Reduce stress in your life.",How to Combat Fatigue2," Avoid caffeine at night, too. Although many adults use (or overuse) caffeine to give them energy throughout the day, excessive consumption can be unhealthy and actually worsen your fatigue.


A small amount of caffeine in the morning can give you a burst of energy, but when caffeine is consumed at night you will find it difficult to fall asleep, making you more tired in the morning.
To give your body time to feel tired naturally, avoid consuming any caffeine after noon., You should feel comfortable wrapped in a blanket. Your body temperature will drop at night, and it is important that you avoid becoming uncomfortable and waking up during sleep.


If your bedroom’s nighttime temperature is high, you will wake up more often and sleep poorly in general.

, Avoid using any of these devices after 8 pm—you should also limit the amount of TV that you watch at night. The light from these devices prevents you from feeling naturally tired, by suppressing the amount of melatonin (a natural sleep hormone) that your body produces.If you are in the habit of spending time on your phone or computer or tablet at night, try reading a book instead.

, If you are not regularly sleeping for at least 8 hours per night, try to decrease your commitments or alter your schedule so that you are not staying up as late or getting up as early.If possible, reduce your hours spent at work or time on your commute, recruit family members to help with household chores, and assign yourself a bedtime.

, Even if you are getting plenty of sleep each night, a stressful lifestyle can increase fatigue and mental exhaustion. By reducing stress, you’ll give yourself time to relax mentally. Try taking up yoga or meditation as a way to help calm emotional stress.


Exercise and spend time with your friends and family. Try not to dwell on issues where outcomes are beyond your control, especially if they frequently keep you up at night.

Improve your daily diet.,
Eat foods that are high in protein.,
Hydrate yourself with water, fruit, and vegetables.,
Spend time with friends.,
Celebrate your own accomplishments.",How to Combat Fatigue3," Although caffeine and sugars will give you immediate bursts of energy, they will lower your levels of energy overall—even later in the same day. Focus on eating healthy, balanced meals.


Eat small, frequent meals and snacks to prevent fatigue caused by hunger and to stabilize blood sugar levels. As a general rule, eat a small meal every 3 or 4 hours; this will keep your metabolism working throughout the day., More than any other food group, proteins give your body energy.Without sufficient protein energy every day, your body will become fatigued more quickly. Avoid foods that are fatty or sugary, such as cookies and chips. Also reduce the amount of simple carbohydrates, such as white pasta and rice, you consume. Look for proteins like:


Meat—including chicken, steak, and pork.
Beans and rice.
Eggs and dairy (milk, cheese, yogurt, etc.).

, Although drinking plenty of water is the best means to keep yourself hydrated, fruits and vegetables are also high in water content and will hydrate your body as well. Eat plenty of water-rich foods, like:


Watermelon and citrus fruits (oranges, lemons, etc.)
Broccoli and carrots.
Adequate hydration keeps your blood thin and able to be pumped more efficiently through the body, reducing fatigue., If you’re feeling fatigued by your level of busyness at work or by seemingly overwhelming responsibilities in general, take some time away—even just an evening—to spend with friends who make you happy.


Even a phone call can help; call a close friend and let them know how you’re feeling. Then talk about something to take your mind off your fatigue.Skip working one evening or weekend; instead, take a camping trip or a “staycation” with a group of friends.

, Part of fatigue can stem from feeling overwhelmed, or feeling like you have an impossible amount of work to accomplish. You’ll feel less fatigued if, instead of dwelling on your responsibilities and failures, you focus on your personal and professional accomplishments.


Make a list: write down everything you’ve accomplished in the last month. Seeing you accomplishments physically written down will help you feel more energized and successful."

Splash water on your face or take a cool shower.,
Get up and move around.,
Take a short nap.,
Take a break from technology.,
Listen to some energizing music.,
Get some sleep as soon as possible.",How to Combat Fatigue4," Although this will not keep you energized for a long period of time, the shock of cold water over your face and body will decrease your fatigue immediately., Especially if you are at work or school, it can be very easy to feel fatigued after hours of sitting still. Get up, stretch, and move around—this will increase your heart rate and help you feel more awake. If you have time, exercise—a quick trip to the gym or a 20-minute run will increase your energy levels, even if you initially feel too fatigued to work out.Also focus on breathing more deeply; increased oxygen will further reduce your fatigue.

, A brief nap, even as little as 20 minutes, can give you a burst of energy. Although you cannot always repeat this activity multiple times during a day (three 20-minute naps will not make you three times as awake as a single nap), it’s a useful strategy if you know you need to be fully awake and functional at a certain time of day.


If you are fatigued but not tired, resting can still help you feel better. Lay down and close your eyes; even if you stay awake, you’ll feel better.

, Especially during workdays, spending all of your time in front of a screen can feel exhausting.Find time to get away from your technology; this could be during a long outdoor lunch break, or an hour spent away from technology after you get home.


Multitasking—which most of us have to do during the work day—can actually decrease your productivity and leave you feeling fatigued. When you do need to work on a computer or tablet, focus on one task at a time., Although this is not a long-term solution, music can decrease the tension in your body, take your mind off of your fatigue, and increase your energy levels.If you’re already listening to music, switch the artist or genre.

, Don’t count on short-term remedies to permanently boost your energy; at best, they’ll help wake you up for 20 minutes or so.


Especially if you are driving or operating machinery, do not attempt to keep yourself awake if you feel fatigued or exhausted.
Short term remedies to help yourself feel more awake are less effective than long-term changes to your sleep schedule, which will leave you with more lasting daily energy.

Ask questions, seek out opinions, and become as knowledgeable as you can about your condition. Coping is very hard to do alone, but it does begin with you.Having an undiagnosed rare illness can be particularly stressful. Co-workers, friends, and even medical professionals may be skeptical or unsupportive if your illness is not made “real” through diagnosis.If you are dealing with an undiagnosed illness, never doubt its reality and never stop seeking answers. Seek out organizations that deal with undiagnosed illnesses for information, advice, and support.
If and when your illness is diagnosed, don’t be afraid to seek a second or third opinion. Rare illnesses are easy to miss and easy to misidentify. Being thorough is not the same as being in denial, and does not interfere with coping.;
, You can make the argument that the internet has been a literal lifesaver for many people facing rare illnesses, by providing them with information, treatment advice, community support, and hope. People with rare illnesses often become “power users” of the internet, developing expertise in finding and evaluating information, and networking with others facing the same challenges.As with everything else on the internet, you need to use your best judgment in determining what information and communities are legitimate and trustworthy. You may want to start your search by utilizing the links and contacts provided by established organizations like the National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD).Prioritize online information about your rare illness that comes from medical or academic journals, government agencies, and recognized healthcare organizations. Steer clear of unsubstantiated claims and websites that are trying to sell you something.

, While the internet makes it much easier to find and connect with rare illness communities, you may also be able to find support groups in your area as well. Whenever possible, seek out support groups (online or physical) comprised of people facing the same rare disorder as you. You’ll probably be surprised how many other people are out there.


You’ll probably find out quickly that “rare” does not mean you are all alone. Just because you do not know anyone else with your illness does not mean there are not thousands of other people going through the same thing as you. In the U.S., a “rare illness” is generally defined as one that affects fewer than 200,000 people in the country. In total, some 30 million Americans live with at least one rare illness.Rare illnesses are prevalent enough that the rarest day on the calendar — February 29th, or “leap day” — has been unofficially declared “Rare Disease Day.” The goal of the event is to raise awareness and funds. Of course, you don’t have to (and shouldn’t) wait for one day every four years to seek out information and provide support for rare illnesses., The initial bewilderment at an undiagnosed illness or the shock of a rare disease diagnosis can unleash a flood of emotions and a wide range of responses. As time passes, you will need to develop coping strategies that work for you, and adjust and revise them as your needs and circumstances change.Coping with a rare illness or anything else is not a start-to-finish task. You never “finish” coping, you get better at doing it. Prepare for plenty of ups-and-downs when it comes to dealing with something as stressful as a rare illness.
In fact, effective stress reduction techniques like meditation, visualization, yoga, aromatherapy, or just exercising, listening to music, or tidying up a bit can help with coping.
Journaling is another effective way to cope with your anxieties and fears. Writing helps you to identify, analyze, and let go of emotional “baggage” that may be weighing you down., You’re going to have good days and bad days in dealing with your rare illness. On the bad days, whether the causes are physical or emotional, lean on family, friends, support groups, professional counselors, and other people you trust to help see you through and continue the coping process.


When you need help, ask for it. When you need someone to talk to, find a good listener — someone who is willing to simply be there for you.NORD also offers a substantial list of links to helpful resources, many of which address getting assistance in coping with a rare illness., Knowledge is power when dealing with a rare illness. You need to be able to trust in the experience and skills of your medical team, but at the same time become an informed advocate for your own care. Legitimate, medically-sound internet resources are a good starting point for learning as much as possible about your rare illness.The old saying “the squeaky wheel gets the grease” is appropriate when dealing with rare illnesses. Become a champion for raising awareness and funds — both charitable and research-oriented — for the cause. Being actively involved in improving the lives of those facing your condition can provide you with a sense of ownership and power over your rare illness.

, The clinical trials website run by the U.S. National Institutes of Health provides information on over 200,000 current studies, so a little research may turn up trials that are relevant to your rare illness. Search the databases, identify possible trials, and see if you may be eligible to participate.Never stop seeking new treatment options for your rare illness. This doesn’t mean you have to sign up for every trial and try every new medication — just make sure you arm yourself with the most up-to-date resources so you can make informed decisions about how to manage your disease.

, Depending upon the nature of your rare disorder, you may be concerned about the possibility of loved ones — and especially children you have or may someday have — contracting the illness as well. Genetic counseling can offer you realistic assessments of such likelihoods so that you can make informed life decisions.If you are dealing with the question of whether to have children due to the risk of passing on a severe and/or rare disorder, empower yourself with as much information as possible. While it’s a decision that needs to be made with your heart as much as your head, use the information you can derive from genetic counseling to influence both of these decision-making zones.

, Dealing with a rare illness can be an expensive proposition, even if you have health insurance. Some insurers may be hesitant to offer adequate financial support for rare conditions, but that doesn’t mean you are out of options. Once again, it is up to you to be your own fiercest advocate.


If you are being denied adequate coverage, contact officials within the insurance company as well as (in the U.S.) your state insurance commissioner. NORD even offers a form letter you can personalize and use.Organizations like NORD may also offer or be able to direct you to patient assistance programs that can help you with your financial difficulties when facing a rare illness., If you have a child or other loved one dealing with an undiagnosed or diagnosed rare illness, you will be deeply affected by it as well. You might experience shock, denial, and other common stages of grief, and will almost certainly be facing a great deal of stress. You will need to learn to cope in your own way, as does the person with the actual illness.Many of the same coping mechanisms that may help the person with the disease might also be useful for you. Educate yourself about the illness, find support groups, advocate for increased awareness and financing, and take other such steps that enable you to accept the reality of the situation while rejecting that you are powerless to do anything about it.

, People caring for sick loved ones are frequently over-stressed, sleep-deprived, lacking in regular exercise, and tempted to seek temporary relief in unhealthy choices like junk food, tobacco, and excessive alcohol consumption. Remember that if your own health falters, however, you will be unable to provide the level of care and support you want to give to the person facing the rare illness.You simply have to set aside some time for yourself to sleep, exercise, eat healthy, engage in stress-reduction activities, and do things that make you happy. This is not selfishness or wasted time; it is a necessary component of coping with a challenging situation and of providing the best care you can.
You can step away from the illness briefly, even if the person suffering from it cannot. Don’t feel guilty; instead, use it as an opportunity to recharge and get back into the fight with renewed energy and purpose.

, Some people, due perhaps to age or the severity of the condition, simply cannot be their own informed advocate when it comes to rare illnesses. When this is the case, you can step up and be a champion for your loved one.Consider becoming an advocate for other people facing rare illnesses who may not have loved ones who can speak up for them. Make use of the expertise and experience you’ve acquired. If you’re looking for a way to cope with a rare illness, getting involved in a manner that may potentially benefit thousands of other people is certainly a worthwhile method to try.

Check for hernias that occur around the stomach, abdomen, or chest.,
Know the types of hernias that affect the groin area.,
Understand the other types of hernias.",How to Check for a Hernia1," A hernia can affect different areas of your body in different ways, although a hernia in or around the stomach area may be the most common type of hernia. These hernias include:



Hiatal hernia affects the upper part of your stomach. The hiatus is an opening in the diaphragm that separates the chest area from the abdomen.There are two types of hiatal hernia: sliding or paraesophageal. Hiatal hernias occur more often in women than in men.

Epigastric hernia occurs when small layers of fat push through the belly wall between your breast bone and your navel.You can have more than one of these at a time. Although epigastric hernias often present no symptoms, it may need to be treated with surgery.

Incisional hernia happens when improper care after abdominal surgery results in bulging through the surgical scar.Often, mesh lining is incorrectly installed and the intestines slip out of the mesh, causing a hernia.

Umbilical hernia are especially common among infants. When the baby cries, a lump around the belly button area usually protrudes.;
, Hernias can also affect the groin, pelvis, or thighs when the intestines break out of their lining, causing uncomfortable and sometimes painful lumps in these areas.



Inguinal hernia affects your groin area, and happens when a portion of the small intestine breaks through the abdominal lining.Surgery is sometimes necessary for inguinal hernias, as complications can cause life-threatening situations.

Femoral hernia affects the upper thigh, right below the groin. Although it may present no pain, it looks like a bulge in your upper thigh.Like hiatal hernias, femoral hernias are more common in women than in men.

Anal hernia happens when tissues protrude around the anal membrane. Anal hernias are rare. They are often confused with hemorrhoids.

, Hernias can affect areas other than the stomach and groin region. In particular, the following hernias may present medical problems for individuals:



Herniated disks happens when a disk in your spinal column pops out and begins to pinch a nerve.The disks around the spinal column are shock absorbers, but can be dislodged either by injury or disease, resulting in a herniated disk.

Intracranial hernias occur inside the head. They happen when brain tissue, fluid, and blood vessels are moved away from their usual position in the skull.Especially if hernias inside the skull take place near the brain stem region, they need to be dealt with immediately.

"
"
Investigate possible symptoms or signs of a hernia.,
Check with a doctor to confirm a hernia.,
Know what puts people at an increased risk for hernias.",How to Check for a Hernia2," Hernias may be caused by a host of different factors. Once they are caused, they may or may not present pain. Look for these symptoms, especially for hernias located in the abdominal or groin region:
You see swelling where the pain is located. The swelling is usually on the surface of the areas such as the thigh, abdomen or groin.






The swelling may or may not hurt; bulging, but painless, hernias are common.






Bulges that flatten when you press down on them need prompt medical attention; bulges that do not flatten out when pressed down on need immediate medical attention.You may notice pain that ranges from severe to mild discomfort. A common symptom of hernias is pain present when straining. If you experience pain during the following activities, you may have a hernia:





Lift heavy objects






Cough or sneeze






Exercise or exert yourself






Your pain gets worse near the end of the day. Hernia pain is often worse at the end of the day, or after long periods of standing.

, Some hernias are what doctors called ""trapped"" or ""strangulated,"" meaning that the organ in question loses blood supply or blocks intestinal flow.These hernias require immediate medical attention.


Set up an appointment and meet with a doctor. Make sure to tell the doctor about all your symptoms.
Undergo a physical examination. The doctor checks to see if the area increases in size when you're lifting, bending or coughing.

, Why do hernias affect more than 5 million Americans?Hernias can happen for many reasons. Here are just a few of the factors that put people at an increased risk for hernias:
Genetic predisposition: If any of your parents had hernias, you are more likely to develop one.






Age: The older you get, the higher your chance of getting a hernia.






Pregnancy: While pregnant, the mother's stomach stretches out, making a hernia more likely.






Sudden weight loss: People who suddenly lose weight are at increased risk of developing a hernia.






Obesity: People who are overweight have higher chances of developing hernias compared to people who are not.






Whooping cough: Coughing puts a lot of pressure and stress on the abdomen, leading to a possible hernia.

Convey an appropriate message about your child’s allergies.,
Provide help at all times.,
Give your child verbal support.,
Be patient and understanding.,
Support a “worry” journal.",How to Help Your Child Cope with Allergies1," When a doctor diagnoses your child with allergies, it may take some adjustment to get used to changes in their routine. Your child may not take the changes seriously enough or could become overly worried about staying safe. Providing a consistent message appropriate to your child’s development can keep them safe while making them comfortable with their allergies.Remain calm and matter-of-fact when discussing your child’s allergies with them. Keep the focus on consistent safety routines so that your child understands that the allergies may be serious, but are manageable.
For example, “Hey Sam, I got this new product I’d like to try tonight for dinner. Could you please do me a huge favor and make sure it doesn’t have any peanuts in it? That way, all of us can enjoy this delicious curry.”
Another example would be, “Hey Molly, can you please remember to tell Mrs. Grasser that you are allergic to Meg’s dog and aren’t being mean if you avoid it? You can give her your medication so that you don’t forget to take it while you’re having fun at your sleepover with Meg.”;
, Take time to reinforce your understanding and willingness to help your child cope with allergies. Make sure they know their family and friends will love and support them unconditionally. Let your child know that you are always there to talk and help however you can.Repeat your willingness to help and support often. This consistency can help your child better handle allergies and any possible situations they may present. For example, say, “I know how it upsets you to have to stay indoors when the pollen is high, Leia. We love you very much and will support you in any way we can. Even if you just want to cry, your dad and I are always here for you.”
Another example would be: “Hey Luke, the pollen is high today and it may make your allergies worse. What if I take you and a friend or two to the movies. I’ll get you popcorn and some snacks.”, Praise your child for trying to navigate their allergies. This can help your child see not only that the allergy is manageable, but also that feeling good is more important than potential consequences of exposing themselves to allergens.


For example, “I know how good that birthday cake looked, Annie. I’m really proud of you for celebrating your sister’s birthday and being a champ when you ate your special cake. You do such an awesome job at staying away from flour!”

, Allergies can cause a child stress, especially around their peers. Any signs of impatience from others may make this worse. Reminding yourself that your child needs help managing their allergies can help you stay patient and understanding.Inhale deeply if you feel like you’re going to scold or give negative feedback to your child about dealing with their allergies. This can relax you and your child and make managing allergies easier.

, If your child has anxiety or fear with their allergies, consider providing a diary or journal to express those emotions. Assure your child you’ll only read it if they want you to and that you’re always happy to talk about any worries they may have. This can help relieve any anxiety or show them ways they positively and safely handled their allergies."
"
Set a good example.,
Follow allergy routines consistently.,
Help your child recognize allergy symptoms.,
Develop a plan to manage symptoms or attacks.,
Plan ahead with your child.",How to Help Your Child Cope with Allergies2," Whether or not you realize it, your child listens to and watches what you do. One of the most effective ways to help your child cope with allergies is to set a good example with your actions and behavior. This can help your child manage their own allergy management and better cope with having allergies.Take time to reinforce your messages through daily activities. For example, “Gabriel, I just got a notification on my phone that I need to take my allergy medication. Did you check your phone for one, too? I’ll get your meds from upstairs when I get mine and then it’s out of the way for both of us.” You can also say, “I’m going to check this curry sauce for peanuts,” or, “Can you check my bag to make sure I packed the EpiPen?”
Remember to remain confident when describing your child’s allergies in front of them. This shows your child that they can manage their allergies. Instead of, “Alex could die from peanuts,” say, “Alex is so great at asking people if dishes contain nuts and making a decision if it’s ok for him to eat new foods.”, Many children with allergies have rules they need to follow about behaviors such as eating or petting animals. Following these rules in your home can help your child continue this behavior when they are at school or another place. Some routines to follow so your child can continue them include:Reading labels
Checking ingredients
Asking questions about food or beverage ingredients
Taking allergy medication
Carrying an EpiPen at all times

, Most children enjoy spending time with friends. As a result, your child won’t always be in your presence for you to see symptoms of an oncoming allergy attack. Teaching your child to recognize the symptoms of an allergy can help them better cope and handle any potential attacks.Let your child know what typical responses to an allergen are. These may include sneezing, wheezing, vomiting, itchy eyes, and dizziness.
Tell your child what symptoms they have with their allergies. You should also let your child know that other symptoms may appear. For example, “When you go out today, Sara, pay attention when you eat the pizza. It’s gluten-free, but may come in contact with flour. If you get a stomachache or want to go to the bathroom, it may be your allergies. You might even feel a little dizzy. It’s ok to just stop eating and talk to Tegan’s mom about it. She’ll have a little something else for you if your allergy bothers you.”

, Preparation is an important part of helping your child handle and cope with allergies. Teach your child to deal with a possible allergy attack by having a plan that you consistently review. This can help your child remain calm and minimize the risk of a serious problem.Work out a plan together with your child. This helps them also feel in control of what’s happening. For example, “Max, let’s work on your plan for an allergy attack together. If you start wheezing from the grass, do you want to let Mr. Bisbee know you’re feeling sick?”; or, “Sam, which friends would you like to tell about your Epipen in case you’re stung by a bee and can’t inject yourself? Your friends can stay with you and make sure you get the injection if you can’t do it yourself. One of them can also let an adult know to call an ambulance.”
Assure your child that they can carry out the plan even if you’re not there. This will give them the confidence to successfully cope with any situation that may come their way. For example, “Allie, you’ve got your EpiPen and are ready to have a great time at the amusement park today. Remember, if you get stung, you’ve got everything you need with you. Alex, Adam, and Mrs. Simpson will also be there with you. You can always call me, too.”

, Kids love to spend time with friends both at and outside of your home. There may be a school dance, birthday party, or something else your child wants to attend. Instead of not allowing your child to go, which may embarrass them, plan a strategy together. This not only shows your child positive management of allergies, but may prevent feelings of being left out.Consider calling the host parent or organization to see if your child can bring along safe treats or an EpiPen.
Let your child know what you’ve worked out. Kids enjoying feeling like they have control over situation, so involve them in whatever solution you’ve worked out. For example, “Hey Julia, I talked to Mrs. Peterson and she’s excited that you can come to the party. She told me that there’s gluten-free pizza she ordered for you for the party and is she’s also making a gluten-free cake for everyone to eat. Why don’t we pick out some pretty flowers for her as a thank you?”; or, “Mr. Christopher told me that you can absolutely go on the field trip, Max. Just give him your EpiPen and let him know if there’s anything at the park you need to avoid. He’ll let you and a friend or two stay back.”"
"
Discuss fitting in with other children.,
Inform your child’s school.,
Let your child know that school is a supportive space.",How to Help Your Child Cope with Allergies3," Children of any age may be worried about fitting in if they have allergies. Talk to your child about any fear or anxiety they may have because their allergies inhibit the activities. Make sure to keep your explanations at a level appropriate to your child’s age.Research places your teen or tween may go with friends. Formulate a strategy with your child in advance to go someplace without feeling singled out or embarrassed because of their allergies.
Explain to smaller children that everyone has some kind of challenge. For example, “You know how your friend Lily has to wear glasses, Luca? Your having to stay away from bees is like Lily wearing glasses. Everyone has something that makes them a little different.”Consider visit a pediatric psychologist if your child has severe anxiety, worry, fear, or even depression about their allergies. A doctor can help your child be vigilant about their allergies without being fearful or restrictive.

, Your child’s teachers and school nurses are there to support your child and create a safe space. Informing your child’s educators about their allergies can reduce your child’s anxiety about uncomfortable or potentially unsafe situations. Recognize that educational professionals are required to this information confidential, so your child shouldn’t worry about other students or parents finding out.Tell teachers, administrators, school nurses and counselors about your child’s allergies and how you manage them. For example, “Mrs. Wiener, I wanted to let you know that Clemens is seriously allergic to peanuts. He knows this and is really great at staying away from potentially bad foods, but occasionally may need a reminder.”
Ask for accommodations if necessary. For example, your child may carry an EpiPen for potential reactions throughout the day. Make sure the school is aware of this so your child can carry it without a problem.
Ask one of your child’s favorite teachers if they would serve as a point person in case your child needs a safe space. For example, “Hi Mr. Sarver, Josie really loves your class and working with you in your lab. Her allergies have gotten so bad that she can’t go outside during recess. Would she be able to come and work with you during this time or seek you out if she’s having a problem?”

, Tell your child that teachers and the school nurse are always there to help. Make sure your child knows that teachers, nurses, and counselors are available at any time to talk or deal with a problem due to allergies.Allow your child to approach teachers on their own. For example, “Callie, I let Mr. Steele know about your allergies. He cares a lot about you and said that you can always talk to him and get help during school.”

Consult your doctor.,
Learn the treatment goals of medication.,
Treat any underlying condition.,
Ask about antiplatelet and anticoagulant treatments.,
Look into anti-arrhythmic drugs.,
Ask about calcium channel blockers.,
Consult your doctor about beta blockers.",How to Choose a Treatment for Arrhythmia1," Many arrhythmias are harmless or require minimal treatment plans. Your doctor will always prefer medication to a surgical procedure if medication is enough to treat your arrhythmia on its own. Your doctor will consider a variety of factors, including your age, medical history, and type of arrhythmia based on diagnostic testing.


For example, medications cannot reliably speed up your heart to treat a slow heartbeat (bradycardia), but they can help with arrhythmias stemming from a heart that beats erratically or too fast (tachycardia).;
, A medication can (when taken according to your prescription) help to slow a fast heartbeat or even reduce the potential for complications stemming from your arrhythmia. Some of the most serious—and potentially life-threatening—complications of arrhythmia include stroke, heart failure, and sudden cardiac arrest., An arrhythmia is often a symptom itself of another underlying condition. Your doctor’s diagnostic testing may undercover that your condition has resulted from a thyroid problem or even heart disease.In this instance, your doctor may prescribe a medication (such as one to treat hyperthyroidism) as well as a medication to combat your arrhythmia during the process.


As with any medications, take exactly as directed by your doctor.

, One of the most common forms of arrhythmia is known as atrial fibrillation (AFib). This arrhythmia allows your blood to pool, increasing the risk of clotting — and therefore stroke — as one of the chambers in your heart pumps ineffectively.Your doctor will likely prescribe a blood-thinning medication to reduce the potential for your blood to clot in these instances.Common drugs used for this purpose include aspirin and warfarin (Coumadin), which you should always take according to your doctor’s recommended schedule.Blood-thinning medications often come with the risk of excess bleeding, and you must inform your doctor of all other drugs you take before beginning this treatment plan.You may also have to submit to regular blood testing to assure the medication is at the correct dosage, especially for warfarin., These options can help with converting the heart rhythm to normal (cardioversion).Your doctor will have a large assortment of these drugs to choose from, and you may have to try several before finding one that manages your arrhythmia without adverse side effects. During the trial-and-error process, you may experience a worsened arrhythmia from some of these drugs, so your doctor will likely prescribe a blood-thinning medication in association to reduce the risk of stroke. Common options include:Amiodarone (Cordarone, Pacerone)
Bepridil hydrochloride (Vascor)
Flecainide (Tambocor)
Ibutilide (Corvert)

, Calcium channel blockers (calcium antagonists) prevent the movement of calcium into cardiac tissue, resulting in a slowed heart rate.This makes these a common choice for slowing a fast heart rate (tachycardia), especially in situations where antiarrhythmic drugs haven’t worked or are not recommended by your doctor. Options include felodipine (Plendil), isradipine (Dynacirc), and nicardipine (Cardene).They are usually taken daily.
Don’t take these drugs if you are pregnant.
Don’t drink grapefruit juice when taking calcium channel blockers because it may increase drug concentration and have a toxic effect.

, Beta blockers reduce the effects of adrenaline, which can also treat arrhythmia caused by a fast heartbeat.Your doctor is more likely to prescribe these drugs if heart disease is the underlying cause of your arrhythmia because they can also treat angina pains associated with heart disease.Common options include acebutolol (Sectral), atenolol (Tenormin), and betaxolol (Kerlone).This drug is usually taken daily.
You shouldn't use this drug if you are lactating or pregnant.
Side effects can include hypotension, bradycardia, and difficulty breathing.
There is increased risk of hypoglycemia if you combine this drug with insulin.

"
Consult your doctor.,
Discuss electrical cardioversion.,
Ask about catheter ablation.,
Choose a pacemaker if your heart beats too slowly.,
Ask your doctor about an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD).,
Discuss a heart Maze procedure.",How to Choose a Treatment for Arrhythmia2," Your doctor will try available medications to control your arrhythmia before resorting to an invasive therapy option or inserting a rhythm-stabilizing device. If your arrhythmia doesn’t respond to medication, the medications produce too many side effects, or your doctor determines that you’re at risk for serious complications that require more than medication, then they will discuss your options. Which option is right for you will depend on your medical history and type of arrhythmia.

, If none of the anti-arrhythmic medications have effectively controlled your arrhythmia, then you may be a candidate for electrical cardioversion. Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter are the most common forms of arrhythmia that respond to electrical cardioversion.The procedure involves delivering a small electrical signal to your heart to stabilize the rhythm., An electrophysiologist can use catheter ablation to correct a variety of arrhythmias, including AFib, atrial flutter, and ventricular tachycardia, which is potentially life threatening.For this procedure, your doctor will insert a small catheter into your heart and deliver high-frequency currents to the tissue causing the arrhythmia.This essentially “disconnects” the faulty pathway, resulting in a normal heartbeat.


Because this procedure is more invasive than electrical cardioversion, your doctor may try the latter option first, followed by ablation if necessary.
This is a short procedure (two to four hours), and you can typically resume normal activities within a few days with a low risk of any complication.

, If your arrhythmia causes your heart to beat too slowly, then your doctor will likely discuss the option of a pacemaker.Unfortunately, no medications are available to treat a slow heart rate (bradycardia). A pacemaker includes a very small set of wires that measure the electrical activity in your heart. They connect to a small pulse generator that delivers a signal to normalize your heart’s rate whenever it detects an abnormality.Though it sounds very invasive, the procedure is considered very safe and requires only one night in a hospital while the team monitors your heart rate and rhythm to ensure proper functioning of the device.Because of their ability to interfere with your pacemaker, you should avoid strong magnetic fields and power-generating equipment (getting an MRI or using arc welding equipment, for instance). You should also avoid storing an electronic device such as your cell phone in your chest pocket next to your pacemaker.

, An ICD is similar to a pacemaker (leads inserted into the heart connected to a pulse generator), but they are used to treat a wider range of arrhythmias, especially ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, both of which can be life threatening.Before you consider an ICD, your arrhythmia must be life-threatening and originate from an uncorrectable cause such as: acute myocardial infarction (heart attack), myocardial ischemia (inadequate blood flow to the heart muscle), or electrolyte imbalance and drug toxicity.
If you choose an ICD, you can maintain a normal lifestyle, including taking part in sports and exercise. Your ICD may need to get checked several times a year, although their batteries last between five and seven years.
To help protect the ICD’s pulse generator, you will need to avoid large magnetic fields and energy-generating equipment (such as MRIs and arc welding equipment, for example). You should also avoid placing your cell phone or headphones within six inches of the device.

, If nothing else has controlled your atrial fibrillation, then your doctor may discuss the option of a heart Maze procedure, which can be minimally invasive cardiac surgery or is an open heart surgery.In the surgery, the doctor creates small cuts that are stitched together and scar tissue forms, which interferes with abnormal impulses."

Bee pollen is the tiny pellets of pollen collected on bees while they fly. It can contain bee saliva.Bee pollen comes in it's natural raw form, or also in tablets or capsules.


Bee pollen is better raw. Never heat it because it loses any helpful enzymes. You can just scoop out the pellets and take it plain, or you can sprinkle it in your food.
Bee pollen is not the same as honey, honeycomb, royal jelly, or bee venom. Some believe that other bee products, like honey and royal jelly, can help with allergies.;
, Bee pollen from your area is the most effective for treating your allergies. When you decide to take bee pollen, try to find a local supplier so that you can be desensitized to local allergens.


Local means the pollen should be collected by bees in areas that contain the same plants as the allergens.If there are no local suppliers, do the research and find a supplier with a good reputation for pure products and one who can supply a bee pollen with a broad range of plant components.

, When you are choosing a bee pollen, look for a lot of color. A variety of color suggests that the pollen has come from multiple plants, which helps you fight off allergens from various sources., You can buy local bee pollen in a few different places, depending on your area. Natural grocery stores, like Whole Foods, or natural health stores may carry local bee pollen. Often, you can find bee pollen at the community farmer’s market. If there are farms in your area who sell honey, you may be able to purchase bee pollen there, too.You may be able to search online for retailers, markets, or farms who sell bee pollen in your area.

, Before you take a lot of bee pollen, ingest a trial dose to see how your body reacts to it. Start with ⅛ teaspoon of the pellets. Wait for at least 24 hours to determine that you are not experiencing any adverse reactions.


Another way you can do a trial dose is by starting with a single pellet of bee pollen and placing it in your mouth. Increase slowly each day to gauge your reaction or tolerance.Adverse reactions range from severe asthma attacks and anaphylactic reactions to mild skin rashes. Anaphylactic reactions and asthma attacks can be life threatening, so be cautious.
Tell your physician about any reactions that you experience.

, If you don’t experience any negative side effects after 24 hours, you can slowly incorporate bee pollen into your daily activities. Slowly increase the amount of bee pollen by ⅛ teaspoon every day.


A typical daily dose is ½ to two teaspoons of bee pollen throughout the allergy season., To get maximum benefit, you should start incorporating bee pollen into your daily routine a month before your allergies usually start. Then, keep using the bee pollen throughout the allergy season to help reduce your allergies.For fall allergies, make sure to buy bee pollen that was harvested in the fall. If you have spring allergies, make sure to buy bee pollen harvested in the spring.

, Bee pollen, in general, is high in amino acids, antioxidants, and fatty acids. It is also rich in minerals, such zinc, copper, iron, and potassium, as well as vitamins like vitamin A, E, and the B complex vitamins. Bee pollen tends to have anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties., The ability of bee pollen to desensitize against hay fever has only been tested in a few small studies, and the results of these studies were generally positive.Desensitization is a treatment process used to modify the allergic response.Bee pollen helps you build up defenses against allergens.


Bee pollen and bee pollen extracts have been shown to decrease the release of histamine, the substance whose activity results in most of the misery of allergy, which helps reduce the itching, the runny nose, the watery eyes, and the sneezing.In a number of human studies, allergies to grass pollen, house dust, and hay fever have been successfully treated with bee pollen., Bee pollen has not been tested on children or women who are pregnant. Because of this, these groups may be at risk. It is not recommended that you give bee pollen to anyone under 12, to any woman pregnant or nursing, or to anyone with asthma.Be aware that some people have adverse reactions to bee pollen. Severe allergic reactions, including anaphylactic shock, have occurred in some cases., Talk to your physician and let them know that you are considering bee pollen as a treatment. She may have some suggestions pertinent to your specific situation.Check with your doctor if you take any medications or other herbal supplements before taking bee pollen.

Minimize your exposure to dust and dust mites.Dust and dust mites are common indoor allergens, so when winter comes (and you spend more time indoors) these allergy symptoms may worsen.,
Get rid of any mold around your home.Another common allergen that can worsen during the wintertime (due to its presence indoors) is mold.,
Practice good hygiene with your pet.Both pets and people may spend more time indoors during the winter, so if you are allergic to dogs or cats you may find that your allergy symptoms worsen during the colder months.,
Plan for the holidays.As the holidays approach, there are some additional steps you can take to handle your allergies and prevent them from getting out of control.,
Know that a runny nose from being outdoors is not an allergy.",How to Handle Winter Allergies1," The best way to combat the allergy symptoms is to prevent (or minimize) your exposure to the allergen in the first place. Strategies to reduce the dust and dust mites in your home include:


Purchase a HEPA air filter. This can help to clear dust out of the air, and hence reduce your allergy symptoms.
Wash your bedding at least once a week in hot water. This can help to prevent the accumulation of dust and dust mites.
Also use allergy-proof covers on your mattress and pillow covers to reduce the accumulation of dust and dust mites.
Vacuum any carpets in the home at least twice a week, and clean any surfaces that gather dust regularly. Use a wet paper towel or sponge to clean these surfaces — a duster will just cause the dust to recirculate and settle again.;
, Mold grows in damp places, such as around leaks in roofs or pipes, in the shower or bathroom, or anywhere with moisture. Strategies to reduce your exposure to mold include:


Throw out any shower curtains, carpets, or other things in your home that have mold on them. If you spot mold on something, your best bet is just to get rid of it. The longer it lingers in your home, the more of a chance there is for mold spores to get into the air and to worsen your allergy symptoms.
Use a dehumidifier to reduce the humidity in your home to less than 50%. Because mold thrives with greater moisture and humidity, this can help to prevent mold problems from developing in your home.

, If you have severe pet allergies, consider getting a non-hairy pet instead such as a fish or lizard. If you only have mild pet allergies and are seeking to manage them as best as possible, you can try:


Washing your pet at least once a week. This is because, contrary to popular belief, pet hair is not the most common allergen; rather, it is pet dander (dead skin cells that naturally shed from your pet). For this reason, bathing your pet can help to diminish the dander and reduce your allergy symptoms.
Keeping your pet out of the bedroom. Because you spend quite a bit of time in the bedroom every night, as well as the fact that bedrooms are often carpeted, keeping your pet out can prevent pet dander from accumulating in your bedroom. This, in turn, can help to alleviate your allergy symptoms.

, These include:


Getting an artificial Christmas tree because real trees have the potential to grow mold. Some people are also allergic to the fragrance of a real tree.
If you do get a real tree, consider washing it thoroughly with water outdoors before you bring it in and decorate it.
If you are visiting relatives for the holidays who have a pet (and you are allergic), plan appropriately by asking for a room as far away as possible from the pet, and by bringing allergy medications as needed.
Be aware of the rebound effect if you are not spending the holidays with your own pet. Some people, after being away from their pet for several days, return home only to find that their allergy to their own pet has worsened. This is due to a decreased tolerance in your immune system following your absence.
Understand that stress can trigger allergy symptoms such as hives or asthma. Try to stay as relaxed as possible over the holidays, and take steps to lighten your workload during the holidays (such as preparing some of the dishes for big dinners in advance).

, Some people confuse the runny nose they get from being outside in the cold with a winter allergy when, in fact, the two are not related. A runny nose in the cold is a vasomotor (physiological) response; it may be correlated to changes in temperature (particularly the cold), windy weather, changes in humidity, and strong odors or smoke.

Improve your diet.Eating a healthy diet is recommended by naturopaths as a method to decrease allergy symptoms.,
Get plenty of rest.,
See an alternative health practitioner.If you are someone who prefers natural remedies over conventional medical treatments, now may be a good time to book an appointment with your naturopath, your acupuncturist, or another complementary healthcare practitioner.",How to Handle Winter Allergies2," Specifically, it is advisable to eat a diet low in fat and high in complex carbohydrates (carbohydrates with a low glycemic index, such as whole grains) to reduce allergy symptoms. Dietary recommendations to help with winter allergies include:


Consume plenty of vegetables (particularly dark, leafy greens, carrots, beets, cabbage, and yams), choose carbohydrates with a low glycemic index (such as whole grains and quinoa), and consume spices (such as garlic, ginger, cayenne, and horseradish).
Avoid caffeine, alcohol, dairy products, red meat, sugar, and wheat as much as possible.
Stay well-hydrated. In addition to a healthy diet, drinking at least eight 8-oz glasses of water daily is important, and more if you are exercising (to compensate for fluid lost in sweat).

, Rest has been shown to boost your immune system's natural effectiveness, and also to diminish unnecessary stress responses that are tied to allergies. The more well-rested you are, the less your allergies will get out of control. Although this is not a guaranteed ""cure"" for winter allergies, it is a step in the right direction, and something a naturopath would advise as one of the first things to change.

, He can provide you with additional information and strategies specific to the winter allergies you are suffering from.

"
"
Try an antihistamine.Antihistamines can help to diminish sneezing, sniffling, and itching as a result of winter allergies.,
Use a decongestant.,
Use a nasal spray.,
Ask your doctor about allergy shots.If you suffer from ongoing allergies, one option to consider is allergy shots.",How to Handle Winter Allergies3," These can be purchased over-the-counter at your local pharmacy or drugstore. Examples of antihistamines include Zyrtec (certizine), Claritin (loratadine), Allegra (fexofenadine), and Benadryl (diphenhydramine). Follow the dosing instructions on the bottle.


Note that many antihistamines, like Benadryl, can have a sedating effect, making it difficult to function. Look for non-drowsy antihistamines, such as Claritin, Zyrtec, or Allegra (fexofenadine).

, If your nasal symptoms are out of control (such as a runny nose and ongoing congestion), you can try using a decongestant.Look for an over-the-counter medication containing phenylephrine or pseudoephedrine, which are decongestant ingredients, and follow the dosing instructions on the bottle.


Your best bet is to opt for an over-the-counter pill form of decongestant if you are suffering from symptoms of congestion due to your winter allergies.

, A nasal spray will usually work faster to treat your allergies than taking a pill.You can get prescription or over-the-counter nasal sprays to treat congestion, runny nose, itchy eyes, and itchy throat. You can try a saline spray, which is safe for daily use and can be used by adults and children. Other options include antihistamine sprays, corticosteroids, or decongestant sprays.

Antihistamine sprays, such as Astepro (azelastine) and Patanase (olopatadine), are available by prescription. They are effective but may cause drowsiness.
Corticosteroid sprays are available over-the-counter or by prescription, and include brands like Flonase (fluticasone proprionate) and Nasonex (mometasone). They reduce swelling and are good for long-term use — you may wish to begin using them at the start of season, as it can take a few days or weeks to notice the full effects of this treatment.
Alternatively, you can also use a decongestant nasal spray like Afrin or Dristan (oxymetazoline hydrochloride); however, this is only recommended for short-term use of less than three days, as any longer can lead to ""rebound"" symptoms of worsened congestion.

, They do not provide immediate relief from your symptoms, but rather, work towards a long-term solution where you eventually become desensitized to the allergen. Your doctor will first determine what allergens, specifically, trigger you by testing you for each one. You will then be administered shots with gradually increasing doses of the allergen so that your body adapts to it and no longer reacts in the same way.


Allergy shots require a time commitment as well as a financial one. It can take as long as six to twelve months to develop tolerance/immune response to specific allergen and then an additional three to five years to maintain.Allergy shots do not work for food allergies.

Make certain areas of your home dog free.,
Use air cleaners in your home.,
Clean your home on a daily basis.,
Wash your hands regularly.",How to Handle an Allergy to Your New Dog1," To help alleviate your allergy, create an area of your home that is dog free. Designate your bedroom or the upstairs area of your home “dog free” and keep the dog out of these areas. Keep the doors closed or block off the area with a pet fence. This way, your dog will stay out of certain spots in your home. You can then retreat to these areas if your dog allergy starts to act up.Another good rule of thumb is to keep your dog off of your furniture, even in areas where they are allowed to hang out and run around. Keep the dog off your couch or your love seats so there is less hair in the area. This will make your allergy less severe when you are sitting in these areas.;
, Place high-efficiency particulate arrestance (HEPA) air cleaners in your home to help filter out dust and dander in the air. You can put one in each room to filter the air or one in areas you share with your new dog. Good air cleaners can help to reduce the severity of your allergy.You can find HEPA air cleaners online or at your local hardware store.

, Keeping your home clean can really help to reduce your allergy. Try to stick to a daily cleaning schedule where you sweep common areas every day and vacuum your home once a week. You should also dust often and remove dog hair with a clean wet cloth.You may also go for hardwood flooring and less rugs in your home so it is easier to clean. Opt for furniture that you can clean easily on a weekly basis to avoid letting dog hair or fur build up.
You should also get in the habit of washing your bedding and blankets on a weekly basis if your dog is allowed in your bedroom.

, Keep your hands clean and free of fur or hair by washing them regularly. Make sure you use warm water and soap to wash your hands every time you touch your dog or before you touch your clothing or your skin. You should also keep hand sanitizer on hand so you can clean your hands when you are on the go.Wash your hands by lathering your hands with warm water and antibacterial soap. Rub your hands together for ten to fifteen seconds to make sure you get all the bacteria, fur, and hair off your hands.

"
Bathe your dog on a weekly basis.,
Hire a professional groomer for your dog.,
Set up a separate sleeping area for your dog.",How to Handle an Allergy to Your New Dog2," To reduce the amount of allergy-causing dander on your dog, stick to a weekly bathing schedule. Use dog-friendly shampoo and give your dog a good cleaning so there is no build up of dander, dirt, or old skin cells on their coat.You may struggle to bathe your dog if your allergy is severe. If this is the case, ask a family member or a friend to bathe the dog for you.

, Your allergy may be too severe for you to groom your dog yourself and brushing your dog can trigger an allergy attack. Hire a professional groomer to brush your dog on a weekly basis to help prevent loose hair from getting into the air in your home. Or ask a friend or family member to brush your dog for you.Make sure the dog is groomed and brushed outdoors so its hair does not get into your home.

, To prevent your dog’s hair from getting into your sleeping space, arrange a separate area for them to sleep and rest. You may set up a dog bed in the living room on a hardwood floor or arrange a sleeping spot by the back door. Having a separate sleeping area for your dog will reduce the severity of your allergy, especially in the area where you sleep.


You may also set up a separate area of your dog to play and eat so they have their area and you have yours. Keep the areas separate and train your dog to respect these boundaries.

"
"
Use over-the-counter medication.,
Get allergy shots.,
Keep tabs on your allergy.",How to Handle an Allergy to Your New Dog3," If your allergy is mild, you can take over-the-counter medications like antihistamines. These medications can relieve itchy eyes, nasal congestion, and other mild symptoms. Keep these medications on hand so you can take them as necessary.Keep in mind OTC allergy medications will not treat more severe symptoms like wheezing and chest tightness. You should see your primary care doctor if you experience more severe allergy symptoms.

, If your allergy is severe you may opt for allergy shots. Talk to your doctor about allergy shots, also called allergy vaccines. This medication helps you develop antibodies that can counter your allergy. However, allergy shots take awhile to kick in and you will need to get weekly injections for several months to see any results.Over time, getting weekly allergy shots and then monthly shots can help to reduce your symptoms or make your allergy go away completely.

, Note if your allergy gets worse over time or if your symptoms do not improve with medication. Keep in touch with your doctor about your symptoms so they can make sure you do not get worse. If your allergy does not get better with adjustments to your home or maintenance of your pet, you may need to consider medications or other lifestyle changes.Sometimes, an allergy can get so severe you may not be able to own a dog. If this occurs, speak to your doctor about your options before you give up your dog.

Put your dog up for adoption.,
Give your dog to another pet owner.,
Ask a family member or friend to take the dog.",How to Handle an Allergy to Your New Dog4," If you cannot handle owning your dog due to your allergy, you may decide to put it up for adoption. The adoption process can be lengthy and time consuming, especially as there are often more dogs up for adoption than available owners. You will need to contact your local Humane Society or SPCA for more information on giving up your dog for adoption.You will need to provide basic information about your dog, such as age, breed, gender, and given name. You may need to put your dog on a waiting list until a spot opens at a local shelter where the dog can stay while it awaits adoption.
You can contact dog shelters or rescue groups in your area directly to see if they will house your dog during the adoption process. Look for shelters that have a no kill policy, as some shelters will put down dogs who are not adopted by a set time.

, If you want to avoid the adoption process, you can try giving your dog to another pet owner. You may ask a pet owner in your neighborhood or friend group to take the dog. Or you may contact a pet owner at your doggy daycare or in your training group. Try to find an owner who knows your dog well already and seems open to owning more pets. Make sure your dog gets along with any pets that owner already has.


For example, you may say to the owner, ""My allergy to my dog is severe and I can no longer keep him in my home. Would you be willing to take over ownership of him?""

, You can also reach out to family members or friends who seem interested in owning a pet. Contact a close family member who has space for a pet and seems to like your dog. Or reach out to a friend who seems open to owning a dog.


For example, you may ask a friend or family member, ""My allergy has made it impossible for me to keep my dog. Would you be willing to take over ownership of my dog?""

Your primary care doctor may be able to provide the vaccinations you need, but if not, then he/she can refer you to a travel clinic. If you do not have a primary doctor, local health departments also sometimes provide travel vaccinations, or they can recommend a clinic to you.Because some immunizations take longer to complete, make an appointment with your doctor at least 4 to 6 weeks beforehand, though two months is ideal, to ensure that the immunizations are in effect when you travel to Thailand.
Have your doctor send your medical history records to the travel clinic so they have them on file when you arrive for your appointment. This is especially important for people who are taking medications for diseases or illnesses.
You can find a list of health departments and travel medical clinics on the CDC’s website: https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/find-clinic
;
, Confirm with your doctor that you are up-to-date on routine vaccinations. These vaccinations include, but are not limited to:Measles, Mumps, Rubella
Chicken pox
Tetanus
Polio
Flu shot

, Contact one of the travel clinics provided by your doctor, and make an appointment as soon as possible. There are no special preparations required before making an appointment. A travel clinic will provide all the necessary information and vaccines for your specific destination, in this case Thailand.


If you do not have an International Certificate of Vaccination (ICV), one will be filled out properly and given to you at your appointment.Appointment costs vary from state to state and will depend upon the vaccinations you choose to receive.
Even if you were born in Thailand, you will still need to get vaccinated. It only takes a short amount of time for people born in foreign countries to lose their natural antibodies once they leave their country of origin., Check to see if there are any additional health precautions that you need to take before you leave due to an outbreak or other emergency. You can find these recommendations by checking CDC or WHO websites:

https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/list
http://www.who.int/countries/tha/en/

, These three vaccines are recommended for all travelers. Hepatitis A and typhoid can be contracted through contaminated food and water. Hepatitis B can be contracted through sexual contact, as well as dirty needles, i.e., needles used for tattoos, piercings, and medical procedures., If you are spending a lot of time outdoors or sleeping outside get the malaria vaccine. Also, if you are visiting provinces in Thailand that border Myanmar, Cambodia, and Laos, especially the forest or forest fringe areas in these provinces, consider getting the malaria vaccine., If you are visiting Thailand during the rainy seasons (mid-May to mid-November), planning to stay for more than a month, spend a lot of time outdoors (adventure travel, hiking, backpacking, etc.), or visit rural/remote areas then consider getting this vaccine., If you are a veterinarian or wildlife professional/researcher, and/or if you will be spending a lot of time with wild animals or staying in remote areas, consider getting this vaccine.


Also, because children tend to play with animals and are less likely to report an animal bite, consider getting a preventative rabies vaccination for your child if you are traveling with children., The government of Thailand requires proof of the yellow fever vaccination if you are arriving from a country with a risk of yellow fever (the U.S. is not included as a risk country). If your flight has a layover and you are required to de-plane in an at-risk country, it is recommended that you get this vaccine. If this applies to you, you need to visit an authorized U.S. yellow fever vaccine center for this shot., Cholera is active in some parts of Thailand, so you may also want to get a cholera vaccine before you leave for your trip. The risk is not high for travelers, but if you contract cholera then the illness can be severe., The cost of immunizations and vaccinations is becoming increasingly expensive. If you’re on a budget, first check if your doctor administers the vaccines before you go to a travel clinic.


At a travel clinic, a consultation fee can range from $50 to $100, and the cost of vaccinations can range from $10 to $150 or more, and some vaccinations require as many as three shots. For example, a Japanese Encephalitis vaccination typically costs $450 to $800 total.Your local public health department might offer discounted rates on travel vaccines., Check with your health insurance company to see what is covered by your policy. Health insurance companies do not provide coverage for some travel vaccinations, and at times provide zero coverage.


For a person who is covered, the typical expenses include a co-pay of $10 to $40 for the doctor visit, and co-pays for the vaccinations.Remember to get a copy of your receipt from the travel clinic so you can submit a claim to your insurance company. Your insurance company may reimburse you for some of the costs.Medicare does not cover any vaccines or medicines for foreign travel., In order to ensure that your immunizations are in effect when you travel, get immunized before you travel. This way you can prevent getting sick while traveling abroad.


If you are in the situation where you were immunized only three weeks or less from your departure date, consider buying supplemental health insurance for traveling abroad. U.S. health plans do not cover international travel. This insurance will cover medical costs abroad and emergency evacuations.
Foreign hospitals and doctors often require payment in cash, and emergency medical evacuations can be very expensive, costing up to $100,000."

,, Common accommodations include restricting allergens in the classroom, an allergen-safe table in the cafeteria, walkie talkies for recess, where the epinephrine will be kept. Think about all the places and things your child will encounter during the school day and decide what he/she needs to be safe and included. For example, consider the classroom, the cafeteria, the bus, recess and gym, after school activities, arts and crafts. How will snacks, lunch, birthday parties be handled? Will surfaces be washed?

Find a credentialed doctor.,
Call in advance to request a food allergy test.,
Ask whether the test will be provided at your practitioner’s office.,
Ask your healthcare provider if you need to prepare for the allergy test.,
Write down all relevant information.,
Ask your doctor if an elimination diet is necessary.",How to Get Tested for Food Allergies1," It can be tempting to imagine that you have isolated the cause of your allergy on your own and don’t need professional assistance. What appears like an allergy can actually be part of a larger disorder. Flawed self-diagnoses can cause these issues to go untreated and result in unnecessarily limiting your access to appropriate sources of nutrition.It is also important that the doctor you seek has proper medical training. Some experimental methods of testing allergies are actually suspected of increasing the risk of acquiring an allergy.;
, If your healthcare provider offers the service, you can schedule an appointment specifically to get tested for food allergies.


In some cases, offices may require a consultation prior to testing to ensure that your insurance will cover the test. If you have no medical reason for suspecting a food allergy (medical reasons would include gastrointestinal discomfort or hives after eating certain foods), your doctor may wish to discuss the appropriateness of the test or try food elimination prior to subjecting you to a skin food allergy test.

, In some cases, you may be sent off-site to a laboratory or referred to an allergy specialist for a food allergy test. If this is the case, ask whether you first need to be seen at your healthcare provider’s office or if you can simply go directly to the test center or specialist office.

, Some physicians may request that you practice an elimination diet or keep a food diary. These can be necessary for isolating an allergy and determining what tests are required. Do not pursue these methods, however, without the explicit recommendation of a doctor.

, Before you visit the doctor, you should be sure that you have available all the information that will allow them to diagnosis your allergy. This includes your symptoms and everything that might have influenced your condition. Writing this down will make it less likely that you forget important information.


Write down all of the symptoms you had. This includes symptoms that maybe came later and seemed unrelated. They could be part of the same disorder and might be important for diagnosing your condition. Write down when the reaction occurred, how long the reaction lasted, the severity of the symptoms, and any treatment provided and your reaction to that treatment.
Write down what you ate, how it was prepared (raw, cooked, powdered, etc.), how much you ate, and when you ate it.
Also write down all of the medications that you were on. Major life changes and outside stressors can also cause negative physical effects, so be sure to inform your doctor of these as well.
If you can, consider bringing along a family member or friend. They might remember things that you forgot., Some people will break out into hives immediately after eating something they are allergic to. Sometimes, however, allergic reactions are delayed. If it is unclear what caused the allergic reaction, your doctor may want you to eliminate suspicious foods from your diet. It is important you discuss this with your doctor first as they can help you ensure you still get all your required nutrients.Think back to what you ate on the day of your outbreak. Eliminate those foods from your diet for two weeks.
Slowly introduce the suspected foods into your diet, one at a time. Write down everything you eat and any symptoms you experience. Remember, the effects may not be immediate — it may be a few days before you experience a reaction.
If you experience a return of symptoms when you reintroduce a suspected food, then it is likely you are allergic to that food.
If the allergy was severe, you should not attempt this.Each time our body comes into contact with an allergen, the response gets stronger and stronger. If you already had a severe reaction to the allergen, even a minor encounter could prove fatal. Talk to your doctor about identifying the trigger as soon as possible, as well as preventative measures and what to do should you be exposed to the allergen.

Wear an allergy mask.An allergy mask is basically a more durable facemask of the sort used by doctors and medical professionals.,
Wear special gardening clothes.,
Wear gardening gloves.,
Protect your eyes.Nothing is guaranteed to set off a nasty allergic reaction than a big chunk of pollen in the eyes.,
Choose the time to garden carefully.If the day is particularly dry and windy, you’re more likely to suffer an allergic reaction.,
Sanitize yourself after gardening.",How to Garden if You Have Seasonal Allergies1," High-quality allergy masks will be lightweight and equipped with a particle filter. The filter on the mask will prevent you from breathing pollen and plant spores. You can easily obtain an allergy mask online for about $50., Don’t go out to work in the garden in the clothes you want to spend the rest of your day in. Instead, put on a different pair of pants – some heavy gardening jeans, for instance – an old pair of shoes, and an old shirt that you don’t care about soiling. Don’t wear it again until after you launder it.Always wear long sleeves and pants in the garden if you have seasonal allergies. This will minimize the amount of skin is exposed to atmospheric pollen., Gardening requires using your hands to interact with plants and grasses. But if you have seasonal allergies, even brief contact with these natural elements could produce an allergic reaction. To protect yourself, wear gardening gloves.You can easily obtain thick gardening gloves from your local home and garden shop.
Don’t touch your skin with the gardening glove.

, If you have seasonal allergies, wear safety goggles/glasses, sunglasses, or regular glasses (if you wear them) while you garden. This will reduce the likelihood of you getting itchy, burning eyes due to your seasonal allergies.If you frequently experience burning eyes despite covering them with glasses, consider using ski goggles or diving goggles while gardening.
Don’t touch your face or eyes without removing your gardening gloves when gardening., Additionally, check your local TV or radio station for high pollen count alerts in your area. You can also obtain pollen counts online at the Weather Underground.Rain helps clear pollen from the air. The best time to garden if you have seasonal allergies, generally, is right after it rains.
It’s also smart to garden in the afternoon, as this will reduce your exposure to pollen., Once you’ve finished your gardening for the day, remove your gardening clothes and shoes. Put them in the laundry bin, and then take a shower. This will reduce the likelihood that pollen or mold spores that may have hitched a ride on your clothes or hair will go on to contaminate the rest of your home."

Perform an oral challenge under the supervision of a health professional.,
Discuss preventative measures with your doctor.",How to Get Tested for Food Allergies2," The only approved methods of testing allergies are the skin prick test, the blood test, and the oral food challenge. Other methods of testing can lead to false results and might even be dangerous. Some unapproved methods include:


Applied Kinesiology, Cytotoxicity testing vega testing, NAET, IG64 Testing, Hair Analysis, and Pulse Testing., This is perhaps the most common food allergy test. A grid is drawn on your skin and tiny amounts of potential food allergens are inserted under the surface of the skin. Squares on the grid that develop a red bump or swelling may indicate a food allergy.


This test does not necessarily confirm food allergies on its own. A negative reaction is usually 90% accurate, while a positive reaction is less than 50% accurate. More testing might be necessary., This requires sending a sample of your blood to a laboratory to get it tested against an extensive list of potential food allergens. The test measures the level of antibodies against specific foods.


This test will often be used to confirm the results of a skin prick test; however, these tests can also be subject to some error and thus it might be necessary to undergo additional testing to confirm the results., When particular foods are suspected to cause an allergy or intolerance, some physicians or health professionals may have you introduce incrementally larger portions of the food into your mouth to test your reaction. The portions will be measured, beginning with very small amounts that are unlikely to cause a response.If you have a reaction to one of the foods, the test will be stopped.
Because the amounts of food are small and carefully administered, reactions will generally be mild, such as flushing or hives. Severe reactions are uncommon.
This can be used to determine if the blood test gave you a false positive.
If you have no reaction to the suspected allergens, then you can work with your doctor to figure out what is causing your symptoms. If you do have a reaction, you will need to discuss the next steps with your doctor.
Because there is the chance this test may cause a serious reaction, it must be done by an experienced professional in a medical setting. This way, the necessary medications and equipment will be available if you have a severe reaction., If a food allergy is confirmed, it is essential that you work with your doctor to create a management plan. It will be necessary to eliminate the food from your diet and take precautions to educate the people in your life about your allergy and train them what to do if you have a reaction.Educate your family, friends, and workplace or school about your allergy. This may include teaching them to read food labels properly, as well as any alternate names for the allergen.For instance, if you have a peanut allergy, you will need to check labels for ingredients that contain peanut protein, such as arachis oil, goober peas, nutmeat, mandelonas, hypogaeic acid, and more.You may need to avoid situations in which there is a high risk of accidental cross-contamination or ingestion of the allergen, such as buffets and picnics.
Wear medical identification jewelry that indicates your food allergy.
Carry an emergency epinephrine pen with you at all times in case you come into accidental contact with the allergen (for instance, at a restaurant in which cross-contamination occurs). Make sure your family, friends, co-workers, and teachers know how to use it.
Consider creating a written emergency management plan to carry with you at all times and distribute to work, school, friends, and family. This will inform others of the recomended treatment should you have a reaction and includes emergency contact information. You can download a form here: http://www.foodallergy.org/faap.

Identify your allergies.,
Talk to an allergist.,
Do not mow the grass.,
Delegate some garden work.",How to Garden if You Have Seasonal Allergies2," “Seasonal allergies” is a blanket term used to describe a diverse set of allergies. For instance, people who are allergic to grass pollen, mold pollen, and tree pollen all experience seasonal allergies, but they are rarely allergic to all possible seasonal allergens. If you can identify your particular allergen, you’ll be better equipped to garden even if you have a seasonal allergy.To identify exactly which seasonal allergies you have, visit a doctor.

, An allergist is a medical professional trained in how allergies affect people. They can help you develop even better plans for gardening if you have seasonal allergies. With the allergist’s help, you’ll be able to find even more techniques and tricks for gardening with seasonal allergies tailored to your specific locale and circumstances.Ask your doctor to recommend an allergist for you.
You might have questions for your allergist. For instance, you might want to ask, “What can I do to alleviate my seasonal allergies?” or “Do you recommend medication for my allergies?”
Use apps like My Nasal Allergy Journal to track your symptoms and triggers. Your allergist will be much interested in this information.

, Mowing the grass can kick up all sorts of pollen and plant spores that might worsen your seasonal allergies. Additionally, do not garden when someone else is mowing the grass. Wait at least an hour before heading out to garden in areas where the grass was recently mowed.For similar reasons, do not rake the leaves. Leaves can collect the mold spores and pollen that cause seasonal allergies. Ask a friend or family member to rake the yard.
Have your yard mowed and leaves raked regularly throughout the fall, especially if your seasonal allergies continue into the autumn season., Invite your friends to join you in gardening and charge them with the tasks that tend to cause you the most intense seasonal allergic reactions. For instance, if you have a strong allergic reaction to certain weeds, have your friend pull the weeds while you plant the tulips in another part of the garden.You can invite your friends to join you in the garden by asking, “Would you like to join me in the garden? I would enjoy the pleasure of your company.”
Your friends will have a great time while gardening with you. Use the opportunity to bond with them.

Plant a low-allergen garden.Certain plants are less likely than others to produce a seasonal allergic reaction.,
Guard against your specific allergy.,
Use medication.There are a number of medications that might be useful in making gardening more bearable if you have seasonal allergies.,
Try acupuncture.",How to Garden if You Have Seasonal Allergies3," A low-allergen garden could, for instance, use artificial mulch and incorporate bright and colorful flowers (which tend to be pollinated by bugs rather than by wind).

Herbs to avoid include chamomile and wormwood.
Weeds you should keep out of your garden include plantago (asthma weed) and Paterson’s curse.
Avoid planting birch, maple, ash, she oak, olive, oak, walnut, alder, white cypress, willow, poplar, elm, cypress, and Monterey pine trees.
Most herbs are perfect for a low-allergy garden. Plant basil, thyme, chives, tarragon, dill, summer savory, fennel, sage, mint, parsley, rosemary, and oregano to your heart’s content.
You might choose to include flowers like the climbing rose, banksia rose, rosemary, and glossy abelia.

, Once you know exactly which allergies you have, you can take action to safeguard against them. For instance, if you have an allergy to tree pollen, you can schedule your gardening in such a way so as to avoid the most intense periods of tree pollination (February through May, in this case). If you’re allergic to grass pollen, on the other hand, you will have a different set of periods during which you should not garden.Consult a botanical guide in order to identify when your specific allergen is pollinating. Avoid gardening during those times.
The plants most likely to cause seasonal allergic reactions include apple trees, dogwood trees, plum trees, pear trees, begonia flower trees, sunflowers, roses, magnolias, daffodils, and lilacs., For instance, you might take a decongestant, which eliminates feelings of stuffiness and runny noses. You might also get an antihistamine, which fights the body’s natural histamine (a biological compound involved in developing inflammation). Finally, you might receive nasal spray steroids, which relieve inflammation and swelling caused by your seasonal allergies.Talk to your doctor about using medication to reduce the severity of your seasonal allergies. If your doctor deems it wise, they will prescribe you an appropriate medication.

, Acupuncture is an ancient Chinese traditional medicine that requires piercing the skin with thin needles to cure various ailments. Some people find that acupuncture can prevent or reduce the incidence of seasonal allergic reactions. To receive acupuncture, visit your local traditional Chinese medical specialist or acupuncturist.Acupuncture is very safe, though you might have some temporary side effects like drowsiness, feelings of sickness, or pain where the needle punctures the skin.

Give the first shot of MMR to children between 12-15 months of age, and the second shot between 4-6 years old. Kids need both doses to have the best immunity.As long as the second dose is 28 days after the first dose, children can get the second dose earlier. The important thing is to give two shots at least 28 days apart.
Children between the ages of 1-12 years can get the MMRV vaccine instead, which covers varicella (chickenpox) as well as measles, mumps, and rubella.;
, Teens who attend college or another post-high school institution should be able to show evidence of immunity to measles, mumps, and rubella. If not, administer two doses of MMR at least 28 days apart.

”Evidence of immunity” is when your patient can show written proof that they have been vaccinated, have had all three diseases, or have had blood tests done showing they are immune to all three diseases.Check your patient's medical records or try to consult with their previous doctor.

, Give one dose to adults who cannot demonstrate evidence of immunity. Adults born before 1957 do not need the vaccine, however., Do a complete history and physical exam and review your patient’s vaccination history before administering the vaccine.Ask if your patient is taking any medications, has any allergies, or has ever reacted to a vaccine previously. Do not give it if they have ever had a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to a component of the vaccine or to the antibiotic neomycin., Pregnancy is a contraindication to giving the MMR vaccine – do not give pregnant women this injection. If your female patient is unsure whether she is pregnant, do a urine test to ensure she is not before administering the vaccine.Let her know this is for her and her baby's safety.

Wait until after the baby is born to give the vaccine.
Advise women not to get pregnant for 4 weeks after getting the vaccine., Severe immunocompromise is a contraindication to the MMR vaccine. Take a thorough medical history of your patient. Do not give them MMR if they suffer from poor immunity due to any of the following:HIV with severe immunocompromise (having the virus alone is not a contraindication if they are in generally good health)
Any type of cancer or cancer treatment
Current chemotherapy or radiation therapy
Congenital immunodeficiency
Low platelet count
Received another vaccine in the past four weeks
Received a recent blood transfusion
Long-term immunosuppressive therapy, such as with corticosteroids

, Some circumstances are not contraindications to the vaccine, but may make it more likely the patient will have an adverse reaction or the vaccine may not work properly. Don’t give the vaccine if any of these conditions are present, unless the benefit outweighs the risk. Use your best clinical judgment!Consider deferring the MMR vaccine if:

The patient received antibody-containing blood products in the last 11 months
The patient has a history of thrombocytopenia or thrombocytopenia purpura
The patient will need TB testing or interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) testing within the next few days; do not give the vaccine if you suspect active TB is present
The patient is moderately to severely ill (mild acute illness is usually not a problem)

, Many patients, especially parents thinking about vaccinating their child, are nervous about vaccines. They may think that vaccines can make their child ill. Explain that immunizations do not cause illness. Help parents and patients understand that measles, mumps, and rubella are very serious illnesses that were common in children before vaccines existed, and that getting any of these illnesses is much more dangerous than getting the vaccine.Address their questions calmly and directly so they feel like you're on the same team. Ask outright, “Do you have any fears or concerns about vaccines that we can discuss?”

, There is a common misconception that vaccines can cause autism in children. This must be very scary for parents, so be sure to address this fear and explain that it simply is not true. Caution parents about believing everything they read on the internet, and direct them to reliable sources of information such as the CDC.

Offer a lead-in to the conversation like, “I know some parents worry that vaccines can cause autism or health problems. If you have those concerns, I’d like to discuss them until you understand and feel comfortable.”

, Give your patients information about MMR that is understandable and relatable. Avoid using excessive medical jargon or talking down to your patients. Don't say things like they should vaccinate their child because it’s the “right thing,” or because you “said so.” Instead, use a friendly tone and supporting information to help them understand that vaccines are safe and will help protect their child – and other people’s children – from life-threatening illnesses.

Avoid terminology like, “MMR is a live attenuated vaccine in which the virulence of the pathogen is reduced.” Instead, say something like, “The measles vaccine uses a weak form of the virus. It’s strong enough to get your body to made defenses to it, but not strong enough to make you sick.”

, Explain that immunizations can cause minor reactions like soreness, swelling, and redness at the site of the injection, and a low fever. Notify your patient that this is not dangerous or uncommon, and it is not a sign that the vaccine is making them or their child sick. Explain that it is their immune system making the defenses it needs. Let them know you're available to help if they have any questions or concerns., Check and re-check the vial label of the vaccine you’re about to give. Check the expiration date – if it’s expired, dispose of it and use a fresh one. Check the labeling to see if the vaccine requires specific handling, for instance shaking the vaccine vial and/or using the reconstituting mix (diluent).Use the “Rights” checklist: Right patient, right vaccine and diluent (when applicable), right time (right patient age, time interval, vaccine isn’t expired), right dosage, right route/needle, right site, right documentation., Choose a needle that is 5/8” long and between 23-25 gauge. Use a new, sterile needle for every injection. Remove the packaging and screw the needle onto the syringe. Only uncap the needle when you’re ready to use it., Wipe the rubber stopper of your vaccine vial with an alcohol swab. Uncap your needle and insert it through the rubber stopper. Pull back on the plunger until you have filled the syringe to just past the 0.5ml mark.Remove the needle from the stopper and push gently on the plunger to squirt a small amount of the vaccine out – make sure this removes any bubbles and gets the liquid to the 0.5ml mark.

This is the right dose for both children and adults.

, Wash your hands thoroughly with warm water and soap. Lather the soap for at least 30 seconds and scrub under your nails, between your fingers, and up your wrists. Dry your hands with a clean paper towel.

You can also put on disposable gloves to administer the injection.Make sure your patient doesn’t have a latex allergy; if so, use non-latex gloves such as those made out of nitrile.

, MMR is delivered subcutaneously, into the fatty tissue beneath the skin and above the muscle layer. For patients under 12 months old, choose a fatty site over the upper outer (anterolateral) thigh muscle. For anyone over 12 months, you can use the anterolateral thigh or the fatty tissue over the triceps muscle.Ask adult patients if they prefer one injection site over another.

, Open a new, sterile alcohol wipe. Rub the site in a circular motion starting in the center and extending out 2-3 inches. Let the alcohol dry.If giving more than one vaccine, use a separate injection site for each one.You can give MMR on the same day as other vaccines.

, Stabilize the arm or leg that will receive the injection with your non-dominant hand. Gently pinch up the skin to allow for better access to the fatty layer.Hold the needle about an inch from your patient. Quickly insert the needle at a 45° angle to the patient’s body. Push down on the plunger with steady pressure to inject the vaccine.

Remove the needle at the same angle you inserted it.
Dispose of the needle in a sharps container. Do not attempt to recap the needle unless it has a built-in safety cap device.

, Apply gentle pressure to the area immediately after removing the needle. Cover this with a small piece of gauze and hold it in place with medical tape. Inform your patient they can remove the bandage later that day., Record the date, dose, and injection site of the vaccination in your EMR (Electronic Medical Records) or paper records, as advised by your administrator. Enter the data into an immunization information system if one is used in your setting., A Vaccine Information Statement (VIS) contains information about the benefits and risks of each vaccine. If possible, give your patients and patients’ parents a copy of a VIS with each vaccination. In the pediatric population, provide a vaccination schedule for the parents indicating which are completed and which are next, and encourage them to schedule an appointment for the next vaccination., If your patient complains of swelling, redness, pain, itching, or mild bleeding at the injection site, assure them this is normal. Then provide medical management to make them feel more comfortable:For pain, redness, swelling, or itching, apply a cold compress to the area. Give adults a mild pain reliever like ibuprofen.
If the injection site is bleeding, apply a bandage over the area. If it continues to bleed, place a thick gauze pad over the site and tell your patient to apply constant pressure.
Raise their arm above the level of their heart for several minutes to slow bleeding.

, Very rarely, a patient may experience a severe allergic reaction to a vaccine called anaphylaxis. Watch out for the following signs, and alert your patient or a second party to do the same and seek emergency medical care if they arise:Quick onset of itching all over
Sudden or severe skin redness or hives
Swelling of the lips, face, tongue, or throat
Wheezing or shortness of breath
Abdominal cramps
Drop in blood pressure and possible loss of consciousness

, For US residents, the CDC considers you already protected against measles under certain circumstances, which may mean you don't need a vaccine. These include:

Having received two doses of a measles-containing vaccine for school-aged children and adults in high exposure settings
Having received one dose for preschool-aged children and adults in low exposure settings
Laboratory confirmation that you have had measles at some point in your life
Laboratory confirmation that you are immune to measles
Being born before 1957

Monitor the pollen count.,
Wear a pollen mask.,
Rinse your sinuses.,
Limit the allergens in your home.,
Keep the humidity between 30-50 percent.,
Purchase mite-proof covers.,
Avoid using certain window treatments.,
Clean bathrooms and the kitchen frequently.,
Use damp cleaning tools.,
Avoid plants and flowers.,
Avoid pet triggers.",How to Fight Hay Fever1," Since pollen is one of the main causes of hay fever reactions, you should monitor the pollen count every day, especially in pollen season. You should try to stay indoors when the pollen count is at its peak. To access the pollen count, you can visit multiple online sources to track what the pollen count is every day..


Most local television weather forecasts also include pollen counts. The reports will usually state if the pollen count is low, moderate, medium, or high. Make sure you avoid going out if the count is said to be high.
If you are extremely sensitive and highly allergic to pollen, you may consider staying indoors even if the count is moderate.You can talk to your doctor about your susceptibility to pollen.;
, If you plan on doing yard work, you should use a pollen mask, such as the NIOSH-rated 95 filter mask. This includes activities such as mowing the lawn, raking leaves, or gardening. These kinds of masks can be purchased online or at the local pharmacy.


If a N95 mask is not available, you can use ordinary surgical mask or a handkerchief. These will not filter the air as much as the N95 mask, but will prevent some of the pollen from being inhaled and landing on your nose.If your allergy is severe, consider having someone else mow your lawn.
You can also wear glasses or sunglasses to avoid getting the allergens in your eyes. Your regular glasses or sunglasses should be sufficient, but you can also purchase safety glasses in a hardware store or online.
When you come in from outside, take a shower and wash your clothes. If this cannot be done right away, wash your face and change your clothes until you can.

, An inexpensive method to relieve hay fever symptoms is to rise your nasal passages using a neti pot or saline flush. A saline flush is easier to use since it only requires spraying each nostril with the saline solution. Neti pots, on the other hand, require you to mix your own saline solution.


If you choose this method, you can make your own saline solution by mixing 3 teaspoons of iodine free salt and 1 teaspoon of baking soda. Next, add 1 teaspoon of this mixture to 1 cup or 8 ounces of lukewarm distilled or bottled water. Do not use tap water unless it has been boiled.
Make sure you rinse the irrigation device after each use with distilled or bottled water and leave it to air-dry. This helps prevent bacterial growth., If you want to keep outside allergens out of your home, you should close your windows and turn on the air conditioner in your house and car, especially with pollen counts are high. Make sure the AC units have been cleaned prior to use and purchase HEPA filters specifically designed for the unit you own.


Refer to the manufacturer's instructions or the store where you purchased the unit to find out what filter to use.
If possible, use vacuums with HEPA filters as well. The HEPA filters traps allergens as the vacuum suctions the air and surrounding dust particles. Refer to the manufacturer's instructions on when to replace them, though they are usually replaced after a couple of uses., In your home, you should keep the humidity levels between 30-50% to limit your exposure to mold. You should get a hygrometer to measure each room's humidity. You just place the device in a room and it reads the humidity levels in the room much like a thermometer reads temperature.You can purchase this device online or in stores. Read manufacturer’s instruction on how to operate it properly prior to use.

, To help cut down on allergens in your fabrics and on your furniture, you should buy cover for your pillows, mattresses, comforters, and duvets that are mite-proof. This will help cut down on mite and allergen transference onto the fabrics, which will keep your hay fever at bay.


You should wash your bedding and covers frequently in hot water. You may want to reduce the amount of pillows, blankets, or stuffed animals in you or your child's room.

, There are certain kinds of window treatments that can draw pollen and mold into your house as well as accumulate dust. Heavy draperies and dry clean only materials attract more dust and allergens compared to easy to vacuum or machine washable draperies. You can use synthetic blinds as well because they are easy to wipe and clean.


Do not hang clothes outside to dry since allergens would gather on the clothes., Mold is another major trigger for hay fever. To cut down on mold accumulation in your home, you should clean your bathrooms and kitchen frequently so mold or mildew will not grow there. You can use cleaning solutions with bleach because it will kill the mold and other allergens in these areas.


You can also make your own bleach solution by mixing 1/2 cup bleach with 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water., When you are cleaning your house, you should use tools that are damp in order to capture the most amount of allergens and dust particles in your home. You should dampen your dust cloths, the mop, and the broom whenever you clean your home.


This is much more effective to keep dust from spreading compared to dry-dusting and sweeping., Since pollen is a hay fever trigger, you should avoid having live plants in your home.Instead, purchase fake flowers or green plants to liven up your living spaces. These will help brighten up your living areas without contributing pollen to the air in your house.


Although there are some artificial plants that look fake, you can find some that look real. Try to get plants that look as real as possible so they don't call too much attention to the fact that they are fake.

, There are many ways you can avoid pet triggers. If you know that you are allergic to a certain kind of animal, avoid getting one of those animals as a pet. If you are allergic to all pet dander, keep your pets outside instead of inside your house. If this isn't possible, try to keep them our of your bedroom so you don't have to breath the dander in at night. You should also obtain an air purifier with HEPA filter and situate it in the areas where the pet spends most of her time.


If you come into contact with a pet, wash your hands afterward to remove the dander.If possible, take out wall-to-wall carpeting because carpet holds in the pet dander. If this is not possible, vacuum often to prevent the accumulation of pet dander or fur. Many vacuum cleaners come with special attachments or filters to reduce pet fur and dander.
You should groom and bathe your pets at least weekly to prevent excessive shedding. It is best if you let someone else bathe the animal so you do not react to all the dander and fur.Some dogs or cats are known to be 'hypoallergenic', which means they are less likely to cause allergies. These may be a good choice for you if you really want a pet.

Get a scratch test.,
Take an intradermal test.,
Take a blood test.",How to Fight Hay Fever2," If you have tried to eliminate all of the factors in your life that might contain triggers such as pollen, mold, and dust, but you still have problems, you need to see an allergist. She can run tests to determine the cause of your hay fever. One of the most popular test is a skin test called the scratch, or prick, test. This test lasts for 10 to 20 minutes and involves administering tiny drops of samples of possible allergens on pricked or scratched skin. The nurse will observe the sites for reactions on the skin.


Some reactions are immediate. If there is an allergic reaction, the skin where a specific allergen was applied will become raised and will look like a mosquito bite.
The nurse will measure and note the reaction and the doctor will interpret the results., Your allergist may also perform a skin test called the intradermal test. Instead of putting the allergen on scratched or pricked skin, the allergens are injected under the skin by your doctor with a thin needle. This test is typically more sensitive than the scratch test.


This test lasts for about 20 minutes., To further solidify the skin test results, your allergist may also run a blood test, called radioallergosorbent test (RAST). The RAST measures the amount of allergy-causing antibodies in your bloodstream, known as immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies. This tells the doctor which allergens your body is reacting to by the breakdown of the antibodies in your blood.


The results of this test usually take a few days to come back since the blood sample is sent to a laboratory for processing."
"
Take nasal corticosteroids.,
Use antihistamines.,
Consider decongestants.,
Ask your allergist about leukotriene modifiers.,
Try Atrovent.,
Use oral corticosteroid.,
Get an allergy shot.",How to Fight Hay Fever3," If avoiding triggers is not possible, easing the symptoms is the next best thing to do in order to fight hay fever. You can take nasal corticosteroids. They prevent and treat the nasal inflammation, nasal itching, and runny nose caused by hay fever. These are usually safe long-term treatment options for most people. Side effects can include an unpleasant smell or taste and nose irritation, but the effects are rare.


Some of these medications need to be prescribed by your doctor, but a few are now available over-the-counter. They usually work best when taken every day, at least during the seasons or times when you are likely to have allergy symptoms. Check with your doctor or pharmacist to figure out which is a good choice for you.
Popular brands include Flonase, Nasacort AQ, Nasonex, and Rhinocort., You can also take antihistamines to help with your hay fever symptoms. This medication can come in pill, oral, liquid, chewable, melt away, nasal spray, and eye drop forms. They help with itching, sneezing, and runny nose by blocking histamine, which is a chemical released by your immune system that also cause the signs and symptoms of hay fever. The pills and nasal sprays can relieve nasal symptoms while the eye drops help relieve eye itchiness and eye irritation caused by hay fever.


Examples of oral antihistamines include Claritin, Alavert, Zyrtec Allergy, Allegra and Benadryl. You can also get prescription antihistamine nasal sprays such as Astelin, Astepro, and Patanase.Do not consume alcohol and tranquilizers when taking antihistamines.
Do not use or combine more than one antihistamine unless they are prescribed to you by your doctor or allergist.
Avoid using heavy machinery, and use caution driving when taking antihistamines. Avoid taking sedating antihistamines if you will be driving. Most people can safely drive if they are taking non or low-sedating antihistamines, such as Zyrtec, Allegra, and Claritin., You can get decongestants as over the counter medications such as Sudafed and Drixoral. You can also get them as prescription liquids, pills, or nasal sprays. There are many oral decongestant prescriptions you can get, but be warned they can cause increased blood pressure, insomnia, irritability, and headache.


Decongestants should only be used temporarily and not every day.
Decongestant nasal sprays include Neo-Synephrine and Afrin. You should not use these for more than two or three days at a time because they can actually worsen your congestion., The leukotriene modifier also known as Singulair is a controller medication and should be taken before any symptoms occur. It may also reduce asthma symptoms. A common side effect is headache, but in rare occasions, it has been linked to psychological reactions, such as agitation, aggression, hallucinations, depression, and suicidal thinking.


This medication comes in tablet form.
It is important that you seek medical advice right away for any unusual psychological reaction you notice while on this medication., Atrovent, also called nasal ipratropium, is a prescription nasal spray that helps relieve a severe runny nose. Some side effects include nasal dryness, nosebleeds, and a sore throat. However, rare side-effects include blurred vision, dizziness, and difficult urination.


People with glaucoma and an enlarged prostate should not use this drug., This medication, also known as prednisone, is sometimes used to relieve severe allergy symptoms. However, you must be cautious when using this medication since long-term use can cause serious side effects such as cataracts, osteoporosis, and muscle weakness.


This drug is only prescribed for a short period of time and may require tapering doses.

, If your hay fever allergic reactions do not respond to other medications, and you cannot avoid exposure to the allergens, your doctor may recommend allergy shots, also known as immunotherapy. Instead of fighting the allergic reactions, the shots instead change the immune system to stop reacting to the allergens. The shots consist of diluted allergy extract which are administered frequently in increasing doses until a dose is found that helps you maintain your allergies. These are then given with larger time periods in between. The series of shots take place over a period of three to five years.


The goal with this medication is for your body to get used to the allergens causing the allergic reactions so you will eventually not react to them anymore.The allergy shots safe with very small side effects. The most common is redness or swelling at the injection site, and can happen right away or within the first few hours. These should go away within 24 hours of the injection. You can also get mild allergic reactions similar to those you normally suffer from because of your hay fever.
In rare cases, you can have a severe allergic reaction the first time you get the shot and again with later doses. Patients are always monitored when they get allergy shots. The symptoms of a severe reaction, known as anaphylaxis, include wheezing or difficulty breathing, hives or swelling of the face or body, irregular or rapid heart beat, throat or chest tightness, dizziness, loss of consciousness, and in extremely severe cases, death.
If you experience any of these severe reactions, call 911 and seek medical attention immediately."

Explain the basics of a gluten sensitivity.,
Talk about the benefits of a gluten-free diet.,
Explain gluten-free food is real food.,
Talk to your child about alternatives to traditional foods.,
Explain a gluten sensitivity does not make them less capable.",How to Explain a Gluten Sensitivity to a Child1," Start with the very basics of what a gluten sensitivity is, using simple terms. Tell your child something like, ""A gluten sensitivity means someone's body cannot process gluten. When people with a gluten sensitivity eat gluten, it makes them sick."" This is a very basic explanation of the disease that a child should be able to understand.Make sure your child understands what gluten is, as many people don't know. Tell your child gluten is a protein found in wheat. Explain which foods contain gluten throughout the day. For example, if you're making toast, stop and say something like, ""See, bread has gluten in it, which is why we're using gluten-free bread."";
, If your child needs a gluten-free diet, or if someone in your household does, make sure your child understands the benefits. This will make them see gluten-free foods as a positive, rather than a burden. Explain that, with a gluten sensitivity, foods can cause symptoms like headaches, joint pain, numbness, and difficulty concentrating. Cutting out foods that cause these symptoms will reduce them, so a gluten-free diet is always a positive for someone with a gluten sensitivity.If your child is gluten-free, talk about their diet in as positive terms as possible. For example, ""You were sick a lot before and this will make you better. This is a good thing that will help you thrive.""

, If your child is gluten sensitive, they feel like they're missing out on ""real food"" as other children are free to snack on popular wheat-based items. Gluten-based foods often feel like the normal versions, making gluten-free options abnormal. Help your child understand that gluten-free food is just as good as any other food.For example, say something like, ""The bread you eat is the same as any other bread, but it just happens to be gluten-free. Most people couldn't even taste the difference.""
A great way to help your child accept their gluten sensitivity is to occasionally make gluten-free dinners for the whole family. If your child sees that their siblings enjoy gluten-free pizza too, for example, they will not feel like they're missing out.

, If your child is gluten-free, emphasize opportunities over limitation. Say something like, ""We'll just have to find some fun new foods to enjoy. You'll get to try a lot of new things.""Talk about gluten-free foods in positive terms. For example, say something like, ""I got some good cookies for you at the store"" instead of ""I got some gluten-free cookies."" This helps your child think of their food as fun and exciting rather than limiting.
Use simple language that communicates important details without harsh words. For example, rather than saying a food is ""dangerous"" or ""destructive"" for your child's body, use words like ""yucky"" or ""sad foods.""
If your child has restaurants they love, see if they offer gluten-free dishes. You can get your child excited about their new diet by saying something like, ""Now, we get to try all kinds of new things at all your favorite restaurants.""

, Children sometimes have a tendency to see medical issues, including food allergies, as evidence they are not as capable or strong as others. Make sure your child knows that, while they can't eat the same food as their peers, they are still just as capable. When treated properly, a gluten sensitivity should not be limiting.Let children know that a gluten sensitivity does not fundamentally change who they are. Your child will still be able to engage in the same activities as any other kid, but they will simply have to monitor their diet a little more.

Make learning fun with games and tools.,
Present your child with age-appropriate information.,
Seek help via social media.,
Find gluten free camps in your area.,
Find a support group.,
Present your child with material that helps them value differences.",How to Explain a Gluten Sensitivity to a Child2," By having fun learning about the digestive system at a young age, your child will be able to better identify the parts of the body affected by gluten sensitivities. They will also develop a stronger understanding of some of the terminology that is used when discussing the effects that a gluten sensitivity can have on the body. Talk to your doctor about visual aids that can help a child understand their gluten sensitivity.


Consider purchasing a book for your child such as Bagels, Buddy and Me by Melanie Krumrey to help them understand gluten sensitivity or Celiac's disease.
Turn the learning experience into a game. Quiz your child and offer rewards for correct answers. Print out a diagram and have them label the body parts that may be affected by a gluten sensitivity. Have a word bank with words such as ""headache,"" ""cramps"" or ""hives"" and have your child write these words on the body where the symptoms would occur.

, Talk to your doctor about age-appropriate information that can help explain a gluten sensitivity in terms your child can understand. You can also look online. Online support groups for families with gluten-free children may offer pamphlets, reading recommendations, and other materials to help your child understand and cope with a gluten sensitivity.Educate yourself as much as possible as well. Read up on your child's condition and ask your pediatrician any questions you have. This way, you'll be better equipped to discuss a gluten sensitivity with your child.

, Websites like Facebook and Twitter can actually provide support for gluten-sensitive children. Look for Facebook groups designed for gluten-free families and Twitter accounts that post informative content about gluten intolerances and gluten-free living. These kinds of websites can provide very useful information, such as gluten-free recipes., Some areas have gluten-free camps where children meet others with a gluten intolerance. This can be an invaluable opportunity for your child to meet others with a gluten intolerance. Children will feel less alone when they interact with peers with similar food restrictions.In the United States, for example, there are gluten-free camps in Texas, Michigan, California, Rhode Island, North Carolina, and Rhode Island.
Check when registration begins for gluten-free camps and register as soon as possible. Slots often fill up fast.

, Ask about support groups at your local hospital or doctor's office. Your doctor may be able to point you in the direction of a support group for gluten-free children and their families. If you cannot find a support group in your area, there are many support groups online where you can share stories and information with other gluten-free families., If your child is gluten sensitive, they may feel different from others. However, emphasize that differences are not always bad. Instead of framing things in a negative light, encourage children to be imaginative and embrace their differences. A great book for children with Celiac's disease or a gluten sensitivity is the The Adventures of Celia Kaye, which is about how a girl with Celiac's diseases uses her imagination to explain the issue to others. This is a great book to make children with gluten sensitivities feel positive about themselves. You can also talk to a librarian about books about differences in general, not just differences related to food and eating. This can help your child value being unique in general, which may help them cope with a gluten sensitivity.

Throw a gluten-free party.,
Teach your child how to talk about their allergy.,
Discuss the issue with other adults.",How to Explain a Gluten Sensitivity to a Child3," Children do not have to feel like it's a burden to tell other children about their gluten sensitivity. Allow them to do so in a fun manner. Have your child invite their friends over and have a party where they serve gluten-free food. This can show other children how gluten-free options can be just as tasty as foods with gluten and allow your child to socialize with others while navigating their gluten sensitivity.If your child's school has Show and Tell, have your child bring gluten-free snacks and explain their sensitivity then.

, Keep the dialogue open when it comes to discussing gluten sensitivity and let your child know they can always come to you with questions. Provide your child with reading material that explains their sensitivity in simple terms so they can talk to other children and adults about the issue.It can be helpful to give your children specific phrases and sentences to use to explain their sensitivity in kid-friendly terms. For example, teach your child to say things like, ""I can't eat foods like that because they don't agree with my body.""
You can also encourage your child to share what their diet is like instead. For example, ""We don't get pizza from that place, because it has gluten, but there's a great gluten-free pizza place we go to instead.""

, It's important your child has advocates in their school and extracurricular activities. If your child is gluten free, talk to people like coaches, teachers, and other parents. Make sure these adults understand the condition as well. In the event your child struggles to explain their sensitivity to others, there should always be an adult nearby to step in and clarify."

Decide if you want to have a backyard or windowsill garden.,
Decide how many plants you would like to grow.,
Consult with local gardeners about what grows well in your region.,
Decide if you want to plant from seeds or seedlings (starts).",How to Plant a Medicinal Herb Garden1," If you choose to plant a windowsill garden, you will have less space and soil to work with because you will need to grow each plant in a pot. If you want a traditional yard garden, you will need to till soil in your lawn in order to plant the herbs directly in the ground.;
, It is a good idea to start with 4 or 5 and expand after you have used your herbs medicinally and know what you will need. The following are plants that are often found in medicinal herb gardens:


Grow echinacea. Both the E. purpurea and E. angustifolia types are sold in nurseries and used in tinctures and teas to boost the immune system. Both the root and the flowers are valued for their medicinal properties.
Grow chamomile. The chamomile plant may be referred to as matricaria recutita, M. chamomilla or chamomilla recutita. The flowers are used in teas to treat muscle spasm, inflammation and tension. You can dry the flowers after they are picked and plant them in enough soil so they will self-sow for the next year.
Grow Yarrow. Yarrow, or achillea millefolium, is a flower in the aster family. Its leaves and flowers are used to staunch blood flow in cuts and minor bleeding. It can be dried for that purpose or made into tea to treat colds.
Grow lemon balm. Lemon balm, or melissa officinalis, is used to treat insomnia, anxiety and problems with the digestive tract. Lemon balm leaves can be dried and made into a tasty tea.
Grow peppermint. Peppermint, or mentha piperita, is a hybrid mint plant. The menthol oil results in the flavor and also makes it a good treatment for nausea, muscle spasms and fever. Peppermint should be grown in pots because it can be invasive. Harvest leaves for tea.
Other good medicinal options include valerian for nerve relaxation, feverfew for pains and fevers, comfrey for a wound poultice, violets for colds or sore throats, black cohosh for female cramps or asthma, hyssop for congestion, St. John's Wort for depression and gingko biloba for increased brain circulation and memory.

, The warmth and moisture in your area will have a lot to do with what will be successful in your herb garden. If you live in a colder area, you may be able to plant certain herbs on the windowsill and others in an outside garden during the summer.

, Seeds are a less expensive option, but seedlings are more likely to make it through the fragile first few weeks of being planted. Seasoned gardeners, and especially those with greenhouses, may want to start with seeds.

"
"
Buy pots for the most invasive species of medicinal herbs.,
Create well-drained soil.,
Place most plants in direct sunlight.,
Place high-quality potting soil approximately three-fourths the way into your container before planting seeds.,
Water immediately after planting seeds or starts.,
Harvest the plants according to package directions.,
Many seasonal herbs require you to dry them before use.",How to Plant a Medicinal Herb Garden2," This includes peppermint, comfrey and yarrow. Invasive species can take over your garden in a year or 2, killing other plants as they fight for the same nutrients.

, If you are planting in pots or other containers, make sure to add some gravel on the bottom to be sure the roots of your plants don't rot. If you are planting directly into the ground, most natural soil will drain through, leaving the roots safe from too much water.

, Most herbs require 6 hours of sunlight per day to grow. Exceptions include violet and lemon balm, but check all plant directions from a gardening book or seed packet before planting, if you are unsure.

, If you are planting starts in a garden, dig holes in the soil with a stick so that you can fully cover the roots, leaving just the stems above the soil. Pack the remaining 1/4th with potting soil after you plant the seeds.

, Keep the soil moist around the plant, but do not over water. You can water delicate seedlings with a spray bottle., Many herbs can be harvested continuously, but some flower plants may be harvested only once or twice per season. Harvesting encourages new growth on many herbs, so water immediately after harvesting.

, Depending upon the climate of your house, you can use a warm, dry and dark room to dry them or use a dehydrator. Store them in tins away from sunlight and air.

Discuss other remedies that might work for you if you are unable to use herbs.;
, This is the same thing that over the counter drugs with antihistamines do.

, A member of the daisy family, this herb comes from Europe and can be taken in tablet form.


Look for Butterbur tablets online or in retailers based in European countries. It can be hard to find in the United States.
Take a tablet 4 times a day to get the same result as an over the counter antihistamine. A study published in The British Medical Journal reports that the effects are the same, without any drowsiness.

, It is inexpensive and can be purchased online or in health food stores all over the world.


Look for nettles that are available in a tincture made from fresh or freeze dried nettle leaves. Using 2 to 4 mL (0.4 to 0.8 tsp.) 3 times per day will help relieve symptoms. You can also find it in a capsule form.
Wait 2 or 3 days if the nettles are not immediately effective. It often takes a few days for them to start working.

, Goldenseal (Hydrastis canadensis) is also called orange-root and it grows wild in Canada and the United States.


Drink the tonic after applying a saline nasal spray to your nose for best results. The saline will clear out congestion and the Goldenseal will use its astringent and antibiotic properties to help rid the nasal passages of pollen.

, This herb is native to colder regions in the northern hemisphere but can be found in many health food stores and through homeopathic retailers.


Add a 1/2 tsp. (2.4 mL) to a cup of hot water to make a tea. This herb will help the body block antibodies that cause allergies.

, The licorice root is a plant used to flavor foods, drinks and tobacco and it also decreases inflammation and allergic reactions.


Take only moderate amounts of licorice, as directed by your doctor. Too much of this herb can cause high blood pressure and drain your body of its potassium reserves.

Contact your doctor.,
Purchase an ozone generator.,
Place the oil in a glass jar.,
Connect the jar to the machine and turn it on.,
Look for bubbles in the oil.,
Let the oil ozonate for an extended period of time.,
Store the oil in the refrigerator.",How to Ozonate Olive Oil1," If you are suffering from a medical condition and believe that ozonated olive oil may help, be sure to talk to your doctor before you begin any self-treatment. When inhaled, ozone can cause serious health problems and should generally be avoided. If you suffer from a respiratory condition like asthma, avoid using any type of ozone generator.Follow your doctor’s recommendation for treating any ailments.;
, If you want to create ozonated olive oil, you will need to buy an ozone generator. You can purchase a machine designed specifically for creating ozonated olive oil. If you already own a generator or want to ozonate other things, you can also buy the individual parts. Check online and find a machine and parts that meet your needs.If you purchase the individual parts, you will need an ozone generator, an aerator, and a glass jar.
Purchase a generator that creates ozone through corona discharge or cold plasma. Ultraviolet machines are not strong enough to ozonate olive oil.

, Place about 8oz (237mL) of olive oil in a glass jar or the container that came with your machine. If you are using your own jar, be sure to pick one that can be sealed with a lid. Avoid using plastic containers that can contaminate your oil during ozonation.If you are using a machine designed specifically for ozonating oils, follow the manufacturer’s instructions.

, Once you have the oil in the jar, you can connect it to the machine. If you are using your own setup, insert the aerator hose into the oil. Once the oil container and the generator are connected, turn on the machine., As it is ozonated, bubbles will appear in the oil. These should be tiny bubbles, which facilitate the process of ozonation. Large bubbles will not allow the transfer of ozone into the oil. If your machine is producing big bubbles, contact the manufacturer.You can also purchase an glass ozone bubbler that will ensure the creation of small bubbles.

, Depending on your machine and how concentrated you want your ozonated salve, the ozonation process can take anywhere from one hour to three weeks. If you are using an all-in-one ozone generator, follow the manufacturer’s guidelines.If your oil still has color to it and is runny, it is not done with ozonation. Ozonated olive oil should be clear and gel-like.

, Once your oil is ozonated, cover it with a lid and place it in your refrigerator. After being stored in the refrigerator, your ozonated olive oil should be good for up to 30 days. You can also store it in your freezer for up to a year."

Check to see if the product is clear.,
Feel the viscosity of the oil.,
Make sure it smells like ozone.",How to Ozonate Olive Oil2," When making your ozonated olive oil or purchasing it from a manufacturer, it is important to check the oil’s color. Olive oil that has been properly ozonated will be clear. The final product should be the same opacity as water.If you are making ozonated oil yourself, let the mixture ozonate until it is completely clear. Because various machines take wildly different amounts of time to make ozonated olive oil, be sure to regularly check on the color of your oil.
Avoid buying any ozonated oils that are colored. The manufacturer may have added a dye to the oil, which might irritate your skin, or is hiding the fact that the oil is only partially ozonated.

, Properly ozonated oil should become denser during the process. The finished product should have a gel-like consistency, as opposed to the more liquid state of the original oil. It may also become slightly stickier.Regularly check the viscosity of your oil if you are making it yourself.
If you can, be sure to test the viscosity of commercial oils to ensure that the product is fully ozonated.

, Ozone and ozonated products have a distinct smell that many liken to chlorine. A fully ozonated oil should smell strongly of ozone. If you are unsure about the ozonation state of your oil, try smelling it to see if it smells like ozone.Be careful when inhaling ozone. It can be dangerous for people who suffer from asthma or have lung conditions.
Because some people find the smell off-putting, manufacturers of ozonated olive oil often add a scent to the oil in order to mask the ozone.

Simply dab a small amount of oil on the wound with a cotton swab. There is some evidence that the ozone in the oil may kill the microorganisms that can cause infection and facilitate healing.For serious wounds, seek immediate medical treatment.
If the wound becomes infected, visit your doctor.

, If you are experiencing skin aliments like acne or athlete’s foot, the anti-bacterial and anti-fungal properties of ozonated olive oil may help. Wash the skin around the affected area and apply the oil. To properly combat these skin conditions, you will likely need to repeat this process daily or until your skin heals.Consult your doctor before applying ozonated olive oil to your skin.

, Because of its believed anti-bacterial properties, ozonated olive oil may help eliminate body odor. Daily application of the oil to the armpits and other stinky areas may kill the bacteria that cause body odor. For best results, use in tandem with frequent bathing.Consult your doctor before using ozonated olive oil as a deodorant.

, If you suffer from an infection of your gums, a light application of ozonated olive oil may clean the wound. Use a cotton swab to apply the oil to the affected areas.

Remove the pitch carefully from skin and clothing.,
Wash your hands throughout the process.",How to Make Pine Pitch Salve," If you live in a rural area, you can get pine pitch straight off of trees. You can see pine pitch oozing out of the bark of pine trees, as pitch is used to heal wounds and keep bark strong.Use your hands on a small container to harvest pitch. Gently peel off pitch that's oozing out of a tree and place it in your container. Keep gathering pitch until you have about a third of a jar's worth.
As trees need pitch for their own care, do not take too much from any one tree. Harvest a small amount of pitch from various trees until you have enough to make salve.;
, In some cases, you may end up with bits of pine pitch that are in hard chunks. Separate these chunks from the more liquid-like pine pitch and then break down the chunks by hand.Break the hard chunks into small pieces. The smaller the pieces, the quicker the chunks will break down when you're making your salve.

, Once your pitch is gathered and prepared, take a mason jar. Take a jar that is large enough to make the amount of salve you want. Fill it about a third of the way full with pitch.Make sure to use a jar you do not intend to use again. Pine pitch is very sticky and you cannot reuse the jar after using it to make salve.

, You can use any type of organic plant oil that you want. You can, for example, use olive oil, coconut oil, grapeseed oil, or any other organic plant out. Fill the jar the rest of the way with organic plant oil.You should aim for a ratio of roughly one part pitch and two parts plant oil.

, Take a large pot and place a piece of cheese cloth or an old cloth on the bottom of the pan. Set your jar on top of this. Fill your pot with about 2 to 3 inches of water, making sure not to cover the jar., Place the water on the stove. Allow the water to warm up over low heat. Do not allow the water to boil. You just want the water to get warm., Keep the water temperature warm by leaving your pot on the heat. Allow the pot to sit for three to four hours. On occasion, remove the jar from the water and shake it to mix it., After the first three to four hours have passed, remove the pot from the heat. Cover the pot and jar with a cloth and allow it to sit covered for an addition one to three hours., Again, warm the jar in water over low heat. Allow it to sit for three to four hours, shaking the jar on occasion. After repeating the process, remove the pot from the heat. Cover your jar and pot and allow it to sit overnight.Place your pot and jar out of reach of children and pets. You do not want it disturbed overnight.

, Every day for three days, repeat the same process. Warm your water over low heat and allow the jar to sit in it. Shake it on occasion to mix the ingredients. Set it off the heat, covered, for one to three hours. Repeat the warning process once and let the jar and pot sit covered overnight., After three days have passed, the solid parts of the pine pitch will settle on the bottom of the jar. At this point, you can add beeswax to the mixture. Just pour it on top of the mixture and then heat everything up together.You should add one to two ounces of beeswax for every eight ounces of oil you used.
Melt the beeswax into the oil by placing the jar in warm water again. Once melted, you can remove your salve from the heat and store it in tins and jars in a cool, dry part of your home.

, Making pine salve is a very messy process. Before you begin, you should cover your work surface. Lay down paper towels, plastic sheets, and other protective covering to keep the mess in check., Pitch will get suck to skin and clothing when you gather it and as you're making your salve. Make sure to remove it carefully when this issue arises.Butter, lip balm, and sunscreen can remove pitch from your skin.

, There is not a lot of information on essential oils and pregnancy, so most healthcare providers advise that women err on the side of caution. It's best to avoid essential oils altogether during pregnancy. However, if you want to use aromatherapy anyway, stick to something like a bath, and only use a couple of drops of essential oils. Ingesting essential oils, or applying them directly to the skin, should be avoided.Parsley seed and pennyroyal oils may be particularly dangerous during pregnancy.

Lay down in a dark, cool room.",How to Use Aromatherapy for Headaches," Peppermint, eucalyptus, rosemary and sandalwood are oils recommended to best fight a headache. Chamomile is known for its pain relieving and muscle relaxing properties. Lavender is also a mighty pain reliever and anti-inflammatory. As each plant has a different effect on the body, if one plant type does not work to get rid of your headache, use a different one or a blend of two to find the most effective remedy for you.;
, Aromatherapy goes far deeper into the healing qualities of plants than just their scent. As the oils soak into the skin, they begin to heal in many ways, both physically and psychologically. When using essential oils on your skin, always mix it with a carrier oil. Essential oils, on their own, can burn the skin. Almond oil, avocado, coconut, apricot kernel and sesame oils are commonly used carrier oils.


Mix a small amount for immediate use. You can place a few drops of carrier oil with a drop of essential oil in the palm of your hand, mix the 2 with your fingertip or rub your hands together and apply the mix to the affected part of the body.






Combine the oils ahead of time. Dilute the essential oil in a bottle with your carrier oil to have on hand for when you need it. A good recipe for massage is 12 drops of essential oil and a tablespoon of carrier oil or unscented lotion.







, For your headache, apply the essential oil at one or some of the key points of your body that are effected by the pain. Rub the oils into your temples, scalp, around the base of your scalp and neck and down onto your shoulders.


Make a compress. Place a few drops of the oil onto a warm or cold cloth to make a compress for your head or neck. You can also wet the cloth with a mix or 2 cups hot or cold water with 10 drops of oil.






Add about 8 drops of the oil to a warm bath so you can bask in the healing properties. Soak in the bath for 15 - 30 minutes.







,

Place water in an aroma lamp with about 12 drops of essential oil. Light the candle underneath to heat up the mixture and surround yourself with the healing scent.






Drop a few drops of the healing mixture onto your pillow so you can be breathing in the health benefits of the plants while you sleep.






Place the oils in a diffuser. Run the machine up to three times a day for 15 - 20 minutes each time.






Inhale the oils to get rid of your headache. Fill a large bowl with hot water. Place 3 - 5 drops of essential oil in the bowl. With a towel over your head, lean over the bowl and breathe in the steam for five minutes.







, Hold your finger on the open top, tilt it to wet your fingertip; that's all you'll need.


Alternatively, use 1 drop in a tablespoon of carrier oil; grapeseed or olive oils are best.

, Do this at the base of your skull, where your spine and neck join.

, Close your eyes. Give yourself a good five to ten minutes, then see how your migraine feels.

Know roughly when the headaches happened, how long they typically occur, and whether the headaches are of the same variety.There are different types of headaches, and treatment varies from type to type. Cluster headaches come in groups are accompanied by cold like symptoms. Migraines are often associated with vomiting and abdominal pain and sensitivity to light and sounds. Tension headaches often include pain in the neck and shoulders. Document all your child's symptoms to get a sense of which type of headache she's experiencing.Children, especially young children, often have trouble explaining their symptoms. Ask your child leading questions, like ""Where does it hurt?"" and ""Can you point to where the pain is?"", Oftentimes, children complain of headaches or other ailments when experience of depression, anxiety, and other mental health issues. Children typically lack the vocabulary to explain mental health issues, and seek out comfort by complaining of physical ailments.


A real headache in a child is easy to spot. A child suffering from a legitimate headache will generally be quiet and want to sit or lie down. They might fall asleep and will avoid exerting themselves in any way. Light and noise will bother them and they may experience stomach related issues, like nausea.If your child does not display typical symptoms of a headache but complains of them frequently, she may be having a mental health issue. Talk to your pediatrician about your concerns. Your doctor should be able to talk to your child about her emotional health in a manner she understand and can refer a therapist if necessary., While headaches are typically not a sign of serious illness, you should watch for certain symptoms. Seek medical care if your child experiences any of the following:


Headaches strong enough to wake a child from sleep
Early morning vomiting, especially in the absence of other symptoms
Personality changes
Worsening headaches that increase in frequency
Headaches that follow an injury
Headaches accompanied by a stiff neck, Dehydration can cause many symptoms, including recurrent headaches. In order to prevent headaches in your child, make sure she's getting adequate water throughout the day.


A child should get roughly 4 eight ounce glasses of water each day. Your child might need more, however, if she is particularly physically active.Avoid caffeinated and sugary beverages. Not only will they discourage children from simply drinking water, they can dehydrate your child. Heavy sugar or caffeine intake have also been linked to headaches., Children need plenty of rest, which is why nap time is often an important part of a child's routine. Inadequate sleep can result in headaches.


Depending on the age of your child, he will need different amounts of sleep each night. Toddlers and pre-schoolers need 11 to 13 hours of sleep. Children from ages 6 to 13 need 9 to 11 hours each night.Set a bed time for you child, if you do not already have one, and make sure she gets up around the same time each day., Sometimes, hunger can trigger headaches. Make sure you do not wait too long between meals.


Dips in blood sugar associated with missing meals can trigger headaches. Make sure your child eats breakfast before leaving for school. Children can be sometimes be stubborn about school lunches and discard unwanted items. If your child has been missing lunch, consider packing a lunch for her so you know she will eat.Children often go through phases where they do not want to eat, particularly in toddlerhood. Establishing a strict mealtime routine and prohibiting distractions like toys and TV during meal times can help encourage your child to eat. If you keep having problems, talk to your pediatrician to rule out underlying medical concerns.Provide nutritious snacks between meals, like fruit, whole wheat crackers, yogurt, cheese, and veggies.

, Common causes of headaches in children include:


Allergies
A sinus infection
problems with their vision

Avoid staying with your child while he/she goes to sleep.,
Provide your child with transitional objects.,
Design a special sleep pillow for your child.,
Stay (mostly) consistent on the weekends.",How to Get Kids to Sleep1," While every child is different, and while every child will go through occasional periods where they need more or less sleep, there are general guidelines for how much sleep your child needs depending upon his/her age. Once you figure out the number of hours you should be aiming for, work backwards from the time they have to wake up so that you can pinpoint their ideal bedtime.


Toddlers (1-3) typically need 12-14 hours of sleep in a 24-hour period, some of which may be taken up with naps.Preschoolers (3-5) may be phasing out naps, but still usually need a good 11 to 13 hours of sleep each night.Grade-schoolers (5-12) will function best with 10 to 11 hours of sleep.
Teenagers (13 and up) still need quite a lot of sleep, and should try to get at least 9 to 9 ½ hours of sleep each night.;
, Consistency and predictability is key for children of all ages, so you'll want to be sure to create a clear time-table that your child knows you will stick to in the evening.


Decide when homework will be completed, when your child will bathe, by what time they need to be pajamas, and when your bedtime routine (stories, songs, etc.) will start.

, Your child may adapt better and be more willing to go to bed if he/she feels that some degree of control over the evening activities.


Sit down with him/her to create the calendar together, and have fun creating a poster or chart which outlines the schedule. Then be sure to put the poster in a prominent place (ideally near a clock) where you can together consult it throughout the evening.

, If your older child or teenager is having sleep issues, it may be because his/her internal clocks are shifting. he/she may want to stay up later, and may even be unable to fall asleep at an early time. Even so, if he/she has to be up early for school, he/she needs his/her sleep to be able to function and learn.


Check in regularly with your older child so that you can together adjust his/her schedule as much as possible so that his/her sleep is kept a priority.

, If there's a necessary part of your evening routine that your child hates, consider getting it over with as early as possible so that it doesn't become negatively associated with bedtime.


For example, while taking a warm bath is a relaxing part of many children's nightly routine, your child may hate baths (or showers) with a passion. If so, consider scheduling bath-time right after dinner and before quiet play time, so that your child doesn't have to endure it right before bed.

, Your child will probably be less likely to throw a tantrum over bedtime if you give them adequate warning. This way, they can prepare to switch gears from one activity to the next.For example, give your child a five minute warning before bath-time, and then another five minute warning before you need to head to the bedroom for story-time.

, The appearance of choice can be important to kids of all ages, so even though your schedule is firm, you can still find ways to let your child exert some independence.


For example, after your child has bathed and changed into pajamas, you can ask: “Now what do you want to do? Do you want to pick out your story or your bedtime buddies?”

, Along with your child, come up with a nightly ritual that you can look forward to, and that as you go through it, will signal to your child that sleepytime is around the corner.


For example, perhaps you'll begin by reading two stories while cuddled up, will then sing your favorite lullaby or say your prayers, say your “I-love-you's”, have your good-night kiss, and then lights out.

, As part of your nightly routine, you may want to consider “fixing” your child's room for sleep. For example, you can help arrange all of his/her stuffed animals around the bed, or sprinkle “good dream dust” around the room.


Use your imaginations, and try to find a way to make your child's room and bed feel like a warm, inviting, magical place for sleep.

, If your child is scared of the dark or fears that there may be monsters hiding under his/her bed, you may be able to alleviate his/her worries by concocting a special “monster spray” that you can ritualistically spray around his/her bedroom before lights out.


Little will he/she know that this magical formula is just water in a spray-bottle!

, You may be able to help your child get excited for sleep if you talk together and “plan” out what he/she will dream about: What adventures will he/she go on tonight? Will he/she travel with his/her stuffed animals or friends to Neverland, just like Peter Pan in the story you just read?


Be sure to ask your child about their dreams when he/she wakes up. You may even want to help him/her keep a dream journal that you can write and illustrate together. He/she may be more eager to fall asleep at night if he/she knows he/she will be able to make an entry in his/her journal in the morning.

, While your child may want you to stay with him/her until he/she drifts off, and while you might be tempted to grab a few more quiet cuddles, you could be setting yourself up for trouble if your child becomes dependent upon you in order to be able to fall asleep.


If your child needs you to cuddle, rock, or sing him/her to sleep, he/she won't be able to fall back asleep on their own during the night should then wake up. This is what is sometimes referred to as “sleep-onset association disorder”., Giving your child with a favorite stuffed animal or blanket can be an effective substitute for your presence.Tuck both your child and his/her buddy, toy, or blanket into bed, and then reassure him/her that the toy will help him/her fall asleep.

, Your child may look forward to sleep if you together design a special sleep pillow (or blanket): decorate it with happy, safe thoughts, pictures, or poems.


You can then place a magical “spell” on the pillow that will guarantee your child will have good, fun dreams and restful sleep.

, Overall, it's important to try to stick to as close of a regular sleeping schedule as possible. As a family, you may be tempted move away from your regular bedtime schedule and to sleep in on the weekends.


While your child may need an extra hour or so of sleep on the weekend, letting them sleep in much longer than that could make Sunday night (why won't he/she fall asleep?!) and Monday morning (why won't he/she wake up?!) unbearable."
"
Create white noise.,
Play soothing music for your child.,
Spray lavender on your child's pillow.,
Keep the room dark.,
Find the ideal temperature.,
Keep track of Fido.,
Control the noise in the rest of the house.",How to Get Kids to Sleep2," Some parents report being amazed at the seemingly instant improvement they see in their child's sleep after adding a source of white noise to the room. This can drown out any distractions from the rest of the household or mask any random “scary” noises your child may focus upon when trying to fall asleep, such as the house settling or pipes clanking.


You can purchase white noise machines, download free or cheap white noise apps for a tablet, or even just plug in a simple fan.

, If your child isn't relaxed by the noise of a fan or of oceans waves from a white noise machine, he/she may nonetheless respond well to having soft music played. Search for cd's or music apps that play calming, slow music or lullabies.


Classical, instrumental music is a good choice, but be aware that some longer pieces have louder, more “stressful” movements that could wake your child up.

, Lavender oil has a calming effect and is known to help some sufferers of insomnia.If your child likes the scent, then consider spritzing his/her pillow a lavender mist.


You could also consider putting drops of lavender oil into your child's “monster spray” if you're using that trick, as well.

, In general, it's best for our rooms to be dark when we sleep, and it's especially important to reduce the “blue-light” from electronic devices such as alarm clocks, computers, and phones, which can interrupt natural circadian rhythms.Even so, your child may be uncomfortable sleeping in a completely darkened room. If so, you may want to select a nightlight together.
You can also search for nightlights which turn off after a short period (usually 30-60 minutes). These often project scenes onto the ceiling (stars or favorite cartoon characters). You can place it next to your child's bed so that if he/she wakes up in the night, he/she can easily turn it back on.

, The quality of our sleep is directly affected by the temperature at which we're sleeping. If we're too hot or too cold, our REM sleep (the period during which we're dreaming) can be interrupted.There's no one ideal temperature for all people: some people rest more easily with the temperature turned low, while others prefer it to be slightly toastier.Experiment with turning the temperature up or down depending upon how your child reports feeling, and make sure that your child's pajamas are comfortable as well., Your child may have an easier time falling asleep if you allow the family pet to curl up in (or near) your child's bed. So long as you don't think that Fido's presence is interfering with your child's sleep, this shouldn't be a problem.


You may have to get firm, though, and remove the pet if it looks like it is keeping or waking your child up. Switch out the real pet for a fluffy stuffed-animal substitute, and you should be fine.

, If your child is a light sleeper or can't stand going to bed before older siblings, he/she may be on the alert for noises coming from outside his/her bedroom. Do your best to turn down the volume on televisions, radios, and gaming systems, and if possible, make sure they aren't set up immediately outside your child's bedroom door.


If you have dogs that are prone to barking, try to keep them as far from your child's bedroom as possible, or give them a chew toy or treat to distract them at least until your child is more deeply asleep.
Having a source of white noise or soft music in your child's bedroom can also help block noises from outside his/her room.

Help your child develop self-soothing skills.,
Wait before responding to your child's calls.,
Keep your return visits brief.,
Offer to check in on your child.,
Gently guide your child back to bed if he/she comes out of his room.,
Create a reward system.,
Remain flexible.,
Consult your pediatrician.",How to Get Kids to Sleep3," At various stages in your child's life, he/she may need you more, particularly if he/she struggling with anxiety or nightmares. Even so, he/she will need to learn to soothe and calm himself/herself when you can't be there—for example, on sleepovers.


Work with your child to practice meditation, prayer, or breathing exercises so that he/she can learn to relax on his/her own, and hopefully fall asleep by himself/herself.While it's a good idea to practice these soothing techniques regularly (and during the daytime), practice with his/her before bedtime, and remind his/her to try them out if he/she wakes up during the night.

, If your child wakes up during the night—or calls out to you shortly after you've put him/her down—avoid running into the room immediately.It's possible that if you wait a few moments, your child will drift back to sleep by himself/herself.

, If your child doesn't fall back to sleep, you needn't feel as though you must ignore his/her calls for you. Return to his/her room, tuck him/her back in while reminding him that it's time for sleep, give him/her a quick hug and kiss, and then leave.

, Your child may be reassured if you promise to check in after a few minutes—perhaps 5 or ten. That's only a short time he/she will have to be alone, and if he/she can trust that you'll return, he/she may relax enough to fall back asleep.


Be sure to actually follow through and check in. If he/she is asleep—great! Be sure to let him/her know in the morning that you came back to give him/her another good night kiss, but that he/she was asleep already.

, If your child makes a sudden appearance after having been put to bed, gently but firmly guide him/her back to bed, and repeat the tucking in and saying good night routine.


Stay firm (but loving) and consistent. You may have to repeat this several times, but your child will soon learn that he/she can't buy extra awake time by sneaking out of bed.

, Your child may respond well to a reward system where you offer him/her stars or stickers for nights that he/she fell asleep on his/her own, stayed in bed, or went to bed without a fuss. After he/she has won a certain number of stars or stickers (for example three), he/she will win a prize like a new book.If this is a new reward system, be sure to offer prizes after only a fairly short amount of time. If you make his/her work for a month before he/she will win his/her treat, he/she may lose focus and motivation.

, While it's important to stay consistent, understand that there's no one strategy that will work for all or that should be used by all.You need to know your kid, and know when to break the rules:


When is he/she clearly troubled? When is his/her sleep issue a symptom of a bigger problem? When would he/she benefit from a longer cuddle or even a night in bed with you?

, Make sure that part of your regular conversation with your pediatrician during your child's check-ups is devoted to discussing your child's sleep habits. It's possible that any new problems could be because of developmental or hormonal changes, or even an illness."

Feed your child a healthy snack before bed.,
Try the tried-and-true warm milk “potion”.,
Cut out the caffeine.,
Control your child's sugar intake.,
Provide your child with a complete, balanced diet.,
Consider adding some healthy sleep-promoting foods to your child's diet.,
Limit beverages before bed.,
Keep drinks small.,
Visit the bathroom before bed.",How to Get Kids to Sleep4," Little ones are sometimes unable to sleep because their tummies are rumbling, or they wake up too early in need of breakfast. You may be able to see a big difference in your child's sleep patterns if you prepare them a carbohydrate-rich snack half an hour before bed.Good options are bananas, cereal, or a small peanut butter sandwich on wheat bread, which has the added benefit of protein, which can also keep your child's tummy full longer.

, Many parents swear by the almost magical effects of a soothing cup of warm milk to help their child relax and drift off to sleep.


The milk is a nice combination of carbohydrates and protein, which can help settle your child's stomach and squash any hunger pangs. Also, serving the warm beverage in a favorite mug is comforting and soothing, which can also help explain why so many children respond well to this remedy.To make the drink more appealing, you may want to add a teaspoon or so of honey to the heated milk, or try adding a few drops of vanilla extract.

, It should probably go without saying that your child shouldn't be drinking soda (or coffee!) in the evening. However, if your child is struggling to fall and stay asleep, one of the underlying reasons could be because he/she is stimulated from the caffeine he/she has consumed earlier in the day.


In order to promote a healthier sleeping schedule, carefully examine your child's diet and cut out any sources of caffeine.Pay attention to the labels of all of their beverages and snacks: caffeine is sometimes found in surprising items, such as what you thought were “un-caffeinated” root beers, juices, or energy waters.Caffeine can also be found in some candy, ice cream, and cocoa drinks, so you many want to limit these treats., Even if your child isn't hopped up on caffeine, their energy levels could be pumped up because of too much sugar.Take care to control your child's intake of sugar, particularly after dinner.

, Whether you are looking for bedtime snack ideas for your child or looking for ways to improve your child's overall diet, the food choices you offer can have an impact on his/her sleep.


Make sure that your child has a well-rounded diet, and be sure to check in with your child's pediatrician before making any major changes.

, While none of these foods will magically make your child drift off to sleep, they are all healthy options that may promote better sleep. Try adding any of these to your child's plate:


Cherries: these are a good source of melatonin, which is the chemical that helps us regulate our sleep patterns.Jasmine rice: this rates highly on the glycemic index (how long it takes your body to digest the glucose (sugar) in the food. A higher score is better, meaning the glucose is released slowly into the bloodstream, making us less vulnerable to blood sugar crashes.Fortified cereals made with whole grains: search for cereals and grains which are a good source of complex carbohydrates. Quinoa, oatmeal, and barley are also good options. (good complex carbs)
Bananas and sweet potatoes: besides being a good source of healthy carbohydrates, both of these contain good levels of magnesium and potassium, which can help relax muscles., You may begin to see an improvement in sleep patterns if you limit the amount that your child drinks before going to bed. Thus, make sure that your child isn't drinking all throughout the evening after dinner.


If your child needs to get up to use the bathroom shortly after being put to bed, he/she will have to start the falling-asleep process all over again. If he/she had managed to get a few winks of sleep in before waking up, then it could be all the much harder for his/her to go back to sleep after this “power nap”.

, While drinking a mug of warm milk may be part of a good bedtime routine, and while you don't want your child to become dehydrated, you don't want to overfill his/her bladder. Otherwise, he/she will be waking up during the night or getting up way too early.


Offer your child just a small 2 to 4 ounce mug of milk, for example, or give him/her small sips of water.

, You should also be sure to have your child go to the bathroom as one of the last steps of his/her bedtime routine.

This will help cut down on accidents and hopefully allow your child to stay asleep longer without a full bladder.

Give your toddler a soothing bath.,
Turn off all screens.,
Give your toddler a high-carbohydrate bedtime snack.,
Maintain the same bedtime every night.",How to Get a Toddler to Sleep1," A picture chart can help your toddler understand his bedtime routine. You can even involve your toddler in making the chart to help him feel more empowered about the process. The picture chart should include images of pre-bedtime activities along with corresponding times when these activities will be performed. The bedtime activities should take no longer than 30 minutes (not including a bath).Some sample times and activities that you may want to use in the bedtime chart include:7:30 enjoy a bedtime snack
7:40 brush teeth, wash face, and put on pajamas
7:50 read a story in bed
8:00 turn off the lights and go to sleep;
, Although you do not need to start getting your child ready for bed an hour or two before bedtime, it is a good idea to encourage your toddler to do some calm activities. Allowing plenty of time to start winding down your toddler will help make the process less stressful for you as well.Some good ways to help your toddler wind down include:


Coloring or drawing
Playing with a doll
Reading a book to your toddler
Talking to your toddler

, About a half hour before your toddler’s bedtime routine begins, start setting the tone for bedtime. By setting a soothing tone, you will make it easier for your toddler to start getting sleepy. Some ways to set the tone include:Dimming the lights in the house
Playing some soothing classical or jazz music
Talking in a low soft voice

, A bath before bed can help to soothe your toddler in preparation for a good night’s sleep. Try using a soothing nighttime bubble bath for kids, such as a lavender scented one. Some people use lavender to help with insomnia, so the scent might help to soothe your toddler and help her fall asleep., Screens such as tablets, computers, and TVs may make it harder for your toddler to fall asleep and stay asleep. This is because the blue light that these screens emit can affect circadian rhythms.To help prevent sleep problems from screens, turn off all screens at least one hour before bedtime and make sure that your toddler knows that this is a rule.

, A high-carbohydrate snack before bedtime can head off requests for food after your child has already gotten into bed. A high-carbohydrate bedtime snack may also help your toddler fall asleep and stay asleep. Some good bedtime snack choices include:A piece of whole wheat toast with jam
A piece of fruit
A couple of graham crackers

, It is important to encourage your toddler to go to bed at the same time every night, even on the weekend.Make sure that your toddler knows when it is time for bed and do not give in to requests to stay up later.


Do not move up your toddler’s bedtime if he missed a nap or seems sleepy. Your toddler may end up waking up a few hours later and have trouble getting back to sleep for the night."

Get exercise in earlier in the day.,
Avoid rough-housing before bed.,
Consider doing a family session of yoga before bed.,
Finish homework well before bed.,
Limit electronics in the hours before bed.,
Address any anxiety triggers.,
Schedule favorite family activities for earlier in the day.",How to Get Kids to Sleep5," Making sure that your child gets sufficient exercise is important for his/her overall health, and it will also help him/her sleep better to have burned off energy throughout the day. Even so, you may find that allowing your child to jump and run around in the hours before bedtime could get him/her too wound up for sleep.


Some research has indicated that exercising at a moderate intensity for at least thirty minutes early in the day (preferably in the morning) can positively impact the length and quality of a person's sleep., Similarly, while it's great fun to allow your children to wrestle together—or to join in with them yourself—you want to avoid encouraging any behavior which will get them overly excited as bedtime approaches., Yoga isn't a practice just for young, limber 20-somethings! While you want to avoid any strenuous exercise in the evening, your child may benefit from the calming effects of a yoga routine. This can help him/her relax both his/her mind and his/her body as he/she unwinds from a busy day.

Recent studies have indicated that yoga practice can lead to improved sleep., One reason an older child may have trouble falling or staying asleep is if he/she is worried about completing all of his/her schoolwork. If his/her projects aren't finished before he/she goes to bed, he/she may be worried about needing to finish it at breakfast or on the bus, and this nagging worry could be interfering with his/her ability to “shut off” his/her mind and get sleep.


Help your child establish a clear homework schedule and create an organizing system to help him/her keep track of his/her homework and due dates. If he/she has a designated time and place to do him/her homework in the afternoon or evening, he/she will be less likely to go to bed with it unfinished.

, Research consistently shows that it is much harder for us to fall asleep immediately after “screen time”.Blue-light emitting devices, such as game consoles, computer screens, tablets, and smartphones are all “blue-light emitting devices,” and exposure to them is thought to interrupt our natural circadian rhythms (our natural sleep cycles).Teenagers seem to be particularly sensitive to the sleep-disrupting effects of these devices.
Make sure, then, that your child “unplugs” at least an hour before bedtime.

, Your child may also be suffering from poor sleep because of problems with anxiety or stress. Particularly if this sleep issue is new, take the time to talk with your child about what is going on in his/her life: is he/she worried, nervous, or scared about something? Is he/she having problems with his/her teachers or friends?Once you've identified any underlying problems, be sure to work with your child to come up with coping strategies, meet with his/her teachers if necessary, and if the problem is severe, be sure to meet with your child's pediatrician to get a referral for counselor.

, Sometimes younger children have trouble going to bed when they feel they're missing out on fun activities with older family members after their bedtime. To reduce this fear of missing out, consider planning activities your younger child likes earlier in the day so they can participate.


If older family members do take part in activities a younger child enjoys after their bedtime, they should avoid talking about it and making the younger child feel left out.
If your child persuades you to let him/her stay up later than usual one night, and you do activities he/she finds boring, he/she won't be as tempted to stay up late another night.

Provide a security blanket or toy.,
Stick to text-only books.,
Create an environment that will encourage sleep.,
Deny last minute requests.",How to Get a Toddler to Sleep2," Some toddlers may become anxious or scared after you leave the bedroom, so providing a special security object may help. Some good security objects include:Blanket
Doll
Teddy bear

, A book with lots of pictures in it may get your toddler excited and this can make it harder for her to fall asleep. Try to stick to text-only books that you can read to your toddler at bedtime.


Encourage your toddler to listen to the story as you read.
Try to read in a soft voice to help soothe your toddler to sleep.

, A sleep-friendly environment will make it easier for you to get your toddler to wind down for the evening. Keep your toddler’s bedroom dark and quiet so that he will not be disturbed by outside lights and noises.Temperature can also influence your toddler’s ability to fall asleep. Make sure that your toddler’s bedroom is cool, but not cold.Provide your toddler with some nice warm blankets, but do not heat the bedroom too much. Try to keep it at about 68°F (20°C)., It is common for kids to try to extend the bedtime routine by asking for another story or snack or something. To avoid making this a habit, it is important to say no if your child asks for something extra right as you are leaving the room.


Try to incorporate all of your child’s needs into the routine so there will not be any reason for last minute requests.For example, you might make a drink of water and a trip to the potty part of the bedtime routine.

Schedule naps well before bedtime.,
Watch your toddler’s cues.,
Maintain the same nap place for your toddler.",How to Get a Toddler to Sleep3," Napping too close to bedtime may make it harder for your toddler to fall asleep at night.If you toddler is still taking two naps per day, then schedule these naps in the morning and afternoon. Do not allow evening naps. If your toddler is only taking one nap per day, then try to schedule the nap for late morning or early afternoon.


Limit naps to 90 minutes. Naps that go longer than 90 minutes may cause your toddler to be cranky upon waking.Keep in mind that your toddler may outgrow naptime., Your toddler will show some clear signs when she needs to take a nap. Watch for things like blinking more than usual, zoning out, rubbing eyes, acting cranky, and yawning. If you notice that your toddler is acting like she is sleepy, then it is time to encourage her to take a nap., Encouraging your toddler to nap in the same spot each day will help your toddler to associate that place with sleeping. This association should make it easier for your toddler to fall asleep and stay asleep during a nap.Try designating a special pillow and blanket for napping. Encourage your toddler to use these items to nap on the sofa or on top of the covers in his crib or bed.
Do not allow your toddler to nap in the stroller, car seat, or a bouncy seat. The stroller, car seats, and bouncy seats are not safe places for your toddler to nap due to the risks of strangulation and suffocation.

One loose stool movement does not mean your child has diarrhea. But several loose stool movements within a short period of time is a good indicator that your child has diarrhea and would benefit from changes to her eating schedule.Increasing the amount of fluids your child drinks and making changes to her diet are two key ways to treat diarrhea at home. This will help to prevent your child from becoming dehydrated and malnourished as she recovers from the diarrhea.
Making adjustments to your child’s eating schedule can also make it more appealing for her to eat when she has diarrhea.;
, Having small meals and snacks throughout the day rather than three big meals can often be gentler on your child’s stomach and help her maintain an appetite. Prepare small meals in small bowls and give them to your child throughout the day. Always pair the meals with lots of fluids so your child does not become dehydrated.Some sources recommend giving your child fluids first and then giving her solid food. You can try to get your child to drink several glasses of water before and after her small meals to keep her hydrated., Your child may not have much of an appetite while she has diarrhea, so you may want to focus on ingredients that your child enjoys and prepare them in ways that will encourage her to eat.


For example, if your child likes chicken, then you can make chicken noodle soup. The soup should be easy for your child to eat with a sore stomach and give her the necessary nutrients to stay nourished despite her diarrhea.

, If your child’s diarrhea clears up on its own after two to three days, you should slowly have your child go back to her normal eating schedule. This may mean giving her one to two full meals as well as one smaller meal or two small snacks. Do not force your child to eat her normal meals right after she has recovered as her body needs time to get used to lots of solid foods again.Some children can experience a bout of diarrhea once they return to their regular diet. This is usually due to your child’s gut getting used to regular food again. This type of diarrhea does not last very long and is not the same as diarrhea due to an illness or infection. After a day or so, the diarrhea should go away and your child should be okay with eating her regular diet.

, Dehydration is a common complication of diarrhea. Prevent your child from becoming dehydrated by ensuring she drinks a lot of fluids. Give her plain water for the first one to two hours of the diarrhea and then switch to liquids that contain sodium and other nutrients, such as milk. Too much plain water can be harmful, as water does not contain any sugars or key electrolytes. She should drink at least eight to ten glasses of liquid per day to ensure she stays hydrated.


Avoid giving your child fruit juices like apple juice or any other full fruit juice. Fruit juices can make her diarrhea worse. However, if your child is not a fan of plain water, you can add a splash of juice to the water to give it a bit of flavor.
Do not give your child any carbonated drinks or drinks that contain caffeine, such as soda or caffeinated teas. These can also make diarrhea worse.If your child has issues with dairy products or if your child's diarrhea seems worse after she consumes dairy, do not give her milk to drink. Instead, give her water mixed with a rehydration solution, such as Rehydralyte and the World Health Organization’s oral rehydration solution. You can also try Pedialyte and Infalyte, which you can get over-the-counter at your local drugstore or supermarket. Older children can also drink sports drinks to rehydrate, such as Gatorade.
Always consult your doctor before using any rehydration solutions for infants or children under 1 year old.

, Most children with diarrhea will respond best to foods that are bland and high in starch. If you cook any foods, season it with only salt and pepper. Try baking or broiling foods so they do not have a strong flavor or a strong taste that will turn off your child. Example foods you can prepare include:Baked or broiled meats, such as beef, pork, chicken, fish, or turkey.
Boiled eggs.
Toasted slices of white bread.
Plain pasta with cheese or white rice.
Cereals like cream of wheat, oatmeal, and cornflakes.
Pancakes and waffles made with white flour.
Baked potatoes or mashed potatoes.
Some cooked vegetables, steamed or sautéed in light oil, such as carrots, mushrooms, zucchini, and green beans. Avoid squash, broccoli, peppers, beans, peas, berries, prunes, leafy green vegetables, and corn, as they can trigger bowel movements, bloating, and gas.
Bananas and fresh fruits like apples, pears, and peaches.

, To make food more appealing to your child, and easier for her to digest, you should try to take all seeds out of foods and all skins off of foods. This means removing seeds from any vegetables or fruits you give your child. You should also peel the skins off of foods, such as zucchini and peaches., Salty snacks are good for children with diarrhea as your child can have low sodium levels due to the diarrhea. Give your child salty snacks like pretzels and saltine crackers. You can also add salt to cooked foods, such as a dash of salt on baked or broiled chicken and salt on a baked potato.Put out bowls of salty snacks for your child to munch on throughout the day, as this will likely encourage her to eat. Make sure she is consuming water with the salty snacks to balance out her sodium levels and prevent dehydration.

, These treats are actually a good source of clear fluids and can help your child stay hydrated. Give your child popsicles made with very little fruit juice and water. Avoid popsicles that contain dairy products, as dairy can irritate your child’s stomach. You can also try giving your child Pedialyte popsicles.


Jello made of fruit can also be a good way to ensure your child gets enough fiber in her diet. The fiber will help her stools to become more solid and absorb some of the water in her digestive system.

, Yogurt contains live and active cultures that can help to replenish the good bacteria in your child's digestive tract.Try to give your child a serving of yogurt every day to aid her recovery.


Choose a low-fat, low-sugar yogurt. Too much fat or sugar can make your child's diarrhea worse.
Try blending yogurt with fruit to make a smoothie. If your child is not fond of yogurt, then she may be more likely to eat a smoothie that contains yogurt. Try mixing half of a cup of yogurt with a banana and a handful of frozen berries. You can also add a half cup to a cup of water to give your child some extra fluids.

, Spicy and fatty foods can lead to further irritation of your child’s stomach and more diarrhea. Do not give your child any spiced foods, such as curries, spicy soups, or any foods that contain red pepper. You should also avoid giving your child food high in fat, such as fried foods or processed and prepackaged foods.Do not give your child foods that are hard to digest, such as sausage, pastries, donuts, and other processed foods high in sugar and fat.

, These are signs that your child’s diarrhea may be a symptom of a more serious medical issue. It is important to note any mucus or blood in your child’s stool and bring her to the nearest medical facility right away so she can be examined by a doctor.


You should also note if your child is experiencing other severe symptoms in addition to her diarrhea, such as vomiting, abdominal cramping, nausea, stomach pain, or a high fever. Take her to a doctor if she is experiencing these symptoms.

, Most diarrhea will go away after two to three days, though it may take a week or two for your child to go back to her normal eating habits. If her diarrhea lasts longer than two to three days and does not seem to be subsiding or getting better, call your child's doctor to find out if you need to bring her in for an appointment.You probably will not have to bring your child in unless there is blood in her stool or the diarrhea is severe.

, Children with diarrhea are susceptible to dehydration, especially if they are not getting enough fluids. The symptoms of severe dehydration include:A dry and sticky mouth.
No urination in six to eight hours, or less than three times in 24 hours.
No tears when crying.
Eyes that appear sunken.
Decreased activity.
Weight loss.

, Your child's doctor may check samples of your child's stool to see if an infection is causing the diarrhea or she may order other tests to help determine the cause of your child's diarrhea. Once your child has been examined by a doctor, she may rarely prescribe antibiotics for the infection or illness that is causing your child’s diarrhea. Antibiotics are not often prescribed, and they may only be prescribed if a bacterial cause of the diarrhea is known, as antibiotics can be ineffective or have unpleasant side effects if they are prescribed improperly.Most antidiarrheal medications are not recommended for children. The doctor will likely avoid prescribing them for your child’s diarrhea. Instead, she may suggest over-the-counter medications for diarrhea that are made for children. For example, your doctor may recommend treatment with probiotics to help your child's diarrhea.
Your doctor may refer your child to a gastroenterologist, a specialist in stomach and intestine problems, if the diarrhea is long-lasting or associated with other symptoms.

"
Start once you feel ready.,
Get a baby-carrier and get moving.,
Try “baby dancing.” Baby dancing is a light cardio workout that you can do pretty much anywhere, either at home, in the yard, or elsewhere, and will also help to improve your coordination and balance.,
Do “tummy-time.” “Tummy-time” is exercise for your baby but a great chance for you both to bond and interact.,
Schedule time for exercise.,
Join a baby-friendly exercise class.,
Enroll in an aquatic class.,
Look for local groups of moms/dads.,
Limber up with stretches.,
Try toning exercises.,
Get moving with aerobic exercise.",How to Exercise with Your Baby," It used to be that doctors told women to wait at least six weeks after delivery to start exercising again. This has changed, though. So long as you’ve had an uncomplicated delivery, it’s usually safe to start working out once you feel ready. Just talk to your doctor first to make sure.

There’s every reason to start exercising again after your delivery. Working out can improve your cardiovascular fitness, help you lose baby weight, restore your muscle tone, boost your mood, and improve your energy levels.
You will probably have to wait a while longer to exercise if you had a C-section or complicated vaginal delivery, however. Make sure to talk to your doctor to ensure you’re sufficiently healed before starting.;
, One great possibility is a baby-carrier. A baby-carrier will let you get out of the house as well as get in a good workout with your baby practically in your arms. Using a walking or jogging stroller, backpack, or front-pack are all options. They also offer an added benefit for exercise — your baby will act as extra weight, forcing you to work harder.Try a jogging stroller. These have big tires and should be easy to push, whether you’re running, jogging, or just walking. They’re best for babies that are at least six months old and they can go off paved sidewalks and onto trails.
A front-pack is another great option. Just strap it on and snuggle close while walking — but don’t run or jog. You should also keep your baby facing you early on until her neck muscles are more developed. Just talk to your doctor before using one, if you’d had a C-section or other complication during your delivery.
Backpacks work the same as front-packs, of course, just on your back. You can adjust the straps to keep you and your baby comfortable while walking or going about your daily activities. With both backpacks and front-packs, you’ll also have to carry the baby’s extra weight and will burn more calories. Your baby will be ready to use a backpack when she can sit up unsupported, at about six to eight months.

, To start, just put your baby in a front carrier that supports their head or hold them in front of you.Put on some music that you like and then start to gently dance, keeping your abdominal muscles taut.
You can also switch between slow and moderately fast music to get your heart rate elevated. Just remember to move gently and to avoid bouncing and sharp turns, especially if your baby is in a carrier.
If you’d like, you might also put your baby in a bouncy seat or swing and dance around her. Keep interacting by maintaining eye contact and making animated movements.

, Putting a baby on their tummy while awake and supervised helps to develop stronger head, neck, and shoulder muscles and to practice skills that will eventually help them turn over. It can also prevent a flattening of the back of the head, or “positional plagiocephaly.”Set your baby down on their tummy across your lap two or three times per day for several minutes. As they get stronger, you can start to use a floor mat for longer periods of time. The idea is to encourage them to look around and hold up their head and upper body. Some research suggests that babies with more tummy-time may learn to turn over, sit up without support, and crawl earlier.Tummy-time will also ensure that the back of your baby’s head gets a rest. Babies’ skulls are formed of soft plates and, if too much time is spent on the back, these plates can become flattened.
Always make sure that tummy-time is supervised. It’s generally OK for your baby to be on their tummy while awake and attended, but doctors recommend that babies sleep on their backs to lower the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). Put your baby to sleep on their back if they get sleepy or fussy during tummy-time.

, One of the hardest parts about exercising with a small child is finding the time. Chances are that you’ll be emotionally and physically tired, and sometimes you may feel too worn down for a full workout. That’s OK, but do the best you can. Find ways to push yourself to be active and pencil exercise into your schedule.If you have a spouse or partner, negotiate times for your exercise. Ask your partner to take over baby duties so that you can get in a 30-minute walk or jog several times per week.
Consider feeding your baby before workouts. Some research suggests that intense physical exercise causes lactic acid to build up in breast milk. While this won’t harm your baby, it may give the milk a sour and unpleasant taste. One way you can avoid this is by sticking to moderate exercise and ingesting plenty of fluids, or by feeding your baby before the workout.
Alternatively, you can pump breast milk before your workout and feed the baby afterward. This may also help you stay comfortable while working out.

, If you want more company, you can also consider finding an exercise group or class. Check out the gyms and community centers in your area to see whether there are baby-friendly exercise classes. More and more, gyms recognize that parents with small children have trouble getting out and staying fit and offer special classes. These allow you to bring along a small child and to work out without having to find child care.Try searching on the internet for classes near you. You can also try calling local health clubs, gyms, and community centers to see what’s available.
Don’t just limit yourself to aerobics. You may also be able to find baby-friendly yoga, dance, or even martial arts classes. You can find classes like this in many cities for babies as young as six weeks old all the way up to one year.

, Another option is to try the pool. Many pools around the US offer infant and toddler aquatic classes, which allow parents to swim and enjoy time in the pool with small children. Such programs have even been developed by the American Red Cross and YMCA.Call pools in your neighborhood to inquire about aquatic lessons for moms and infants. Some places offer such classes all year round.
Keep in mind that these aren’t “swimming lessons,” though. Children really aren’t ready for proper swimming lessons until about age four and your infant will need your constant and close supervision. You should always be within an arm’s length of your child.

, Don’t forget to comb your own networks of friends, acquaintances, neighbors, and co-workers. Ask other people you know who have small children. See what your peers are doing and whether they know of or participate in informal groups of moms and dads who get together for exercise.


Informal groups might get together two or three times a week for stroller walks in the park or around the neighborhood, for example.
You might also be able to find informal groups of moms who do yoga together with their babies. Your baby can relax on your mat while you stretch and socialize.

, Exercising with your baby doesn’t have to start after delivery. Working out is also good for you while you’re still pregnant. Gentle stretching will keep your muscles limber and warm and reduce feelings of stiffness. It can also help to relieve aches and pains, including in the back, and reduce leg cramps. There are a number of simple stretches that you can do on your own to benefit. Make sure your muscles are already warmed up before you begin stretching to avoid injury. Try a light warm up like walking.Stretch your neck by relaxing your shoulders and neck muscles. Then, drop your head forward and slowly rotate it to your right shoulder, back to the middle, and to the left shoulder. Do three or four complete rotations in each direction.
To work your thighs, stand with one foot about two feet in front of the other and with your toes pointed in the same direction. Then lean forward, supporting your weight on the forward thigh. Switch sides and repeat for a total of ten.
To stretch your shoulders, bring them forward before rotating them up toward your ears and then back downward. Repeat this several times.

, Toning exercises include the benefits of stretches while also strengthening your core muscles, including the abdomen, pelvic floor, vaginal muscles, back, and thighs. Apart from the usual pluses of exercise, these activities will help to prepare you physically for delivery. Just remember to avoid positions that make you feel unstable or could increase the risk of falling.Try pelvic tilts. Start on the ground on all fours, keeping your hands in line with your shoulders and knees with your hips. Your back should be straight. Then, inhale and tighten your abdomen, tuck your buttocks under, and tilt your pelvis forward all in one motion. Exhale, relax, and repeat 10 times.
You can do a pelvic tilt while standing, as well. Just stand with your feet about 10 inches apart with your legs relaxed and bent slightly at the knee. Then, put your hands on your hips and inhale. Tighten your abdomen, tuck your buttocks under, and shift your pelvis forward. Exhale, relax, and repeat.
You can also do Kegel exercises. Just imagine that you are trying to stop yourself from passing gas or stopping the flow of urine. Try not to move other muscles or shift while doing Kegel exercises – in fact, no one should be able to tell that you’re doing them.

, It’s generally safe for pregnant women to exercise in low- or moderate-intensity aerobic exercise several times per week. In fact, most should aim for at least thirty minutes on most, if not all, days of the week. Slowly work your way up if you haven’t been exercising regularly, and expect to do lower-intensity workouts than you did before the pregnancy.If you weren’t exercising previously, start with as little as five minutes of activity per day. Then, work up to ten minutes, fifteen minutes, and eventually thirty. If you exercised before, it’s probably OK to continue at the same level while pregnant. Just make sure that you’re comfortable and have the go-ahead from your doctor.
Try a low-intensity activity like walking. It’s a great aerobic exercise and will be easy on your joints. You can also try things like swimming and cycling on a stationary bicycle.
You can also take a class. Consider signing up for prenatal yoga or low-impact aerobics for pregnant women, for example, which are offered at some hospitals and fitness centers. That way, you’ll be ready to continue exercising with your baby in the months after your delivery.

,How to Ensure That You Have Healthy Children1,
"
Feed your child iron-rich food.,
Reduce cow's milk intake.,
Give your child orange juice, not iced tea.,
Limit physical activity.,
Pack your child's lunch.,
Know the signs and symptoms of anemia.,
Get a proper diagnosis.,
Administer medication.,
Do not administer supplements on your own.,
Ask about blood transfusions.,
Ask about bone marrow transplants.,
Ask about surgery.",How to Deal with Your Child's Anemia," Consult your pediatrician to figure out how much iron-rich food to feed your child. Unless your child is a vegetarian, prepare meals of red meat, dark poultry meat, tuna, and salmon. Tofu and eggs are high in iron, and are both extremely versatile ingredients. Enriched grains, dried beans and peas, and fortified breakfast cereals will give your child iron.Tomatoes, leafy green vegetables, yellow vegetables, and potatoes with the skin on all provide iron.
Feed your child dried fruits, such as raisins (if he is over four so as not to be a choking risk), and sweeten food with blackstrap molasses.
Do not give your child an iron supplement unless the doctor prescribes one.;
, Cow's milk interferes with iron absorption and can cause mild internal bleeding in toddlers. Breast milk has plenty of iron, especially if you are taking prenatal vitamins. If you are using a formula, use iron-fortified formula. Limit the cow's milk in your child's diet to less than 24–32 ounces per day. Don't give cow's milk to babies under one year old.Prepare iron-rich non-dairy treats. For example, if your child loves pudding, make a silk-tofu chocolate pudding.
If your child loves creamy desserts, try using eggs instead. Make a meringue and custard dessert, such as a pie or a floating island.

, Drinking coffee or tea with a meal will inhibit your child's iron uptake. Vitamin C can increase iron uptake, so offer a glass of orange juice instead. Give your child iron-fortified beverages or green juices for a change of pace., Your child may tire more easily than other children. Keep an eye out during playdates, and redirect frenetic activities if you notice your child is showing signs of fatigue. Inform your child's teacher, school nurse, and gym or Physical Education teacher about your child's condition. Let all caregivers and the parents of your child's friends know as well.


Keep art supplies, books, and games on hand so your child can entertain her friends without overexertion.
If your child is seriously unable to keep up during gym class, talk to the school principal about alternative instruction during that period.
If your child's spleen is enlarged, do not allow him or her to participate in contact sports.
Children who exercise regularly may need extra sources of iron, as they may lose some iron through sweat., Unless you can depend on your child's school providing iron-rich, low-dairy meals, pack lunch for your child. If your child's school does provide meals that satisfy your child's dietary needs, you might still want to pack iron-rich snacks, such as raisins. When your child is old enough, she can pack her own lunch. Involve your child in food preparation early on, to help your child feel excited by healthy eating rather than burdened by medical chores.

, Some children with mild anemia may have no symptoms, but common symptoms of moderate or severe anemia include:Pale skin and lips
Fatigue, weakness, irritability
Light-headedness or dizziness
Rapid heartbeat.
Some children with anemia may also have jaundice, an enlarged spleen, or developmental or behavioral problems.

, Anemia can be temporary or chronic, and can stem from a wide range of causes. Bring your child to a doctor before you begin treating him at home. Although iron deficiency is a common cause of anemia, it is far from the only one. Some forms of anemia can endanger your child's life if left undiagnosed.Anemia can indicate serious underlying conditions that might need immediate attention.
Your child's doctor will give your child a physical exam. The doctor will listen to your child's heart and lungs. She may also feel the abdomen for signs of enlarged liver or spleen.Prepare your child for needles. Your child's blood will be drawn.
The blood sample will be tested for its complete blood count (CBC), the level of red blood cells and hemoglobin in your child's blood. Your doctor may check iron levels and iron stores in your child's blood. A test for lead is often done as well.
The size and shape of your child's blood cells will be tested. Iron deficiency anemia causes the red blood cells to grow small and pale, while sickle cell anemia causes misshapen blood cells.
Your child's doctor might do follow up exams to test for internal bleeding or even bone marrow irregularities.

, If your child has iron deficiency anemia, the pediatrician is likely to prescribe a medicine that rebuilds the body's store of iron. Administer drops if your child is an infant, or liquid or tablets if your child is older, for up to three months. If your child has vitamin deficiency anemia, you may be limited to administering folic acid and vitamin B supplements.If your adolescent child has anemia caused by heavy or irregular menstruation, the doctor may prescribe hormonal treatment such as birth control pills.
If the anemia is caused by infection, your doctor may prescribe antibiotics.
If your child's body does not produce enough blood cells, she might be given medication that stimulates the bone marrow.
If your child has sickle-cell anemia, she may need to be given penicillin twice daily to guard against infections.In addition, children with sickle-cell anemia require close monitoring and often other treatments including folic acid supplements.
If your child's current medications have been found to cause anemia, you may have to develop a new treatment plan with your doctor.

, Unless your doctor has prescribed iron or vitamin supplements to your child, do not administer them. Do not give your child more iron supplements than prescribed. Iron can be toxic if your child takes too much of it., Children with severe or chronic anemia might require regular blood transfusions. If your child has sickle cell, aplastic, or hemolytic anemia, ask the doctor about blood transfusions. Blood can come from a bank, or from a non-anemic family member or friend. This person's blood will have to be screened before donations can begin., If your child has sickle cell anemia, aplastic anemia, or thalassemia, your doctor may recommend bone marrow transplantation. For bone marrow transplantation, bone marrow cells from a donor are injected into your child's vein. The cells travel from your child's bloodstream to his bone marrow, and produce new cells once they have arrived., If your child has an iron deficiency, she may have internal bleeding which could require surgery to stop. If your child has thalassemia or hemolytic anemia, it may be helpful to remove her spleen. This is not always the case, but in severe cases your doctor may recommend it."

Watch out for high doses of vitamin A.,
Avoid smoking and drinking alcohol.,
Put a limit on your caffeine intake.,
Get enough exercise.",How to Ensure That You Have Healthy Children2," It is important to see your family doctor or obstetrician soon after finding out that you are pregnant. The doctor will most likely give you a general exam, a blood test, urine test, pelvic exam, and pap smear. These are done to check for possible complications and deficiencies, such as cervical cancer, harmful bacteria in the blood, or low iron levels. You should then expect to see your doctor every four weeks until the seventh month of pregnancy, then every two weeks until the final month, after which you should start weekly visits., If you want to have a healthy baby, you may wish to terminate a foetus discovered to have a genetic or congenital defect., Meals featuring fruits and green leafy vegetables, then secondly whole grains, light dairy, and extra lean proteins are essential to nourish your developing child while maintaining your own health.Your appetite should increase during pregnancy. Compensate by eating a full breakfast, and if you feel like snacking, try fresh fruits and vegetables instead of junk food.
For the last six months of pregnancy, your daily intake should increase by about 300 calories. And if at normal weight before pregnancy, you should also expect to gain 25 – 30 pounds.It is recommended that pregnant women eat 12 ounces of fish or shellfish per week. These are rich in protein, in addition to omega-3 fatty acids, which can aid in the baby’s brain and eye development., The following fish contain dangerous levels of mercury, which can cause birth defects: swordfish, mackerel, grouper, Chilean sea bass, marlin, orange roughy, shark, tilefish (also known as white or golden snapper), and tuna steaks (including canned albacore).


Recommended fish and shellfish with the lowest levels of mercury include tilapia, herring, pollock, whiting, anchovies, sardines, non-farmed salmon, shrimp, crayfish, and cooked clams and oysters., These include unpasteurized milk or juices, and unpasteurized soft cheeses such as feta, blue cheese, brie, queso fresco, and queso blanco. These can contain a harmful bacterium that causes an illness that pregnant women are vulnerable to, called listeriosis, which if passed on the the fetus can result in miscarriage, premature labor, low birth weight, or infant death, in addition to several debilitating birth defects., Hot dogs, deli and luncheon meats, pâtés, and refrigerated smoked seafood can all contain the bacterium that causes listeriosis. Proper refrigeration can reduce the risk, so freeze or refrigerate perishables and leftovers within 2 hours of preparation.


To ensure adequate refrigeration, make sure the freezer temperature is set at 0°F (-18°C) or below, and the refrigerator at 40°F (4°C) or below., Raw or undercooked meats — especially pork, venison, and lamb — can contain a parasite called Toxoplasma gondii, which causes Toxoplasmosis. This illness, if passed on to your baby, can bring on a number of birth defects, including brain and eye impairment.



T. gondii is also found in unwashed fruits, vegetables, and contaminated water, so be sure to thoroughly wash all produce from the store or garden, and drink only treated water.
If you've been working in the garden or changing a cat litter box, wash your hands afterwards to protect against T. gondii, which can be present in cat feces.Poultry should be cooked to an internal temperature of at least 165°F (73.9°C), ground meat should be cooked to 165°F (73.9°C), and steaks, roasts, chops should be 145°F (62.8°C).It is also important to defrost, chill, clean, and handle foods properly to avoid foodborne illness. (For instance, don't wash raw meat, as this can spread bacterial all over your skin and kitchen.)

, It is recommended that expectant mothers and women trying to get pregnant take 400 – 800 mcg (micrograms) of folic acid daily. This supplement helps to reduce the chance of neural tube defects — such as spina bifida and anencephaly — which inhibit brain and spinal cord development.


While a balanced diet should provide most of the nutrients you and your baby need, it is difficult for pregnant women to get enough folic acid from foods alone to ensure the baby's healthy development., Most prenatal vitamins will contain the bulk of the supplemental nutrition you’ll need. Regardless, make sure you’re getting these daily recommended doses in addition to folic acid:


27 mg of iron
1000 mg of Calcium (1300 mg if younger than 18)
770 mcg of vitamin A (750 mcg if younger than 18)
2.6 mcg of Vitamin B12, The recommended daily dose for expecting mothers is at least 400 IU/10mcg. Vitamin D regulates calcium and phosphate levels, aiding in the growth of muscles, teeth, and bones., Make sure your prenatal vitamin does not contain more than 5,000 IU of Vitamin A (1500 mcg of retinol, 3000 mcg of beta carotene).Also avoid fish liver oil supplements (cod liver oil), and liver products such as liver sausage and liver pâté. High doses of Vitamin A can cause birth defects., Mothers who drink or smoke during pregnancy are shown to increase the chances of miscarriage, stillbirth, low birth weight, and giving birth to children at risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs).You may have heard that small amounts of alcohol from time to time are not harmful. The fact is that studies on the safety of an occasional drink have been inconclusive, so it’s best to not take the risk--go without alcohol for the sake of your baby., Drinks containing caffeine should be approached carefully, since too much has been shown to cause low birth weight and miscarriage.To help you limit your daily caffeine intake to 200 mg per day, here is a list of how much caffeine is found in the most common drinks:


2 ½ tablespoons of regular ground coffee to make 12 liquid ounces: 200 mg
Black tea (brewing for three minutes): 80mg
Green tea (brewing for three minutes): 60 mgSoft drinks and energy drinks should be out of the question, considering not only their high caffeine content but also their potentially harmful levels of sugar as well.

, Staying active by doing simple and safe activities like walking, swimming, light aerobics, pilates, and yoga can make labor and delivery more manageable.If you weren’t exercising before pregnancy, start with 15 minutes per day, working up to 30 minutes. If you were active before, try for at least 30 minutes of exercise per day.Be sure to avoid exercising or strenuous activity in hot weather, and drink plenty of water before, during, and after your workout.
Discuss with your doctor what types of exercise are best for you and which exercises you should avoid as your pregnancy progresses.
Certain exercises can help you adapt to your changing body as the pregnancy progresses. Ask a personal trainer about starting stomach-strengthening, pelvic floor, and pelvic tilt exercises."
"
Make just a few dietary adjustments while breastfeeding.,
Provide iron-rich complementary foods after six months.,
Prepare meals for your baby that emphasize fresh vegetables and fruits.,
Include grains such as brown rice, whole wheat bread, and whole-grain crackers in every meal.,
Serve lean proteins such as poultry, fish, beans, peas, nuts, seeds, soy, and eggs.,
Increase dairy servings as the baby grows.",How to Ensure That You Have Healthy Children3," For your child’s first six months, when either breastfeeding or formula should be their only source of food, maintaining a standard balanced diet will help you produce nutritious milk for the baby. Emphasize green leafy vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and lean proteins such as fish and poultry. Continue this regimen as you combine breastfeeding or formula with baby food up to the child’s second year.In addition, a daily vitamin D supplement of 10 mcg/400 IU is advised while breastfeeding.
Breastfeeding is strongly recommended as the exclusive source of nutrition for your child up to six months.It provides the best source of nutrition for healthy growth, aids in reducing the risk of infection, and prevents overweight., An infant’s natural supply of iron is typically depleted at six months, therefore it is necessary to begin adding solid foods to the diet while breastfeeding or giving formula.Fully cooked meat, fish, poultry, and meat alternatives (tofu, eggs, legumes) should be served in small, easily digestible quantities. Try for two to three servings per day from six to eight months, then three to four servings from nine to 13 months.Be patient when trying to get your baby to accept solid foods for the first time. It can take up to 10 to 15 tries before they get used to the change in feeding., At two years of age, your baby should be ready for exclusively solid foods. At least half of each meal should consist of fruits and vegetables, and the other half whole grains and protein. Try for at least five servings of fruits and vegetables per day.Diets that favor fruits and vegetables offer a number of long-term health benefits:


For one, they help control blood sugar, which in turn moderates appetite.
They also lessen the risk of stroke and heart disease, lower blood pressure, prevent certain types of cancer, and reduce the risk of digestive and eye complications.

, Whole grains contain vital minerals and B vitamins for energy, and dietary fiber for healthy digestion. At least half the grains should be whole grain, and should be listed first (or second after water) on the ingredients list. Mix in other whole grains such as wild rice, quinoa, oats, millet, sorghum, and buckwheat., Cut down on red meats (beef, lamb, pork) and especially processed meats such as bacon, salami, ham, hot dogs, and sausages — all of which have been linked to an increased risk of cancer, heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes.Protein helps to form healthy body tissues, and is the building block for hemoglobin and enzymes.Experts recommend 8g of daily protein consumption for every 20 pounds of body weight. For a 70-pound child, that calculates to 28g of protein per day., Recommended servings are as follows: 2 cups at Two to three years, 2 1/2 cups from four to eight years, and 3 cups from nine to 18 years (1 cup of milk or yogurt = 1 1/2 ounces of unprocessed cheese). Emphasize low-fat milk, cheese, and yogurt. Foods sometimes considered as dairy, such as cream cheese, cream, and butter, are high in saturated fats and should not be eaten.Dairy products are an excellent source of calcium, which helps bone growth. You can also substitute non-dairy calcium sources such as fortified soy milk, collards, bok choy, kale, and white and navy beans."

Reduce saturated fats, and cut out trans fats.,
Try to do without added sugars, or sugars not occurring naturally.,
Work on reducing sodium and seek out foods high in potassium.,
Choose carbohydrates with a low-to-medium glycemic load.",How to Ensure That You Have Healthy Children4," Diets high in saturated fats and trans fats are a major contributor to childhood obesity. Fats are a necessary component of a healthy diet, but it’s important to distinguish the good from the bad. Favor unsaturated fats from fish, avocados, snd nuts as well as sunflower, canola and olive oils. Reduce saturated fats from butter, palm oil, cheese, cream, ghee, lard, and fatty meats. Do your best to avoid altogether processed foods high in trans fat (partially hydrogenated oil), namely most fast food, packaged snack food, fried food, pizza, pastries, spreads, and margarine., Non-natural sugars added to soft drinks, many juices, most processed sweets, and processed foods in general are known to be major contributors to childhood obesity and diabetes.Added sugars tend to be found most commonly in processed snack foods. If you’re serving or packing a snack for your child, go for fresh fruits, nuts, and raw vegetables instead of canned drinks with added sugar or potato chips, pretzels, and similar packaged foods.

, Most people consume about twice as much sodium (9-12g) than recommended daily doses (5g), and children are particularly vulnerable if they have a diet high in processed snacks and meats. Excessive sodium intake combined with insufficient potassium levels elevates blood pressure. Increase your child’s potassium intake by serving plenty of vegetables, fruits (especially avocados and bananas) and nuts, and avoid processed meats such as cold cuts, bacon, plus salty snacks and cheeses., Foods rated as having a high glycemic load cause unhealthy fluctuations in blood sugar levels, which have been associated with obesity, type 2 diabetes, and heart disease. Foods with a low-to-medium glycemic load include whole grain bread, wheat tortillas, muesli, oatmeal, skim milk, apples, pears, watermelon, cashews, peanuts, green peas, carrots, and parsnips."

Make sure infants and toddlers progressively get more exercise.,
Keep them moving once they’re walking.,
Involve older children in aerobic and strengthening activities.,
Make an effort to limit screen time to two hours per day.,
Encourage play and social interaction.,
Teach fundamental social skills.,
Schedule regular check-ups with pediatricians and dentists.",How to Ensure That You Have Healthy Children5," Before they crawl, they can benefit from lying on the floor and kicking their legs. To exercise the arms, interact with them by practicing grasping, pushing, and pulling. Once they're crawling, provide an extensive space for them in the home, or on a grassy surface outdoors, while ensuring the surfaces are free of sharp objects.As your child begins crawling, walking, and exploring their world, you will need to take steps to child-proof your home so that your child is not unintentionally injured. This may include putting safety latches on cabinet doors, covering outlets, putting up safety gates, putting bumpers on sharp corners, securing bookcases to the walls, and so on.Child-proofing will give your child a safe space to develop.

, Encourage your child to walk with you as much as possible, instead of overusing the stroller. Allow them to take part in routine household tasks and activities such as setting the table, unpacking groceries, sorting laundry, walking the dog, and raking leaves. Frequent trips to parks with a playground will allow them to exercise all muscles in the body, and give them a chance to begin friendships with their peers., From five to 11 years, children are physically developed enough to benefit from a combination of aerobic (walking, basketball, soccer) and strengthening (climbing on playground equipment, snow shoveling) activities. Try to make sure they get at least one hour of moderate- to high-activity exercise per day., To help cut down on screen time, simply remove television sets and computers from the child’s bedroom. Restricting the time your child spends watching tv, sitting at the computer, and using mobile devices is a good way to make more time for exercise and social interaction.


After-school sports or other organized activities are an excellent way to schedule in most of the recommended daily exercise time., Trips to the playground, after-school activities, and clubs are just a few ways to put your child into contact with others their own age. From three years forward children should increasingly interact with their peers and begin forming social bonds. And emotional development should go hand-in-hand with social development, so the more your child interacts, the better they’ll be able to handle emotional challenges., By giving direct instructions and offering feedback, you can help your child adopt the building blocks for getting along in social situations. Teach them the importance of eye contact, listening, sharing, saying “please” and “thank you,” greetings, taking turns, cooperating, being inclusive, showing affection, apologizing, forgiving, and empathy., Starting at birth, your child will need regular wellness check-ups with their family doctor or pediatrician. The doctor will be able to make sure your child is hitting their developmental milestones, give vaccines, and address any health concerns you may have.In addition, your child should start visiting a dentist when their first tooth appears, then at least every six months for a checkup to ensure their mouths and teeth are healthy."

Don’t over-criticize.,
Help kids set their own goals.,
Celebrate running victories.,
Help kids pick out special running clothes.,
Create a playlist.",How to Get Kids Interested in Running1," The quickest way to make a kid lose interest in an activity is to continually criticize how they perform that activity. When they’re first getting involved with running, don’t criticize their form or speed (or lack thereof). Instead, emphasize the fun they’re having.For example, if you notice that their form needs work, sandwich it between two positive comments. So you could say something like, ""It really seems like you're running faster! Just make sure you keep your back straighter while you run. But your stride looks really good!"";
, For a kid to get interested in anything – not just running – they have to feel like they own the activity. A good way to foster this sense of ownership is by helping kids set their own running goals.Goals can include time goals – maybe they want to be able to run a mile in 20 minutes or run a 100 yard dash in a certain amount of time.
Kids can also have non-timed goals. For example, maybe they want to be able to run a whole mile without stopping.
It doesn’t really matter what the goals are, as long as the kids themselves are setting them.

, Celebrating kids’ running victories is another way to keep them motivated about running. Once kids have set their goals, help them celebrate when they meet them.You can say something like ""You ran that whole half mile without changing your pace once! Way to go!""
Your celebrations should still support the healthy lifestyle that running engenders in kids. Celebrate with healthy snacks or a cute card. Try to resist celebrating with something like cupcakes.

, Another good way to motivate kids to run is by making an event out of choosing running clothes. Take them shopping for a new outfit especially for running, or for new shoes that are only running shoes. This makes the whole experience feel special.If you don’t have the money for new clothes, you can help them go through their existing wardrobe and pick out an outfit that’s just for running. Encourage them to keep it separate from their regular clothes and only wear it when they're ready to run.

, If the kids have a music player or a phone with music-playing capabilities, you can help them create a running playlist. This adds to the feeling that running is special. Music also works as a good motivation to keep moving."

Sign up for a family fun run.,
Try a mud run.,
Do the Color Run.,
Take part in a dress-up run.,
Participate in a mermaid run.,
Sign them up for a Spartan Kids run.,
Sign them up for an inflatable fun run.",How to Get Kids Interested in Running2," Family fun runs are a great way to get the whole family running while introducing your kids to competitive races without overwhelming them. Most family fun runs have a variety of course distances you can choose from, which make them a great option if your kids are different ages.These runs usually take place in the spring or fall, depending on where you live. You can get more information about family fun runs in your area from community newsletters, magazines, and some cities' official websites.

, Mud runs are part competitive race, part obstacle course, and many adult mud runs have a kid version that happens on the same day. Mud runs give your kids an excuse to get dirty while they run, which is a great way to get them interested in running.Make sure you check out what the obstacle course for the kids’ mud run looks like. You don’t want to sign your kids up for a mud run that is beyond their abilities. This can actually turn them off from running, rather than making them more interested.
Make sure the clothes your kids wear for a mud run are expendable - the stains might not come out.

, The Color Run is a 5K run that happens across the country on various dates. Runners dress in white and are showered in colored powders as they run (or walk) the race route. The Color Run has a fun, family-friendly vibe and can be a great way to get kids to love running.www.thecolorrun.com has all of the dates and locations of upcoming Color Runs.

, Around Halloween, some community centers – like local YMCAs or YWCAs – sponsor character or Halloween themed runs. These runs encourage kids to race while dressed up in their Halloween costumes. Some versions of the run include trick-or-treating along the way or promise tasty treats like apple cider or hot chocolate at the end.If your kid is participating in this type of run, make sure they can run in their costume – you don’t want anyone tripping over a cape or a skirt.

, Mermaid runs are exclusively for women and girls, and they often offer multiple race courses of varying distances and difficulties. Mermaid runs can help get girls interested in running because girls can run without making gendered comparisons to boys who might be faster than they are.This is a great option for a multi-generational run – mermaid run organizers encourage runners of all ages and abilities to participate.

, The Spartan run is one of the toughest obstacle course races in the country, but they also offer a kid version of the race. Not only will kids have to run, but they will also have the chance to jump, climb, and get muddy.As with other mud runs, make sure your kids are up to tackling the obstacles that are part of a Spartan run.

, Inflatable fun runs are kids-only obstacle course races. Instead of climbing up nets or crawling through mud, however, they’ll have to tackle a variety of inflatable obstacles. Inflatable fun runs are a great option for kids who want to run an obstacle race but aren’t quite ready for some of the other races out there."

Play Frisbee.,
Play catch.,
Try I-spy.,
Play red-light-green-light.",How to Get Kids Interested in Running3," Playing Frisbee with your kids is a great way to get them running without focusing only on running. Just make sure that you throw the Frisbee a little out of their reach so they must run to catch it. Return the favor by running to catch their return throws., If your kids can’t catch something as oddly-shaped as a Frisbee, try playing catch with a regular ball. As with Frisbee, make sure you’re throwing the ball slightly out of their reach so they have to run to catch it.


Playing catch has the added benefit of improving your kids’ hand-eye coordination.

, Taking kids on a run through the neighborhood can be boring for the kids, but playing a game like I-spy can keep them interested. Take turns giving one another hints about what you’re looking at and guessing what the object is., Red-light-green-light is another game that gets your kids running while improving other motor skills. It also works great with as few as 2 kids or as many as 15 to 20.Set the players at a starting line a fair distance from the boss of the round. This distance can vary depending on the age of the players - if your players are younger, you can start them a little closer. If they’re older, they can start further back.
The boss stands with their back to the players and calls “Green light!” which is the players’ cue that they should start running toward the boss. The boss calls “red light!” and spins around quickly. Anyone still moving when the boss turns around is out of the game.
Whoever touches the boss first wins and takes over as boss for the next round.

Make it a family event.,
Encourage them to run while they’re doing other things.,
Include your pets.,
Encourage your kids to play sports.",How to Get Kids Interested in Running4," One of the best ways to get kids interested in running is by showing them that you’re also interested. Plan family runs, or make a point for the whole family to be outside while kids are running. This makes it feel like an important family event, rather than just a solo event.You can also encourage your kids to run with their friends. This matches them with fellow runners whose abilities and speed are probably closer to their own.

, Kids might not like running all by itself, but you can incorporate it into other things your kids do – running to do a chore or get something for you. Sneaking running into their everyday movement can eventually lead to their becoming interested in running on its own., If the kids have a pet – especially a dog – encourage them to take the pet with them on their run. If the dogs want to run, too, it can make it more fun for the kids. And following the dogs’ lead is a good way to get kids interested in running without just telling them to run., A lot of sports require that kids run. Signing kids up for those kinds of sports can get kids running early. It can also lead to them gaining in interest in running on its own.Basketball, baseball, and soccer are good sports to get kids to start running.

Ask them to drink water.,
Feed your child bland foods.,
Offer warm chicken broth.,
Give your child over-the-counter stomach ache medicine.",How to Cure a Child's Stomach Ache1," Dehydration can contribute to tummy troubles. Offer your child some water, and encourage them to drink. You may want to add a bit of fruit (such as watermelon or orange) to the water to make it taste yummy for them., Bland white foods can help absorb any excess acid floating around in your child's tummy. A plain slice of whole wheat bread is an excellent choice, as well as dry crackers or plain rice.It is best to avoid oily foods or dairy.

, Chicken broth (especially broth made from real chicken bones) is a mild, nutritious, and easy-to-digest food. The warm liquid is also soothing. Especially if your child does not want to eat, try offering some chicken broth to help keep them nourished and hydrated.If your child does not eat chicken, you could offer vegetable broth instead.

, You can purchase over-the-counter stomach ache medication made specifically for children. Ask your pharmacist for a recommendation. Provide the correct dosage based on your child's age and weight, and follow any instructions.

Some options include:

Electrolyte drinks (such as Pedialyte) can help with diarrhea or vomiting.
Children’s laxatives (such as Pedia-Lax) can help with constipation.

Don't panic.,
Understand the body's natural heat response.,
Allow the fever to do the work.,
Understand the mechanism of chills.,
Use homeopathic remedies.,
Note the response to the increase in heat.,
Understand fever convulsions.,
Understand your child's behaviors while having a fever.",How to Deal With a Child's Fever Naturally," You may feel compelled to try to take away the symptoms and stop the poor child from feeling so miserable. However, it's important to realize that all of their symptoms are natural, and that bringing the fever down may not always be necessary.;
, When the initial responses of the immune system are not sufficient in dealing with all the invading pathogens, or if it has been thwarted in its natural efforts to heal, your body launches another attack – turn up the heat! The role of a fever is to literally kill the bacteria and viruses that are causing the system distress. Bacterial and viral proteins die off at different temperatures, bacteria at below 40 °C (104 °F) (usually 38 – 39.5) and viruses at over 40 °C (104 °F), usually 40-41ºC.

, If you leave the fever alone and do not give anything to bring it down, then the immune system can kill all pathogens leaving your child’s body free and healed. When the fever breaks on its own and the temperature starts coming down, your child will wake up better.

, Chills are often felt before the heat, because this is one of the mechanisms of heat production. When the thermostat level is set higher than normal, the relative current temperature is now colder than the setting, hence the child feels cold. Blood vessels in the skin constrict (get smaller and deeper) to prevent heat loss from the skin causing a cold feeling. Shivering follows because the brain instructs the skeletal muscles to contract in order to create movement & friction that heats the body up. The hair follicles on the skin also perk up, trapping a layer of air underneath which insulates the skin and increases the temperature – this is commonly known as “goose flesh”!


As the temperature increases to the new level set by the thermostat, these chilly symptoms abate, because the temperature now reflects the setting and the child feels neither hot nor cold – despite an elevated temperate reading.
At this point the temperature may stabilize for a few hours, alerting you to the fact that this is the optimal temperature for the destruction of the enemy. If the child is calm but just hot, leave them be, this is not dangerous and is vital in killing off the baddies!

, These work wonderfully in supporting the body’s natural immune response. They will not actively bring down the fever as a paracetamol or ibuprofen-based medications would, but rather support and speed up the body’s inherent healing abilities, thus bringing about rapid healing.


Commonly known remedies that have been known to assist in as little as a few minutes at times are Belladonna and Aconite.However, finding the remedy that is specific for that particular fever may take a little more thought. These two remedies will not necessarily cure all fevers; homeopathic remedies are very specific to the nature of the symptoms.
Consult a registered practitioner for more specified care.
Know that the sooner homeopathic remedies are given, the quicker the healing happens. The fever will usually come down within 1-3 days of homeopathic intervention

, When the immune system has won the battle and most of the pathogens have been killed off, an apparent crisis arises. The child will suddenly get very hot, feel very hot to touch and often begins sweating excessively. This is because the pyrogens have been removed to a safer level, the bacteria and viruses killed, and the thermostat has been reset to normal again. The body must now bring down the temperature of the internal environment. Blood vessels in the skin dilate (get wider and closer to the skin), causing heat to be radiated from the skin as well as the red / pink hue of a fever. Sudden sweating also follows, which is a well-known way in which the body cools itself down.

, Although frightening when not understood, convulsions, or ""febrile seizures,"" are actually not that dangerous and are seldom the cause of any brain damage as is commonly thought. Recent research suggests that fever convulsions have no lasting negative effects on a child. Only about 2% of people (children & adults included) will ever get a fever convulsion, and while having a fever convulsion may increase the likelihood of having another in the future, it will not increase future risk of acquiring a seizure disorder. Convulsions are caused by excessive heating of the centre of the brain that is responsible for temperature control, which leads to abnormal activity in the brain area that controls muscle contractions, this results in a fever fit.


Know what fever convulsions look like. The fit may start suddenly and can be preceded by a scream. Typically, your child will get rigid and their arms and legs will begin jerking. Their eyes may roll backwards or they may stare fixedly into space. Sometimes frothing at the mouth also occurs. They typically last for one minute. Afterwards, your child may stay unconscious for a short while, then wake up appearing dazed and confused and then fall off into a deep sleep for a while longer. Leave them to sleep, as this sleep is very necessary for the recovery of the brain and system in general.
Know what to do when your child is having a fever convulsion.

As in all first aid practices, always check your ABC’s: AIRWAY, BREATHING, CIRCULATION.
Check the clock so that you can time the length of the fit.
Turn your child onto his side to prevent his tongue falling back and possibly blocking his airway (actually swallowing the tongue is impossible).
Wipe away any mucus, foam, food particles or anything else that may be blocking his mouth by sweeping one finger across his mouth (never use a 2-fingered pincer grasp as this can push the blockage further in).
Loosen all tight clothing to allow free movement.
DO NOT restrain your child at all, allow his body to shake as it needs to, the muscles are very rigid and if restrained, this may result in injury.
DO NOT try to give him anything in his mouth.


Contact your practitioner as soon as possible.
Distinguish fever convulsions from epilepsy. Care needs to be taken however, to ensure that your child does not suffer with epilepsy. If your child convulses at a low grade temperature, below 38.5 °C (101.3 °F), then professional help must be sort.

, Don’t be alarmed if your child is burning up and wants a blanket, or is sweating but does not want anything to drink. Understand that they are following the exact commands of their bodies and will ask for and accept anything that they need.

Papaya, ginger, and peppermint chews are all available at health food stores. These items resemble candy and taste good, so your child is more likely to eat it. Read the packaging to determine how many chew your child can eat in a day., Ginger and mint are also available in tea form. These warm beverages work quickly to ease stomach discomfort. Make your child a cup of warm mint or ginger tea. You may add a bit of honey if it helps them to enjoy it. Avoid adding white sugar, as this may aggravate their tummy., Gripe water is a product sold to relieve colic and other tummy troubles in infants, but it can be helpful for older kids too. The main ingredient is fennel oil, which can help ease gas, bloating, or upset stomach. Try to avoid gripe water varieties that contain sweetener (sucrose) or alcohol., Warmth can encourage your child’s stomach muscles to relax, helping to ease the discomfort. Use a traditional heating pad (on low), or warm a cloth in the microwave., With soft hands, rub circles around your child’s stomach. This should provide some comfort, while also encouraging their muscles to relax. Continue this for 5-10 minutes. Avoid moving too quickly or pressing too hard."

Call a doctor if pain continues for more than a day.",How to Cure a Child's Stomach Ache4," If you child is having a tummy ache, ask them some questions to help determine the cause. Most of the time, a stomach ache is nothing to worry about it. In some instances, your child might need to see a doctor. You might ask your child what they have eaten that day, how bad the pain is, and where it hurts.Some causes of stomach aches include:

Some common causes of upset stomach include:

Consuming certain drinks (such as excess consumption of acidic fruit juice)
Allergy related conditions (such as celiac disease or irritable bowel syndrome)
Appendicitis
Stomach flu
Food poisoning
Constipation, diarrhea, or indigestion

, A stomach ache could be a result of consuming something poisonous, such as a chemical, medicine, cleaning product, or other dangerous substance. If your child has consumed a non-edible item or liquid, call your local poison control center. You can reach the American Association of Poison Control Centers at (800)222-1222. They will instruct you on what actions to take.You may be instructed to:

Call an ambulance
Induce vomiting
Watch for other symptoms

, Sometimes, a stomach ache can be serious or a sign of a medical condition. If it hasn't cleared up after twenty-four hours, if your child cannot keep water down, or if your child is experiencing a high-grade fever, it is a good idea to call the doctor. The doctor will ask you a series of questions.Be ready to explain:


Any symptoms your child is experiencing
When the symptoms began
What medications your child is taking (if any)

Provide your child with clay (play dough).,
Provide paints and paintbrushes.,
Provide newspapers or rough paper to your child.,
Provide pre-school and older children with strings and beads to make and wear a necklace.",How to Develop Motor Skills in Kids," Allow him/her to stand when ready as the basic and most important gross motor skill needed to learn to walk. Occasionally using a high-sided playpen gives the child opportunity to pull up, stand and freedom to walk around holding to the railings, being very active in a safe area (get rid of the pen when the child is getting close to being able to climb out). A baby ""gate"" in a doorway will keep the very young child in a room that is safe and clear of dangers.;
, Obviously, soft toys should be available, but the crawling child will taste and swallow anything on or near the floor. You cannot be too sure, so ensure that the following issues have been taken care of:


Secure cleaning products, shoe polish, glass that can shatter, forks and knives out of reach, etc. Keep the floors free of bits, pieces and objects.
Put/tie up venetian blind cords, and any other dangling objects that can entangle the child.
No electric cords to pull an iron or lamp, etc. down on the child's head.
No small wheels and such that can be pulled or broken off, chewed and/or swallowed. Hand to mouth action makes a floor sweeper that will put any debris, or bits in the mouth.

, You can be ""it"": follow and catch (tag) your child and then vice versa (let the child catch you).

, Place a newspaper on the floor and ask your child to walk around the newspaper without stepping on it. If the child steps on newspaper, he or she will have to start again. You can also do the same thing.

, Hide the child’s favorite toy on the floor beneath a baby blanket, or such, and ask the child to find it. Then you can ask your child to hide something and you can find it. Let the young child be messy, until you ask for help cleaning up.

, Play kick ball/soccer games. You will have the most amazing time.

, Try gently throwing and retrieving a very light, soft, fairly large ball with your young child. Toss the ball ""underhand"" and ask your child to throw it back and you catch it. Let it be a game where one loses and other wins. Allow your child to win a few times. But don’t make it a habit to allow him/her to win every time. Let them lose too.

, Develop throwing and catching skills. Eventually play football and baseball with your child.

, It will help them develop their grip, which is required for writing skills.

, Let them open and close the zips and button and unbutton the shirt. This will enhance their fine motor skills along with eye-hand co-ordination and self help skills, which are required before the child starts to go to a pre-school.

, One option is snap together a soft cube. Large Lego blocks are available for small children, smaller ones when old enough. Another good task is lacing. You can make lacing boards at home by punching holes in different shapes. Then ask your child to pass a bulky cord through, to lace through the holes.

, Let the child be messy and create different forms from it. This will also enhance your child’s creativity.

, Spread out plain paper around the floor or attach to an easel board. (Do not use newspaper or paper with something written on it, as the child will not like it visually and might not want to paint on it.) Allow the child to be the messiest he/she can ever be and let him/her paint imaginatively with the paints and brushes. Another option is to allow the child to just dip his/her hands and fingers in the paint and create ""masterpieces"". Though it can be very messy, it's the most fun. You can also take part with your child and paint and have fun with colours.

, Ask your child to tear it, then twist it and crumple it. The child can make balls, then you can play an aiming game with the child; for example, lay aim the balls in the bin. This will enhance fine motor as well as gross motor skills. Older children can be asked to tear it and then paste it to make a collage.

, This will enhance their fine motor skills and helps their eye to hand co-ordination. If beads are not available, give them macaroni and let them weave it onto string.

If your child fell or was hit in the face, and swelling accompanies the bleeding, you should get medical treatment as soon as possible. His nose could be broken.;
, If at all possible, take your child into a bathroom (or any uncarpeted room — blood can stain carpeting). If you are in public, it’s best to move your toddler out of public view; she may be upset by people staring, and some people feel sick or faint when they see blood.

, Your toddler’s head needs to be higher than his heart to avoid creating extra pressure in the nose, which could lead to increased bleeding.For the best results, have your child sit in a chair or in your lap.


If you place your child in a reclined position, blood can go down the throat, which could cause nausea and vomiting. Sitting up is much better., Using a basin, a napkin, or the sink, help your toddler spit out the blood gently. For most, the taste of blood is unenjoyable, and swallowing a lot of blood may lead to vomiting.

, Whether your toddler is in a chair or in your lap, he needs to lean forward a bit so that he is less likely to swallow blood.If your toddler is sitting in a chair, place a hand on his back and gently push forward.
If your toddler is sitting in your lap, lean forward gently, pushing him forward.

, Using a handkerchief, towel, or other soft cloth, wipe away any blood that is visible.

, If your toddler is able to blow her nose, that will help get rid of excess blood.

, Be gentle; if you pinch too tightly your child is likely to struggle, and in the case of injury, you may make the situation worse.


Resist the temptation to let go of the nose before the ten minutes are up, as this can break any clot that is forming.
Be sure you do not cover your child’s mouth at the same time. He needs to be able to breathe freely.
Distract the toddler. Depending on the age of the toddler, he may need some distraction while you are holding his nose. Something such as a favorite television show or book might work well.

, After pinching the nose closed for ten minutes, check to see if it is still bleeding. If so, continue to pinch the nose for ten minutes more., If the bleeding continues, place a cold compress on the bridge of your toddler’s nose. Doing so narrows the blood vessels and may help reduce the bleeding., Once the bleeding stops, try to get your child to rest. Encourage your toddler not to touch or blow her nose again.

, Get medical treatment immediately if your child is injured. In addition, call your pediatrician if any of the following situations apply:You have completed all of the previous steps, but the bleeding has not stopped.
Your child is experiencing nosebleeds several times a week.
Your child is dizzy, weak, or pale.
Your child has recently started a new medication.
Your child has a known or suspected bleeding problem.
Your child has a severe headache.
Your child is bleeding anywhere else — ears, mouth, or gums, for example — or has blood in his stool.
Your child has unexplained bruises on his body.

, Once your child is taken care of, clean up any blood that may have dripped onto the furniture, floor, or countertops. Wipe the area down with disinfectant.

, In the vast majority of cases, nosebleeds are nothing to worry about. If you panic unnecessarily, you will frighten your child and make the situation worse. Remain as calm as possible.


The “stay calm” rule also applies if you are certain that your toddler’s nosebleed is the result of enthusiastic nose picking. This is not the time to reprimand or embarrass your toddler, or to get upset or angry. Stay calm and deal with the nosebleed itself before addressing the cause.

, He may be most upset because he doesn't understand what is happening. Try to keep your voice low and calm. As you go through each step to deal with the bleeding, explain what you are doing and why.

, Once you have dealt with the bleeding, provide some physical affection, such as a hug or some cuddles, to comfort her. Explain that although a nosebleed might be scary, it doesn't mean that she is dying or that she is very sick.

, The nose is full of tiny blood vessels that are easily irritated when hit or poked.Because toddlers are so curious and often clumsy, they are especially likely to get nosebleeds. They may put their fingers or small objects up their noses, and they may often slip and fall; both of these tendencies can lead to nosebleeds.

, All of this will irritate the sensitive mucous membranes inside the nose.

, If your toddler takes an antihistamine in the form of a nasal spray, she is more likely to develop a nosebleed. These medications dry out the nasal cavities, making them more susceptible to irritation and bleeding., Cold, dry weather leads to more frequent nosebleeds.This problem is often exacerbated by indoor heating systems, which tend to dry out the mucous membranes of the nose, making it more sensitive and prone to bleeding.

, Although it is rare, a toddler’s nosebleeds could be a sign of a medical condition that prevents blood from clotting effectively.Your pediatrician can order tests that will check for these conditions.


In most cases, toddlers with clotting disorders come from families with a history of such conditions. If you, your spouse or partner, or any other close members of your family have problems with effective blood clotting, you should talk to your child’s pediatrician immediately. Consider, too, whether your toddler has other areas of bleeding or easy bruising.

, If your toddler gets a lot of nosebleeds, apply a product such as Vaseline at night to keep the nasal passages moist. You can also moisten the nasal passages with saline spray, drops, or gels.You may also want to get a humidifier for your child’s room. Humidifiers keep the air from getting too dry, which may help prevent future nosebleeds., You may be able to prevent nosebleeds by keeping your child’s room free of dust and other allergens,which can dry the mucous membranes and cause nosebleeds. Keep your child away from smoke; if anyone in the household smokes, make sure they do so outside. Pay particular attention to carpets, curtains, and stuffed toys, which can trap allergens.

, Toddlers are curious creatures, prone to sticking fingers up their noses. If you keep your child’s nails trimmed, he will be less likely to cause a nosebleed., Make sure your child is eating lots of healthy, unprocessed foods. Avoid artificial sweeteners, which can suppress the immune system. Also try to incorporate foods high in omega 3 fats, as these can help boost the immune system and strengthen blood vessels"

Your doctor might also recommend that you supplement with prebiotics or probiotics. These promote ""good"" bacteria in your child's system.

, Many children with Chron's simply cannot get the nutrients they need by ingesting food. You may want to consider enteral feeding. Enteral feeding is a method in which you child receives nutrients from a tube.For enteral feeding, your child will be fed by a nasogastric (NG) tube. This tube will be inserted into your child's nose and go down through his stomach.
Your child's nutrients will be inserted into the NG tube. You will be able to administer the food supplements to your child.

The process of talking allows someone to free himself from the lie of keeping secrets. Talking is extremely therapeutic and is used in many types of psychotherapy.If the person tells you he has an addiction, then allow him to tell you his story. It is important for him to know that he is being heard.
If you notice changes in the person’s behavior, then you can bring it up by saying something like, “I’ve noticed you are spending a lot more time online, and you look like something is bothering you. Do you want to talk about it?”
Don’t be afraid to ask the tough, honest questions. Confronting difficult subject matter that might jeopardize a relationship is challenging. Deceit is at the root of addiction so you must tell the truth.You will need to ask direct, honest questions like, “Do you think you are addicted to pornography?”;
, People tend to rise to a challenge when they know someone is interested in the outcome. There is a tendency to believe in yourself and your abilities when you can tell someone about your accomplishments. Accountability increases results and effectiveness.You can be the person who asks to be updated, shows an interest in the person’s success, and will call a person out if he is not living up to expectations. It will help the person attach to a process that will help end unhealthy behaviors.


You can help the person be accountable by saying something like, “I want to help you with this so I’m going to check in with you and ask you how things are going.”
Offer to monitor the person’s computer activity by checking search histories on a daily or weekly basis. You must secure the person’s commitment to not delete his own search histories.

, An addiction to pornography carries its own sense of shame in most cultures. If a person is trying to change his behavior, additional shame and guilt is not helpful to the process. Help the person find other things that motivate positive change, rather than ridiculing negative behaviors.


Encourage a healthy sense of right and wrong when necessary. You can do this by explaining to him that he needs to view himself separate from his behaviors. He is not a bad person, but his behaviors cause harm and must change.If the addiction has caused harm to his relationships, you can say, “Your relationships are going to be so much better once you change your behavior. Life is going to be easier for you. It might not seem like it at first, but it will.”
In contrast, a shame and guilt-filled statement would be to say “Don’t you want to stop messing up your relationships? I don’t know why you would want keep doing that. It doesn’t make any sense and it is so hurtful to everyone.”

, The goal of ending an addiction to pornography is to find alternate ways to manage and cope with negative feelings. A structured approach is always an effective way to manage behavior change.


Identify the target behavior. Through discussion, identify the behaviors the person would like to change. For example, if the person stays up until 3:00 a.m. watching pornography and misses class or work in the morning, then he will need to change his sleeping schedule. A goal could be: Go to bed no later than 11:30 p.m. on weeknights.
Help him select/design a system to monitor and change his behavior. This may include: setting schedules for limited time using the computer; scheduling time to do outdoor activities; requiring an hour per day writing about his feelings in a journal.
If he is depressed, anxious, stressed or suffering from low self-esteem introduce relaxation techniques like yoga, meditation, and breathing exercises that have all been successful in treating these afflictions.Choose ways to reinforce positive thoughts and behaviors. If he enjoys going to the movies or sporting events, these can serve as a rewards if he meets daily or weekly goals. This will help build self-esteem and his belief in himself.Fade your involvement as improvements happen. As he accumulates longer and longer periods of positive behavior you can slowly step back your involvement.

, Provide healthy distractions to pull the person away from the computer. The goal is to help the person get physically active to build an interest in feeling the health benefits of physical activity. If he feels better he is more likely to stay positive and motivated to change.


Suggest things like walking, running, hiking and weight lifting. These activities help the brain release endorphins, which increase feelings of pleasure and lessen pain.Also, you could suggest that he take a dance class. Learning new dance steps requires his full attention, which allows him to take a mental break from his addiction., Having an addiction occupies most of the person’s time and pushes him away from pursuing his interests. It robs him of experiencing things that he enjoys, and things that he might enjoy if he had the time.


Encourage him to explore his interests by answering the questions: What is missing in your life? Where would you travel if you could? If money had no implications, what would you do for a career?
Perhaps playing the guitar has been an interest. Suggest that he take a class online or at a local music store.
Encourage him to get involved in groups that share his non-pornography interests. These connections may lead to close friendships.Take as much time away from the addiction as possible. If he spends most of his time on new activities, then there will be no time left for watching pornography.

, If his struggles are becoming more difficult and the self-help strategies are not making a big impact, then suggest that he see a therapist. He may be dealing with underlying anxiety, depression, and self-esteem issues that are too much to handle. A licensed therapist is trained to deal with these types of issues and can help the person. It is the goal of the therapist to provide a safe place to talk, express emotions and discuss the situation openly and honestly.Reinforce the fact that it takes courage to make positive changes in his life. The therapist will echo your statements.
Confirm that talking to a therapist is the next step toward getting the help he needs. You have been there for him to talk about his addiction, but now it is time to talk to a professional. You can tell him, “I will still be here for your, and you will have the therapist to talk to who will undoubtedly have better ways to help you.”
Find a therapist who is a good fit. Ask a doctor, family member or trusted friend if they can recommend a therapist. There are professional therapists available in your local area who will help people deal with addictions.
Look for a therapist who practices cognitive behavioral therapy.This type of therapy is one commonly used to treat addiction and provides a step-by-step process designed to stop compulsive behavior. The therapist will help the person examine and dispel the negative thought patterns he has developed.
You can suggest that the person attend a 12-step program designated for those people who suffer from sexually-related addictions. There are 12-step programs available worldwide. Contact a local chapter to obtain information on a meeting near you.

, An intervention is a planned confrontation by friends and family to address the person with an addiction. It is a hard decision to make, but one that is necessary if the addiction has spiraled out of control and the person’s life is in danger. Many people with an addiction are often in denial and unwilling to seek treatment. While an intervention will likely be overwhelming to the person, the intent is not to put the person on the defensive.


Be aware that those who will participate in the intervention should be carefully chosen. The person’s loved ones can describe how the addiction to pornography is affecting them.
There needs to be a plan in place to provide the person with treatment options. For example, there are inpatient programs, outpatient programs, and counseling is involved in all.

Take care of your own health and well-being.",How to Help Someone End a Pornography Addiction2," If the person has been open with you about his addiction you must focus on being supportive rather than negative. It is difficult to admit you have a problem. If you want to help you need to demonstrate that you can be trusted and will not make fun of the person. A good support system will help the person experience less stress.It takes courage to admit you have a problem, so you can say something like, “First of all, thank you for telling me. I know that takes a lot of courage to do that. I’m here for you in any way I can help.”

, Being listened to and understood are key components to personal growth.The emotional experience of dealing with a pornography addiction will force a person to grow, which may be painful. You can help ease the person's pain by actively listening.


Put yourself in the person’s shoes. Learn to be compassionate and accepting rather than judging the person. Find resources that can teach you about being compassionate.It might be difficult to understand, but you can always try.
Treat the person like you would like to be treated. You have probably experienced struggles in your life and know what was helpful to you, and what wasn’t.

, When people experience unpleasant thoughts and feelings they may turn to viewing pornography as a way to manage those feelings. Pornography captures a person’s attention and pushes feelings of anxiety, depression, boredom, loneliness and stress away. Unfortunately, this is only a temporary solution and does nothing to create long-term effective ways of dealing with those feelings.


Help the person determine if he has feelings of depression. There are online screening questionnaires that can help with the process.He may have been depressed before delving into pornography, or he could be depressed because of his addiction to pornography. You can ask him, “Are there some things that you’re depressed about?”
You can use the same type of question to address anxiety, loneliness, boredom and other emotions he may be trying to manage.
Cybersex or pornography addiction involves compulsive behaviors. Unique challenges exist because the person can remain relatively anonymous, which allows him to continue the behavior. Additionally, unlimited access makes it that much harder to resist.Suggest that he might be using pornography to push away his feelings rather than deal with them. Emphasize that you are there to help him and get him the help he needs. If that means putting a lock on his internet access, then do it.

, Changing behavior is difficult so if the person shows signs of improving you need to acknowledge his progress.It may be small celebrations at first, building to larger ones as time goes by. If the person shares any news about the positive things he is doing, congratulate him.


For example, he may tell you that he made it through an entire morning without looking at pornography. You could respond by saying, “That is awesome. You are really making progress. You really want to do this, don’t you? Keep going.”

, It is difficult to change your own behavior, but it is even harder to help someone change his behavior.There are a lot of variables that you cannot control. Therefore, you will not always be able to help someone. The ability to let go of control and strictly be a guide and support for the person is where you will find success.


You can provide consistency and reliability for the person. You are always there for him.
There may be a time when you need to remind the person by saying, “You know I’m here for you. It is hard for me to see you struggle and I wish I could do more.” By saying things like this you will motivate him to try harder.

, When a person helps others she will experience health benefits including: feeling less depression, aches and pains, and you might even live longer than most people.However, helping others can take a toll on you so take steps to stay physically and emotionally healthy. Focus on the following things to ensure a healthy emotional balance for yourself:


Get the proper amount of sleep that you need to avoid getting exhausted.Eat healthy food to maintain good health and energy and combat stress.Include fruits and vegetables, lean proteins, complex carbohydrates and fiber. Avoid caffeine, sugar and foods high in saturated fats.
Exercise regularly to help manage the stress you might be feeling."

He needs to know that there will be people to support him on the road to recovery, and that includes you.


Be kind and understanding of the person’s struggle. Treat others as you would like to be treated.

, An addiction to pornography results in an imbalance in the amount of time spent online vs. time spent in real life. If a person hopes to have real, meaningful relationships with people, then he must engage in a balanced amount of human interactions.


Invite him to attend gatherings with you where there will be new people. He may be uncomfortable in the beginning so be at his side to provide him the support he needs.
Pornography has caused a distorted view of human sexual interaction. He will need to be educated on the realities of sexual relations. Do your best to provide reliable and honest resources to him.

, Put yourself in charge of coordinating fun activities that will be beneficial to you and the other person. You deserve to have fun and if it can help the person expand their view of the world, all the better.


Arrange sporting events, casual hang-out events, and vacations. If there is something you want to experience, encourage the person to join you.

, Be the one who makes sure that common sense prevails. If the person tries to negotiate with you about complying with his commitment to not watch pornography, then confront him on his actions. He may think he can watch just a few minutes of it and be fine. You know that once he starts back up he won’t stop.


Be the reminder of consequences. You will need to remind him about the dark place from which he came. Remind him that all the hard work he did will be eroded if he starts watching again. Approach the conversation in a matter-of-fact tone and explain, “This is not about shaming you or guilting you into something. This is about the reality that you were living and are living right now. You have a responsibility to yourself and the people who care about you.”
Observe changes and discuss them. If you see changes in his behavior that lead you to believe there might have been a slip-up, then calmly confront the issue. You can say, “I’ve notices you look really tired. Is everything okay? Are you abstaining from watching pornography? If you aren’t, I’m still here to help you so there’s no reason to lie.”

, Either way, you must focus on helping the person forgive himself, regroup and continue on the path of abstaining from pornography. The more open and willing you are, the more likely he will continue to feel safe sharing his thoughts and feelings. This will prevent the person from creating secrets that can undermine his progress.


Help the person manage the temptation to view pornography if a particularly difficult situation presents itself. Suggest alternate activities that will distract or preoccupy the person’s attention such as remote control airplane flying, or rock climbing. Get the person involved in something completely different.
Encourage the person to forgive himself for any lapses in behavior. It is crucial for dealing with a setback.Do this by helping him focus on recommitting to his goals. You can tell him something like, “You may have slipped up, but what is important now is that you focus on small steps to get back on the program. Commit to the next hour that you will not do it. Build momentum with each hour you stick to your plan. You have to work your way back. Don’t give up on yourself.”

Get a professional assessment.,
Learn about physical withdrawal symptoms.,
Watch for dangerous symptoms.,
Create a safe, supportive environment.In order to make your loved one as comfortable as possible, take extra care to create a safe environment in your home.,
Manage pain.,
Encourage liquids and easily digestible food.,

Contact others for support.,
Talk to a doctor.",How to Help a Loved One Through Detox1," Because detoxing from many drugs can be dangerous and often requires medical supervision, make sure that a home detox is the best choice for your loved one. Arrange an assessment by calling a nearby detox center for information, and always have a physician or nurse that you are able to contact for advice.


Find a nearby detox center by calling your state’s Alcohol & Drug Information Service.;
, Know what physical and psychological symptoms to expect as you help your loved one through detox. Since withdrawal symptoms vary by drug, be sure that you are prepared to deal with the symptoms unique to your loved one’s drug(s) of choice.


For alcohol detox: headache, shaking hands, eyes blinking on their own, clammy skin, rapid heartbeat, sweating, nausea, nervousness, irritability, insomnia, nightmares.

The symptoms of alcohol withdrawal can begin within just a few hours without having a drink.


For opiate detox (heroin, morphine, codeine, Oxycontin, Dilaudid, and methadone): Early symptoms include muscle aches, tearing, runny nose, sweating, and yawning agitation, anxiety, insomnia, irritability. Late symptoms include abdominal cramping, dilated pupils, diarrhea, goose bumps, nausea, and vomiting.

Symptoms typically being to emerge within 12 hours of the last dose, and within 30 hours for methadone., Be on the lookout for withdrawal symptoms that seem especially worrying. If you see your loved one having a fit, becoming unconscious, hallucinating, or having serious chest pains, call 911 to send an ambulance right away., Try to get as much natural light in your home as possible, and keep lots of sanitary items in close reach. Make sure that your loved one has an accessible place to rest in peace.


Remove anything that might tempt or trigger him to use, like alcohol or other prescription medications.

, Help the person to manage any physical pain and discomfort, like cramps, vomiting, diarrhea, and fever. It may be helpful to learn a few basic first aid skills, like how to effectively use a heat pad and cold compress. To avoid messes, keep buckets in convenient places in case vomiting occurs suddenly.


If the nausea, vomiting and diarrhea is severe, then medication such as Maxalon or Lomotil may be helpful, but keep in mind that these can only be prescribed by a physician.You can also try homeopathic remedies like acupuncture pressure points to encourage a settled stomach.

, Most withdrawal symptoms leave the body dehydrated and exhausted. So, see to it that your loved one doesn't get dehydrated. He should be drinking at least two liters of water per day, even if this proves quite difficult. Eating may be even more difficult, due to nausea and indigestion, but light foods like soup, rice, noodles, vegetables, and fruit will provide nutrients that are important for recovery., Help your loved one relax by reminding them about techniques that they already use. Even if it's simple, like taking slow, deep belly breaths, listening to music, or relaxing in the bath, don't try to teach him something he doesn't already know. These techniques will help take his mind off of the pain of detox and send a signal to his body to stop resisting this pain and simply allow it to pass.


If your loved one is familiar with yoga or meditation, join him in a practice of his choosing.

, It’s not always the best idea to be the sole person helping your loved one through detox, as you may end up with caretaker burnout. Caretaker burnout occurs when you spend so much time worrying about and helping your loved one that you neglect your own needs, which can lead to unexamined resentment and ultimately lead to a poorer quality of care. If possible, enlist the help and support of other mutual, local contacts.


These others can provide support to your loved one detoxing, help you with the tasks you are taking on to aid the process, and even help you with responsibilities that you've put aside to take care of your loved one.

, Make sure you ask for advice to prevent the spread of infection, for which there is high risk, throughout the detox. Know what to do should you be faced with an emergency situation. Always call your doctor or go to the emergency room if you think your loved one is in severe medical danger.


Be sure to put off the counseling or psychological help until after the detox. This is because the detox puts the person in a very vulnerable physical state, and counseling may create more stress than help at that point.

Identify signs of a gambling problem.,
Talk to them about their problem.,
Avoid judging them.,
Explain the consequences.,
Prepare for any reaction.",How to Help a Compulsive Gambler1," Not everyone who gambles has a problem with it. It is important to determine whether or not the other person has an addiction. There are many common symptoms of compulsive gambling that you can look for.Many times, compulsive gamblers will not only spend a long time gambling but they may be desperate to find more and more money to gamble with. Lying, stealing, or engaging in illegal activities to get more money are clear signs that there is a problem.
A compulsive gambler may constantly increase the stakes or money so that they can get a bigger thrill.
A compulsive gambler may try to hide their habit from family and friends. This means that they may lie about how often or how much they gamble. They may also be in denial about the extent of their problem.;
, If you want to help a compulsive gambler, you may need to discuss the problem. This may be when you start to see a pattern of behavior leading to compulsive gambling or after the person has gotten into trouble due to their gambling.To decide if you should bring it up to the gambler, you should look at your relationship with the person. Are you close, or are you just casual acquaintances or colleagues? If you are not close to the person, you may want to discuss any problematic behavior you see with someone close to the gambler, like a spouse, family member, or close friend.
Start by asking, “Do you think your gambling has become a problem?” After listening to their answer, you can say, “I care about you and I am worried. I’ve noticed that you are gambling more and using money in your savings. I’d like to talk about the possibility of a gambling problem.” You may also say, “I am concerned because you said you were only going to gamble $20, but you gambled hundreds.”

, The other person may become defensive when you begin the talk. Try to remain calm, and avoid being accusatory. Be sympathetic to their issues, and avoid judging them for their problem. Expressing anger or blame will inevitably lead to problems.

Avoid starting sentences with ""you."" Instead, use ""I"" statements. For example, instead of saying, ""you're wasting all of your money,"" you can say, ""I'm worried about how much money you're spending.""
Ask them about other parts of their life as well. Is there anything they're unhappy about? Are they struggling with depression or other issues?

, When you talk to the person about their gambling problem, calmly explain the consequences that can arise from their behavior. Don’t yell or get angry. Instead, remain logical as you present facts about the harm and damage compulsive gambling can lead to.For example, you may want to talk about the depletion of savings and the legal problems if you gamble money you don’t have. You can mention how gambling can put the person and their family into debt and cause problems for their loved ones. Gambling may also lead to violence, stealing, and lying.
You may want to say to the person, “Gambling can be fun when controlled. However, gambling can become a serious addiction. If you can’t control your gambling, you may end up in debt or losing the money you’ve worked so hard to save. Gambling may even end with jail time if you can’t pay your debts.”

, Some people may be glad that you brought up the issue because they didn’t know how to bring it up themselves. However, some people may get extremely angry or defensive when you mention they have a problem. They may think you are accusing them of something or become confrontational. Others may just refuse to talk about it.If the conversation doesn’t go well, let it go and broach the subject later. Avoid trying to push the subject when the other person is angry or unwilling to communicate.

Provide a listening ear to your loved one.,
Exercise patience with your loved one.,
Consider and encourage treatment.,
Determine treatment options.",How to Help a Hoarder1," One of the most powerful means of supporting an individual who hoards is to simply listen without judgment. Listening can help her articulate and process difficult feelings and thoughts. Instead of attempting to offer a quick solution, ask clarifying questions that help the individual to organize thoughts in a manner that motivates the solicitation of help with the problem.


Inquire about the reason for saving items. Individuals who hoard often save items due to beliefs in sentimental value, instrumentality (they think they can use it somehow or someday), and intrinsic value (they think it’s pretty or interesting in some way).Ask questions about the reason why the individual obtains or holds on to certain items.;
, While it may be difficult at times to understand why your loved one cannot part with a particular object that may seem like junk to you, hold your tongue and realize that she may not be ready to part with that item just yet.


Be cognizant that if your loved one does have a Hoarding Disorder (HD), the process of recovery could take time.

, If your loved one mentions that she wants professional help, ask if she would like help in locating and selecting a therapist. If she is torn between the desire to seek help and the fear of talking to a stranger about such a personal matter, offer to go along for a session or two as moral support.


The best form of help for a Hoarding Disorder (HD) would be therapy with a psychologist, Marriage and Family Therapist (MFT), or a psychiatrist.
Remember that the person who hoards may not want to get treatment. Do not force this idea on her.

, The most common form of therapy for hoarding is Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). CBT for hoarding is focused on changing the thinking that maintains the hoarding in order to reduce negative feelings and hoarding behaviors. Individuals who hoard tend to respond well to Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT).There are also group therapy options that are beginning to emerge.Online help and support groups have been suggested as helpful for recovery from hoarding.Explore medication options. Several medications have been indicated in the treatment of hoarding including Paxil.Consult a psychiatrist for additional information or to discuss psychotropic options.

Call the detox center or hospital.,
Take cues instead of giving direction.,
Enlist the support of other loved ones.,
Be patient.,
Bring mementos.,
Get involved.",How to Help a Loved One Through Detox2," Before visiting, become familiar with the facility's visitation procedures. Ask about visiting hours, spending the night, and their policy on visitors who are not immediate family members.

, Try to resist the temptation to visit your loved one whenever you want, without asking. Always make sure that your loved one wants you around, and abide by his wishes no matter how you're feeling. Let him direct your level of involvement, and don't take it personally if this level is lower than you expected. Some people find it easier and more comforting to handle pain and sickness on their own.


This same attitude also applies to talking about thoughts and feelings related to the process. Your loved one should know that you're available to listen without feeling forced to speak and explain while getting through a time of weakness.

, If there are others who you think would appreciate the opportunity to visit, give them information about visiting hours. Remember to brief them on how things are going, and give them the same instructions that you are following about how to be supportive visitor.


Don't bring anyone to visit that you think could potentially agitate your loved one. If you're unsure, check with him before inviting anyone else to the facility.

, Avoid putting any unnecessary pressure on your loved one. Since you are not around 24/7 to see the detox process through entirely, you may feel compelled to ask many questions about how he feels and what's happened since you last spoke. However, this may inadvertently make it seem like you want or expect him to be able to recovery very quickly.


You can still express love and encouragement without bringing an anxious tone into his room. Try talking about how proud and excited you are. Emphasize your awareness that the process is long and taxing.

, As an additional form of support, bring along with you any small tokens or forms of entertainment that you think your loved one might like to have around. Especially if your loved one gets homesick easily, have beloved objects with you and even things that might serve as motivators or reminders that recovery is important. These might be photographs, memorabilia, childhood toys, etc.


Check with the detox facility before bringing any home items to ensure they will allow your loved one to have them inside the facility.

, Many detox centers offer programs for the family of users. These might be family therapy or multi-family sessions. Taking this step in support of your loved one will send a clear message that you are available, unashamed, and happy to support him.12-step support groups like Alcoholics Anonymous and its variants (which exist for all addictive drugs) prove very helpful for maintaining ongoing sobriety. These groups usually have family chapters that you can attend.

Keep your attitude peaceful.,
Listen without judgment.,
Avoid bringing up touchy subjects.You are probably thrilled that your loved one is on the road to being able to see things more clearly than when he was using.,
Suggest distractions from cravings.,
Review reasons to quit.,
Talk about triggers.,
Understand that relapse can be a part of detox.,
Take care of yourself.",How to Help a Loved One Through Detox3," Practice patience and try to be as non-confrontational with your loved one as possible as they are detoxing. Consider that his body is going through a lot, and he probably is not thinking very clearly at this time. Don your best nurse attitude and try to focus more on what he is going through than whatever might have happened to make you upset.


Even if something happens that would normally provoke an argument, keep your cool and tell yourself that you absolutely must let your loved one take it easy now.
Try not to take anything your loved one says too personally. Don’t assume that he is trying to hurt you just because you got caught up in a moment of his moodiness.

, While your loved one is feeling vulnerable and ill, he may still want to discuss much of what's going on. Listen closely and give words of encouragement whenever possible. Congratulate him on getting to this point, and tell him how proud you are. If he says something disturbing about his current state or past drug use, don't react with shock or demand an explanation. Understand that you do not fully understand, and choose instead to simply let him speak from the heart.


It can also be encouraging to discuss and remind him to look at his reasons for stopping. This way he'll stay grounded in the purpose behind the taxing mission of detox.

, However, detox is not the stage of recovery to try and talk out issues that may be looming from the past or plans for how to carry forward. For now, just show lots of support and be very present; after all, your loved one is in a very vulnerable, physically painful place.

, Because cravings provide a major hurdle through detoxing, do whatever you can to distract your loved one. Cravings pass when they are not indulged. Reassurance about how well he is handling everything will also serve as a reminder that going back to the drug is not the only way to make negative feelings go away.


Try activities that are engaging, but not too physically taxing. Watch a movie that you know by heart, play cards, crossword puzzles, and listen to music.
If your loved one decides it's too hard to go through with the detox, make a deal with him to wait an hour and then confirm it instead of just acting immediately.

, If your loved one is interested in talking through the detox, try to direct the conversation in a way that will motivate him to stay clean. Rehash all of the important reasons why he is detoxing in the first place. Remind him of all of the things he is excited to do and explore now that drugs are not going to be a part of his life. Assure him that you and others in his life are also thrilled to be able to connect in a new way that is not hampered by his addiction.

, In order to be more certain that you are doing everything you can to keep your loved one clean, to see through the whole detox process, ask him what triggers him to use. For example, he may be angered by the mention of his mother in a way that makes it especially difficult to resist the temptation to quell his craving. Without ever asking, you may not have known that you are mentioning something that hurts his ability to cope.


The same goes for things that may be lying around the house (besides the obvious, drugs) Specific movies, music, or TV shows might also be triggering.
Try to have the conversation early on so that you're not left wondering what might be needlessly creating a difficult environment for him to detox in or asking him to name his triggers at inopportune times.

, Remember not to get so excited about your loved one’s detox that you take it as a failure if he has a relapse and begins using again.Relapses can provide important information about what triggers drug use and where extra coping strategies may be needed. If you assume that a relapse means the whole detox was a failure, you could end up hurting your loved one’s morale at a crucial time where confidence and support are most important.

, Helping someone through a detox can be very taxing, and may require you to completely rearrange your own schedule in order to provide continuous company and support. It is hard work to be kind, positive, and understanding throughout the process. Make sure that you have others around to share the responsibility with you, and try to give yourself as many opportunities to recharge as possible.


When asking for the presence of others, be careful with your choices. Discourage any other users or people who might trigger cravings or anger in your loved one.

Therapy sessions help the person figure out why they gamble or diagnose any underlying conditions. In therapy, the person can learn how to cope with triggers and stressors that may lead to impulses and relapses.
If the gambling is severe, the person can go to inpatient treatment.
Say, ""I'm proud that you have acknowledged that you have a gambling problem. Compulsive gambling is a treatable condition. Here are some numbers for therapists who can help"" or ""I think you should get help for your compulsive gambling. Here are some places that treat your condition.""

Help them by encouraging them that they are on the path to recovery and doing better. Help them think about taking everything one day at a time.If the person has a relapse, help them stay positive and focused on treatment and recovery.

This was a minor slip up, but it doesn't erase your hard work"" or ""You have done really well getting your finances back in order. I believe you can continue to stay gambling-free. You're strong, and I have faith in you.""

, People who have certain addictions, like compulsive gambling, benefit if they have a sponsor or designated person that can help them if they face any problems during recovery. Gambling may be readily available, presenting temptation to the person. Offer to be someone the person can call or talk to when they find themselves in a stressful situation or on the verge of a relapse.For example, you may say, ""If you don't have anyone to call or talk to if you feel the urge to gamble, you can talk to me. I am here for you if you need me.""

, Most compulsive gamblers have specific triggers that will make them want to gamble. These triggers are situations, items, moods, or feelings that may lead to compulsive behavior or relapses. Help the person identify their triggers. This can help them know what to avoid or allow them to learn how to cope when faced with these triggers.Money is a common trigger for compulsive gamblers. Having cash or extra money in the bank account can trigger gambling. Needing money for bills or other debt may also trigger gambling.
Free time or boredom may lead to gambling.
Being near gambling, such as in a casino, a place with Keno, at a dog or horse track, or near lottery cards, may trigger someone.
Extreme highs or lows in moods may trigger the gambling impulse.

, The person may benefit from a list of reasons they want to stop gambling that they keep with them. This list can help them if they feel the urge to gamble or get in a compromising situation. They can read the list before making the decision to gamble, and hopefully avoid a relapse.Image:Help a Compulsive Gambler Step 11 Version 2.jpg

Encourage the person to make the list themselves and come up with their own reasons. They should come up with their own personal reasons for not gambling, like not wanting to disappoint their family, not wanting to lose their trust, and increasing their debt.
They may also want to update this list as time passes without gambling. One reason not to gamble could be, ""I have gone without gambling for one/three/six months and don't want to break my streak.""

"
"
Keep the person busy.,
Encourage that the person pursue hobbies.,
Help them work on their finances.",How to Help a Compulsive Gambler4," Some people relapse because they are bored or have unstructured time. To help with this, help the person learn how to keep busy. You can spend time with the person and do things, like go to movies, have dinner, or exercise together. Encourage the person to make a schedule and fill their time so they won’t be tempted to gamble.Help the person learn how to fill their down time. They can spend time with family and friends, work on a list of movies they’d like to watch, or read books they’ve been wanting to read.
You may say, ""How would you like to go to the movies?"" or ""Why don't you call your family and spend the weekend with them?""

, A way the person can fill their down time and refocus their attention away from gambling is to find hobbies to replace the gambling. This can also help them fill any down time.

They may take a painting class or start drawing.

, You may want to help the person work on getting their finances in order. Compulsive gambling can lead to serious financial consequences and debt. The person may be at a loss with how to get things back in order, so you can help them figure out how to approach their financial situation.For example, you may help them give the control of their credit cards and bank accounts to someone they trust, like a partner or family member.
Suggest they see a financial planner. If that is not an option, sit down with the person and their debt and come up with an action plan for paying back what is owed.
Helping them come up with a plan doesn’t mean lending them money or paying things for them. You shouldn’t bail a compulsive gambler out of debt. Instead, help them deal with the consequences of their actions.

, Depending on your relationship to the compulsive gambler, you may have many negative emotions to work through. You may feel betrayed, angry, frustrated, ashamed, or sad. You may have lost trust in a person you care about, and the relationship may have changed for the worse. These emotions are common when dealing with an addict. Allow yourself to process and work through the emotions. Don’t try to suppress them.Talk to someone about it, whether it’s a friend, therapist, or family member. You may even want to talk to the person about how they made you feel. For example, you can say, “I feel very hurt by your gambling. I am ashamed that we have debt and I am angry that you stole money from me.”
Consider writing your thoughts and emotions down. You can write in a journal, or you may consider writing a letter to the person.

, Part of moving on and recovering is accepting what has happened. Dwelling on the past will do nothing for you or the compulsive gambler. Instead, acknowledge what happened, accept that it is a fact and happened, but move on. This may mean that you forgive the person, help them get treatment, or distance yourself from the person temporarily.Don’t obsess about gambling losses or the way things could have been. That is unhealthy thought patterns. Instead, focus on the future and what can be done to make things better.

, Helping someone who is a compulsive gambler can be emotionally taxing. You should take care of yourself first. If you can, get someone to help you with the person.

Use assertive communication.,
Offer your help.,
Help set goals.",How to Help a Hoarder2," Once you have provided adequate support, psychoeducation of the compulsion of hoarding may be the best first step in helping your loved one.Understand that hoarding is associated with excessive clutter, difficulty discarding items, and excessive acquisition of new items.Due to the emergence of hoarding behaviors, a new diagnosis of Hoarding Disorder (HD) was added to the most recent and updated version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), which is the basis for diagnosing mental health concerns.First and foremost, hoarding can cause health and safety risks. Explain to your loved one that hoarding is dangerous because: it may prevent you from being able to escape in an emergency, does not adhere to fire codes, and can lead to mold and other harmful buildup in the home. It can also cause complications in activities of daily living (ADLs) such as walking, moving around, finding objects, eating, sleeping, and using the sink or bathroom.Hoarding can lead to social isolation, disruption of relationships, legal and financial issues, debt, and property damage.Some issues that may coincide with hoarding behaviors include negative and unhelpful thoughts such as perfectionism and fear of regretting removal of information or objects, over-attachment to material items, reduced attention abilities, and lowered capacity to make decisions., Being assertive means saying how you think and feel while being respectful and appropriate.Discuss how you feel about your loved one’s hoarding, and the specific concerns that you have about your loved one’s health and safety.


Explain your concerns and set boundaries. Explain that you will not continue to live or be in the house if it is unsafe or unsanitary (if this is feasible).

, Tell your loved one that you are willing to help her if she is open to assistance. Be aware that people who hoard can have very strong emotional reactions when asked to give away their belongings.Assess the level of openness to your assistance. You could say something like, ""I know you've been concerned about your hoarding and I am also. I am here to help if you want it. What do you think?"" If the individual responds negatively and says something like, ""Absolutely not, I don't want you forcing me to throw away my prized possessions,"" you may want to back off for a while. If the individual says something like, ""I might be open to that,"" give your loved one some space to decide if she is willing to let you help. You can revisit the conversation at a later time.

, Individuals who hoard need specific goals to work toward in order to be successful in reducing hoarding behaviors. This helps them to organize their thinking and plans associated with reducing their hoarding.People who hoard may need help with motivation, organizing, avoiding acquiring items and removing clutter.Write down the specific goals you have developed with your loved one.

Identify specific criteria for keeping and discarding items. Ask the person who hoards what criteria she would like to create for getting rid of items versus keeping them. You could say something like, ""Let's see if we can make a plan that will help us organize our time. Would you be open to making a list of reasons to keep items? What are the types of items that you absolutely need to keep? What are the types of items that you can let go?"" Make sure your loved one is still open to receiving help, and if she is receptive to this idea you can move forward with your plan together.
Make a list of the criteria to keep or discard items. This might look like - Keep if the item is needed for survival or daily life, or if it is a family heirloom. Toss/sell/donate if item is not currently being used or has not been used in the last 6 months. Categorize and organize wanted items, as well as unwanted ones.
Talk about storage locations and systems of discarding items. Select interim locations during sorting. Sort items into categories such as: trash, recycle, donate, or sell., There are particular skills that are indicated in assisting the recovery of hoarding behaviors such as organization and decision making techniques.Help the individual who hoards decide on rules for acquiring, keeping and discarding items.


Do not simply choose which items to trash, have the person with the hoarding problem make her own decisions based on the criteria you developed together. If she is unsure, help her refer back to the list of reasons to keep or discard an item. You can ask questions like, ""Is this item necessary to daily life, has it been used in the last 6 months, or is it a family heirloom?""

, Instead of trying to clean out the whole house in one day, try starting with a room that seems to elicit the least amount of anxiety. Develop a plan that moves systematically by room or type of space or object.Start with easy items first then move to harder ones. Ask the individual where will be the easiest place to start; the place that she feels will be easiest for her to deal with emotionally.
Always ask permission first before touching any item that the individual is hoarding.

, Sometimes getting rid of clutter can be a time-consuming and emotionally draining process. Fortunately, there are organizations that specialize in cleaning, hoarding coaching and removal of items. Check your local newspaper or do a quick internet search to find an organization in your area.


If you find that hiring help is out of your budget, you can attempt to get other friends or family members to assist you. Try asking by saying, ""She needs our help with her hoarding, do you think you can spare a day or two to help clean the house and get rid of some of the items?""

, Help your loved one identify problems with obtaining new items.Work with your loved one to develop a hierarchy from easier to harder situations to deal with such as: driving by a shopping center, standing at the entrance of a store, walking through a shopping center/thrift store/mall, browsing a store, seeing an item you desire, physical contact with said item, and leaving the store without the object.
Ask your loved one questions that may help her to develop alternative thoughts about the usefulness or necessity of the objects she may want to obtain. For example, you can inquire by asking, “Do you have a specific use for this item? Can you survive without it? What are the pros and cons of having this object?”
Assist your love one in making rules for obtaining new items such as having a direct use for the item, needing the financial means to purchase the item, and requiring enough space to house the item.

, Once the therapy has begun, the individual may be assigned small tasks to perform in between sessions, such as cleaning out one corner of a room or clearing out a single closet. Offer to help with this process by holding the box or bag that will receive the discarded items, but do not take on the task of cleaning out the closet yourself. Part of the recovery is that the individual who hoards must be the one to make the decision of what stays and what goes.

, A person with a hoarding issue who successfully cleans out a closet one day may be incapable of tossing anything out the next day. Depending on the severity of the condition, the recovery period may take anywhere from a few weeks to a year or more before significant and consistent progress is made.

Recognize the possible causes of hoarding.,
Know the negative effects of hoarding.,
Remember that a hoarding disorder may not completely go away.",How to Help a Hoarder4," Hoarding affects 2-5% of people above the age of 18. Hoarding is associated with, “alcohol dependence; paranoid, schizotypal, avoidant, and obsessive-compulsive personality disorder traits; insecurity from home break-ins and excessive physical discipline before 16 years of age; and parental psychopathology.”Hoarding behaviors can also be a result of the individual wanting to hold onto items that remind her of individuals who have passed away, or to keep special memories from the past alive. Hoarding behaviors also tend to run in families, especially for women.Individuals with Hoarding Disorder may have brain abnormalities that result in difficulty identifying the emotional worth of an object, having normal emotional reactions and regulating emotions while making a decision (whether to buy, save, or throw out an object). , People who compulsively hoard may be more likely to: be evicted or threatened to be evicted, be overweight, miss work, and have medical and mental health concerns., Like many types of illnesses, the goal is to learn how to manage the disorder, not expect it to go away and never come back. Your loved one may always have the temptation to hoard. Your role as a friend or family member is to help the one who hoards balance that temptation with all the benefits that come from keeping the impulse in check.

Talk to your healthcare providers and trusted sources.,
Conduct targeted online searches for groups.,
Identify promising groups and ask questions.,
“Try before you buy.” No matter how much research you do and how many questions you ask beforehand, you never really know if an addiction support group is right for you until you give it a try.,
Watch out for scams, quackery, or “gripe clubs.” No matter how much we all like to believe we could never fall for a scam, we all have at one time or another.,
Evaluate the group continuously.,
Don’t try to get by on support groups alone.,
Get a professional diagnosis and treatment plan first.,
Incorporate support groups into your ongoing treatment plan.",How to Join an Addiction Support Group," If you are battling addiction, you should make sure you are under the care of an experienced and collaborative healthcare team before seeking out support groups. Ask the physician(s), mental health professional(s), and others who provide you with care for tips and references for addiction support groups.Also try asking loved ones, friends, and colleagues who have experience (firsthand or otherwise) with addiction treatment. See what leads they can provide.
Remember, though, that the final choice is always yours when it comes to finding a group that best fits your unique circumstances.;
, The internet is a fantastic resource for identifying potential support groups, but some common sense measures should be taken. For instance, start your search at recognized and respected sites that deal with your type of addiction, and look for groups that likewise focus on your particular addiction.Established organizations like Alcoholics Anonymous (www.aa.org), Narcotics anonymous (www.na.org), and SMART Recovery (www.smartrecovery.org) have search features on their sites that can help you find either online or in-person support groups that suit your needs.
Websites for government agencies that deal with health issues can also be a good resource. Some have links to support group sites, and may also have locator searches that can help you find a support group close to home.Many addiction recovery organizations offer both online and in-person support group options. Talk to your healthcare team and consider your own needs and preferences when deciding which may be best for you., Every case of addiction and every individual dealing with the problem is unique, so there is no “one size fits all” program for any single addiction disorder. Before committing to a group that seems promising on the surface, do some digging and ask questions of the group’s leadership in order to get a better “feel” as to whether the group is right for you.Start by asking basic questions regarding how the group functions and meetings operate. These might include:

“When and where does the group meet, and do the meetings always happen on this schedule?”
“How much does it cost?”
“Are the meetings more structured or free-flowing?”
“Are meetings led by a professional, a layperson, the members, or no one?”
“What affiliations if any does the group have to nonprofits, religious or other organizations, government agencies, healthcare systems, etc.?”
“Is everyone expected to speak at each meeting, or is it OK to just listen sometimes?”
“What are the policies regarding confidentiality?”


If you can’t get satisfactory answers to your questions, keep looking.

, Ask if you can attend a meeting or two as an observer in order to get a “feel” for the particular group dynamics.If you are required to join the group before you can attend a meeting, remember that you should never be obligated to keep attending if it isn’t the group for you. Never be afraid to switch support groups in order to meet your addiction recovery needs. Remember that the primary focus needs to be you and your condition.

, When you’re struggling with addiction and seeking help, you may be especially vulnerable and miss signs that your support group is not all that it is cracked up to be.“Red flags” for a scam might include high initial costs or rapidly increasing costs to be part of the group, or group leaders who push you to buy (perhaps from them) a particular product or treatment regimen.
Groups that promise a permanent “cure” for your disease of addiction or push you to stop your medications, therapy, or other treatments should also be treated with great suspicion. Addiction is a manageable, controllable condition when you find the right mix of treatments.
Groups that revolve around members complaining about their problems instead of seeking solutions and coping mechanisms are probably not worth your time. Nor are groups that judge your legitimate treatment choices. Remember, support groups are supposed to be supportive!

, No group remains the same, and neither will you or how you experience your addiction. Group members come and go, and circumstances and dynamics change within and outside the group. A support group that is perfect for you initially may no longer suit your needs shortly thereafter.Never grow complacent or feel obligated to stay with a support group that no longer provides what you need. Dealing with addiction is an ongoing, challenging process, and you need all the help you can get.
Try to evaluate the group regularly in the same manner as you did when you first joined it. If you wouldn’t have chosen to initially join the support group in its current iteration, then it is probably time for a change. Start your search again.

, A support group should always serve as a complementary element to your overall addiction treatment plan, no matter if you are addicted to hard drugs, fast food, or something else. Regardless of how supportive and helpful a group is, addiction treatment requires a range of methods and points of emphasis.As the name indicates, support groups should support your overall effort to manage your addiction. But support alone is not enough to overcome the problem.

, When you are ready to address your struggle with addiction, start with care under the guidance of medical and mental health professionals and addiction specialists. Develop an accurate diagnosis of your condition and an individualized treatment plan that addresses the physical, mental, emotional, and social elements of it.To successfully deal with addiction, you need to first change your behaviors, then work to maintain those changes. Support groups are best suited to the second task.

, Joining a support group shouldn’t replace or take time away from any component of your treatment regimen. Otherwise, the group is likely to do more harm than good in regards to the management of your condition.For most people struggling with addiction, the front line treatments include medications and therapy under the direction of trained experts. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), for example, which can help you develop new routines, perspectives, and coping mechanisms, is often a beneficial treatment option for addiction.

Know the risks.,
List what you do on the computer.,
Figure out how much time you spend in front of the screen.",How to Get Away from the Computer1," Too much time in front of a screen isn't just a time waster. It can cause physical and emotional distress. Understand how too much time on the computer can affect you. Adequately knowing the risks provides motivation to quit.


Spending more than 4 hours a day in front of a screen can increase the risk for heart disease, even if they engage in adequate amounts of exercise throughout the week.Some studies show that excessive screen time damages brain tissues and ultimately impairs the brain's ability to function. The frontal lobe, which determines success in many areas of life, is most susceptible to damage.Carpal tunnel syndrome is a well-known health risk of heavy computer users.
If you have pre-existing mental health issues, especially hypochondria and obsessive compulsive disorder, the onslaught of information readily available online can fuel unwanted thoughts. For example, hypochondriacs often turn to WebMD to self-diagnose benign symptoms as serious medical problems.While rare, some people develop Internet or Computer Addiction. Excessive use of the internet or the computer becomes addictive, causing emotional symptoms like depression, anxiety, and a feeling of isolation and physical side effects like back aches, headaches, weight loss, and weight gain. If you worry you might be suffering from an addiction to your computer or the internet, seek psychiatric care.;
, In order to understand where and how you're spending too much time on your computer or laptop, keep track of the websites you visit and anything else you do in front of the screen. Which websites are causing the problem?#Figure out how much time you spend online.


Do you use the internet primarily for social media? Are you a Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram user? Do you find yourself mindlessly scrolling a newsfeed? Try to figure out why you're drawn to social media sites and how you might be able to cut back.
Many people use the internet for watching television, movies, and videos. Do you spend a lot of time on Netflix and YouTube? Is watching things your primary form of relaxation? Is there anything else you can do to unwind besides indulging in online viewing?
Are you a news junkie? Do you read the New York Times, Huffington Post, and other news-related websites to stay up-to-date with the world? If so, could you subscribe to a few magazines or read a newspaper in lieu of getting your news solely through the screen.
Do you play any games? Many people use their computer primarily on their laptop, whether online with other players or solo. How many hours do you spend on computer games each night?
Track your computer time for a week, making a comprehensive list of all the sites you visit and anything else you do with your computer. Try to figure out what websites, applications, and games take up the most time.

, Many people are shocked when they actually calculate how much time they're spending on their computer. Figure out approximately how many hours a day you spend in front of the screen. This can be great motivation to quit.


You can use pen and paper to create a computer log for yourself. Write down the websites you visit, games you play, etc., and keep track of start and end times for your computer activity. Total the hours at the end of the day.
If you have trouble keeping track of information yourself, there is a time management and analytics app called RescueTime. It breaks down how much active time you spend on your computer and what websites, games, and applications you're focus the most attention."
"
Make an Internet schedule.,
Use technology to your advantage.,
Uninstall anything you don't absolutely need.,
Make access difficult.,
Take breaks.",How to Get Away from the Computer2," When it comes to using a computer, quitting cold turkey is no longer an option. We're increasingly dependent on the internet and email for work, our social lives, paying bills, and making purchases. Making an online schedule is a more viable option. Limit the time you spend online without completely eliminating the habit.


Plan what times you will go on your computer. For example, say you find yourself mindlessly passing the hours after dinner on the Internet. Limit the time you go online to one hour and, after that hour is up, find other ways to pass the time.List the websites you plan to visit. The reason many of us fritter away hours online is because of unplanned websites visits and, as many sites link you other relevant sites, you end up getting drawn in for hours. Go online only with specific intentions. Plan to check your email, Facebook, read a news article, and then turn off the computer.If you crave the occasional spontaneous internet searches, set a timer for how long you can search aimlessly. Give yourself one to two hours of unplanned internet usage and then disconnect for the remainder of the day.

, There are a litany of applications and add-ons available that can block your access to time wasting websites. Invest in some of these if self control alone isn't cutting it in terms of lessening your time on the computer.


If you're a Firefox user, there is an add-on called LeechBlock. You can block time wasting websites for specific time periods, ranging from a few hours to a few days. If you use Chrome, there is a similar add-on called StayFocused and Internet Explorer simply allows you to block certain sites by manipulating your blocking settings.There is a MacOS application called SelfControl that allows you to black list certain websites. You set a timer and you are unable to access the listed websites during that time. For PC users, there is a similar application called Freedom., If your computer time is caused primarily by gaming or using certain application, it might be time to simply uninstall.


What do you absolutely need your computer for? For most of us, we need our computers to check our email for work and access calendars and schedules. You might have different needs, depending on your location and occupation. Figure out what you need versus what you don't need and go from there.
It can be difficult to uninstall a video game you're prone to playing frequently, especially if you have data and information stored that will be lost. You might not have the personal will power to do so. Talk to a friend or loved one about how you feel you're spending too much time on the computer. See if they can come over and uninstall the game for you.

, Sometimes, out of sight out of mind is an effective tool to lessen your computer time. Simply making it difficult to access the internet or your laptop can give you added time to consider what you're doing and make the decision to take a break from the computer.


Rearrange your computer's screen. This is a simple but effective trick when it comes to lessening screen time. Remove browsers from your dock, as well as short cuts to websites like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. If you have your email set up in a mail application, remove the application.Change where you keep your laptop or computer. If your computer is easy to access, you're more likely to use it. If, for example, your computer is on a desk near your bed you're likely to start off the morning by checking Facebook. Have a designated area in your home where you keep your laptop and/or computer and do not use those electronics outside of that space.Unplug your modem. If you have to wait for the modem to start up, this will give you added time to consider whether you really need to go online. Unplug the modem after your designated daily internet usage.
Turn off your computer when you're not using it. The added start up time helps you slow down and reconsider how you're spending your time., Sometimes, even if we're wary about screen time, we have to be on a computer for work or school. If that's the case for you, schedule breaks to save yourself the physical and emotional side effects of too much computer time.


Schedule regular breaks if you're using the computer to complete a project. We are often tempted to take breaks on the computer. For example, after an hour of work we allow ourselves to check Facebook or Twitter. Instead of online rewards, go for a 10 minute walk every 50 minutes or take a break to have a snack or listen to your iPod.There are many 10 minute workouts you can do during your designated break time. Exercise helps us cope with stress and can counter some of the negative health effects of sitting in front of a screen too long. Push-ups, pull-ups, and squats are great options.Ten minutes of meditation can also help relax you. You can find meditation techniques online or ask friends who you know practice meditation."
"
Find hobbies.,
Seek psychiatric help.,
Use the internet to enhance your real life.",How to Get Away from the Computer3," A lot of the time, the computer serves as our primary form of relaxation. If you've fallen into a rut in regards to your recreational activities, try to take up some new hobbies to combat excessive internet use.


If you want something you can do at home after work, invest in crossword puzzles, sudoku, board games, and cards. If you live with a roommate, family, or a significant other propose a weekly game night.
Declare internet free days or time frames and use that time to engage in other activities. Oftentimes, getting out into nature can help curb internet usage. Try going for hikes on weekends or brisk jogs after work.
If you're the type who does a lot of reading online, consider buying physical books and subscribing to magazines related to your interests. Nightly reading can help you get away from the computer.

, A high amount of internet usage is sometimes associated with pre-existing conditions like depression and anxiety. Or you might be suffering from internet or computer addiction itself.


Know the symptoms of psychiatric disorders. Do you have a persistent sad, empty, or numb mood? Do you experience feelings of guilt or worthlessness? Do you have trouble making decisions and meeting deadlines because of these feelings? Have you had physical side effects, like weight lose or gain, insomnia, headaches, and digestive issues?Do you use the internet or computer to avoid or combat these feelings? Do you experience feelings of euphoria when going online that temporarily alleviate negative moods?You can find a psychiatrist by visiting your insurance provider's website and seeing where you plan is accepted. If you're a student, you can usually get free counseling through your university.
Be patient. It can take awhile to find the right counselor and you're uncomfortable with one therapist you can ask for a referral to another therapist in your area.

, If you use the internet to encourage an active social life, you'll end up spending less time in front of the screen. Use your computer to your advantage. Make plans and meet new people.


Make plans with friends. Facebook events, google calendars, and e-vites can be used to reach out to people and make plans. As most people spend a great deal of time online they might be more likely to respond to and remember an online invitation than one in the form of a phone call or paper invitation.Use sites like Meetup. Meetup is a website that advertises groups around any given city relevant to a wide array of interests. Create a profile on Meetup and go to events near. It's a great way to get out of the house and meet new people.Skype of Google Chat with long distance friends. One of the reasons being online too much affects us emotionally is because we feel isolated. If you use the video chat feature on Skype or Google Chat to converse with long distance friends, instead of increasing your sense of alienation the internet can bring you closer to others. While this seems counterintuitive, you might ultimately end up spending less time online if you're in a better mood.

Keep a food journal.,
Eat small meals throughout the day.,
Watch your portion sizes.,
Eat at least five servings of fruits and vegetables.,
Make changes gradually.",How to Eat When Recovering From Addiction1," Write down exactly what you eat and when you eat it. Make a brief note as to portion sizes as well. Don’t forget to write down what you drink. Keep journaling your food choices until you feel as if you are aware of your dietary patterns and what needs to be adjusted.


Writing down everything will help you to differentiate between hunger pangs and a craving for addictive substances. As your body begins to recover, you will see that many of your body’s cues are actually requests for additional nutrients via food.You can also download smartphone apps that will allow you to track your diet. This may be a more convenient way to store the information, just make sure to keep the entries accurate and up-to-date.;
, Start your day by eating breakfast about 30 minutes after getting out of bed. From that point onward, eat a small meal every two to four hours until your final evening snack. Staying full with a regular snacks and meals will keep your blood sugar consistent and help you resist giving in to other problematic cravings.


Carry healthy snack foods with you, such as almonds, so that you nibble on something healthy if you feel hunger pangs. If you need to keep your hands busy, you can choose a more interactive snack such as string cheese, which you can shred and eat piece-by-piece.If you simply don’t feel hungry (lack of appetite is common when in recovery), carry some saltine crackers with you and munch on them whenever you can. This will help to stimulate your appetite, keep your hands busy, and soothe your stomach.All of your meals and snacks throughout the day should total to around 2,000 calories. Try to maintain a balance of 30% calories from fat, 45% calories from carbohydrates, and 25% calories from protein., Your addiction may have inhibited your ability to sense when you are no longer hungry and full. Monitor your portion sizes by paying attention to product packaging and general nutritional guidelines. Go online and print out a small portion calculator or download an app on your phone to provide portion references for you.


One easy method to measuring out portions is comparing the food to parts of your hand. For example, a portion of cheese is the same size as your pointer finger. A portion of chicken should fit on the flat surface of your palm, making it around 3 ounces., Nutrient-dense foods are a critical component of an effective recovery diet. Consuming fresh or raw fruits and vegetables will increase your antioxidant levels, boost your immune system, and help to reverse some of the damage done to your body.Certain fruits and vegetables can target particular elements of your body’s recuperation process. For example, green leafy vegetables, such as spinach, can fight off nausea and intestinal issues. Acidic fruits, such as limes, can improve the functioning of your liver.Experiment with fruits and vegetables by trying out new ones each week. For example, if you’ve never had eggplant before, try making eggplant pasta one night for dinner. This will also prevent you from becoming overly focused on only one type of fruit or vegetable, meaning you will be getting a variety of nutrients.
Always thoroughly clean fresh produce prior to consuming, to clean off any potential pesticide residue or harmful bacteria.

, Being in recovery requires a number of major lifestyle changes, so don’t overwhelm yourself by expecting diet perfection overnight. Instead, pick a few areas to work on based on what your food journal shows and what your body tells you. For example, if you eat way too much candy, try to replace some of it with fruit in your diet."
"
Consume protein-rich foods.,
Incorporate fiber-rich foods into your diet.,
Add healthy fats to your diet.,
Take a good quality vitamin/mineral supplement.,
Drink plenty of water.",How to Eat When Recovering From Addiction2," Protein is one of the most important dietary elements for a recovering addict. The amino acids found in proteins can assist in healing your body’s tissues and organs. Protein may also boost positive chemicals in the brain, such as dopamine, providing a barrier against depression.Aim to eat around 10 – 15 grams of protein during each meal or snack session. This will keep you from feeling hungry and will also be easier on your digestive system. Nuts, lean red meats, turkey, and eggs are all good sources of protein., If your addiction led to problems with your digestive system, fiber just might be the answer for you. It will soothe your intestines and get them back on a ‘regular’ schedule. Remove all white flour from your diet and replace it with unrefined and unprocessed whole grains.


Whole grain pasta and brown rice are quick and easy fiber options. You can also get fiber from vegetables, such as beans, artichokes, and lentils.If you need an extra fiber boost consider taking a fiber supplement. These come in both caplet and stir-in forms., Not all fats are bad for you. Eating certain fats can actually assist in addiction recovery by boosting fatty acids. This, in turn, helps elevate your mood, turning it away from depression. Healthy fats can also assist in the absorption of vital nutrients from other foods.Olive, coconut, and flaxseed oils all contain healthy fats. Whole foods such as avocado and fish are also good sources., It is likely that your addiction period left you with a serious nutritional deficiency — malnourishment is a common problem among recovering addicts. Eating a balanced diet can counter some of this, but adding a multivitamin will fill in any gaps. You can also take supplements in order to get those good fatty acids in your diet as well. It is important to make your healthcare provider aware of any supplements you are taking, as they can interact with some medications.


B vitamins are particularly helpful when recovering from addiction. They elevate brain function and fight against signs of mental fatigue. Vitamin B5, for example, has been shown to help detox the body of harmful chemicals and is often used by recovering alcoholics.Most adults need about 2.4 micrograms of vitamin B daily.Remember that multivitamins are not a “cure all.” You still need to follow a careful diet as part of your recovery process., Try to drink at least eight 8-oz glasses (1.9 liters) of water each day; even more is better. Water will help flush your body of toxins and will hydrate your intestinal tract, which often suffers damage from addiction. Drinking a full glass of water before most meals is one way to reach your goal.


If you are struggling with nausea, pour yourself a glass of ice cold water. Take your time drinking it and that alone will help to calm your system.If unflavored water is too bland for you, try adding a lemon slice (or a slice of any other fruit) to each glass. You can also freeze fruit into ice cubes and add them in.Stomach upset can sometimes be a problem during recovery and coconut water has been shown to calm your digestive system. It also contains natural sugar for an energy boost and electrolytes to increase overall hydration."
"
Limit saturated fats.,
Limit processed and packaged foods.,
Keep a close eye on your sugar intake.,
Avoid caffeinated beverages and foods.",How to Eat When Recovering From Addiction3," These “bad” fats are often found in fast foods and processed foods. They burden your digestive system as they take more effort to process. This can lead to constipation and other intestinal issues especially if your system is already weakened. In the long-term, they can lead to heart problems as well.

, These items often contain high levels of sodium, which can dehydrate you and contribute to depression. This can then damage the recovery process. Processed foods are also tough on the liver, which has to process all of the artificial preservatives. Go with natural or raw food whenever possible.For example, instead of the prepackaged frozen fish sticks, grill a piece of fresh salmon instead.

, Many addicts fall prey to sugar addiction during recovery. Sugar provides a similar high to alcohol and can cause intense cravings as well. These cravings can lead to your reaching for sugar or the prior substance of addiction. It is best to eliminate all, or close to all, sugar from your diet.Part of following a healthy diet is also watching your caloric intake. Sugars provide very few nutrients at a high cost in calories. Sugar tricks your body into thinking it is satisfied., Caffeine is a stimulant and may contribute to mood swings. It can also make it harder for you to resist the temptation of other addictive substances.As a substitute for caffeinated beverages you could try herbal coffee or teas. The taste is similar without the potential negative effects. If you simply cannot live without your coffee, try to limit it to no more than two cups a day.If you choose an herbal tea, chamomile is a good option. It will calm your stomach down by reducing inflammation. Peppermint tea, in contrast, can irritate your digestive system."
"
Share meals with your friends and family.,
Shop for groceries with a team.,
Take a cooking class.,
Work with a nutritionist.",How to Eat When Recovering From Addiction4," Eating does not need to be, and often should not be, a solitary venture. Cook for your friends at home or meet them at a restaurant. Start to view food as both fuel and a means for fun interaction. Tell your friends about your nutritional goals and ask for their cooperation in monitoring your progress.

, The ""buddy system"" is often used as a model of accountability in recovery situations. Take this model and adapt it to your new diet. Invite family members or friends that you trust to go shopping with you for groceries. Make this a weekly or bi-weekly plan and, to keep it lively, switch out stores every so often.Add challenges into your grocery shopping excursions. For example, spend time reading the food labels and avoid buying any food item that includes any form of sugar in the first three ingredients., The more pride you take in your food, the better your diet will be. Enroll in a cooking class for amateurs at your local recreation center or through a cooking school. Most classes meet once a week and focus on a single dish or type of preparation. This will allow you to experience new foods and meet new people, thus moving further into the recovery process., Many recovery programs now include nutritional counseling. If you do not have a nutritionist, look for one online that works in your area. Many of them are affiliated with local hospitals and healthcare centers. You can even go to one that specializes in addiction recovery."

Consult your doctor.,
Talk to your friends and family members.,
Pick an inpatient program.,
Try an outpatient program.,
Consider the location.,
Check the staff's credentials.,
Review the treatment plans.",How to Get Off Adderall1," Let your doctor know that you have decided that you want to quit taking Adderall. Discuss with your doctor the different treatment options that are available to help you get off Adderall safely. Because there are different levels of Adderall dependency, your doctor will be able to recommend the best option for your particular case.Your doctor can also refer you to professionals who treat drug dependency and addiction.;
, Talking with your close friends and family members about your dependency may help you to finally decide to quit and stick to quitting. Only ask friends and family members who are truly supportive of you and that want to help you quit. Make sure that the people you are asking support from aren’t currently using or abusing drugs as well.Because withdrawal symptoms may disrupt your life, you may need to move in with a family member or friend until your life is under control.

, Inpatient programs are a great choice for people who are suffering from a debilitating and severe dependency. Inpatient programs offer 24-hour medical supervision and care. These programs allow their patients to focus on their recovery and to escape environments that may trigger a relapse. Choose from three different types of treatment centers:Residential programs have 30-day, 60-day, and 90-day recovery programs to choose from. You live at the treatment center and receive treatment there.
Executive programs are for patients who are working professionals, for example CEOs, who cannot take time off from work to receive treatment.These treatment centers offer business amenities like workspaces, meeting rooms, and Internet access. They are also highly confidential and have fewer patients.
Luxury treatment programs have the look of vacation resorts. They offer recreational activities and added amenities like private rooms, room service, workspaces, and fine dining. These treatment programs are more expensive.

, Outpatient programs are a great option for people who are suffering from a mild or moderate dependency. These programs are flexible and are scheduled around patients' school and/or work obligations. Therefore, they are great for patients who cannot drop work, school, or family responsibilities to enter into an inpatient program.Examples of these types of programs are intensive outpatient treatment, group counseling, partial hospitalization, individual therapy, and 12-step programs.
These programs offer a supportive environment where the patient can explore their dependency, receive medical supervision (if needed), and may require the patient to set aside a certain amount of time each week to attend the program.

, If you have a severe dependency, you may want to choose a program that is located far from home to escape environments that may trigger a relapse. If your dependency is mild to moderate or if you want the support of your friends and family, you may want to choose a center that is closer to home., Check to see if the nurses, therapists, counselors, doctors, and psychiatrists are required to be licensed or certified to work at the treatment center before enrolling yourself. In the U.S., each state has different certification and licensing requirements. Check the state's requirements to see if the staff adhere to the guidelines.At a minimum, the facility should be able to show proof that they are licensed to treat their patients and their primary staff/counselors should be certified by an accredited organization.
As a general rule of thumb, the more schooling, licensing, and certification a person has, the more qualified they are.

, Quality rehabilitation centers create individualized treatment plans to meet each patient's needs. Make sure the center you choose tailors treatment plans to their patients' needs. Treatment plans usually consist of an evaluation of the patient's addiction and other co-occuring mental health disorders, assisted detox, therapy, and aftercare. Some common treatment therapies used are:

The matrix model: an intensive program that takes place over a 16-week period. This treatment is designed to treat stimulant dependency specifically.
Cognitive behavioral therapy: this treatment places emphasis on the relationship between behaviors, feelings, and thoughts. Patients learn coping skills for high-risk situations.
Motivational interviewing: this treatment encourages patients to make positive changes in their lives through talk therapy.
Contingency management: a treatment where positive behavioral changes made by patients are rewarded to encourage abstinence from stimulants.

Give them a doctor's play set!,
Use guided role play.,
Do a test run where you leave the room.,
Give them fun books about going to the doctor's office.There are wonderful kid's books about children going to the doctor's office.",How to Get Your Child to Like Going to the Doctor1," You can get these in most toy shops, and they include plastic stethoscopes, thermometers, tweezers and other items commonly seen during an appointment. Get your child to play with it and pretend he/she is the doctor. Let them 'examine' you, and practice on dolls or stuffed toys.;
, Have them role play what will or might possibly occur during the appointment. You can play doctor and model how caring you will be. It's also fun to have them play the doctor—the aspects they are most anxious about will show up in their portrayal, allowing you to rest their fears.For example, you could ask, ""Can you show me where your heart is?"" When the child points to the heart, you can then say, ""That's right! Your heart is here. Now I'd like to check your heartbeat to see if it's regular. Is that okay?"" Then, show your child, through pretend-play, how the doctor will check their heart during a visit.

, Many children are terrified about being left alone in a room with an adult who is not their relative or school teacher. If your child's appointment requires you to leave them alone with the medical professional, you can ease their concerns by practicing what separating from them temporarily feels like.

, These books reassure them that there is nothing to worry about, but can do so in a more kid-friendly way! Provide them a book with cartoons or lots of pictures in and they will be less worried!


If your child responds more to videos than picture books, a number of fun videos exist online that show kids how fun going to the doctor's office can be. Child-oriented websites like Sesame Street, for example, offer a variety of free, fun videos that cover many types of doctor visits.

Work with your doctor.,
Know the symptoms of withdrawal.,
Expect withdrawal to begin within 36 hours of your last dose.,
Manage withdrawal during the first week.,
Anticipate symptoms for the next month to 90 days.",How to Get Off Adderall2," Tell your doctor that you have decided that you want to get off Adderall and why. Then work with your doctor to come up with a weaning plan that will suit your individual needs. For example, if your dependency is significant, then your weaning plan may be drawn out and your doctor may recommend therapy or an outpatient treatment program.Dependency is influenced by many factors, including the method of use (snorting, injecting, or swallowing a pill); length of time using the drug; amount taken each dose; family history of substance abuse; and mental health status.Your doctor can also recommend support groups, like Narcotics Anonymous (NA), where you may be able to find the support to help you stick to your weaning plan. These groups can also educate your friends and family members on how to provide you with the best support.
Your doctor may temporarily prescribe you antidepressants, or anti-anxiety or mood-stabilizing agents while you go through withdrawal. You may also need to temporarily use a sleep aid.It is essential that you work with your doctor to get off Adderall — do not attempt to adjust your dosage on your own.

, Though the experience of withdrawal will be different for everyone, usually the first week is when you will experience the most severe symptoms. As time goes on, the symptoms should lessen. The more dependent you are on Adderall, the more powerful and longer withdrawal may be. Symptoms may include the following:Insomnia
Change in appetite
Fatigue
Irritability
Depression
Mood swings
Anxiety
Tremors
Headache
Drug cravings
Trouble concentrating
Lack of motivation
Muscle aches
Seizures (see a doctor immediately)
Suicidal thoughts (contact your doctor immediately)

, Depending on the size of your dose and how long it takes to leave your blood stream, you may begin experiencing withdrawal symptoms between about six and 36 hours. You will likely experience fatigue, depression, and anxiety., The first week will likely be the hardest, as withdrawal symptoms are often the most intense during this time. You may experience vivid nightmares, irritability, and headaches in addition to fatigue, depression, and anxiety.

Try to stay distracted and busy during this time. Attend support groups, meetings, counseling sessions and family therapy if you are not in an inpatient facility.
Take any medications prescribed by your doctor exactly as instructed. Make sure you are eating well, getting enough sleep, and exercising to manage symptoms.

, Depending on your level of dependence, you may begin to feel normal as early as the second week of being off Adderall. You may experience an increase in appetite (as Adderall suppresses hunger), difficulty concentrating, and weight gain.Note that the weight gain is usually temporary, due to a combination of feeling fatigued and a return of your appetite. Your appetite should return to normal soon, and if you begin exercising, you should lose the extra weight.

Exercise.,
Sleep at consistent times.,
Restrict your work or school schedule.,
Cultivate your passions.",How to Get Off Adderall3," Exercise not only creates structure, but it is also a great way to deal with withdrawal symptoms like depression, insomnia, anxiety, and an increased appetite. Aerobic exercises, like swimming, cycling, walking, and elliptical trainers, are particularly helpful because they are low impact., By sleeping at consistent times, you are also forcing your self to take your medication at a consistent time so you can sleep. If this means taking your dosage at an earlier time during the day, then you will need to do this.Sleeping at a consistent time also creates a much-needed structure for you to successfully wean yourself off of Adderall.

, You will need to break old habits like staying up late to finish work or homework assignments, or staying late at the office. If your schedule is full, cut unnecessary activities and obligations that cause you stress or cause you to overwork.Remember that the average person completes three to five tasks per day.
Sign up for an aerobics class at your local gym.

, One of the most common withdrawal side effects is depression and a lack of motivation. You can combat these symptoms by engaging in activities that you are passionate about.

Tell them what to expect.The most common source of a child's anxiety about going to a check-up or appointment is not knowing what will happen to them.,
Explain the purpose of the visit.,
Have your child ask questions.,
Address guilty feelings.Sometimes if a child has a serious medical condition, the effort to get them to the doctor, and the disruption this might cause in the family routine, is something they will notice—even if they don't always have the vocabulary to explain what they see happening.,
Take them along to your own medical appointments.Where appropriate, one fast way to get your child more used to the idea of going to the doctor's office is by taking them along when you go for a check-up or non-stressful appointment.",How to Get Your Child to Like Going to the Doctor2," You can dispel that anxiety by simply telling them, in age-appropriate but honest ways, what they can expect. This approach uses information to allow them to visualize, in advance, the encounter that has them so worried because it is unknown.


For example, you can tell them that ""The doctor is going to have a soft wrap that will hug your arm like this. The hug will get harder and then stop, and that way we can learn how fast your blood is moving.""

, Similar to telling them what to expect, explaining the purpose of the appointment or check-up lets your child know why it's important and how the visit connects to their health and your family life. Educating your child will help ease their anxiety through knowledge.


For example, you can explain your child's dental check-up by saying, ""We need to keep our teeth clean so our mouths can smell good and our teeth can stay strong. We do a pretty good job when we brush our teeth after every meal, but the dentist has really special tools that can see hidden things we might miss because they're so tiny.""

, As you talk with them, have them ask you questions about what they don't know, what confuses them, and especially what they are afraid of. Take time to help them generate their own questions that they can write down and bring with them to the appointment. It will give them a greater sense of control and comfort if they can walk in with specific questions for the nurses, assistants, and doctors that they have come up with on their own.


For example, your child might be nervous about the pieces of gum they keep swallowing (that you have told them not to swallow). You could encourage them to ask the doctor, ""How long will it take for my gum to go through my body?""

, This can cause great feelings of guilt, with your child feeling that they are the cause of all the anxiety around them. Talk honestly and lovingly about any guilt they might be holding, assuring them that going to the doctor is not a punishment but an opportunity the family is fortunate to have.

, Take them along when they don't need to be examined, and let them see, by watching how comfortable you are, that there is nothing wrong!

"
"
Stay positive, calm, and confident.Your child will look to you for cues about the situation.,
Praise good behavior with compliments.,
Validate their fears.,
Reframe their fears.",How to Get Your Child to Like Going to the Doctor3," If you are tense, nervous, or fearful you may inadvertently encourage these emotions in your child. Even if your child has misbehaved at the doctor's office in the past stay confident that this time everything will go perfectly.

, Taking a child to the doctor's office is part of the work you need to do to socialize them into life as a member of a community. Remember that they are learning all sorts of social skills through this process, so be sure to compliment them when they behave the way you want them to, reinforcing the positive aspects of the experience.


For example, you could say, ""You were so good today when you got your shot! I was very proud of how you held my hand and did not want to close your eyes. In fact, you were so brave I think we need to go get some ice cream to celebrate.""

, While this is similar to giving them information, you won't know all the information you'll need to share until you have a sense of where their anxious minds and active imaginations have taken them. Ask them why they are scared, and let them know you will be with them, carefully watching, and that they will not be hurt by this experience.Remember that a trip to the doctor touches on most of the natural fears children have based on their psychological development—it's natural for them to be anxious about it! Talk with them to put them at ease.

, Telling your child ""It's not going to be that scary,"" might not feel comforting if your child is quite anxious and fearful already. Instead, get them to think about the experience in a different way by talking about how going to the doctor's office can help them feel better.


For example, you could say, ""Getting your teeth scraped today is going to feel strange and unpleasant for a few minutes. But when those few minutes are up, your teeth are going to be healthier, a whole lot stronger, and clean and shiny--just like the people we see on television.""

Understand different types of sex addiction.,
Observe common addiction behaviors.,
Diagnose a medical condition.,
Consider if you engage in risky sexual activity.,
Ask yourself if you use sex to cope or feel normal.,
Notice if you struggle with true intimacy.,
Ask if your self-worth is tied to sex.,
Think about your priorities.,
Decide if sex affects you negatively.,
Note sexuality in excess.,
See a therapist.",How to Diagnose Sex Addiction," There are lots of different behaviors that comprise the symptoms of a sex addiction. While some of these things may have a level of social or societal norm, you may practice them outside of that norm or to such an extreme that is interferes with your life. Some examples include:Compulsive masturbation
Having multiple affairs
Compulsively use pornography
Having unsafe or risky sex
Sadistic or masochistic practices
Practicing voyeurism or exhibitionism;
, Addictions have traits in common, regardless of what the addiction actually is. For example, some common addiction behaviors include engaging in the behavior even though you know it causes harm, finding it difficult to stop even when you want to, experiencing some sort of withdrawal symptoms when you don’t engage (irritability, restlessness, cravings, depression), and hiding your behaviors from family and friends or minimizing them.Do you engage in any of these behaviors regarding your sexual activity? How do they affect you? How does it interfere with your daily life?
To get more information and educate yourself, you may also want to look into resources on sex addiction, such as online or at your local library.

, Some medical conditions can cause changes to sexuality and arousal. You may want to have a medical check-up to rule out possible factors that can affect sexuality. Some considerations include having a brain lesion, endocrine abnormalities, or side-effects from certain medications.Check with your physician whether you are at risk for any of these problems.

, You might engage in risky situations which could hurt your emotional or physical health. Exposing yourself to HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) can be a long-term cost to what you consider a little bit of fun. You might put yourself in dangerous situations in the pursuit of sexual pleasure such as illegal prostitution.If you know the risks yet continue to put yourself in risky situations, this might be part of an addiction.

, You might feel stressed or overworked and use sex as a way to feel better. Just like drug addicts turn to drugs when life feel overwhelming, you might turn to sex. If you start to feel out of sorts or ‘off,’ you may use sex as a reset to return to normal.When you feel stressed, you might turn to sex as your first option to relieve stress over other options available to you. If you use sex as a stress reliever or if you have trouble stopping, then you may have a sex addiction.

, Some people with a sex addiction have trouble experiencing true intimacy. This can include being intimate with someone on an emotional level or sexual level. You may form little attachment to your sexual partners or fail to truly connect with any love interests beyond sex.You may want to have a relationship yet not know how to connect in an intimate way beyond sex. Sex may not feel fulfilling as a form of intimacy.

, You might feel as if you use sex to feel like ‘more of a man’ or ‘more of a woman.’ You might feel like you don’t know who you are without engaging in sexual activities or not have friends outside of a certain social circle that also engage the same way you do. If you take a break from sex, you might feel lost as to who you are.Outside of your sexual activity, you might have low self-esteem.

, If you arrange your life around sex and obtaining your sexual desires, you might have a sex addiction. When given the opportunity to engage with friends and family or pursue sex, you may choose sex much of the time. You might prioritize sex above other things that you have to do or neglect your responsibilities in order to have sex or engage in sexual activity.If you tend to skip out people or activities to engage in sex instead, this can indicate a problem.

, Many people enjoy sex and feel closer to their partners as a result of sex. Instead of feeling safe or intimate with someone as a result of sex, you might struggle with controlling your thoughts about sex or feel unable to postpone sexual feelings or actions. If sex and sexual activities take up much of your time and energy, it may be a problem.You might struggle to control thoughts or actions regarding sexual activity and feel unable to get them under control. Your thoughts may become obsessive about sex or wanting sex.
Even though you may engage in sexual activity often, you may not enjoy it or find pleasure from it., It’s difficult to measure what ‘excess’ means because healthy sexuality is different depending on individual factors and life stage. For example, a person in their early 20’s may masturbate or engage in sexual activity daily and still feel and be labeled ‘healthy.’ When considering your own sexuality, ask yourself if you engage in sexual activity even when you don’t want to, or go with someone you’re not attracted to in order to fulfill your desires.You might feel powerless over how you act. If you wish you could be happier with less sex yet cannot cut back, it could indicate a problem.

, If sex is affecting you negatively and you want more control over your life, consider seeing a therapist. Treatment focuses on helping you to manage your urges and desires and learning ways to engage in healthy sexuality. Cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) can help you identify negative thoughts and behaviors and learn to replace them with healthy, positive ones.If you’re done struggling with a sex addiction, it’s time to seek help.


You might also consider attending an open meeting of a local Sexaholics Anonymous group to see if you can relate to what the members share and get more information on the condition."

Make a list of all the situations in which you drink alcohol.,
Look for patterns.,
Find alternatives to drinking in stressful situations.,
Seek professional help.,
Know the warnings.,
Think about your brain.,
Make a health-focused plan.,
Increase satisfaction in your life.,
Tell others you need their support.,
Celebrate in new ways.",How to Drink Less," Studies have also shown that a majority of drinkers do so in moderate proportions to make a party more enjoyable; whereas heavy drinking or binge drinking is associated with the coping of negative emotions. Which side of the issues do you fall on?


Research has shown that alcohol produces both stimulant and sedative effects in humans.;
, Notice if you drink more around certain friends, or during sporting events, or by yourself. Is alcohol providing a positive experience for you? Are you getting into trouble when you drink? Do you say things that you regret later? Do you rely upon it to relax?


Change your routine. If you’ve developed a pattern or habit for drinking, you must break the habit. For example, if you meet at the same sports bar to watch football every Sunday, change locations and tell yourself, “New location. New habit of drinking less.” A change in location can facilitate a change in behavior.
Get a calendar and stick it to your refrigerator and mark a couple of alcohol-free weekends, or a few days per week. Writing it down will keep it visible so you won't forget, and will help you be accountable to yourself.

, If you are managing your emotions with alcohol, there are healthy alternatives. The key is to remain alert and aware of your behaviors as situations present themselves. You must catch yourself before reaching for a drink and choose an alternate path. Healthy alternatives to drinking alcohol include:


At a party: Drink a glass of water between each drink, and avoid doing shots of alcohol. Give yourself a gold star for sticking with your plan.
Work functions: Sip your drink and when you are done hold an object like a smartphone or tablet in your hand so you won’t feel the need to fill it with a drink.Financial troubles: Consult with a credit specialist or job placement counselor to develop a plan to increase your income and ease your financial troubles.
Physical pain: Investigate the possibility of entering a pain management program. Biofeedback is a drug-free way to help with pain management.A break-up: physical exercise will produce the same endorphins that alcohol produces. Studies have shown that people who exercise are less likely to be depressed.Walking, hiking, surfing, or tennis are all healthy alternatives.
Problems at school. For example, if you recently failed a class and are frustrated with your academic career, learn some relaxation techniques including breathing exercises and yoga., If you are experiencing extreme difficulty reducing your drinking, you may need professional help. Perhaps you thought you could drink less and realized that you drink too much and cannot stop. There are doctors and therapists available in your local area to help.


Alcoholics Anonymous chapters are available worldwide and can be located by contacting them directly 24/7 at 1-888-827-7180., Alcohol is a drug so there are health implications that must be considered. From a health perspective, you need to know what damage is being created each time you take a drink. You might think it is all fun, but your body behaves otherwise. If you need a reason to drink less, perhaps your health will be your motivator.


Alcohol is a toxin that puts a burden on your brain, heart, liver, pancreas, immune system, and is associated with cancers of the mouth, esophagus, throat, liver and breast.If you have a family member who has suffered with alcohol addiction you stand a higher chance of suffering the same fate. Children of alcoholics are about four times more likely than the general population to develop alcohol problems., Alcohol has a different effect on the brain of a heavy drinker. There is a higher release of endorphins (chemical in the brain that triggers positive feelings, and reduces your perception of pain)in the heavy drinker’s brain when compared to people who are not heavy drinkers. This difference causes the heavy drinker to consume more in an attempt to seek additional pleasure.Unfortunately, the more you drink, the more intoxicated you become and the more damage it causes.


This research is being used to develop effective treatment for people with alcohol abuse problems.
When the focus turns to seeking pleasure, you lose sight of the consequences of your behavior. For example, you keep drinking well past the point when everyone else at the party stops; then you decide to drive home and get arrested or cause harm to someone.
If your body enjoys alcohol, it is harder to give it up. You may need to seek guidance from a professional.

, Few people will challenge your efforts if you focus your motivation on health related issues. For example, if someone offers you a drink that you know is in excess of your limit, decline the person’s offer by saying, “Thank you for the offer, but I’m making some changes because of my health.”


Identify your objectives and make a list. For example, you will limit your social drinking to one drink to lessen the impact on your body; you will lose five pounds; you will order club soda with a splash of cranberry juice and happily enjoy your “mocktail” while toasting to your liver’s health; you will rise each morning after a night out and relish the feelings of not being hungover. You get extra points for exercising.
Determine a schedule for addressing and accomplishing each of them. Pick a day to start and stick to it. There will be items you accomplish when you are out in public and ones when you are home. For example, you will keep an ample supply of ice tea and other beverages at home to provide a healthy alternative to alcohol.
Allow yourself to make adjustments as you might find some techniques are more effective than others. No one is perfect. You will have slip-ups. The important thing is to be resilient and not give up due to your mistakes.
Reward yourself for your accomplishments in a non-alcohol related way. For example, take yourself to the movies, or out to lunch. Keep a list of your accomplishments as they will remind you that you are capable.

, You may be drinking because you are dissatisfied with your life. Alcohol is a quick fix, but has no lasting effects on your well-being. Take steps to create real satisfaction in your life. The more satisfied you are, the less you will be interested in drinking.


Investigate your interests. Get busy finding new and exciting things to do that don’t involve alcohol. For example, if you’ve always wanted to play the guitar, take a lesson. You will be focused on something new, which will distract you from drinking.
Brainstorm some activities you can do without alcohol. Instead of pub trivia, dancing or bar karaoke, try mini-golf, a hike, a movie or a picnic.

, Many times when you attempt to decrease your drinking, others will try to derail your plans. Even kind, polite people will offer you a drink because they think they are demonstrating good manners. You must speak up for yourself and make your wishes known.


Some people think it’s fun or clever to undermine your attempts to live healthier.
Approach every situation with a calm assertiveness that allows you to make decisions that feel right to you.
Don’t sabotage your efforts by wandering down the alcohol aisle at the grocery store. Temptation is best handled by not exposing yourself to the item you are trying to avoid.

, Drinking less doesn’t mean you have to stop celebrating life’s accomplishments. It means you can get creative. Staying fully present and unaltered in times of excitement allow you to feel things more fully.


Experiment by not drinking at a celebratory event to see how it feels. You may notice that you don’t feel that different. Focus on enjoying yourself and appreciate others instead of worrying about how much alcohol you are consuming.
Ask friends or others who don’t drink how they have fun. There are millions of people who don’t drink for one reason or another. They are having fun without being under the influence of alcohol. You may find the benefits of not drinking far outweigh the rewards you receive from drinking.
Remember, if you don’t spend money on alcohol, you can spend it on something else like electronic gadgets, clothing, sports equipment, or dance lessons. The end result: by drinking less you receive gifts that can enrich your life

Keep lines of communication open.,
Don’t ignore ‘slips’ in drug use.,
Organize sober social activities and networks that support abstinence.,
Keep track of your loved one’s treatment program.",How to Handle a Loved One's Sobriety Relapse," The sooner you deal with a loved one’s relapse, the better. In order to get a jump on the problem, you should keep a sharp ear and eye out for early indications of an oncoming or beginning relapse. For example, romanticizing about old times associated with using, or suggesting that casual or controlled use is possible, can indicate that your loved one is feeling the ‘itch’ to use.Speaking pejoratively about recovery programs, meetings, or sober friends can also be a sign of waning recovery and cravings to use.;
, In addition to verbal clues indicating drug use, there are often behavioral changes which can help you identify a relapse. Unusual mood swings can reflect the effects of substance use and withdrawal, while irritability or defensiveness can indicate the fact that your loved one has something to hide.Also be sure to keep track of any misplaced cash, stolen credit cards, or missing household items, as these losses can mean that your loved one is paying for their habit.

, Once you think you’ve detected and identified a relapse, take some time to reflect on the event and get in the right mindset to handle it. While your first reaction might be panic, exhaustion, anger, fear, or disheartenment, don’t let these feelings weigh you down. Instead, remember that recovery is a long and bumpy road, and that most addicts experience a relapse at one time or another.If you’re having trouble dealing with the idea of your loved one’s relapse and the task ahead, go to a support group meeting for allies and family members, such as Al-Anon. The group will be able to provide emotional support for your discovery and decisions, as well as share valuable information, resources, and strategies for moving forward.

, The minute you suspect or discover a loved one’s relapse, you should contact them regarding your observations. If you’re not open about the issue from the get-go, you encourage secretive behavior and poor communication by modeling it in your own actions. By confronting them openly and promptly, you show respect and honesty, while also demonstrating that you won’t tolerate secretive or evasive behavior in your relationship.Make sure you articulate your concern in a loving, sympathetic manner, and also that you do it in a one-on-one situation so that your loved one doesn’t feel embarrassed or ganged-up on.
For example, pull the person aside for a moment and say something like, “Hey, I’ve been noticing you’ve been missing meetings and showing wild mood swings. Have you been using again? It’s okay, we can handle it together, but you need to be honest with me.”

, If your loved one feels genuine support and compassion from you, they’re much more likely to respond positively to your intervention and re-engage in treatment. Tell them how much you love them and how you plan to stick with them through another round of recovery. Remind and assure them that relapse is normal.You can also remind them that they’ve been through this before. This means that they’ve got the tools they need to be successful this time, as long as they keep trying.

, After expressing your love and support, encourage your loved one to seek out further professional support. Whether you offer to help them re-enroll in a rehabilitation center, accompany them to a meeting, or get them back in touch with a sponsor, sober friend, or addiction hotline, you need to be proactive about getting them back into an organized treatment plan.If you don’t know your loved one’s support network or prior treatment programs, contact a substance abuse hotline for local resources to which you can point your loved one.

, No matter what your loved one’s reactions to your relapse talk, you should be prepared for them to refuse help or continue using and lying. In this case, you’ll need to make it clear that you won’t tolerate substance use and will enforce consequences if the person continues to use. Failure to communicate and enforce boundaries can normalize addictive behaviors and compromise your ongoing relationship.For some families, partners, or friends, this boundary entails kicking the loved one out of the house until they reenter treatment. For others, it means cutting off phone contact, refusing to see the person socially, or suspending any financial or business ties.

, One of the best ways to alienate a relapsing addict is to cajole or push them into treatment with guilt. Since addiction is a disease and not an easily controlled behavior or moral choice, you can’t prompt them into good behavior by merely appealing to their values or punishing compulsive behaviors.For example, as tempting as it may be, don’t say things like, “If you really loved me, you’d see how much this is hurting me and stop.” Such appeals incite and exacerbate counterproductive feelings of guilt and shame rather than motivating the person to return to recovery., The unpleasant and discouraging experience of a relapse can be turned into a positive if you couch it as a teachable moment. Rather than looking at this relapse as a failure, look at it as an indication that current treatment measures need to be adjusted or redoubled.If your loved one was in treatment during the relapse, have them speak to a counselor about other options or approaches to add to their recovery repertoire. For example, if their AA group doesn’t seem to be helping, maybe your loved one should enter an inpatient rehab program, try a faith-based option, or one-on-one counseling.

, All addicts have specific incidents or situations which make them feel particularly drawn or compelled to use. Most people, for example, find stressful events, such as a death or crisis in the family, money problems or times of plenty, certain holidays, or parties, make them crave substances more than usual. If you can identify these triggers ahead of time, you can potentially cut off a relapse before it begins.When a triggering situation occurs, have a plan ready to prevent relapsing behavior. Double up on meetings, call the loved one’s sponsor and have them on-hand, or organize lots of sober activities to keep the person busy.

, Aside from special circumstances such as family crises or personal trauma, household friction or interpersonal conflicts are a major source of relapse for addicts. In order to decrease the chances of your loved one relapsing, then, you can keep communication and relationship negotiations civil.This doesn’t mean you have to eliminate all conflict or disagreements in your household or friendship circle. Rather, make a special attempt to keep these disputes level-headed, clear, and amiable.

, Honesty and openness are essential to preserving sobriety and supporting another person’s recovery. Discuss any problems immediately and without accusations, concede when one person is right or wrong, and agree not to take punitive measures for mistakes or disclosures borne from honesty.If you find the two of you getting in fights and showing poor communication, consider going to a professional counselor who can help mediate you and your friend or family member’s discourse.

, Slips are times when a recovering addict returns to substance abuse for a short period of time but gets back on track with recovery almost immediately. They differ from relapses in their length of time as well as in the nature of the lapse: rather than going back to old patterns of behavior and losing motivation as they do in a relapse, they retain the values and commitment to treatment. While slips are less severe than relapses, you need to take them seriously by recognizing and responding to them.If you ignore slips, you’re implicitly encouraging drug use and paving the way to a relapse.

, Often times, an addict’s whole social life revolves around drugs or alcohol, so finding a network of friends and activities to fill up their sober life can be particularly challenging. You can assist them in this challenge and support their abstinence by coordinating fun group events that don’t rely on drugs or alcohol.For example, join a club sport or community art class with your loved one, or organize a board game night with sober or abstinence-supporting friends.

, While it’s ultimately an addict’s responsibility to maintain their recovery, you can help them stay on track by being informed about their treatment-related events, such as meetings, treatment sessions, and therapy groups. Keep a calendar of these appointments and make sure they attend them by checking in frequently."

Making sure that you get plenty of quality sleep as you get off caffeine can help fight the fatigue you may be feeling.Try getting at least seven to nine hours of sleep each night.;
, Making sure you get enough water during this time is important. Dehydration can occur when you are going through caffeine withdrawal. To help with symptoms and make sure that you get enough fluids, increase the amount of water you drink. Try drinking eight 8-ounce glasses each day., Without your morning caffeine, you may not feel like you have any energy. Physical activity can help boost your energy in the morning without a caffeinated beverage. Moving around and getting physical activity can get your blood moving and your body warmed up. Since caffeine withdrawal causes fatigue, try adding some light exercise into your morning routine.You can try going for a quick jog or doing a short workout at the gym.

, Herbal tea is a tasty way you can combat symptoms, plus it's caffeine-free. It can also help you stay hydrated. Dehydration sometimes occurs with caffeine withdrawal and can make your symptoms worse. Herbal tea also generally has health benefits, such as antioxidants.Try replacing your usual caffeine coffee or tea beverages with herbal teas.

Measure out the first tape piece.,
Anchor the tape at your fingers.,
Stick the tape up across your wrist and arm.,
Cut a second piece of tape.,
Attach the second piece of tape to your arm.,
Obtain a third piece of tape.,
Apply the third piece of tape.,
Check that you still have full movement of your hand and wrist.",How to Wrap a Wrist for Carpal Tunnel1," Measure the first piece of tape as the length between the middle of your fingers (with your palm facing upwards) to the bend of your elbow. At one end of the piece, fold over a section about 1” long. Use your scissors to cut two small triangles out of the end of the tape, on the fold. This means that when you unfold the 1” piece on the end, there will be two diamond shaped holes in the tape.These two diamond-shaped holes should be right beside each other and maybe 1 centimeter (0.39 in) wide at the middle.
The end with the two holes is considered the “anchor” piece.;
, Take the backing off the tape only at the ‘anchor' end where the two holes are. Holding your arm in front of you with your palm upwards, slide your two middle fingers through the two holes in the tape. Be sure to keep the sticky side of the tape facing towards your palm.Press the anchor end of the tape onto your skin, around your fingers.

, You will probably need a second person to help you put the tape on your arm, as you’ll need to keep your hand and wrist fully extended while applying the tape. Once your wrist is fully extended, take the backing off the rest of the tape as you stick it to your skin.To fully extend your wrist hold your arm directly out in front of you, palm up. Then use your other hand to pull your hand downwards so your wrist bends. Your hand should be at a 90 degree angle to your arm.
Do NOT pull or apply any tension to the tape when applying it to your skin, just take off the back and press it down onto the skin.
When you straighten your wrist and hand you should notice the tape has some natural folds or ripples in it at your wrist joint. This is to ensure you still have full motion of your hand and wrist while the tape is on.

, The second piece of tape should be exactly the same length as the first piece of tape, including the two holes in the end for your fingers. The same two middle fingers are going to go through the small holes again, but this time the adhesive side is going to go across the back of your hand and arm — so your arm needs to be palm down.As with the first piece of tape, remove the backing from the anchor piece only and slide over your fingers.
Press the anchor end of the tape onto your skin, around your fingers.

, Fully extend your wrist again, but this time you want your palm facing downwards and your hand is going to fold towards the inside of your arm. Slowly remove the backing from the tape as you stick it to the skin while in this position.Do NOT pull or apply any tension to the tape as you attach it to your skin.

, The third piece of tape should be the same length as the first and second piece, except it does not need to have any holes cut in it for your fingers. Instead, once it’s cut to the right length, break the backing of the tape exactly in the middle so you can access the adhesive side., Hold your arm out in front of you again, with your palm upwards and fully extend your wrist. Place the middle part of the tape over your inner wrist, right at the bottom of your palm. Because of the width of the tape, it will likely also cover a piece of your palm. Slowly remove the backing from one side and attach it to your arm. Do the same for the second side.Do NOT pull or apply any tension to the tape while taking the backing off and attaching it to the skin on your arm.
Because of the angle of your hand, the tape ends may cross over each other on the back of your arm.

, The purpose of the tape is to pull open the carpal tunnel and ease the pressure on your median nerve. The purpose is not to apply any additional pressure (which is why you didn’t apply pressure when attaching the tape to your skin). As such you should still be able to fully move your hand and wrist once the tape is on. If you can’t, you will need to re-do the tape."

Do some research at a local library or on the internet.,
Look for signs of Tourette's Syndrome.,
Do not stare if the person has a motor (movement based) tic.,
Ask the person about it.,
Do not joke about it.,
Be patient.,
Defend your friend.,
Let the person feel they can trust you.,
Don't talk about it.,
Make the person feel comfortable.,
Never tell the person that they are being naughty, bad mannered, rude, causing trouble playing up, making a show, etc.",How to Understand and Accept a Person with Tourette's Syndrome," The website tsa-usa.org is a great place to start.;
, When first meeting someone with this neurological disorder, it may or may not be clear that this person has TS. Some cases are very mild and only include motor or vocal tics. Other people have it worse. Their tics consist of yelling, flailing their limbs, and even facial tics that interrupt their speech.

, That is very impolite. If need be say that it is a little distracting. Be honest, but never rude.

, Don't be pushy, though. First ask the person if they are comfortable talking about it. If they are, ask away. Make sure your question is intelligent and not something such as ""Can't you just stop?"" No. They cannot just stop. TS is much like Parkinson's in that you simply don't have complete control over your body.

, It has become more common in stand-up comedy, but also tv shows and films, to make jokes about TS, especially about a symptom called coprolalia. A person whose tics include coprolalia will use swear words without being able to control them. Not all people with Tourette's Syndrome show this symptom. If they do, they are often treated negatively by strangers for being ""rude"", or laughed at. They are not being rude, nor is it funny or hilarious. Tourette patients with coprolalia do not ""have an easy life"" because they ""get to swear whenever they want"". Do not swear loudly at someone who annoys you, then grin and say ""I have Tourette's"". This makes light of a symptom they have to live with every day., If someone has a tic that interrupts speech (either motor or vocal) let him or her get out their thought. It's can be very irksome when people don't let you finish your sentence. Even if it takes them a whole minute to say ""I would like some ice cream,"" it's nice to say it.

, There will be those who bully, taunt, or insult your friend. Back them up and make them feel like someone cares. TS, among multiple disorders it's related to, will cause depression. Being made fun of makes you feel like total crap, so stick up for those who can't help it.

, If the person feels as though they can relax around you and talk to you openly, they will actually exhibit less tics than usual.

, It is okay to ask questions, but don't make it the topic of all your conversations. Pretend the person doesn't have it and go on with your lives as you usually would.

, Ignoring the tics, pretending they don't bother you, or just not reacting to them can be great. People with TS have enhanced bursts of tics when they are stressed. If people notice their tics they will become more stressed out, resulting in an increase their tics, making them unhappy about not controlling themselves which will stress them out further, increasing their tics yet again. It is a horrible cycle.

, This can antagonize or anger the person and they might react badly.

Don't bring too much attention to tics.,

Talk to your doctor about medications.",How to Tell the Difference Between Tourette's Syndrome and Transient Tic Disorder," Tics due to TS typically show up between the ages of 2-15, with the average age being near 6 years of age.TS often lasts into adulthood, but it always starts during childhood. TTD is also a childhood disorder, and in fact, the transient tics need to occur before the age of 18 years to be diagnosed as such.There's a lot of overlap between the two conditions in terms of age of onset, but TS often begins at a little younger age because of genetic links.


Tics that develop in adulthood for the first time are typically not diagnosed as either TS or TTD. Both conditions must originate during childhood to be diagnosed as such.
Boys are approximately three to four times more likely than girls to develop TS and TTD.;
, For a child to be diagnosed with TS by a doctor, they must exhibit both motor tics and vocal tics.Motor (movement) tics can include excessive blinking, nose twitching, grimacing or shoulder shrugging. Vocalizations can include simple grunts and repetitive throat clearing, or more complex verbalization such as yelling out words or phrases. Multiple types of motor and vocal tics in the same child is not uncommon with TS. In contrast, most kids diagnosed with TTD have either a single motor or vocal tic, but rarely both during the same time frame.


When repetitive words and phrases are spoken, it's considered a more complex vocal tic. Kids with TS are more likely to display coprolalia (yelling out socially inappropriate words or phrases — vulgar swearing) and echolalia (mimicking the words or phrases of others).
Despite how it's portrayed in movies and TV, coprolalia only occurs in 10 to 15% of people with TS., Although TS varies from mild to severe in terms of repetitive behaviors and vocalizations, it tends to involve the more complex tics. Complex tics involve several different parts of the body and the movements typically have a pattern or rhythm — such as bobbing the head while jerking the left arm and yelling ""Shut up"".By comparison, kids with TTD can also have complex tics, but not nearly as commonly as is seen in TS. Furthermore, TTD rarely involves complex motor and vocal tics at the same time.


The most common first symptoms of both TS and TTD are facial tics (blinking, raising eyebrows, nose twitching, grimacing, sticking out tongues). Initial facial tics are often added to or replaced by tics of the neck, trunk and/or limbs.
Tics of both TS and TTD often occur many times daily (usually in bouts or bursts of activity) nearly every day, although sometimes there are breaks.
The tics often look like really nervous behavior and can get worse with stress. Interestingly, tics usually don't occur during sleep., The duration of the abnormal behavior and tics is the biggest factor in distinguishing TTD from TS.To be diagnosed with TTD, a child has to display a tic(s) for at least four weeks almost every day, but less than a year.In contrast, for TS to be diagnosed, tics must be present for more than a year.That's why time and patience are needed to get an accurate diagnosis and to distinguish between TTD and TS.


Most cases of TTD fade away within weeks to months, well within the one year time period.
Tics that last a year or a little more may be called ""chronic tics"" until enough time passes that qualifies for a TS diagnosis.
TTD is much more common than TS. About 10% of kids develop TTD during their early school years, which later fades away.In contrast, about 1% of Americans have mild TS and approximately 200,000 have severe TS (both kids and adults combined)., A relatively good predictor of potential tics in a child is seeing tic behavior in their parents, siblings or close relatives. TS, in particular, seems to have a relatively strong genetic link, whereas environmental factors (stress, abuse, diet) likely plays a larger role with TTD. Regardless, TS is regarded as a complex neurological disorder influenced by a combination of factors, including genetic (inherited), environmental, behavioral and chemical — especially the neurotransmitters in the brain called dopamine and serotonin.An inherited genetic condition means that it's passed on from at least one parent to child through genes located on chromosomes.
Research indicates that TS may involve inherited brain abnormalities in certain regions and circuits, as well as hormones called neurotransmitters — essentially communication among brain cells is disrupted or over-stimulated., Another decent predictor of potential tic behavior (for both TTD and TS) is whether or not the child has previous ""neuro-behavioral"" problems such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and/or autism.Significant problems with reading, writing and/or arithmetic may also be risk factors for developing tics.


Obsessive compulsive behavior includes intrusive thoughts and worries combined with repetitive behaviors — worries about dirt / germs get associated with repetitive hand-washing, for example.
TS in particular is strongly associated with co-occurring conditions. About 86% of children with TS also have at least one additional mental, behavioral or developmental condition — often either ADHD or OCD., When you see a tic develop in your child, don't assume the worst — that it will become a severe case of TS lasting the rest of their life. Instead, be patient and supportive, while trying to create a less stressful environment for your child, either at home or at school. In the vast majority of cases, childhood tics vanish almost as quickly as they come on, within a few months.If your child has a tic for more than a year, then a diagnosis of TS is likely, but there's still a chance of it going away or becoming very mild and controllable.


There are no blood, laboratory or brain imaging tests used for diagnosing tics. Most kids or adults are self-diagnosed after they, their parents / relatives or friends read or hear about TS or TTD.
Chronic emotional, psychological and physical stress is associated with virtually every behavioral abnormality. Look at your child's daily routine and try to spot the major stressors, then alleviate them if you can.

, Doctors, psychologists and counselors recommend that family members don't call much attention to the tics, at least at first.This is because unwanted attention, especially if it's negative and involves anger or disparaging remarks, causes more stress that can make the tics worse. If the tics become complex and severe enough to cause social problems at school and/or work, then consider behavioral therapy and/or medications if they persist beyond a few months.


If the tic doesn't go away within a week or, ask your child what's bothering them. Maybe they have allergies, a chronic infection or another illness. Short-term repetitive behavior is not always a tic.
Don't mimic your child's tic in efforts to be humorous or playful — it may make them more self-conscious or nervous.
Seeking therapy or medication for a mild tic in a child due to your embarrassment is not a good idea. Deciding on treatment should depend on if the tic behavior disrupts your child's life or has a real negative impact.

, Cognitive behavioral therapy is usually the first line of treatment for tics that are not accompanied by ADHD or OCD.If the tics are severe enough to negatively impact a child's life, then some form of therapy should be considered, regardless if the diagnose is TTD or TS. Therapy is usually conducted by a child psychologist or psychiatrist and can involve cognitive behavioral interventions and/or psychotherapy.During these sessions (multiple are often needed to be helpful) the child or adult should be accompanied by a close family member for support.


Cognitive behavioral therapies typically include habit-reversal training, which helps to identify the urge to tic and then learn to voluntarily combat it from happening.
Most tics can't be stopped completely, but they can be made less obvious or forceful.
Psychotherapy involves talking and asking probing questions. It can help more with accompanying behavioral problems, such as ADHD, OCD, depression and anxiety.

, There are medications to help control tics and reduce the effects of related behavioral problems, but they are not often recommended for TTD because of it's temporary or transient nature.Instead, these drugs are usually reserved for those kids or adults who suffer from severe TS. These psychotropic drugs can certainly change symptoms and behaviors, but they often have serious side effects, so weighing the pros and cons with your doctor is important.


Drugs that help control tics by blocking or reducing dopamine in the brain include: fluphenazine, haloperidol (Haldol) and pimozide (Orap). Ironically, a possible side effect is more involuntary, repetitive movements.
Botulinum (Botox) injections paralyze muscle tissue and may be helpful for controlling simple isolated tics of the face and neck.
ADHD medications, such as methylphenidate (Concerta, Ritalin) and dextroamphetamine (Adderall, Dexedrine), can sometimes help with tics, but they can also exacerbate them too.
Central adrenergic inhibitors, such as clonidine (Catapres) and guanfacine (Tenex), can help with impulse control and reduce rage.
Anti-seizure drugs typically used for epilepsy, such as topiramate (Topamax), have proven helpful for some TS patients."

The Third Eye Point, also called GV 24.5, helps relieve headache and head congestion. This point is found between the eyebrows, where the bridge of the nose connect to your forehead.Press this point with firm, but gentle pressure for one minute. You can try simple pressure or apply a circular motion. See which works best for you.;
, Drilling Bamboo, also called Bright Lights Points or B2, helps headaches that are located more in the front of the head. These pressure points are located at the inner corners of both eyes, just above the eyelid and on the bone surrounding your eye.Use the tops of both your index fingers and apply pressure to both points at the same time for one minute.
You can stimulate each side separately if you want. Just make sure to do it for one minute on each side.

Take vitamin and mineral supplements.,
Try peppermint.",How to Handle Caffeine Withdrawal2," For caffeine headaches, you can take over-the-counter pain relievers to help. This can help ease the pain as you work through the withdrawal. Pain relievers can also help with muscle aches.You can try ibuprofen, naproxen, acetaminophen, and aspirin.

, Caffeine withdrawals can disrupt your sleep patterns. You may not be able to fall asleep and you may wake up a lot during the night. Melatonin is a substance your body naturally produces to help promote sleep. Supplements can help you fall asleep and reestablish normal sleeping patterns. Take the supplement about 45 minutes to an hour before you want to fall asleep.Caffeine messes up your circadian rhythms, so melatonin can help you naturally get that rhythm back.

, Your body is detoxing from the caffeine while you go through withdrawal. Some of your organs, like your bowels, may be adjusting to functioning with caffeine to stimulate them. Vitamin and mineral supplements may help your body adjust better as you get off caffeine.Supplements you may want to try include vitamin C, magnesium, calcium, potassium, zinc, and B-vitamins.
You can also increase your intake of fruits and vegetables to increase the amount of vitamins and minerals you eat.

, Peppermint may be able to help with your withdrawal symptoms, like headaches or nausea. Plus it smells and tastes great. Try placing peppermint oil on your temples to help with headaches. You can also try sucking on hard peppermint candy. Peppermint tea, which is caffeine free, may also help with headaches or nausea."

Notice headaches.,
Recognize other symptoms.,
Cut out caffeine gradually to lessen the risk of symptoms.,
Expect symptoms to last up to a few months depending on your caffeine consumption.,
Reduce your caffeine consumption to a healthier level.",How to Handle Caffeine Withdrawal3," The most common symptom you may feel from caffeine withdrawal is headaches. You may get a headache as soon as 12 hours after stopping caffeine. The headaches may be worse for the first couple of days after you stop using caffeine. If you drank a lot of caffeine, you may experience worse headaches., There are other symptoms that may occur because of caffeine withdrawal. You may feel tired, have problems concentrating, or feel drowsy. Some people even feel like their brain is in a fog. Mood changes may also occur, like anxiety, irritability, or depression.Some people experience flu-like symptoms or muscle aches.
You may experience an erratic heartbeat.

, You may not want to quit cold turkey because you are worried about symptoms. Phasing caffeine out of your daily life, and therefore your body, may help reduce the symptoms you experience compared to stopping cold turkey. Try to cut back on the number of cups of caffeinated beverages you drink each day to start reducing your consumption.For example, if you drink four cups of coffee each day, you may drink three cups for a few days, then two cups for a few days, and then go down to one before quitting completely.
You can also try switching to half caf coffees or trying decaf.

, Caffeine withdrawal symptoms vary from person to person. Some people experience symptoms for a few days, others a week, while some people may go through withdrawal for two months. The duration of withdrawal symptoms correlates to the amount of caffeine consumed each day.Though some symptoms may continue for weeks, most of the worst symptoms go away after about a week.

, You may not want to cut coffee and tea out of your life completely. Despite having caffeine, both coffee and tea have positive health effects. However, if you consume too much, you may need to cut down, which can lead to withdrawals. The standard safe amount of caffeine for adults is up to 400 milligrams.This is approximately four cups of brewed coffee, 10 sodas, or two energy drinks. However, this caffeine content varies, especially for energy drinks or coffee from coffee chains.
Try to get an idea of how much caffeine you consume. Some people drink around 1000 mg of caffeine each day from coffee and energy drinks without realizing it.

Find the right type of tape.,
Apply the anchor pieces of tape.,
Put the ‘dorsal crosses’ of tape on your wrist.,
Remove the tape after a maximum of 48 hours.",How to Wrap a Wrist for Carpal Tunnel2," For this type of taping you’ll want to obtain adhesive, non-stretch (rigid) sports tape that is about 38mm wide. When this type of tape is used, it is suggested that a hypoallergenic underlay tape also be used. This underlay tape helps to prevent skin irritation from the sports tape.In order to avoid pain later, you may want to consider having the hair off your wrist area and the back of your hand. Do this at least 12 hours before you apply the tape.
The reason rigid tape is being used is to prevent movement of the wrist while the tape is on.
Wash and dry your hand and wrist before you apply the tape.

, The first piece of tape needs to go all the way around your wrist, like a bracelet. The second piece of tape should go around the palm and back of your hand, just above your thumb. Apply well, but not very tight. You do not want to cut off any circulation with these tape pieces.Simply estimate the length of tape required for each anchor section, as it’s okay if the ends overlap each other.

, First, position your wrist in a neutral position. Then place two pieces of tape across your hand and wrist such that the final result looks like an X on the back of your hand. One piece should run from the general area of your thumb down to the outside portion of your wrist. The second piece should go from just below your pinky finger to the inside portion of your wrist.To put your wrist in a neutral position hold your hand straight out from your arm and then tilt it about 30 degrees upwards (as your palm is facing down).

, Don’t leave the rigid tape on your hand and wrist for longer than 48 hours, but definitely remove it earlier if it is cutting off circulation or if it is causing you pain. You can use blunt-nosed tape scissors to help cut off the pieces of tape, or you can pull it off from the ends.Pull the tape off in the opposite direction of how it was put on.
It may also help to pull your skin slightly in the opposite direction of where the tape is being pulled.

Ask your doctor about corticosteroids.,
Speak to your doctor about surgery.",How to Wrap a Wrist for Carpal Tunnel3," While there is no direct evidence that carpal tunnel syndrome is caused by using your keyboard and mouse, those objects will certainly cause your wrist to become more painful if you already have carpal tunnel syndrome. Therefore, if you do work on a keyboard or mouse, or you work with other type of equipment that affects your wrist, take frequent breaks.Taking regular breaks can be used in conjunction with many other treatment options.
While taking a break consider rotating your wrists and stretching your palms and finger to help keep the area flexible and loose.
When typing on a keyboard try to keep your wrists straight, and avoid bending your hands upwards from your wrist to type., Cold, in general, helps to reduce inflammation. Putting a cold pack or ice pack on your wrist may help to relieve the pain of your carpal tunnel syndrome temporarily. Put cold packs on for 10-15 minute periods, and avoid putting those items directly onto your skin. Wrap the packs in a towel first.Alternatively, work to keep your hands warm as often as possible. Working in a cold room can often cause more pain and stiffness to develop. Consider wearing fingerless gloves while you work on a keyboard., Carpal tunnel syndrome can actually be made worse by how you sleep. Most people sleep with their wrists flexed in some way, which will aggravate any wrist problems they have. Wearing a splint while you sleep is one option to help relieve pressure on the median nerve while you’re asleep.Splints are designed to hold your wrists in their proper and straight positions.
Also try to avoid sleeping on your hands at night, as this added pressure may add to the pain in your wrists and hands.

, Yoga has actually been proven to reduce wrist pain and improve grip strength in people who suffer from carpal tunnel syndrome.Yoga poses that focus on strengthening, stretching and balancing the joints in your upper body are the most useful., Massage therapy provided by a registered therapist may help relieve any pain associated with muscle dysfunction. Massage is effective in increasing blood flow and removing fluid build up in the wrist and surrounding muscles. Start with a 30 minute massage. Please note that you may require three to five treatments to see any benefits.

, In some cases, carpal tunnel symptoms can be referred from trigger points, or more commonly known as muscle knots. These knots can appear in the wrist area, the forearm, and even the neck and shoulders. You can apply pressure yourself, looking for tender spots that recreate the carpal tunnel symptoms. Applying pressure for 30 seconds will lead to a gradual reduction in pain and discomfort. It's important to find as many tender spots as you can and address them. Perform this once a day until the pain subsides.

, Physical and occupational therapy, performed with the assistance of a physical or occupational therapist, could potentially help relieve pressure on the median nerve and reduce the amount of pain you experience. Ultrasound therapy can also be used to raise the temperature in the carpal tunnel area, which in turn helps reduce the pain.Both types of therapy would need to be done over several weeks, at the very least, before improvements would be noticed.

, NSAIDs include drugs like ibuprofen (e.g. Advil, Motrin IB, etc.) and may work to temporarily reduce the pain caused by carpal tunnel syndrome. NSAIDs are available over-the-counter at all drug stores and the generic versions are inexpensive.Be sure to check with your doctor before taking any new medications.

, Corticosteroids are drugs that can be injected directly into your wrist by your doctor. Corticosteroids are known to decrease inflammation and swelling, which may in turn release the pressure on the median nerve and make your wrist feel less painful.While corticosteroids come in oral (pill) versions, they are not as effective for carpal tunnel syndrome as the injected versions.

, For people who have severe and chronic carpal tunnel syndrome one potential option may be to consider surgery. Surgery can allow doctors to ease the pressure on your median nerve by cutting the ligament that runs along side it. Doctors can perform two types of surgery: endoscopic surgery and open surgery.Endoscopic surgery is where your doctor will use a tiny camera that can be put inside your wrist, and then tiny little surgical tools to cut your ligament. Endoscopic surgery is not as evasive as open surgery, and is easier to recover from. Plus it doesn’t leave noticeable scars.

Open surgery is where your doctor will make an incision in your wrist and palm so the carpal tunnel and median nerve can be seen. One your wrist and palm is cut open, the doctor can cut the ligament to relieve pressure on the nerve. Because of the larger incision, it can take a longer time to recover and there will be a scar.
Other surgical side effects are: an incomplete release of the nerve from the ligament, which means the pain will not be completely relieved; infections in the wound; scars; and nerve damage. Make sure you discuss all possible side effects with your doctor before making your decision about surgery.

Watch for memory loss, one of the first signs of the disease.,
Listen carefully.,
Pay attention.,
Spend time observing.,
Be aware of behavioral changes.,
Other signs can include going outside in their nightie/pyjamas, neglect of personal grooming and hygiene, accusing people of stealing/moving/hiding belongings.

",How to Recognize the Early Symptoms of Alzheimer's Disease," If someone has trouble recalling where they parked the car or what they went to get in the pantry, that is not unusual and may be a normal part of aging. The loss associated with early Alzheimer's affects short term memory, things that recently happened, such as not remembering that they ate lunch an hour ago. Another indicator may be that they are increasingly and persistently misplacing everyday objects like glasses or keys. Or putting the items in unusual places, like the refrigerator.;
, The inability to think of the word for common items like a spoon or hairbrush may also occur. This is not the same as being at a momentary loss of a descriptive word for something. The individual no longer knows what the object is called and may make-up or use a word that sounds like or has a similar meaning for the object. Speech and understanding become slower and they may lose their train of thought in mid sentence.

, Difficulty learning new things and making new memories is another indicator. The individual has a shorter attention span, may ask repetitive questions, and resists change. They also have trouble organizing their thoughts and thinking logically. This loss of processing skills might be evident in the inability to do things such as balance a checkbook or forgetting to pay for an item.

, Being unable to perform simple everyday tasks as effortlessly as they once did is another symptom of mild Alzheimer's. The individual may take longer doing routine things and become agitated if rushed. They may also get lost easily, even going to familiar places, and sleep patterns can become disturbed.

, One of the earliest changes might be a loss of interest in life or things once enjoyed. Less energy, a lack of spontaneity, emotional outbursts, and unprovoked hostility are other symptoms. The individual may also experience a loss of inhibition causing behavior such as undressing in public or making inappropriate remarks. The loss of the ability to judge time and space and what's going on around them can contribute to paranoid behavior.

Get more information online and buy Kinesio tape.",How to Use Kinesio Tape  for Carpal Tunnel Syndrome," Before applying any tape, make sure to wash your forearm, wrist and hand thoroughly with soap and warm water, then dry the entire area thoroughly with a clean towel.Leaving any moisture or oils on your skin will reduce the effectiveness of the adhesive (glue) on the back of the Kinesio tape.


To remove all oils and grime, consider using some alcohol-based hand sanitizer after washing with soap and water.
If you have especially hairy forearms and/or hands, then gently shave them at least one day before applying any tape so it will adhere to your skin better.;
, If you bought the Kinesio pre-cut wrist kit, then set out the strips on a counter or flat surface. The special wrist kit includes three strips: a long light blue one about 12-inches long, and two shorter black pieces about 6-inches in length each.The longer piece is meant for your forearm / hand, whereas the shorter black pieces are meant to wrap around your wrist for support.


Realize that the Kinesio pre-cut wrist kit comes with tape that has a paper backing over the adhesive material, which makes it easier to cut to suit your body proportions.
If your wrists are thin, you may be able to cut one of the black pieces in half and apply the two pieces separately for more support (see below).

, Once you arm is clean and dry, the first piece of tape you apply is to your forearm. It should be long enough to run from just below your elbow, to halfway down the back of your hand — a few inches away from your knuckles.In most people, the distance is about 12 inches, but it could be more or less depending on your size and proportions.


The long blue ""I-strip"" with the pre-cut wrist kit fits virtually everyone, although it may have to be trimmed if your forearm is relatively short. There are cutting guides on the back of the tape to help you.
Before apply the long strip of tape, flex your wrist down so that your forearm muscles are put into a position of stretch or tension.
When applying the Kinesio tape, try not to stretch it too much. Remove the paper backing, apply it firmly and press down on your skin so that it sticks well.

, Once the forearm piece is firmly attached to your skin, a piece around your wrist needs to be applied as if it were a relatively tight bracelet. If you bought the pre-cut wrist kit, the black pieces are meant to wrap around your wrist.If your wrist is thin, cut a black strip in half and wrap your wrist twice for best support.


Add a second band of tape to your wrist for better support, don't apply it too tight because you can cut off circulation (and nerve flow) to the hand and make your CTS worse.
Apply Kinesio tape at least an hour before any physical activity in order to give the adhesive material (glue) enough time to thoroughly bind to your skin.

, Most Kinesio tape jobs can remain in place and be effective for three to five days with some athletic activity and normal bathing, although you may be able to get a week from it if you're inactive and really careful when washing.The point of taping your wrist is to provide continual support and pain relief from CTS, so when it feels loose and the symptoms get worse, it's time to re-tape it.


Pulling the Kinesio tape off is usually pretty easy. If you're having trouble, try soaking your arm in warm water and/or using special tape-cutting scissors with blunt ends.
CTS is a chronic condition, so you may need to tape your wrist for many weeks or months to get symptom relief if you can't find the cause.
If the adhesive from the tape starts to irritate your skin, you may have to take a break for a few days or so to allow your skin to heal. Applying aloe vera gel can help skin heal quickly.

, Make sure to wash your forearm, wrist and hand thoroughly before applying Kinesio tape as moisture and skin oils reduce adhesion to skin.If you don't want to use an alcohol-based cleaner, consider using white vinegar or lemon juice to remove any tough grime from your skin.


An alternative to shaving hairy arms is to remove hair with wax (temporary fix) or laser treatments (more of a permanent treatment).
Allow you skin a day or two to heal from the hair removal procedure before applying Kinesio tape.

, If you bought a roll of Kinesio tape online or from your therapist, then you'll need to cut three pieces to approximately the same lengths (as mentioned above) with some sharp scissors. The longest piece should be about 12 inches (30 cm), and two shorter pieces should be between 4–6 inches long depending on the diameter of your wrist.Measure your wrist with a tape measure and then add an inch or so to figure out how much tape to cut.


All cut strips should be trimmed with round corners so its more difficult for the edges to pull off your skin.
When cutting adhesive tape, make sure your scissors are sharp and clean so it's easier to cut through the glue on the back. Use alcohol wipes to clean the scissors if needed.

, The first piece of cut tape you should apply is to your forearm, as it will act as an anchor for the band of tape you later put on your wrist.Before applying the tape, don't forget to flex your wrist down so that your forearm muscles are under tension.


Place the tape directly over the muscles, which make up the most fleshy part of your forearm. Do not put tape over the elbow bone.
The Kinesio tape may seem flimsy, but studies show that it impacts tension in muscle tissue and can prevent your wrist from flexing too much and increasing CTS symptoms.

, Once the forearm piece is down as an anchor, firmly apply a shorter piece around your wrist — a second piece might provide more support, as noted above, especially if you have a larger wrist with strong tendons and ligaments.With your role of Kinesio tape in hand, cut a piece long enough to wrap completely around your wrist without stretching the tape.


Add a second band of tape to you wrist for better support, but wrap it in the opposite direction. Make sure the ""joint"" of the first piece is fully overlapped by the second.
Reapply the tape within three to five days as noted above.

, Before taping or treating your wrist, it's important to know what's causing the pain or other symptoms. CTS is caused by median nerve compression within the the small carpal bones of the wrist.It's typically triggered by repetitive strains / sprains from overuse of the wrist, unusual wrist anatomy, poorly healed fractures and/or inflammatory arthritis.


Typical symptoms of CTS include: pain, numbness, tingling and/or weakness within the wrist and hand.
If you're experiencing similar symptoms in your wrist(s), make an appointment with your family doctor or neurologist so they can make sure it's CTS and not another disease, condition or injury.
Electro-diagnostic studies, such as an EMG and nerve conduction, are often done to confirm a diagnosis of CTS., Once it's confirmed you have CTS and not some other condition that can mimic it (such as a hairline fracture), see a health professional experienced with Kinesio taping.Your doctor may know how to do it, but he/she will likely refer you to a sports physician, physiotherapist or chiropractor who has more experience and training with the techniques.


At this stage, you should let the health professional tape your wrist with Kinesio tape so you can learn the technique and rational behind it, and then duplicate it at home.
Watch the practitioner closely and don't be afraid to ask lots of questions so you're clear on the most effective way to tape your wrist.
Other health professionals who deal with CTS and may use Kinesio taping include some massage therapists, acupuncturists or naturopaths.

, Once you're at home with your taped wrist, see how effective the Kinesio tape technique is for your CTS symptoms. If you think it's helpful, then watch videos and do more research online regarding Kinesio taping and where to buy it for home use. Your health practitioner (physio or chiropractor) may have some additional Kinesio tape to sell (or give) you, but there are many online sites to purchase from as well.


Kinesio tape is available for the wrist as special pre-cut pieces, which makes it very convenient for taping CTS and other wrist injuries.Purchase this type online if at all possible for best results.
Kinesio taping can typically be left on for several days (up to a week), depending on your activities, so that gives you enough time to do some research and order the tape before having to re-tape your wrist."

Learn what acupressure is.,
Use the correct amount of pressure.,
Choose the proper pressing aids.,
Talk to your doctor about using acupressure.",How to Use Acupressure Points for Migraine Headaches4," In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), acupressure is an approach that utilizes various points along 12 basic meridians. These meridians are energy pathways that are believed to carry “qi” or “chi,” which is the Chinese term for life energy. The basic concept in acupressure is that if there is a blockage in qi, illness is a consequence. The application of pressure in acupressure can unblock these energy pathways and restore the easy and unimpeded flow of qi.Acupressure has been shown to benefit migraine headaches in a number of clinical studies.

, When you do acupressure, you should try to use the right amount of pressure. Press the points with a deep, firm pressure when you stimulate the points. When you press the points, you may feel some soreness or pain, but it shouldn’t be unbearable. It should feel somewhere between pain and pleasure.Your overall health determines the amount of pressure you place onto the pressure points.
Some pressure points will feel tense when pressed. If at any time you feel extreme or increasing pain, gradually decrease the pressure until you feel a balance between pain and pleasure.
You should not try to endure any pain during acupressure. If something feels so painful that it’s uncomfortable or excruciating, then stop applying pressure., Since acupressure requires the pressing of pressure points, you need to make sure you use the right things to help you press the points. Most commonly, practitioners of acupressure use their fingers to massage and stimulate the pressure points. The middle finger works best to apply pressure to the pressure points. This is because it is the longest and strongest finger. You may also use the thumb. Some smaller, hard-to-reach pressure points can be pressed using a fingernail.Other parts of the body, such as the knuckles, elbows, knees, legs, or feet can also be used.
To correctly press a pressure point, you should press with something blunt. For some pressure points, the tip of the finger may be too thick. You can try a pencil eraser for small points. You may also consider using an avocado pit or golf ball.

, You can try these acupressure points on your own or you can go see an acupressurist or a traditional Chinese medicine doctor. If you decide to try these acupressure points, you should always let your physician know what you are doing to help yourself. These points will not interfere with any medication or any other approach your physician may recommend.


If these acupressure points provide relief, make certain you let your physician know. However, make sure to see your physician if these points do not provide relief.

Identify the two different types of headaches.,
Recognize the symptoms of migraines.,
Recognize the red flags for headache medical emergencies.,
See your physician.,
Treat migraines medically.",How to Use Acupressure Points for Migraine Headaches5," There are two basic types of headaches: a primary headache that is not caused by any other disorders, and a secondary headache that is caused by another disorder. A migraine is a primary headache. Other types of primary headaches include tension headaches and cluster headaches.A secondary headache can be caused by strokes, very high blood pressure, fever, or a problem in the TMJ (Temporomandibular Joint).

, Migraine headaches generally are only on one side of the head. Most commonly, they occur at the forehead or the temples. The pain can be moderate to very severe and may be preceded by an aura. Most people with migraines also get nauseous, are sensitive to light, odors, and sounds. Moving around generally makes the headache worse.An aura is a temporary disturbance in how you process environmental information. Auras may be visual, like flashing lights, blinking lights, or zigzags of light, or they may be the detection of smells. Other auras may be numbness that marches up either arm, speech disturbances, or confusion. About 25% of people with migraines also have auras.
Migraines can be triggered by all sorts of things and vary from one person to another. Potential triggers include red wine, missing meals or fasting, environmental stimuli such as flashing lights or strong odors, changes in weather, lack of sleep, stress, hormonal factors, particularly a woman’s period, certain foods, head trauma including traumatic brain injury, neck pain, and TMJ dysfunction.

, Headaches of any kind should always be evaluated by a physician. In some situations, a headache may signal a medical emergency. The red flags for medical emergencies are:A severe headache that occurs along with a fever and a stiff neck. This might be a sign of meningitis.
A thunderclap headache. This is a sudden and very severe headache that can signal a subarachnoid hemorrhage, which is bleeding under the tissue that covers the brain and spinal cord.
Tenderness, with sometimes a pulsating blood vessel, at the temple. This can, especially in older people who have lost weight, signal a condition called giant cell arteritis
Reddened eyes and seeing halos around lights. This can be a sign of glaucoma, which if left untreated can lead to permanent blindness
Sudden or severe headaches in people with cancer or a weakened immune system, like post-transplant patients and those with HIV-AIDS.

, Headaches can be symptoms of very serious conditions. You should go see your doctor to determine if you have a problem with primary headaches or a secondary condition that causes headaches. If you meet one or more of the following conditions, make certain you see a physician within a day or two, but no later:Headaches that occur with increasing frequency or severity
Headaches that begin after the age of 50
Changes in vision
Weight loss

, Medical treatment for migraines include the determination and elimination of triggers, along with managing stress and treatment. In severe cases, doctors may prescribe medications such as triptans (Sumatriptna/Imatrex or Zolmitriptan/Zomig), dihydroergotamine (Migranal), and a drug to control nausea and vomiting, if these are present.Triptans and dihydroergotamine cannot be used in people with coronary artery disease or uncontrolled high blood pressure and must be used cautiously in elderly patients or those with cardiovascular risk factors, including obesity, high levels of LDL cholesterol or triglycerides, or who have been diagnosed with diabetes.

Spending time in quiet settings with your love can help you manage your tic. This will also give you the opportunity to pursue romance by getting to know each other better.


Plan dates or time together in settings where you know you will be relaxed.
For example, instead of planning to go to the gym together right after work when it will be packed, plan to go earlier in the day.
Have a meal at your house instead of going to a crowded restaurant to eat.

, When you have a Tic Disorder and you are in a relationship with someone, you can turn to them for support.Part of pursuing romance means opening yourself up and letting someone help you when you need it.


Let your romantic partner know when you are having a hard time managing your Tic Disorder.

Let your partner know how they can help you manage your Tic Disorder.
You might say, “Sometimes just you talking to me in a calm voice helps stop my tic.”

, Work with your romantic partner to develop a way to handle it when someone asks them about your tic. Talking about it in advance and having a plan will help both of you handle any stress or possible embarrassment your Tic Disorder may cause.


For example, you and your girlfriend might decide that you are going to ignore people that stare or act rude.
Or, for instance, your boyfriend might choose to tell people, “My partner has a Tic Disorder, that’s all.”

Make a list of your positive qualities.,
Keep it in perspective.,
Socialize with others.,
Live a healthy lifestyle.",How to Pursue Romance if You Suffer from a Tic Disorder3," In order to remind yourself that you are more than your Tic Disorder, write down all the great things about yourself that you can think of. This will help you have confidence in yourself and confidence in pursuing romance.


Write down all the things you can do, your personality traits, hobbies, and interests.
You can even include your Tic Disorder on the list because it makes you unique.
For example, you might write, “I’m funny, smart, and full of energy. I have a tic and I’m athletic. I’m also good at writing poems.”

, Your tic may seem worse to you than it actually is.Don’t be embarrassed by something that you think everyone is noticing. They probably have accepted it and I doesn’t bother them. Accept that you have a Tic disorder and that it’s not that big of a deal.


Making a big deal out of your Tic disorder by being embarrassed or stressing about it can cause your tics to be worse.
When your tics are happening notice how many people are ‘’not’’ paying attention to you instead of how many people are paying attention.

, Spend time with friends and family that care about you and not about your tic.Being around people that accept you and your Tic Disorder can increase your confidence in yourself and give you the courage and support you need to pursue romance.


Join a local support group for people with Tic Disorders.
Volunteer at a local community center or for a cause you care about. Helping others will also help you feel good about yourself.
Hang out with friends and family doing things that you all enjoy.

, It can be hard to have confidence in yourself and to manage your tics if you are tired, hungry, or just don’t feel well. If you are taking care of your health in general it will be easier to manage your Tic disorder and easier to have confidence in yourself.


Your tic can be worse when you are tired so make sure you get enough sleep at night.Eat healthy meals and snacks that promote brain health and give you energy. For example, have plenty of vegetables, fruit, and limit your sugar.
Get some physical activity. It helps you be healthier in general, but there is also evidence that when you are focused on physical activity you are less likely to tic.

Arrange your workspace within a comfortable reach zone.,
Consider a footrest.,
Support your back.,
Align your hands and head with their ""targets."",
Ensure forearm support.",How to Use Good Posture to Prevent Carpal Tunnel," Make certain your seated elbow height allows you to reach your work tools, typically a keyboard and mouse, without reaching up or forward. You want your arms relaxed at your side and your elbows, wrists and hands in a straight line (i.e. the elbows are not bent).;
, If proper seated elbow height requires setting the seat at a height that puts pressure on the back of your legs in order for your feet to reach the floor, then you may need a footrest. Your knees should be at about the same height as your hips or slightly lower.

, An ideal work surface will allow you to pull into a ""body pocket"" such that your forearms are gently supported at your sides and the surface tilts towards you, enabling you to rest comfortably against the backrest and not have to sit straight up. Support to the forearms in a posture where the elbows are slightly lower than the hands makes it much more comfortable to use the backrest and open up your body angles.

, Use a chair that allows you to move while at the same time maintaining alignment of your head and hands to their primary visual and manual targets. Chairs that allow you to relax in an ergonomically correct posture and offer counterbalanced motion are ideal for this purpose.

, Any desk can easily be adapted to provide a body pocket by attaching a forearm support device. Such a device should offer a padded surface for the forearms and a positive tilt angle of approximately 9 degrees (front is lower than the back). Typical width of the body pocket ranges from 21 inches (53.3 cm) to 18 inches (45.7 cm); the deeper you pull in the more narrow the gap between the left and right supports. #* According to studies from University of California and Harvard, supporting the forearms with the mouse centered in front of the user and between the user and the keyboard produces the lowest amount of tension (muscle activity) of any possible position for the mouse, keyboard and user.

Forgetting a few things, like the rules of your favorite game or how to drive somewhere, is normal.
Forgetting which day it is is normal.
Making more errors while balancing the checkbook is normal.
Making a few bad choices is normal.;
, Forgetting a few things is normal, but if your memory is bad enough that it disrupts your everyday life, you may have Alzheimer's. Signs of serious memory loss include:Forgetting names, events, important dates
Forgetting big events that happened
Relying heavily on memory aids like sticky notes, apps, or notebooks

, People with Alzheimer's may struggle to concentrate, make plans, and do procedural tasks like following a familiar recipe or balancing a checkbook.Needing occasional help working the stove or TV is normal. Not being able to use them at all, or not being able to drive to a familiar spot, suggests a problem., A person with Alzheimer's might forget the season or year. They might get lost easily, and forget where they are or how they got there., While declining vision or cataracts are normal in aging, severe difficulties can mean Alzheimer's. People with Alzheimer's might struggle to read, judge distance, recognize their own reflection, and tell colors apart., While word-finding problems are typical of older people, someone with Alzheimer's may struggle to have conversations at all.Lots of difficulty finding words

Monitor your blood pressure.,
Maintain healthy cholesterol levels.,
Exercise daily to keep weight, blood pressure and cholesterol in check.,
Take steps to prevent or manage diabetes.,
Kick the smoking habit.,
Take steps to minimize dementia symptoms, even if you have already been diagnosed with the disorder.",How to Prevent Vascular Dementia," Most people diagnosed with vascular dementia are first diagnosed with high blood pressure, making this one of the greatest risk factors for the disease.


High blood pressure is also a risk factor for many other serious medical conditions, including cardiovascular disease and heart attack, so it is very important to manage this condition. Maintain a healthy blood pressure through a healthy diet and daily exercise and by eliminating smoking and excess alcohol consumption. If you cannot effectively lower blood pressure through lifestyle choices, medication may be required as well.;
, This will serve as effective vascular dementia prevention and lower the risk for other serious medical conditions.


Blood cholesterol levels indicate the amount of plaque build-up inside the arteries. By keeping these numbers at healthy levels, you ensure blood flow to the brain remains unhindered. Cholesterol is typically managed through a low-fat diet and daily exercise, but some people also need a cholesterol-lowering medication to keep numbers in check.

, Aerobic exercise has also been shown in recent studies to preserve cognitive abilities, and may even slow the progression of dementia once it starts.

, Diabetes can directly affect brain health. If you already have diabetes, keeping glucose levels under control can prevent damage to blood vessels that might contribute to the onset of dementia symptoms.


You can also take steps to prevent type 2 diabetes, by maintaining a healthy weight, adhering to a nutritious, low-fat diet and exercising daily. If you are at risk of diabetes, due to a family history or being overweight, monitor blood glucose levels regularly with your doctor.

, Cigarettes are highly damaging to the entire cardiovascular system, which can increase the risk of many related conditions, including vascular dementia.

, Those at any vascular dementia stage can still enjoy a high quality of life despite their diagnosis.


Remain active as much and as long as you can. Continue to eat a healthy diet rich in fresh fruits and vegetables, lean protein and whole grains. This menu will keep your heart and cardiovascular system healthy, which may slow the progression of vascular dementia. Seek support of family and friends, and stick to a regular daily routine as much as possible to keep stress and anxiety to a minimum.

An ideal goal is to do a combination of cardiovascular exercise (i.e. getting sweaty and getting your heart rate up) and strength training to build muscle.Walking and swimming are great for those new to exercise.


Aim for 30 minutes of cardio five times per week. This is the President’s Recommendation for physical fitness. Swim, run, do an at-home exercise tape – whatever gets your blood pumping.For those less in shape, even 40 minutes of brisk walking three times per week can be of benefit.Talk to your healthcare provider about any medical conditions before starting a new exercise plan.;

The ten best brain foods in the MIND Diet are green leafy vegetables, any other vegetables, nuts (walnuts, almonds and hazelnuts are the best choices),berries (especially blueberries), beans, whole grains, fish, poultry, olive oil, and red wine.This is a great diet for your body, too, since it can also help lower blood pressure and cholesterol.


The top five foods to avoid are: Red meats, butter and margarine, cheese, pastries and sweets (sugar), and fried or fast food.Fish contains omega-3s, which are great for brain health. Eating fish one or more times per week may reduce your risk of Alzheimer’s by up to 60%.Vegetarian options high in omega-3s are chia and flax seeds.Red grapes contain a compound, resveratrol, that may help protect the brain. Limited consumption of red wine may be beneficial. As with any alcohol, drink only in moderation (e.g. one glass daily maximum). Red grape juice is a good alternative., Your goal Total Cholesterol should be under 200 mg/dL, and LDLs (or “bad” cholesterol) below 100 mg/dL. However, there’s no “lower limit” to what your cholesterol should be – in other words, the lower the better.Indeed, studies have shown that levels of LDL, especially in middle life, impact the risk for Alzheimer Disease. Since hypertension has been consistently associated with risk of dementia, the average ideal blood pressure is 120/80, though that varies somewhat with age and medical conditions. Talk to your doctor about your ideal blood pressure, and strive for that goal.


Cut as much salt out of your diet as you can to help your blood pressure. Snack on fresh fruits and vegetables instead of potato chips, and season your food with herbs and spices rather than table salt.Mg per deciliter means there’s a milligram of cholesterol in every liter of your blood.

, People with type 2 Diabetes may be more at risk for Alzheimer’s, because when the body has a problem with insulin it can cause injury to the neurons in the brain.Keep your blood sugar within a healthy range to avoid negatively affecting your brain health. Diet, exercise, oral medications, and insulin injections can help.


Speak to your doctor about your diabetes. You should always attempt to control your blood sugar for health reasons. They can tell you what your blood sugar goal should be for your age and other medical conditions.
Exercise and diet are extremely important for controlling blood sugar, so talk to your doctor about a good diet and exercise plan for you to follow.

, These conditions can increase your risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease, so it is important to find ways to reduce your risk.Talk to your doctor about how you can reduce your risk for these conditions, and thereby reduce your risk for Alzheimer’s.

, Smoking is probably the risk factor for Alzheimer’s that you have the most control over. Smoking is linked to heightened odds of developing the disease, with smokers older than 65 having maybe up to 80% higher risk than non-smokers., There are numerous health benefits of drinking tea, especially green tea. Green, white, and oolong tea may be especially helpful in lowering Alzheimer’s risk. Coffee can also benefit your brain, although not as powerfully as tea. Try to drink 2-3 cups of tea a day."

In fact, middle and late stage patients may insist that they’re not hungry or that they already ate.


When dinner comes around, politely and calmly remind the person that they need to eat. Say something like, “Margaret, I made one of your favorite meals, would you like to join me?”
If you can't be present for meals, set an alarm to go off at dinner time. Make sure to put a note on the alarm reminding the person to eat when it goes off. Also, post notes on the refrigerator, microwave, and anywhere else relevant to the meal.
You may need to bring middle and late stage patients to the dinner stable, or if they can't move, you may need to bring the food to them.
Set an alarm to go off at meal time. It will remind you and them of meal time.;
, Depending on the condition of the person, you may also need to sit with them. This is because they might get side-tracked and may never finish. At the same time, you’ll be able to spend quality time with the person and help stimulate their brain.


Eat at the same time as the person.
If you don’t eat with them, use the time to talk to them or to clean up the area where they’re eating.
Invite the person to join you and your family for meals, if the person is a friend or relative., Depending on the stage of their disease, you'll have to physically help the person eat. Ultimately, meals will become a team effort.


You'll have to provide middle stage patients with some physical help. For instance, you may need to grab silverware for them, help them cut or lift food, and serve them.
Late stage patients will need substantial physical help. This will likely include you holding a spoon and feeding them one bite at a time.
Some late stage patients may not be able to eat solids at all, and will rely heavily on feeding tubes., In addition to the challenges from Alzheimer's itself, other health issues can cause a loss of interest in food or difficulty eating. Try to identify possible factors and talk to the patient's doctor about finding a solution:Many medications can cause a decrease in appetite.
Constipation and other digestive problems can lower interest in eating, as can serious conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, and depression.
Dental problems can make eating painful. Check for tooth pain, mouth sores, and poorly fitting dentures.

, You'll have to prepare food for people in almost all stages of the disease. This is because they'll largely be unable to navigate the complexities of organizing and cooking a meal. In addition, there are cooking-related dangers that pose risks to Alzheimer's patients.


If the person is in the earliest stages of the disease and lives on their own, prepare the food and deliver it to them with everything they’ll need to eat. Label a full meal such as pre-cut fish, mashed potatoes, and peas. If possible, deliver the food to the person while it is still warm so they don’t need to worry about heating it.
People in the middle or later stages of the disease should not prepare food for themselves., A simple trick to make meal time easier for Alzheimer’s patients is to cook foods that they like. By cooking their favorite foods, you’ll motivate them without coercing them to eat. It’ll save you and them a lot of energy.


Offer a varied menu so they don’t eat the same thing all the time. Even though the person has Alzheimer’s, they’ll likely remember if you serve them their favorite meal every night.
Try accompanying food you know they need to eat, like fresh vegetables, with food they love, like fried chicken.
Be flexible and open to preparing foods you might not normally prepare., People in the middle or late stages of Alzheimer's often have trouble swallowing. Serve soft, easy to chew foods, or cut the food into small pieces.


Avoid potential choking hazards, such as raw carrots and nuts.
Some late stage patients may need their food pureed, or they may need tube feeding., If the person with Alzheimer's has trouble swallowing, don't leave them alone at meal times. Ask them to sit up straight while they eat, and keep their head slightly forward, not tilted back.Check the person's mouth at the end of the meal to make sure there is no unswallowed food they could choke on.

Learn how to do the Heimlich maneuver in case the patient chokes.

, By establishing a meal schedule, you'll create order and stability for you and the patient. A meal schedule will ground you and give the patient a sense of predictability and routine.


Serve meals at the same time every day.
Build in enough time so the person has plenty of time to eat. For instance, instead of reserving half an hour, reserve an hour for meal time.
Plan meals ahead of time. Early stage patients might take comfort in knowing what they will eat in the future.
Post the meal plan and schedule somewhere the patient can view it. Early and middle stage patients will appreciate this. Remember, though, make sure to put a clock next to the schedule., One of the biggest threats to an orderly meal time for Alzheimer's patients are distractions. By removing distractions, you'll help keep the patient focused and make the experience easier for both of you.


Turn off the TV or radio.
Put pets outside or in another room.
Ask children and others who may live in the home to be quiet.
Put your cellphone on vibrate., By removing unneeded items from the dining table, you'll help create an environment that is as streamlined as possible. As a result, your meal time will be more smooth and less complicated.


Only place utensils the person will use, such as a fork or spoon. If you are cutting the patient's food for them, do not provide them with a knife.
Remove decorative pieces, such as flowers, from the table.
Avoid placing large dishes of food on the table, especially if the person is a middle or late stage patient., The dishes and place settings you choose are an integral part in making meal time easier for Alzheimer's patients. In the end, you need to pick dishes and place settings that will create order and make it easier for both of you.


Consider picking solid white dishes, so the patient will be able to distinguish their food from the plate.
Think about using disposable or plastic dishes. Ceramic dishes may present a safety hazard, as the patient might break them.
Avoid picking plates that are too large.
Stay away from patterned dishes, place settings, or table clothes, as these might confuse the patient., Serving food can be one of the trickiest things with Alzheimer's patients. By serving food, you'll remove the possibility that they hurt themselves, spoil food, or make a mess.


Serve the food away from the table.
Provide enough food for them to eat, but not too much so they will waste it.
Make sure the food is an appropriate temperature when you serve it. Depending on the food, it should be between 120 and 140 degrees Fahrenheit (49 to 60 degrees Celsius). Drinks should never be served hotter than 120 degrees (49 degrees Celsius)., If you want to take the Alzheimer’s patient out to dinner focus on taking them to restaurants they are very familiar with. By taking them to places they’re familiar with, you’ll put them at ease and make the dining experience much more enjoyable for everyone.


If the person has a favorite restaurant they’ve frequented since they were a child, go there. They’ll have good memories associated with it. Remember, though, they may get confused and think they’re visiting the restaurant with different people and at a different point in their life.
Avoid fast-paced restaurants that are very busy. This will likely upset the Alzheimer’s patient and make meal time uncomfortable.
Let restaurant staff know that the person has Alzheimer's.
Some middle or late stage patients should not be taken out. In fact, late stage patients may be bed bound or confined to a care center or hospital., Depending on the person’s condition, you may have to disconnect certain appliances in their kitchen. This is important, as the Alzheimer’s patient may inadvertently hurt themselves or someone else when trying to prepare a meal.


If the person’s condition merits, you should disable their oven. They may try to prepare something when no one else is around. This could result in a fire or a gas leak.
Remove blenders and electric knives.
Also remove unnecessary knives and other utensils they may hurt themselves with.
Some mid and all late stage patients should be restricted from cooking., Another way of safeguarding the person and making meal time easier is to remove all unneeded food as well as chemicals from the kitchen area.


Take all cleaning supplies out of the kitchen.
Remove food that is old or expired.
Put latches on any cabinets with possibly dangerous chemicals or other products., As a caretaker for an Alzheimer’s patient, you need to make sure that the person has a medical alert bracelet that lists their condition and any allergies they have. This is important, as you may not always be around and the person won’t always remember their conditions and allergies.


List their condition as an Alzheimer’s patient.
Include any allergies such as those to peanuts, shellfish, or lactose.
Detail other conditions such as diabetes or metabolic disorders or diseases., There may come a time when you will be unable to care for and feed an Alzheimer's patient and have to enlist help to do so. For most people, this comes at the later stages of the disease when the patient's cognitive abilities and mobility become severely limited.


Think about hiring a nurse or full-time aid if you don't have the time or ability to get the person to eat.
Consider moving the patient to a care center if you are unable to get the person to eat and are concerned for the overall well-being."

Note severe decline stages.",How to Know if Someone Has Alzheimer's Disease," Memory loss is one of the most common signs of Alzheimer’s. Be especially aware of memory loss that disrupts daily activities and causes confusion. Short-term memory tends to go before long-term so pay attention to failure to keep track of where things are, times, dates, and appointments.Try telling the person several pieces of new information and then ask them to recount that information about 10 minutes later. If they can’t remember, try it multiple times to determine if they may have Alzheimer’s.;
, People with Alzheimer’s often leave their belongings in strange places and have difficulty retracing their steps. This will usually start with objects that they don’t use regularly but will progress to everyday objects remote controls and cell phones. This forgetfulness often results in a pronounced irritability and a lack of critical reasoning as to where the object is. People with Alzheimer’s also have a tendency to accuse others of stealing their belongings when they can’t find them.Ask them to tell you where they have placed essential personal belongings that they use every day, like their wallet, keys, or phone. Consistent inability to locate these items may be a sign of Alzheimer's.

, Inability to follow a plan, solve problems, or work with numbers are all hallmarks of Alzheimer’s. Early stage Alzheimer’s patients will have trouble understanding complexities and multi-step problems. They often spend a long time calculating basic math and determining to-do lists.If you are in a car with them, ask them how to get to a local grocery or drug store.
Ask them to solve an algebraic or long division math problem. These math problems require multiple steps to work out and will do a better job of demonstrating their problem-solving ability than addition or subtraction. Try to choose a relatively easy problem as algebraic or long division math problems could be could be difficult for anyone.

, It is common for people with Alzheimer’s to lose track of time and dates. They often excessively check their watches or the date. They can also misjudge lengths of time and lose track of where they are and how they got there.Ask them what month it is or what season it is.

, People with Alzheimer’s often lose track of a conversation they’re having or struggle to follow along. They may also mangle common words or phrases or repeat themselves. Watch out for slurring, using incorrect words, or random, strange pauses in conversation.Give them a series of relatively long words with many syllables that you would expect them to know like “magnanimous,” “unencumbered,” and “perfidiousness” and ask them to repeat them back. If they slur or are unable to pronounce the word, this may be a sign of Alzheimer’s.

, If you are concerned that a loved one may have Alzheimer’s disease, then it is important to take them to see a doctor for a Mini Mental Status (MMS) Examination. This is the primary diagnostic tool for dementia, and it can also help to identify Alzheimer’s disease. Even with advances in neuroimaging there is still no way to assess cognitive function without some diagnostic test. Psychiatrist and Neuroscientist continue to rely on the MMS as a means to examine mental function and neuropsychiatric testing.

The goals of the MMS are to determine normal for abnormal cognition, dementia from delirium, and to diagnose primary psychiatric disease.
The mental status examination evaluates problems with arousal, concentration, memory, language, visual perception, executive functioning, mood, thoughts, praxis, and calculations.
A score of less than 24 out of 30 is significant for some form of cognitive deficit., People with Alzheimer’s often lose interest in their hobbies, friendships, work, or social activities. This may be caused by the difficulties of their condition or a general blasé attitude toward their interests. These changes in attitude should be assessed overtime.If you know they follow sports or politics, ask them about their favorite team or what they think about current events. If they are uncharacteristically out of touch, this may be a sign of intellectual withdrawal associated with Alzheimer’s.

, Alzheimer’s often causes abrupt changes in their mood and relationship with others. Look out for irregular expressions of confusion, anger, suspicion, depression, fear, or anxiety. Pay particular attention to how they behave when they are around new people or otherwise outside their comfort zone., People with Alzheimer’s often show poor judgement and decision-making ability. Watch out for a tendency to spend money unwisely or give money to telemarketers. They may be overly trusting or overly skeptical of people. They may also keep poor hygiene and an unkempt appearance., The early stages of Alzheimer’s may see only a minor decline in cognition or change in personality. It will be more difficult to decisively determine the person has Alzheimer’s but there are still some basic signs to look for. Ultimately, you’ll need a CTE scan from a doctor to confirm.Look for a tendency to fumble over words, trouble remembering names, gaps in short-term memory, and trouble organizing thoughts.

, The middle stages of Alzheimer’s usually last the longest and will require some level of assistance to care for the person. Periods of anger, odd behavior, and changes in their hygiene or appearance usually occur. Their forgetfulness will likely start to extend from short-term memory into longer-term aspects of their personal history. There may also be troubles with bladder and bowel control., The later stages of Alzheimer’s come with serious consequences that will require round-the-clock assistance for their personal care. They will often lose their ability to relate with their surrounding environment and memorize even basic aspects of their personal history like their name. They often lose the ability to perform core physical activities like walking and even swallowing."

Concussion and other head injuries can happen playing sports, falling from a bike, in vehicular accidents, and many other ways. Always take care to protect your head as much as possible. Wear appropriate safety gear playing sports and riding bikes and motorcycles, and never talk on your phone or text message while driving or biking.


In the elderly population, falls are a very common cause of injury – including head injury. Prevent falls by staying active and strong and setting up your house for safety. Ensure there are no loose stairs or carpets to trip over, and that you remain aware of where pets are in the home.This is known at Chronic Trauma Encephalopathy, which can be seen in athletes that suffer from constant concussions like hockey players, boxers, and football players.

, Do exercises like yoga, tai chi and pilates to improve your balance and coordination. Maintaining muscular strength and physical alignment can help prevent falls and subsequent head injuries in older adults., A great way to stay mentally fit is by learning new skills and knowledge. Learn how to play chess, take up piano or the fiddle, or study a foreign language; challenge your brain to go outside your comfort zone., You can solve puzzles like crosswords, Sudoku, or cryptograms.Risk is a great strategy game, and the game Memory is a fun tool for improving your memorization abilities to keep memory and cognition sharp.

, Drive a new way to work, change the order of your morning bathroom routine, or just read a different kind of book (historical fiction rather than your usual sci-fi). Changing up your usual routine can help keep your brain active and engaged.

, Research actually suggests that staying socially engaged as you age and maintaining close relationships with others can decrease your risk for Alzheimer’s disease. Challenge yourself to join a new club, start an activity, engage in a hobby, and reach out to those you know. Take advantage of Church groups, your local YMCA or community center, volunteer activities, and neighborhood events to meet new people and stay social., Maintaining your role in the work force may help you stay sociable and active. Some seniors find that when they retire they feel a loss of purpose, and their health starts to decline. Staying mentally and physically active at work may be of benefit for overall brain wellness, if your health is good enough and you enjoy your job.Or retire, then travel! You’ll be challenged by meeting new people and interacting with new cultures and languages.

, It’s well-known that getting insufficient sleep makes you less able to function well the next day, but the same may be true in the long-term. Set a regular sleep schedule and ensure that you get around 8 hours of uninterrupted sleep nightly.If napping during the day makes it harder to sleep at night, skip the daytime rest. When you start feeling that afternoon drag, go for a brisk walk instead of giving into the urge to sleep.
If you are unable to get a full night’s sleep for some reason, then nap during the day. It’s healthier to get enough broken sleep than not enough sleep.
Get tested for sleep apnea. This is a breathing condition that severely impacts your ability to sleep well, and is treatable., Feeling really stressed out releases a hormone in your body that negatively affects your health, including brain health over time.Lowering your stress level on a consistent basis can keep your brain healthy for longer.


Find an activity that helps you feel calm. Consider yoga, meditation, warm baths, slow walks in nature, or simple breathing exercises.
If you live a high-stress life because of work or family, study stress-management skills like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy or mindfulness. You can’t eliminate stress from your life, but you can change how you mentally and physically respond to it.

, Adults, especially older adults, who suffer from depression may have a higher risk of Alzheimer’s.Loneliness and isolation often play a hand in depression for seniors. Stay connected to your community. If you struggle with depression, seek the medical and therapeutic care you need to help improve your mood and mental health.

Talk to your doctor about your diet and if you get less than 5mg of vitamin E daily, consider taking a supplement., Vitamin B9 contains folic acid which, along with vitamin B12, may help prevent brain deterioration. Folate and B12 are the most helpful for this; vitamin D, magnesium and fish oil supplements may also be beneficial.Try to get as much folate from your food as you can. Foods high in folate include lentils, spinach, beets, broccoli, cauliflower, parsley, collard greens, asparagus and romaine lettuce.Foods containing B12 and other B vitamins are fish, potatoes, eggs, poultry, cereal marked as “fortified,” and red meat – but eat red meat sparingly and get a lean cut to keep cholesterol down., Berberine is a natural chemical extracted from numerous plants, including Goldenseal, Oregon grape, Barberry and Chinese Goldthread.Berberine was used in ancient medicine, and is now being researched more for medical purposes. It may lower blood sugar, lower cholesterol, and decrease the risk of Alzheimer’s.Research is still early, but speak with your doctor about taking any kind of herbal supplement.

, Alpha-GPC may be helpful in slowing progression of mild to moderate Alzheimer’s, especially when used in conjunction with standard medications. It is considered a safe non-prescription drug in many countries, and in the United States it is classified as “generally recognized as safe” (GRAS).Ask your doctor about its use and availability.

, No medication cures Alzheimer’s, but some prescriptions medicines exist that can help improve your symptoms. A class of drugs called cholinesterase inhibitors is used in cases of mild to moderate dementia. These include the medications Aricept (donepezil), Exelon (Rivastigmine), and Razadyne (Galantamine). In more severe cases, a drug called Namenda (Memantine) is usually used. Another, newer medication for moderate to severe dementia is Namzaric, which combines Namenda and Aricept.These medications have side effects, and should only be used as directed. Your doctor will help you choose the best medication for you or a loved one.

One of the earliest behavioral signs of Alzheimer’s is the progressive loss of short-term memory.If you find yourself forgetting where you left items or someone tells you that you are repeating yourself often, see your doctor.

, An early sign of Alzheimer’s is finding it progressively harder to converse with people, often due to forgetting common words like “car” and “pen.” You may know what you want to say, but be unable to find the word for it., People developing Alzheimer’s often struggle to finish tasks that used to be easy, like managing a budget. They may also become unable to navigate to a familiar place – even one they have known for a long time., Alzheimer’s patients may become unable to keep track of what day, month or season it is. If you find yourself being unsure where you are in time, see your doctor., Sometimes affected people start to put items in unusual or inappropriate places, such as repeatedly putting clean dishes in the refrigerator or stove for no reason., As the disease progresses, those with Alzheimer’s often become less comprehending of their cognitive problems. If you see these signs in a loved one, take them to the doctor.


People may demonstrate consistent confusion, such as saying “I want to go home!” while they’re home, or asking to speak with a loved one who has been deceased for years.

, There may be a genetic aspect to Alzheimer’s, meaning you may be more likely to get it if your parent or sibling has it. Know your family’s health history; if there’s a history of Alzheimer’s, note at what age it began. Tell your doctor, and you can both be on the lookout for early signs."

Plan ahead.,
Create a safe environment.,

Create a supportive environment.,

Anticipate behavior and personality changes.,
Share memories.,
Share laughter as much as possible.,
Maintain yourself.",How to Deal With Alzheimer's as a Caregiver," Look on the Internet or at the library. Find local organizations that offer Alzheimer's education. It will be difficult to face some facts, but you need to know what to expect.

There are 7 described stages to the progression of Alzheimer's disease. Many patients are not diagnosed until they have reached stage 4. Determine which stage the person is in, and what the symptoms are now and as the disease progresses.;
, A physician makes the diagnosis. Primary care physicians, neurologists, and psychiatrists are all very adept at making these diagnosis. Typically a MMSE (Mini Mental State Exam) is administered. PET scans and CAT scans are also done to rule out stroke as a cause of dementia (stroke caused dementia appears to have more step like decline in cognitive ability whereas Alzheimer's is a steady downward arc).

Although there is currently no cure for Alzheimer's, there are many medications (cholinesterase inhibitors) that will slow the progression of the disease, and in some cases, extend a patient's cognition longer than they would have had without medications. These medications include: Cholinesterase inhibitors: Aricept, Exelon, and Razadyne (a version of Reminyl). Cholinesterase inhibitors can be taken in very early to late stages of Alzheimer's. Namenda is a glutamate reducer that is taken as adjunctive therapy to cholinesterase inhibitors in moderate to late stage Alzheimer's
Alzheimer's patients live an average of 8 years after diagnosis. Some patients will survive only 3 years, and others survive up to 20 years.

, Once you are aware of how Alzheimer's disease may affect this person, think ahead and be ready for the changes that will follow, both in the short term and in the long run. You will need to prepare both materially and emotionally. Eventually, you will probably need to do the following: assist with toileting and personal hygiene; adapt mealtime rituals to suit their condition; and obtain a wheelchair when mobility becomes a problem., Make changes in your home that will protect the person you are caring for. Limit access to dangerous areas and medicine cabinets. Install child-safety locks and automatic shut-off devices. Install grab-bars in the bath. It may become necessary to take measures that will prevent them from leaving the house and wandering off., Your loved one may forget names for common objects. It will not help to reprimand. A person with dementia will not benefit from an argument. Offer love, emotional support, spiritual support, interesting activities, and social interaction with understanding people., A sufferer of Alzheimer's will lose the ability to perform complex tasks, then later, even simple tasks. The sleep-wake cycle will become disrupted, keeping you up some nights. They may suffer hallucinations, even the delusion that you are an enemy or impostor. Remember: As a caregiver, you are assisting a person—not a disease. Try to treat this person as you, yourself, would like to be treated., Enjoy sharing memories from the person's past for as long as you and they are able. As the person with AD is losing their capacity to retain or learn new information, talking about their past may enable them to revisit happier times., Although a person with Alzheimer's Disease may not be able to say who you are, or recognize even the closest relatives or friends, often their feelings can be expressed through interactions geared towards their current capabilities. Almost everyone is capable of receiving love and kindness., Try to maintain a sense of compassion, humor, and a willingness to learn new strategies to assist the person with AD, as well as yourself. The person with Alzheimer's Disease (and you, as their caregiver) will experience many changes over the course of time. This can be frightening and requires flexibility. You are both experiencing unknown territories. Be kind to the person with AD and yourself.

Most of the pharmaceutical manufacturers have programs for elderly individuals that cannot afford their medications.
Never make a promise that should not be kept. The best option for some patients is residence in a skilled nursing facility. They can provide health care and supervision that is not possible in your home.
Keep in mind that other family members and friends will want to help you with your difficult task. All you have to do is ask, and the worst that they could do is say no. Caregiving is very stressful and you'll need all the help that you can get.
Consider attending a caregiver support group such as is offered by organizations like the Alzheimer's Association.
Contact your local Area Agency on Aging through the Eldercare Locator 1-800-677-1116 or www.eldercare.gov to find out about free caregiver support services.
You could also write down a list or a guide to help you with every day things and or tasks.

It can be safely assumed that most people get the diagnosis of dementia at this stage, and this article is meant to help them in particular. Some people aren’t even aware that they have the disease during this stage, and they may not be diagnosed until they have proceeded to a more advanced stage.


When you are diagnosed with early Alzheimer’s disease, you are still likely to be able to keep doing much of what you have been able do and you will probably only need a little help during this stage. You may be able to make out how your abilities are changing. If this happens, you can tell others what it is like for you to live with the disease. You can help to plan and direct the care you will need from them in the future.
At this juncture, it is only natural to feel overwhelmed and scared or nervous about the future. It is normal for both you and your family to have many mixed emotions and concerns. These can include feelings of grief and sadness. Many people are concerned about how the changes will affect them, how they will plan for the future and get the help and information they need. The following are suggestions for living life to the fullest.
Please note that the term ""early stage"" refers to people of any age who have mild impairments as a result of Alzheimer's disease. This is different from the term ""early onset,"" which refers to people who have been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease at a younger age than usual.;
, Common symptoms at this stage include


Forgetfulness
Difficulty following conversations
Difficulty learning new things

Choose music for each stage of AD.,
Work with a music therapist.,
Make music associations early on.,
Make music part of the daily routine.,
Use music to combat sun-downing.,
Involve the person in music.,
Calm late stage agitation.,
Monitor the person while you play music.,
Avoid caregiver burnout.",How to Ease Alzheimer's with Music Therapy," You'll need a variety of music when using music therapy. Since songs create different feelings, it's a good idea to have music for different moods. Look for songs that the person has a positive association with. You can choose music that:Was their favorite song growing up
Was a special song the person shared with someone special
Was a song played at a special occasion
Was played during the time the person was between the ages of 18 and 25 years old;
, Unfamiliar music can be useful for several reasons. It can develop new responses since the person with AD has no memories associated with it. For example, a new slow-paced song may calm the person and help bring on sleep. Or, a new pop-song can energize the person with AD.


Turn off the music if the person isn't responding well to the music. The person might seem upset or wring their hands.

, Make a playlist of music that is energetic and that encourages movement. You should feel like dancing or swaying when you listen to these songs. Look for songs with solid rhythms, quick tempos, and catchy beats.


You may notice the person with AD tapping their toes or clapping along to the music when listening to these songs., Consider using classical music to calm or relax a person with AD. If the person is agitated or having trouble sleeping, you should have music that acts as a sedative to help them. Sedative music usually doesn't have a particular rhythm. It's usually slower paced.Sedative music has been found to reduce aggression in people with AD.

, Since music can create a powerful emotional response in the listener, pick music that's appropriate for what the person is going through. Each stage of AD has its challenges:Early stages: play music the person grew up with or favorites and take the person out to concerts or live shows.
Middle stages: choose relaxing music and play music throughout the day to improve mood. You can start playing songs as part of the daily routine.
Late stages: exercise or interact using music. Play music that soothes the person and try singing along to songs.

, Music therapists are trained in using music to help each individual patient. Their goal is to play or make music that improves the quality of life for the person with AD. A music therapist will determine the strengths and needs of the person in order to make a treatment plan.Most music therapists are part of an AD health care team. The person with AD can work one-on-one with a music therapist or as part of a group.

, In stage 1 or 2 of AD, get the person to listen or dance to music. You can encourage the person to play their own music too. In order to help later on, you should start playing certain songs when specific people are around. When the person struggles with memory in later stages, a specific song can help the person remember someone they associate with that music. During stage 1, most AD are still functioning normally. In stage 2, there may be subtle changes in memory, speech, and cognitive ability (although sometimes it's hard to distinguish between AD and old age causes)., Just as you can create associations between songs and people, you can use music to create daily habits. During the middle stages of AD, many people struggle with everyday functioning (like getting dressed, brushing teeth, or showering). To distract and relax the person, play songs that the person responds well too.For example, if the person is fighting against doing something like getting dressed, you may be able to distract by playing their old school song or a song the person grew up with.

, During the middle stages of AD, the person can become frustrated or moody, be more likely to wander, and be confused. People with AD begin experiencing sundowning. This is the worsening of symptoms late in the afternoon. To soothe the person, play calming and relaxing music.Refer back to the sedative music you assembled.

, Try playing karaoke or play music during any physical therapy. You can also encourage the person to learn an instrument or pick it up again if it's been a while since the person played. In later stages of AD, you can encourage simple music participation like clapping along or tapping toes to music.Listening and getting involved with music can improve emotional closeness with family or caregivers. Music can make the person feel happier or more secure.

, Use the person's favorite songs to calm agitated moods. Since people with late stage AD have trouble moving, playing upbeat, stimulating music could encourage the person to get up and dance or move around a little. With music, the person may seem expressive.By stages 6 and 7, the person with AD has severe difficulty with everyday functioning and memory. The person will have extreme trouble in communicating with others.
Individualized music was found to be more effective at calming late stage agitation than classical music.You can also try playing music during routine activities, such as bathing, which has been shown to help ease agitation., Since music means different things to different people, pay attention to how the person with AD is responding to the songs you're playing. Turn off the music if the person seems more agitated or upset. To avoid sensory overload, keep the music at a moderate volume and turn off any other music or television.Try to play music that doesn't have commercials. Commercials or interruptions in the music can confuse the listener.

, You should listen to music too if you're caring for someone with AD. It's easy to completely focus on the other person and neglect your own needs. But, research shows that listening to music can regulate your mood.Try listening to relaxing music before you sleep. Creating a simple habit like that can make it easier to fall asleep and make you calmer.

Focus on fruits and vegetables.,
Include seafood at least twice per week.,
Have some whole grains.,
Add a little olive oil to your food.,
Include beans in your meals.Legumes, like beans, are included in Mediterranean diets because of their numerous health benefits.,
Have a glass of red wine with dinner.",How to Avoid Alzheimer's with Diet1," Plant-based foods are at the heart of a Mediterranean diet. Make sure to eat plenty of fruits and vegetables. These foods contain antioxidants, which is essential to help prevent Alzheimer’s.Include leafy greens and other vegetables in your diet to avoid Alzheimer’s.


If vegetables aren’t your favorite, try adding spinach, kale, or broccoli to your smoothie. You get the health benefits without the taste.
Instead of a traditional sandwich for lunch, try substituting your bread or bun for romaine leaves.
Brighten up a dish by adding red, yellow, and green peppers.
Have a bowl of fresh fruit salad with breakfast, toss a handful of berries into your salad, or have a piece of fruit for a snack or dessert.;
, The Mediterranean Diet suggests having very little red meat – only about one serving a week. Instead, a Mediterranean style diet includes foods like fish and shellfish that are high in Omega-3 fatty acid. This has been found in some studies to help prevent Alzheimer’s disease and Dementia.Include salmon, tuna, halibut, or sardines in your meals at least twice per week.
For instance, you might have salmon for dinner on Monday. Then, Thursday have tuna salad for lunch and a snack of sardines on Sunday.
Add scallops or shrimp to your meals. For example, you can add both to your pasta or salad to give it a new flavor.

, Instead of processed grains, try heart healthy whole grains as recommended by the Mediterranean Diet. Whole grains help you maintain a healthy weight, are full of nutrients, and contain beneficial dietary fiber.Instead of white rice, have brown or wild rice with your meals.
Try a bowl of oatmeal with your breakfast. You can add honey or fruit to give it added flavor and health benefits.

, Some research suggests that oleocanthal, a component of olive oil, may help prevent the build-up of one of the brain proteins that cause Alzheimer’s.You can avoid Alzheimer’s with diet if you substitute butter and other oils with olive oil.


Instead of putting butter on your bread, use a mix of olive oil and herbs.
Sautee your vegetables in olive oil to bring out their natural flavor and get an added health benefit.
Other good fats to include are nuts, seeds, olives, and avocados.

, For example, they are high in fiber and protein – both of which can help you avoid Alzheimer’s.


Include lentils, red beans, or white beans in your meals several times a week. For example, you might have northern beans for dinner.
Add black beans to your nachos to add extra nutrition, texture, and taste.

, On the Mediterranean diet, it is okay to have red wine in moderation, but this is an option, not a requirement.You can sip one glass per day if you are a woman or two glasses per day if you are a man. Make sure that you do not exceed this limit."

Look for signs of how the dementia is progressing.,
Have the person undergo a complete physical and mental examination.,
Consider your ability to care for the person at home.,
Also consider the toll on your own physical and emotional health when serving as a caregiver.",How to Find a Nursing Home for Someone With Alzheimer's Disease or Dementia1," In the early stages of Alzheimer's disease or other forms of dementia, the person may appear and function close to normal. As the dementia progresses, however, the person's ability to think and reason declines, often progressively faster. Signs such as the following may mean the person needs the care a nursing home can provide: progressively worsening memory, such as asking the same question again and again, forgetting both the answer and the question and that he or she asked it in the first place, difficulty in communicating verbally, increasing difficulty in bathing, dressing, using the bathroom or just moving around, disorientation, including confusion in directions and habitually wandering off and forgetting how to return home, putting things in places where they don't belong, such as sticking a purse in the freezer or a meatloaf under a cake cover, loss of reasoning skills, such as forgetting the concept of numbers or ignoring a whistling teakettle on a hot stove, severe mood swings ranging from joy to anger or sadness in a matter of minutes, and loss of interest in things that used to matter;
, A family physician can sometimes perform the entire examination; but more likely, the doctor will refer the dementia sufferer to a neurologist, gerontologist or geriatric practitioner to properly evaluate whether the person's symptoms have worsened to the point where he or she should be placed in a nursing home.

, Alzheimer's and dementia sufferers need a safe, structured environment as well as things to do and people to talk to. It takes time and effort to provide these things, requiring the primary caregiver to sacrifice other areas of his or her life. You may initially be able to provide a suitable environment for your loved one, either alone or with the help of family, friends or a hired caregiver and adult day-care programs, but the progressive nature of Alzheimer's will likely mean moving your loved one to a nursing home at some point in the future.

, Your own needs matter in making the decision to place your loved one in a nursing home.

Educate yourself about Alzheimer’s disease.,
Assess safety risks in the home.,
Foster their independence.,
Allow their emotional responses.,
Plan ahead.,
Develop routines.,
Prioritize self-care.",How to Help People With Alzheimer's Disease1," If you suspect that a loved one has Alzheimer’s disease, learn about signs, symptoms, early detection, and your role as a potential caregiver. The more you learn about this brain disease, the better prepared you will be to handle impending changes in your loved one.Check with your local health department for resources, such as support groups and classes dealing with Alzheimer’s education.
Your local hospital may have printed resources in their library for your use.
Several websites offer accessible, easy to read information about Alzheimer’s disease. These include http://www.alz.org/alzheimers_disease_what_is_alzheimers.asp and http://www.alzfdn.org/AboutAlzheimers/definition.html
;
, You’ll need to assess safety risks in the home in which the person with Alzheimer’s disease lives. If you find potential safety risks, make every effort to remedy them right away. Even if the person is in the early stages of the disease, it’s best not to leave them alone until safety risks are resolved.When looking for safety issues, evaluate every part of the home for the patient’s potential to harm themselves, another person, or damage property.
For example, they may have a gas stove, which poses a few safety risks (gas poisoning, unattended open flame, potential burns). Purchase knob covers so that the patient won’t be able to turn the gas or the stove on.
For larger safety risks that aren’t easily resolved, such as steep stairs, you may find yourself in a position of having to decide if it is in the patient’s best interest to remain in the home.

, Encouraging Alzheimer’s patients to maintain independence and carry on with daily responsibilities helps foster their independence. It also helps them focus, remember, and maintain organization, which are important exercises in the beginning stages of dementia. How active you must be in these activities may fluctuate and depends entirely on the person whom you’re helping.You may need to take initiative and oversee areas of their life, but can foster independence at the same time.
The tasks that they will need assistance with may deal primarily with management and organization: managing their money, transportation, keeping appointments, keeping track of medications, and even remember words, people, and places.

, Living with an Alzheimer’s diagnosis can be intensely difficult for some people, and will elicit a variety of emotional responses from most patients. You can be helpful by facilitating those emotions, allowing the person to feel them without explanation, but also helping them move from frustration to proactively helping themselves.Typical responses include fear, denial, anger, anxiety, and depression.
Encourage them to write their feelings and thoughts down, such as in a journal. This is a safe way for them to work through what they’re feeling, and also helps them practice writing and organizing their thoughts.

, Talk with the person that you’re helping about the future, especially while they’re in the beginning stages of the disease. Find out how they’d like to be cared for, where they would like to stay, what sort of medical interventions they approve of, how this care will be financed, and update documents such as their will and power of attorney designation.Having the conversations now and planning ahead now will not only be easier on you both, but will help ensure that you’re giving the person the sort of care that they want.

, Routines are helpful for anyone, whether they have Alzheimer’s or not, because they remove uncertainty. With a routine, you already know what your tasks are and how you need to accomplish them. Develop routines for yourself and the person with Alzheimer’s disease, which will help foster their independence, alleviate some potential anxiety on their part, and also help you see any changes in their physical or cognitive abilities., To be an effective caregiver, you must prioritize how you care for yourself. If you do not take care of yourself, you won’t have the physical, mental, or emotional resources to care for anyone else. Alzheimer’s is a progressive disease, meaning it is increasingly demanding. Every month or so, honestly evaluate your needs and abilities, to ensure that you’re providing the best care for yourself and the Alzheimer’s patient.Caregivers often report feeling guilty for needing assistance with an Alzheimer’s patient, or even a day or week off. It’s important that you understand that you have to recharge if you’re going to be helpful.
You’re not less of a loved one or caregiver if you ask for help. In fact, you’re demonstrating that you’ve considered what’s best for your loved one and your abilities to meet their needs. Asking for help shows that you are doing what you can to make sure those needs are met.
Find support — through local groups, through doctors, online, and with family. Your loved one needs assistance, and you need support. Sharing experiences with others will help you work through your emotions, and may even point you toward good resources or tips that help you in your care giving.

Take paracetamol.,
Use anti-emetic drugs.,
Stay hydrated.,
Apply a cold compress to your forehead.,
Use menthol-based balms.,
Have a snack.,
Consider switching your birth control pills.,
Stop smoking.",How to Treat Migraine Induced Nausea and Vomiting1," Paracetamol is a very effective and easily available over-the-counter drug that can relieve a migraine.


It mainly acts by blocking certain chemicals in the body that cause the dilation of the blood vessels. This stops the headache and, in turn, the nausea and vomiting too.
The usual dosage of paracetemol is a 500 mg tablet, taken up to 4 times per day after eating;
, Anti-emetic drugs are drugs that are formulated to prevent emesis (which is the medical term for vomiting). They act mainly by slowing the gastric action which causes regurgitation.


The most commonly used anti-emetic drugs are domperidone and ondensetron. The dosage of domperidone is one 10 mg tablet which can be taken three times a day just before eating a meal or whenever nausea persists.
Ondensetron dosage is one 8 mg tablet taken twice a day before eating or whenever nausea persists.

, Migraine is aggravated by dehydration, so when you experience nausea and vomiting, you might already be dehydrated. Lack of fluid, specifically cerebral fluid, causes migraines.


Therefore, you should drink plenty of water as soon as you feel a migraine coming on, and make sure to replace lost fluids with a glass or two of water following a vomiting episode.
In order to prevent migraines you should avoid dehydration by drinking 6 to 8 glasses of water per day.

, An ice cold towel can be placed over the forehead to help alleviate the pain of the migraine.


It is believed that the cold temperature helps to constrict the dilated blood vessels on the surface of the brain which are causing the headache symptoms.
Once the migraine itself is alleviated, symptoms of nausea and vomiting should subside.

, Though they are not backed up by any proper scientific research, menthol-based balms originating from the East (China and India mainly) can be applied over the forehead for relief of headaches.


A commonly available commercial form is “Vicks”. It is believed that the strong menthol aroma can help constrict blood vessels and give relief.
However, the skeptical scientists believe the strength of the smell itself can “distract” the person from the pain of the headache, hence making the person believe that the headache has gone.

, During migraine episodes, nausea and vomiting may also be triggered by hyperacidity. If your stomach is hyper acidic it may give you the sensation of needing to vomit. Having a light snack during migraine episodes can prevent the hyperacidity which leads to nausea and vomiting.


The best snacks are soda crackers. Soda crackers contain sodium. Sodium in the stomach reduces acidity.
Refrain from eating snacks high in acidity such as citrus fruits, protein containing food like beef, pork and peanuts and fermented and picked fruits foods.

, Using birth control pills can cause headaches and migraines, leading to nausea and vomiting. This type of migraine is caused by the drop in estrogen in a woman’s body.


The monthly pill pack of contraceptive contains placebo pills that are used during the days of menstruation. However, during the other days of the month, a woman takes estrogen pills. The shift of estrogen pills to placebo pills causes a drastic decrease in estrogen which causes migraine.
There are few ways to prevent this type of migraine. When the root cause of the migraine induced nausea and vomiting is addressed, nausea and vomiting is also treated.
You can either: shift to contraceptive pills which contain fewer placebo pills; shift to contraceptive pills will lower dose of estrogen; shift to progesterone only birth control pills.

, Studies have shown that smokers and second hand smokers are more prone to headaches and migraines associated with nausea and vomiting. This is due to the nicotine found in cigarettes and tobaccos. Nicotine causes the blood vessels in the brain to constrict.


Aside from nicotine, cigarette contains carbon monoxide which provokes a lack of oxygen to the brain, which triggers headache. Smoking also causes a decrease in monoamine oxidase activity. A decrease in monoamine oxidase activity is linked to an increase in occurrence of headaches.
Aside from that, studies have also shown that smoking causes hyperacidity which can lead to nausea and vomiting. Therefore, it's a good idea to quit smoking, or at least cut back on it for a while.

Check the labels on food to find the sodium intake.,
Eat more fruits and vegetables.,
Drink some milk.,
Snack on fruit, seeds, and nuts.,
Add flavor with spices.,
Use vegetable oils.,
Have less sugar.,
Eat poultry instead of red meat.",How to Avoid Alzheimer's with Diet2," The main goal of the DASH diet is to reduce your sodium intake to help lower your blood pressure. You should not exceed 2,300 mg of sodium while you are on the DASH diet, so you will need to keep track of the sodium in the foods you eat.To find out how much sodium is in the food you eat, it is important to check the label. Read the labels and avoid foods that are high in sodium.
Foods high in sodium include canned foods, prepared frozen foods, snack foods, and cured meats, such as hot dogs, deli meats, and bacon.

, Like the Mediterranean diet, the DASH diet encourages lots of fresh fruit and vegetables. Make sure to include a serving or two of vegetables with every meal, and include a couple of servings of fruit each day as a meal accompaniment, snack, or dessert.

You can count canned or dried fruit, but check the label to make sure they do not contain any added sugar.
Try including a few plant-based meals into your diet each week as well.

, The DASH diet (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) aims to reduce your chance of developing hypertension, which can also help you avoid Alzheimer’s. This diet suggests eating fat-free or low-fat dairy products as well as the foods suggested in the Mediterranean Diet.In addition, a recent study found that drinking low-fat milk may increase antioxidants in the body that can help you avoid Alzheimer’s.Have a cup of low-fat or fat-free Greek yogurt sprinkled with almond slivers and fruit for breakfast or for a snack.
Add fat-free or low-fat milk to your oatmeal or dry cereal or have some cottage cheese with fruit.
Use skim or low-fat milk in place of cream in your coffee or tea.

, These foods are great to include in your diet when you are trying to avoid Alzheimer’s. They help reduce plaque build-up in the brain that causes Alzheimer’s because they rich in omega-3 fatty acid, fiber, and antioxidants.Add fresh berries like strawberries, blueberries, or raspberries to your morning cereal or your salad at lunch.
Have a mix of walnuts, sunflower seeds, pistachios, and cashews as a mid-afternoon snack.
Try including almonds or walnuts in your dinner recipes. For example, you might try orange-almond chicken.

, The DASH diet recommends cutting back on your sodium to help avoid Alzheimer's disease.Instead of salt, experiment with other herbs and spices to give your meals an added kick.


For example, substitute salt with garlic, parsley, paprika or a blend of spices in your pasta dishes.
Experiment with spices you may not have used a lot before like rosemary, tarragon, thyme, dill, oregano, etc.
Cinnamon, sage, cumin, and turmeric all help reduce brain inflammation., Similar to the Mediterranean Diet, the DASH diet calls for using olive oil and other healthier oils instead of butter, margarine, and other solid fats like lard. Using oils helps to reduce your risk for hypertension, and relatedly Alzheimer’s.Try using sunflower, canola, peanut, safflower, corn, or soybean oil in your recipes.
You can also use cooking sprays made with one or more of these oils when you are cooking.
Be sure to cut back on your use of butter and margarine. Use only half of your usual serving size.
When choosing salad dressings, opt for light version of your favorite flavors.

, Some research indicates that high levels of sugar may cause memory loss and other signs of Alzheimer’s by shrinking the hippocampus.Avoid sweets and sugary beverages when you are trying to avoid Alzheimer’s with diet.


Have naturally sweet foods like fruit when you have a ‘sweet-tooth’.
Instead of sodas, which are packed with sugar, try having water with an orange slice in it for flavor.

, The DASH diet recommends limiting your red meat and having fish (like the Mediterranean Diet) or poultry instead.Try to include chicken and other poultry in your meal planning several times a week to help you avoid Alzheimer’s.


Have turkey or grilled chicken instead of meatloaf or steak for dinner.
Instead of adding ground beef to your nachos, for example, try topping them with strips of grilled chicken breast.
Do not exceed 6 ounces of meat per day.

"
"
Combine the Mediterranean Diet and the DASH diet.,
Enjoy your red meat.,
Have alcohol in moderation.,
Limit high fat indulgence foods.",How to Avoid Alzheimer's with Diet3," The MIND (Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay) Diet includes all of the suggested foods in the other two diets, plus includes a few more suggestions that help you use diet to avoid Alzheimer’s disease. This diet can dramatically decrease your risk of Alzheimer’s disease.One the MIND diet, you will need to:


Eat plenty of vegetables, fruit, whole grains, and low-fat or fat free dairy products.
Include seafood in your diet at least once a week and poultry in your diet at least twice per week.
Have at least six servings of green leafy vegetables per week.
Get two or more servings of berries per week.
Have beans three times per week.
Cook with olive oil instead of butter, lard, or other oils.

, One big difference between the MIND diet and the Mediterranean and DASH diets is that the in the MIND diet, red meat is okay in moderation. With this diet you can have up to four servings of red meat a week and still avoid Alzheimer’s.For example, you might have a hamburger for lunch on Saturday and then a grilled steak on Sunday.
Later in the week you could have meatballs for dinner on Tuesday and meatloaf on Thursday.

, Some studies suggest that moderate amounts of alcohol, like red wine, may reduce the risk for developing Alzheimer’s disease.The MIND Diet recommends having one glass of red wine a day if you are trying to avoid Alzheimer’s with diet.Although a glass of red wine is recommended, other alcohol like beer or whiskey may not have the same health benefits.
Remember that excessive drinking can cause more health problems than benefits.

, There are certain foods on the MIND diet that need to be severely limited. These foods include:

Butter and margarine—no more than 1 tablespoon per day.
Cheese—no more than one serving per week.
Pastries and sweets—no more than five servings per week.
Fried foods and fast foods—no more than one serving per week.

Drink plenty of water.,
Enjoy your coffee.,
Have some tea.,
Take supplements.",How to Avoid Alzheimer's with Diet4," Staying hydrated throughout the day is important. No matter what diet you decide to follow, make sure to drink lots of water during the day. You may need to drink more or less depending on your health and activity level. Check with your doctor for a recommendation., If you like your regular caffeine, then go ahead and have it. Some studies suggest that moderate amounts of caffeine may actually decrease the chances of developing Alzheimer’s.Limit your intake to about three cups of coffee or 300 mg of caffeine per day.
Make sure you pay attention to what you are adding into your coffee. For example, avoid adding too much sugar, cream, and other flavorings.
Pay special attention if you like to get your caffeine from sodas. The added sugar may eliminate any benefits of the caffeine.

, Many teas have been found to have properties that improve memory, lower blood pressure and increase brain activity and health.All of these benefits can help you avoid Alzheimer’s.


Research suggests that green tea increases brain activity which helps improve memory and prevent Alzheimer’s.Oolong and white tea are made from the same plant that green tea comes from. They have many of the same beneficial properties.
However, not as much research has been conducted on the effects of oolong, white, or other tea on Alzheimer’s as has been done on green tea.

, Some nutrients and minerals that may help you prevent Alzheimer’s are difficult for people to absorb through foods. You may need to take a supplement in order to get enough of them to help you avoid Alzheimer’s.Vitamin B12 can help you avoid Alzheimer’s but is difficult to get through regular diet.
Ginkgo biloba is a popular supplement used to prevent memory loss and Alzheimer’s.Coenzyme Q10 is another supplement that has had some success in helping people avoid Alzheimer’s.

They can direct you to which nursing homes have good track records in taking care of dementia patients and who to contact at those homes to arrange an interview.

,, Look at the quality and cost of care, as well as how far away the home is. While it may be tempting to put someone suffering from Alzheimer's or dementia in an out-of-the-way facility, both you and the loved one suffering from dementia will be happier if you and other friends and family members can visit regularly.

, Look at a nursing home's overall appearance and cleanliness. Also look at how well-staffed the home is on both weekdays and weekends and the overall attitude of the staff. Note how frequently the residents are visited by observing how full the home's parking lot is. Look at the residents themselves to see if they appear clean, well-fed and reasonably happy.

, They'll help you determine what you should be looking at if you don't trust your own common sense.

,, If you hear something that sounds like the home may not provide adequate care for your loved one, trust your instincts and validate it in the interview before deciding to place your loved one in the home.

, In addition to looking over the nursing home inside and outside, interview the home's administrator and members of the nursing staff to evaluate whether or not the nursing home would be suitable for your loved one.

, You should also get copies of recent health inspection reports and ask how the home remedied problems identified in those reports.

,, If the nursing home is to undergo a change in management, the change could be either beneficial or negative. You'll need to investigate the incoming owner as you did the home itself.

, It's helpful to corroborate the information given by the nursing home's administrator and staff with the observations of residents' family members to give you a more complete picture of the home. Ask them how the home handles nutrition, falls and incontinence and how well it manages their loved one's dementia care, as well as their opinions on the residents' quality of life.

Ask open-ended questions.,
Say the same thing differently.,
Don’t ask them if they remember.,
Don’t be patronizing.,
Offer emotional support.,
Consider taking them on a short trip for a change of scenery and potential mood boost.",How to Help People With Alzheimer's Disease2," Questions that can answered with a simple “yes” or “no” should be avoided. These sorts of questions already contain the answer and are simply asking the other person to verify whether the information is correct or not. Instead, ask open-ended questions that require the person with Alzheimer’s to consider their answer and effectively communicate it back to you.Instead of saying, “Do you want soup for lunch?” ask them, “It’s time that we make lunch. What should we make today?”
Rather than ask if they’re having a rough day remember things, ask them, “Are you noticing any difficult tasks today?”

, Sometimes you might need to explain an idea several times before the other person understands what you’re trying to say, whether they have Alzheimer’s disease or not. When you notice that the person you’re helping is having a tough time understanding your explanation, stop, take a breath, and reapproach the explanation differently.Think of this like driving to the store. Your goal is to make it to the market. There is more than one way to get there, and in the end, one way may feel like the best way, but as long as you get there (they understand your explanation), you’ve done what you set out to do.

, Helping a person with Alzheimer’s disease is a lot of work, and it can be frustrating when you find that you’re repeating yourself. In explaining to them that you’ve said this before, or that a conversation already happened, you’re running the risk of making them feel badly and shutting down. They don’t want to forget any more than you want them to, so be patient and don’t ask them if they remember a conversation that they obviously don’t remember having.Don’t say, “Did you forget?” or “Don’t you remember?” It’s obvious that they did forget, so either skip the line of questioning altogether, or simply say, “We wrote this down on your calendar, and next time you should check there first.”

, Don’t talk down to them by simplifying your language, or even worse, baby talking them. You should speak to them as you normally would, although you may need to repeat yourself or slow down what you’re saying sometimes. Patronizing language and baby talk are belittling and will only hurt their feelings or make them angry.For example, don’t ask them, “Did somebody forget to brush their teeth today?” If you suspect that they’ve forgotten to do something, just say, “Dad, why don’t you go brush your teeth now since you didn’t do it after dinner?”
Another example is referring to their dementia as the ""forgetsies,"" as in, “You’re just having a bad case of the forgetsies today, aren’t you?” Neither the question or the terminology are productive. Instead, you can say, “It seems like you’re having a rough day remembering things. That’s okay. How can I help you?”

, One of the first signs of dementia is memory loss, and that can be frightening, and even elicit anger and sadness, from Alzheimer’s patients. You can offer emotional support by talking with them about their feelings – their fears, their hopes, their frustrations. You can also be supportive and help with their cognitive functions and memory by showing them old photographs and asking them to tell you the stories behind each picture.If they cannot remember a story or person in a photo, be patient and let them try to remember.
You can also ask open-ended, probing questions that might jog their memory.
You will be most helpful in giving them a safe, judgment-free space in which to share their emotions.

, Of course, discuss your plans with their healthcare providers first.

"
"
Work with their healthcare providers.,
Include family and friends.,
Report changes in behavior or emotion.,
Stroll down memory lane.",How to Help People With Alzheimer's Disease3," The person who you’re helping will likely have a healthcare team that manages their medical and psychological needs. Because this person is living in a facility, this team is likely established into the patient’s weekly routines. You can help them by introducing yourself and working with their healthcare providers, and may prove an invaluable resource to both the patient and doctors.You may become a liaison between the patient, facility, and healthcare team.
You can also serve as the patient’s advocate.
If the patient has named you Power of Attorney, you will need to be proactively involved with the healthcare team to make informed decisions.

, When a person goes to live in a facility, it may feel to others as though they are not as accessible as they once were. Family and friends may also be a little uncomfortable with the facility, not knowing what to expect. Include them, talk with them, and encourage them to be active in the patient’s life. This will help family and friends feel connected, and help the patient feel less isolated.Talk with family and friends about the stage of Alzheimer’s disease and what to expect.
Give them tips on communicating with an Alzheimer’s patient.
Maintain the Alzheimer's patient’s dignity by not sharing confidential medical information or talking about them in their presence as though they are not there.
Plan activities, outings, or projects that they can do with the patient. For example, the facility might let you use part of the day room for a card game or art project.

, A person with Alzheimer’s disease will likely experience changes in their behaviors and emotions, suddenly and gradually, and if you notice a change, communicate what you’ve noticed with the facility’s manager. The person may be a bit more open with you than staff, and your speaking up about changes in behavior and emotion may help staff develop a new treatment plan for them.For example, they may become suspicious or paranoid. They may even think that facility staff are trying to harm them. Whether this is a sudden or gradual thought, you need to report it to the patient’s case manager, as they may become agitated or harm themselves.
You might notice that they vacillate between anger and giddiness pretty rapidly. This shows potential instability, but could also be an indication that they are stressed or having difficulty coping with something. Communicate this to facility management so that they can help the patient sort out the problem.

, This is important whether the person lives in a facility or not, but especially if they live somewhere other than their home. Their home is full of triggers and reminders that will help jog their memory, but a facility is a new place devoid of those cues. Make sure the person has personal mementos from home in their room. Reminiscing about the past with the patient helps them recall events, people, and experiences. Not only is this fun for both of you, but it helps you learn about them and it helps them remember details."

Understand what a migraine is.,
Recognize what happens in the attack phase of the migraine.,
Be aware that not much is known about why migraines occur.,
Understand the link between migraines, nausea and vomiting.",How to Treat Migraine Induced Nausea and Vomiting4," A migraine, in simple terms, is a chronic neurological disorder. It is characterized by recurrent headaches as well as other symptoms such as vomiting and seeing “flashes of light” (known as aura). To better understand migraines, various renowned medical authors have split migraine symptoms into phases. They are;


Prodrome
Aura
Attack
Postdrome
Not every patient will suffer from each phase. Only one particular phase may occur and then nothing else. However, the opposite can also be true.

, The attack phase of a migraine is the headache itself, which can be mild to severe. The pain can be throbbing and on both sides of the head, and is usually felt behind the eyes.


There is usually a sensitivity to light and a handful of patients prefer to stay in a dark room. It is during the attack phase that patients can feel extremely nauseous and have a few episodes of vomiting.
The attack phase can last anywhere between four hours to 72 hours depending on how well treatment works and whether the patient is on medication or not.

, Vast research has been going on for over two decades on migraines, their effect on the body and the constant search for a potential cure or at least more effective treatment options.


Unfortunately not much progress has been made in finding the exact cause of why a migraine occurs. There has, however, been strong evidence linked to the familial history of the disease with a strong presence amongst first generation of relatives and siblings.

, Other than the potentially severe headache, vomiting is one of the most painful symptoms that one can suffer from during a migraine. However, on the other side of the coin, some patients have reported to have a temporary sense of relief from the migraine after they have vomited, but not all patients feel the same.


It's unclear as to exactly why people suffer nausea and episodes of vomiting along with their migraines. The present hypotheses surrounding this is that migraines occur when nerves in the brain send messages (signals) to the blood vessels to dilate, in particular, the ones that lay on the surface of our brains. Estrogen hormone levels are also thought to play a role, hence explaining the incidence being higher in women than in men.
Continuing on the theory of blood vessels on the brain’s surface getting dilated; neurologists also say that the levels of certain neurotransmitters (the chemicals that help transmit the brain’s signals to various tissues and organs) fall when there is dilation of the blood vessels.
One neurotransmitter called serotonin is believed to be the main culprit. Therefore it is indeed possible that lower levels of this neurotransmitter may be more likely to cause migraines as well as nausea. The link to nausea is credible because a drop in serotonin levels is also witnessed in other conditions like motion sickness, which also gives rise to vomiting.

Repeat memory-triggering phrases.,
Post reminders around your home.,
Put up photographs of important people in your life.,
Do word games.,
Play “name that tune.” To keep your memory strong, you can use music as an aural cue.",How to Help Your Memory During Early Stages of Alzheimer's Disease1," One way to help improve memory and keep it sharp is to use memory-triggering phrases on a daily basis. You can repeat these phrases to yourself aloud or have others around you use them. Memory triggering phrases have been shown to improve memory loss.For example, you may use a common saying that the person uses as a memory trigger. Perhaps the person tends to say the phrase, “A rolling stone gathers no moss.” You may then have the person say the phrase often, with you saying the first part of the phrase and them completing the second half of the phrase.;
, Another option is to post reminders around your home on post-its or small slips of paper. This can help trigger your memory and keep you sharp. You may write down the reminders yourself or have someone close to you write down the reminders and post them around your living space.People with Alzheimer's often find it difficult to remember how to complete daily tasks, even if they were once routine. You may get halfway through a task and not remember the final steps. Having the steps written down can help you go through your day without too much interruption.For example, perhaps you want to be sure you remember how to use your coffee machine. You may then write down instructions and post them on the coffee machine so they are there for reference in the event you start to forget how to use it.
You can also post reminders for important tasks you might forget, such as to turn off the stove after cooking.

, You can maintain your memory by putting up photographs and images of loved ones and relatives in your living space. You may print out pictures of your family and tape them up around your home or frame images and hang them in a room you use often. Visual cues like photographs can really help your memory stay present and sharp.Label the pictures with each person's name.


For example, you may hang a piece of string over your fireplace and hang photographs of friends and family on the string, replacing the images when you start to worry you are forgetting someone’s face.
You can also carry photographs in your pocket or your purse to help you remember the names and faces of your loved ones. This way, when you are in a conversation with someone and start to forget a name, you can pull out the photographs to help you remember.

, You can improve your memory by doing word games on your own or with family and friends. You may do crossword puzzles, word guessing games, or spelling challenges. Doing word games can help your memory stay sharp and allow you to retain information about language.You can also try playing board games with others, as they are a good way to keep your memory present.

, You may play “name that tune” on your own or with others. Listen to the radio and challenge yourself to remember the name of the song as well as the name of the artist.You may also play your favorite music and play “name that tune” to ensure you have not forgotten any of your favorite tracks.

You can then listen to the recordings later as a reminder.

, A big part of staying sharp is trying to stick to your normal routine as much as possible. Having a routine puts fewer demands on your short-term memory so you can save that mental energy for when you really need it.

The painkiller ibuprofen may effectively prevent altitude related headaches before they begin.


In a recent study, hikers preparing for a high altitude journey were given doses of ibuprofen in the 24 hours prior to their journey. A little over 40% of hikers who took ibuprofen developed altitude-related headaches and nausea. In the control group, where hikers did not take ibuprofen, almost 70% experienced headaches, nausea, and other symptoms.If you're going to be flying, try taking 600 milligrams of ibuprofen sometime during the 24 hours leading up to the flight. Ibuprofen can be purchased at most drug stores and supermarkets and comes under a variety of names, such as Advil or Motrin.;

If you experience more serious side effects, like fever, rash, or blood in urine, cease use and talk to your doctor., As headaches are sometimes triggered by altitude changes, trying to book a non-stop flight may help you avoid headaches.


Altitude changes can prompt changes in your oxygen levels, causing your head's blood vessels to compensate by contracting and expanding. This change in your blood vessels can trigger a migraine.Booking a non-stop flight can be difficult and costly. However, see if you live within driving distance of a location that provides non-stop flights to your end location. It might be worth it to take a road trip to an airport and take a non-stop flight from there if you're migraines or headaches are particularly severe.

, You will be doing a lot of sitting while on the plane and a lot of walking while in the airport. Do not wear constricting clothing or shoes without enough support., Drinking plenty of water in flight can help avoid causes of after flight headaches like jet lag and dehydration.


Aircrafts only have a humidity level of 15%, which is on par with some of the driest climates on earth. Make sure you bring a water bottle on the plane and stay hydrated prior to boarding.
Due to restrictions on liquids, you may have to purchase a water bottle in the airport or bring an empty water bottle through security and fill it up at a water fountain. Remember, drinks are not usually offered on a plane until well after take-off. Bring your own water on board so you won't end up waiting for a drink if you start to feel thirsty.
If you forgot your water bottle and are feeling thirsty as the plane takes off, it's fine to ask the flight attendant for a water bottle before the plane takes off.

, Going for long periods of time without eating can cause the onset of a headache. Food on planes can be expensive, so bring something to eat with you.Purchase high-fiber and high protein snacks, like nuts, dried fruits, and granola bars. Put them in your carry-on bag. Avoid salty or overly sugary snacks, which can worsen dehydration.

, It can be tempting to kill time at the airport bar or have a beer in-flight to reduce boredom. However, alcohol can contribute to after flight headaches.


Alcohol is one of the biggest triggers for migrainesand also contributes to dehydration that can exacerbate jet lag and cause headaches.
Red wine, in particular, is known to cause headaches if drunk in excess. Consuming a glass or two of red wine before or after boarding could lead to a headache after flight.If you really want a preflight alcoholic beverage, stick to white wine as it's less likely to cause headaches., Getting some sleep on the airplane can help you feel rested and refreshed when you land. If your headaches seem to be caused by jet lag, sleeping in flight can help.


Herbal supplements, like melatonin, can be purchased at drug stores and supermarkets. In small doses, they can promote sleep. Many people also take Dramamine while flying as it reduces nausea. It also causes drowsiness and may help you sleep through a long flight.
Test any medications you're trying at home before a fight. If they have any adverse side effects for you, you want to know ahead of time.
Bring an in-flight pillow to avoid straining your neck while flying.

, Headaches can often be caused by stress. Staying calm before and during a flight can reduce their likelihood.


Familiarize yourself with the routines of flying and airplane noises before leaving for the airport. Anxiety is often rooted in the unexpected or unknown, so having as much information as you can beforehand can reduce fear.Keep a picture of your destination on hand. If you start to become anxious during the flight, reminding yourself what you have to look forward to can help ease that anxiety.If your fear of flying is particularly bad, talk to a doctor or therapist about an anti-anxiety medication you can take as needed before flight., While it might take awhile to get through baggage claim and find your way to the proper exit, fresh air or sunlight can help wake you up, alleviating jet lag. Exposure to more natural air is also important. There may be substances in the airport or airplane to which you are mildly allergic. These could trigger your headaches. Lessening exposure can help prevent headaches.

, Regardless of what precautions you took, most people feel a little ""off"" when exiting an airplane. Allow yourself time to adjust.


It might not be a good idea to drive right away. Take a cab home from the airport or have a trusted friend pick you up.
Do not expose yourself to stimulants that can normally induce headaches. Caffeine, loud music, and alcohol should be avoided in the hours after a flight until you've readjusted.

, If your headaches are frequent or severe, you should make an appointment with your physician. You want to make sure your headache are caused by flying and not related to more serious medical concerns. Your doctor might also be able to recommend medications and lifestyle changes that could help alleviate your after flight headaches.

Take Sudafed.,
Try using a nasal spray.,
Understand what a pressure point massage is.,
Try to give yourself a massage.,
Try the tapping method.,
Use either a hot or cold compress.,
Try using a vaporizer or humidifier.,
Try clearing your headache with steam.,
Drink tea.,
Be aware of infections.,
Look out for swelling and mucus congestion as the cause of your headaches.,
Know that allergies can trigger sinus headaches.,
Keep track of your headaches during cold weather.",How to Stop Sinus Headaches," If you cannot see your doctor immediately, you can take Sudafed PE Sinus Headache, which comes in 325 mg/5 mg caplets. These can be bought over-the counter.


They contain acetaminophen which helps to relieve pain. They also contain phenylephrine hydrochloride which relieves congestion in the nose by shrinking the blood vessels.
You can take four caplets every four hours, or as needed. You can only take a maximum of twelve caplets within the 24 hours. Make sure you are not allergic to any of its ingredients before taking.;
, Using a nasal spray can be helpful, as it decongests the clogged nose, thereby relieving pressure on the air pockets. Less or no pressure will lead to headache relief.


One preferred brand of nasal spray that can be bought from the drugstore is Vicks Sinex Decongestant Nasal Spray. It is available in two forms: the 0.025% solution and the 0.05% solution.
The dosages are as follows: For 0.025% solution - four to six drops in each nostril twice a day, or as necessary. For 0.05% solution - two to three drops in each nostril twice a day, or as needed.
Experts advise that you do not use nasal spray beyond three days unless advised by your doctor., Another method that can be used to relieve sinus headaches is massage. Massage can lessen the pressure in the nasal passage which is causing the pain. Below are different kinds of massage and the information on how to do them.

, There are two simple trigger points that you may choose to massage: the center of your eyebrows just above your nose and the sides of the bridge of your nose.


Slowly apply pressure onto these trigger points. Push only until you feel discomfort or resistance in the muscle.
Hold the fingers in place for 5 to 60 seconds or until the area being pressed feels numb.
Push once more to increase the pressure until discomfort is felt.
Do steps 2 ,3 and 4, three to four times on each trigger point.
Each trigger point can be massaged three to six times a day.

, You will need the help of another person to perform this massage. Sit on a chair and face the other person. Ask the other person to place his hands on the sides of your head.


Using the pointer fingers, the other person will begin tapping, starting at the temples, then going down to the cheek bone, and continuing until fingers meet at the nose.
From the nose, the tapping will slowly move back to the cheek bone and then to the temples.
The tapping end with a gentle massage on the temples.
This can be done as often as needed.

, Warmth can help to clear blockages and cause greater blood flow in the nose. On the other hand, coldness can relieve pain. You can apply hot and cold compresses to ease headaches related to sinus pressure, as follows:


You will need a hot water bag and an ice pack. Wrap each of them with cloth so that the heat or cold is not too intense on your skin.
Place the hot compress across your sinuses. Keep it in place for three minutes.
Follow this right away with a cold compress on the same spot for 30 seconds.
Repeat steps 2 and 3 three times per treatment. This can be done two to six times a day as needed.

, The mucus in the nose and sinuses will not flow properly if the air that you breathe is very dry (like when the weather is extremely cold).


When this happens, the sinuses will not be able to drain well so congestion occurs in the nasal passages. This results in sinusitis and sinus headaches.
You can reverse this situation by using an air humidifier or vaporizer. Place it in your bedroom and leave it on as you sleep., If you do not have a humidifier machine at home, you can improvise and do any of the following:


Turn on a steam shower and sit nearby so that you can breathe in the steam. Stay in the shower room until you feel better.
Fill a tub or a sink with hot water. Sit or stand facing it and stay there until nasal congestion feels loose.
Alternatively, you can actually get into the shower or tub.

, Herbal teas have been known to reduce headaches and relieve pain, pressure and congestion. You can make your own tea at home. All you need are two pieces of ginger as big as your thumb. Here are some simple steps to follow:


Wash two thumb-sized pieces of ginger. Do not peel.
Slice them and add to a cup of freshly boiled water.
Allow the ginger slices to be submerged in the water for 15 minutes.
Drink the tea while it's still hot.
You can drink a cup whenever the headache attacks.

, Knowing what is causing your sinus headache is vital in stopping it, as it will lead you to the right remedy.


An episode of sinus headaches can be caused by infections in the nose or allergic reactions.
As a response to these things, more mucus is produced in the nose, which causes the pressure that leads to a sinus headache.

, Swelling and mucus congest the nose, which puts more pressure on the air pockets in front of the person's skull. This results in sinus headaches.

, If certain foods like milk, nuts or chicken trigger your allergies, remove them from your diet.


If a specific medications is causing an allergic reaction, ask your doctor for a replacement drug.
If you are not sure if you have an allergy or what's causing an allergy, you can seek the help if a doctor who can run tests to find out.

, If cold weather conditions trigger nasal problems like rhinitis and colds, try to stay indoors, keep warm and wear cozy shoes and clothing especially when going outside.

Ensure fluorescent lights are fitted with a diffuser.,
Consider using a filter.,
Try light filtering glasses.,
Fix flickering lights.,
Reduce the amount of lighting.,
Install an anti-glare filter on your computer monitor.",How to Manage Migraines in Fluorescent Lighting1," Fluorescent lighting can contribute to the triggering of migraines in those who are particularly sensitive to light. If you suffer from migraines and think the fluorescent lights in your office or at home are part of the problem, the first thing you should do is ensure that they are fitted with the correct diffuser. A diffuser works to make the light emitted imitate natural light as much as possible.

These diffusers are relatively inexpensive, costing anywhere between $10 and $50, and are easily available online or at your local hardware store.
If you are in an office, speak to your boss about the problem and ask him or her about getting a diffuser installed.;
, An alternative to a diffuser is to install a filter between the fluorescent bulb and you. The filter can help alter the light that reaches you by filtering out certain elements. Research has shown that blue filters in particular can relieve the symptoms of migraine sufferers., If it is not possible to attach a filter to the source of the light, an alternative way to achieve a similar result is to wear specially designed glasses. There are glasses available which filter red and blue light. These can ease your symptoms and even help prevent migraine attacks. Speak to your doctor about these devices. They are available in a number of different frame styles, and as clip ons for your ordinary glasses.

, Flickering lights can trigger a migraine for some people, so if the fluorescent light is flickering be sure to fix this and switch off the light in the meantime. Fluorescent lights should be properly maintained in order to prevent flickering, but if you have a problem, raise it with whoever is responsible for maintaining the lighting in your office.However, just because you cannot see flicker does not mean that the fluorescent is not flickering. Normally operating fluorescents with older-style ballasts will flicker at twice the line frequency, or 120 Hertz; this is not perceived as flickering, but can still cause headaches in some people.
Light dimmers cause significant flicker because they ""dim"" the light by rapidly switching it on and off. TV and computer screens also flicker.
Fluorescent lights are not as straightforward to change as ordinary light bulbs, and a flickering light normally indicates that you need to change the ballast.
Replacing a ballast is not that expensive (though it may be cheaper and more economic in the long-term to buy a new fitting). You should look for a modern electronic ballast made by GE or Philips; these can be obtained for around $25 at Home Depot or Lowes, and may need appropriate fluorescent tubes. These electronic ballasts will flicker at 20,000 Hertz, too fast to cause trouble for humans. Most large organizations have a person who maintains fluorescent lights and can replace ballasts, or it can be done by a home handyman/handywoman or electrician. , Particularly bright lights can contribute to migraine symptoms, so one simple way to lower this risk is to reduce the amount of fluorescent lighting in the room. The way most straightforward ways to do this are by removing some of the bulbs from the overhead fluorescent lights, or just turning off some of the lights. This won't always be feasible in an office or work environment, but investigate the possibilities.

If you do reduce the amount of light, ensure that there is enough to work with and you do not risk straining your eyes.
Consider using floor or desk lamps to light your office with softer, less intense light.

, Even after adjusting the settings on your monitor to reduce glare and intensity, you may find that the screen still reflects the glare of the fluorescent lighting. Reflected light from the overhead fluorescent lights and from windows and doors can contribute to a developing migraine. Put a filter over your screen to reduce the glare from other lighting sources."

Medicate with the first symptoms.,
Take a break.,
Use a cold compress.,
Speak to your doctor for alternative medications.,
Speak to your boss and colleagues.",How to Manage Migraines in Fluorescent Lighting2," If you suffer from migraines it's important that you learn to recognise the symptoms quickly so that you can act fast and take some medication. Abortive drugs such as painkillers and anti-inflammatories can be taken when you first begin to experience the symptoms of a migraine. Over-the-counter drugs such as ibuprofen and aspirin can work well.Even though your migraine may be stimulated by the fluorescent lighting in your office, medication may reduce your pain and suffering.
Take the medicine before your migraine progresses in severity.

, If you feel a migraine coming on, try to ease the symptoms by taking some breaks from the light and stimuli that are causing you problems. Try to sit in a dark and quiet room for a few minutes to try and relax. Close your eyes and let any tension that has built up in your shoulders and upper back fade away.If it's possible, you can try to lie down and close your eyes for a few minutes. You might even find yourself drifting off for a rejuvenating nap.Just stepping outside for a few minutes could give you a valuable respite.

, Applying an ice pack or cold compress to your head can help to ease the symptoms. Try placing the compress on your forehead, at your temples, or on the back of your neck.A cold compress can a have a numbing effect that may dull the pain. Alternatively, applying something warm or hot to your body can help relax tense muscles., Normal over-the-counter painkillers will not always be effective against migraines, but you should try these drugs first. If you find that they do not have an impact, speak to your doctor and ask about what prescription drugs might be appropriate. You should also speak to your doctor if you find yourself regularly taking over-the-counter painkillers more than two days a week.Generally doctors are advised to prescribe nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) for all but the most severe cases.
If the attacks are more severe and do not respond to NSAIDS, migraine-specific agents, such as triptans, ergotamine, or dihydroergotamine, may be prescribed.Antiemetics may be prescribed if you experience vomiting and nausea with your migraines.

, If you are suffering from migraines brought on the by environment of your office, you should talk your colleagues to explain your condition. If you keep leaving the office for a few minutes to give yourself a break it's important that people understand why. You will probably find some sympathy from your colleagues, who might help you to adjust the lighting, cover for you for a few minutes, or generally help you out when you have a migraine.

Locate the pain.,
Look for other symptoms of a migraine.,
Check for triggers.,
Try some common physical activity.,
Look at the medication you are taking.,
Look for sinus congestion.,
Notice the frequency of your headaches.",How to Tell if You Have a Migraine1," Migraine headaches involve an intense throbbing pain, usually on one side of your head. You may feel it in your temples, or behind either eye. The pain is constant, and it can last anywhere from four to 72 hours.Migraine pain will come along gradually, so that you will probably notice your head starting to hurt a few minutes before the worst of the pain arrives.;
, In addition to your headache, a migraine will bring other symptoms. The experience of a migraine is unique to each patient, and you may have some or all of them during your migraine headache. These symptoms include:Sensitivity to light, sounds, and smells
Nausea and vomiting
Blurred vision
Lightheadedness and fainting
Symptoms that vary over time. As you get older, new migraines may bring different symptoms. The headaches themselves should still follow a regular pattern in terms of length and frequency. If that changes, talk to your doctor, as it may be the sign of another health problem., Doctors are not completely sure what causes migraine headaches, but suspect they can be triggered by outside factors. Every person has different triggers, which include a variety of outside changes to your life or environment. If any of these things have changed in your life recently, your headache could be a migraine:Unusual amounts of sleep, either too much or too little
Skipped meals
Extreme sensory overload from bright lights, loud noises, or strong odors
Stress and anxiety
Consuming certain chemicals in food such as nitrates (in hot dogs and lunch meat), MSG (in fast food and seasoning), tyramine (aged cheeses, soy products, hard sausages, and smoked fish), or Aspartame (artificial sweetener sold as NutraSweet or Equal)
Menstruation (women may experience migraines due to hormonal changes that occur during their menstrual cycles.)

, One characteristic of migraine headaches is that they are debilitating, making even the simplest tasks difficult. Try a simple physical activity like walking up the stairs. If that causes your pain to increase, or the pain is too great to even attempt it, you are probably suffering from a migraine.If you can still perform basic physical tasks, even with some slight discomfort, you probably have a common tension headache, not a migraine., There is no cure for migraines, but you can manage some of the symptoms with various medications. If these do not provide relief, you may need to discuss treatment with your doctor.


Over-the-counter ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB) and acetaminophen (Tylenol), along with rest in a dark room, can provide some relief if taken as the headache begins. If you suffer from migraines regularly, your doctor may have recommended additional medication like cardiovascular drugs or antidepressants to reduce the frequency of your headaches.Too much anti-headache medicine can actually cause additional headaches, which are not migraines. If you are taking over-the-counter or prescription medicine to help relieve headache pain, and have taken these medications for more than 10 days a month for three months, or in high doses, you could be suffering from a medication-overuse headache. If you have been taking medication frequently, and having additional headaches, stop taking it. You might be making things worse for yourself., If your sinuses are congested, like when you have a cold, this can also give you a headache. A sinus headache, while painful, is not the same thing as a migraine. If you are congested, feel nauseous, are sensitive to light, and have a runny nose, it is probably a sinus headache., If you are experiencing headaches that are regular and brief, lasting 15 to 180 minutes up to eight times a day, these are cluster headaches. They are very rare, and more common in men between the ages of 20 and 40. Migraines last for several hours, and it will usually be at least several weeks before they reappear.Cluster headaches are usually accompanied by other symptoms, including congestion, runny nose, forehead and facial sweating, and eyelids either dropping or swelling.

Yoga therapy focuses on breathing and relaxation, but it goes beyond a normal yoga class to address specific medical issues (in this case, migraine prevention).


Unlike a conventional yoga class, yoga therapy is done in small groups and resembles physical therapy/rehabilitation more than a conventional yoga class.You can find yoga therapy instructors online, or by searching in the phone book.
Make sure your yoga therapy instructor has specialized training, ideally with some medical background like nursing or physical therapy.;
, Meditation and deep breathing are two popular relaxation technique that can reduce the symptoms of migraines and their frequency.However, in order to achieve maximum results, meditation and deep breathing should be practiced on a daily basis.Find a quiet place where you won't be disturbed. Sit in a relaxing position with your eyes open or closed (whatever you're most comfortable with).
Breathe deeply into your diaphragm (down in your belly, below your rib cage). You should feel your belly rise and fall with each inhalation and exhalation., Relaxation techniques like yoga and tai chi are a wonderful way to reduce stress and prevent migraines.You can take classes in relaxation techniques, either through your doctor's recommendations, or though a local class in your area. Talk to your doctor about which relaxation techniques are best for your symptoms.

, A common cause of migraines is emotional stress. If you're trying to squeeze too many activities into your day, you might be setting yourself up for a migraine. Try cutting down on the number of activities you commit to each day and managing your time a little more efficiently to reduce your migraine frequency.Prioritize your daily schedule. Obviously work and/or school comes first, and family and friends second - what else in your day could you not live without?
If something doesn't need to get done today and can be safely put off until tomorrow or the next day, then don't try to cram it into your already-packed schedule.
Allow yourself to take breaks during the day. Even a five minute walk away from your desk can help clear your head and improve your circulation.

, Reframing your perspective takes time and effort. It is not always easy, but it can be very rewarding in the long run. Not only can it help with migraines; it can also help you feel better and happier in general.Try not to dwell on negative thoughts. Any time you catch yourself, think about something more positive and affirmative.
Instead of thinking, ""I can't do this, it's impossible,"" try thinking, ""This will challenge me, but I know I can do it.""

Look at your family history.,
Watch for prodrome symptoms.,
Notice an aura.,
Keep a headache diary.,
Get tested.",How to Tell if You Have a Migraine2," As many as 90 percent of migraine sufferers come from families that have a history of attacks. If one or both of your parents suffers from migraines, there is a chance you will as well., The prodrome is the first step to getting a migraine, and can let you know one is coming. You may notice subtle changes in your health or mood one to two days before your headache that signal an oncoming migraine. About 60 percent of migraine sufferers will see certain symptoms before their headache.Some of the symptoms for prodrome can include:Constipation
Depression
Food cravings
Hyperactivity
Irritability
Neck stiffness
Uncontrollable yawning

, Anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes before an attack, you might begin to hallucinate certain symptoms. This is called an aura, and could mean that a migraine is coming. Only about one in five migraine sufferers experience an aura, and women far less so than men.If your aura symptoms last more than an hour, that could be a sign of bleeding in the brain — a stroke. If that is the case, you should see a doctor immediately. Symptoms of an aura can include:Flashing lights, bright spots, or blind spots in your vision
Numbness or tingling in your face or hands
Aphasia, which is speech or language problems

, By recording information about your headaches, you may be able to notice patterns to your suffering. This information can help you and your doctor figure out what is triggering your migraines, and how to stop them.Your diary should include information about when you had the headache, how long it lasted, what kind of pain you felt, any other symptoms you noticed, and any treatments you tried. This information can help you and your doctor discover triggers and figure out the most effective treatments.
This can also to help you identify the migraine early, which is beneficial because response to treatment is more effective during the prodrome or aura.
Make sure to keep the diary after visiting your doctor and starting treatment. Not every treatment will work on you, so you’ll want to make sure you find the best ones for you.

, If you still aren’t sure if your headaches are from migraines, your doctor can help you figure it out. There isn’t any test for a migraine. Your doctor will just be asking about your symptoms. To help your doctor, make note of a few things to tell him:Information about your headaches, including when and how often they happen, where the pain is, and how long they last.
Other symptoms, including nausea or blind spots.
Additional information, including a family history, any medicines you are taking, and any side effects those medicines may have had.
If your headaches are particularly severe, your doctor may recommend other tests to rule out other potential causes, including blood tests, a CT scan, an MRI, or a spinal tap. These tests can’t confirm that you have a migraine, but they will be able to prove other things are not causing your headaches."

Explore aromatherapy oil options.",How to Reduce Migraine Symptoms Naturally2," Some studies suggest that acupuncture may be somewhat effective in treating and preventing migraines.Acupuncture involves getting stuck with very thin needles in carefully-chosen areas on your body.Acupuncture is safe, but should only be performed by a qualified practitioner. You should never attempt to practice acupuncture at home.

, Some studies suggest that massage therapy can help reduce the frequency of migraine symptoms. It may be related to the relief of stress that tends to come with a massage, or it could have something to do with pressure points in the body (the same reason acupuncture works in some individuals)., Some studies have found that taking herbs and herbal supplements can help provide pain relief and reduce the frequency of migraines over a period of several months.It's important to exercise caution, however, since most herbs and herbal supplements are not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration.


Feverfew is a plant that is in the daisy family which has been shown to help reduce migraine symptoms. Its leaves are typically dried and ground into capsules, which are sold in health food stores and certain online retailers.White willow naturally contains aspirin-like chemicals which may help relieve migraines, especially when combined with feverfew. You can find extracts and supplements made from white willow at certain health food and vitamin stores.

, Studies suggest that vitamins may be helpful at reducing migraines in some individuals. Be aware, though, that some of these are more effective than others. Natural supplements are no substitute for professional medical attention, so make sure you continue to see your doctor on a regular basis and let him or her know about your plan to try supplements.Vitamin B-2, also known as riboflavin, may reduce the frequency of migraine symptoms or prevent them altogether.
Coenzyme Q10 is a supplement that may reduce the incidence of migraines. However, once you begin to experience a migraine, it will not have much effect on the immediate symptoms.
Some people have found that magnesium supplements may be helpful. However, this tends to be most helpful in people with a magnesium deficiency, and not in general migraine sufferers.

, If you're willing to explore your options, you may find aromatherapy helpful in treating and preventing migraines. Some studies suggest that certain aromatherapy oils, particularly lavender essential oil, may be helpful in managing the symptoms of migraines.You can find lavender essential oils at many natural food stores, as well as through many online retailers.

Try different biofeedback methods.,
Wear a portable device.,
Use an interactive program.",How to Reduce Migraine Symptoms Naturally3," Biofeedback is a medical technique that relies on measured feedback, via electrical sensors, from your body. The goal is to learn how to relax or contract your muscles to make changes in your body's performance.Be aware, however, that some studies suggest biofeedback may not be very effective, especially for the monetary and time constraints it requires.Common biofeedback methods involve measuring each of the following:


brainwave
respiration (breathing)
heart rate
muscle contraction
sweat glands
body temperature

, There are two primary biofeedback devices used for individuals suffering from migraines. The first is a portable device, which is usually worn around the waist. It tracks your respiration patterns and indicates when your body and mind are calm. The goal is to recognize when the symptoms of a migraine are approaching and to learn how to control your body's stress response., Interactive programs have a similar goal to portable devices: to measure physiological variations in your body and teach you how to reduce stress when a migraine is approaching. Common ways of managing stress that are combined with biofeedback include altering your respiration, relaxing your body's muscles, and avoiding certain thoughts."

Avoid tobacco smoke.,
Develop a regular exercise routine.,
Eat regularly-scheduled meals everyday.,
Abstain from foods and beverages known to trigger migraines.,
Get adequate sleep each night.",How to Reduce Migraine Symptoms Naturally4," Smoking tobacco has been linked to increased migraine symptoms. In nonsmokers, even exposure to second-hand smoke can trigger a migraine.If you're currently a smoker, you should consider quitting. Whether you smoke or not, try to avoid being around tobacco smoke as much as possible.

, Some studies suggest that exercise can be nearly as effective as medication at controlling and preventing migraines.Having a consistent exercise routine may help reduce your symptoms and prevent future occurrences. However, caution must be taken when exercising if you live with migraines, as strenuous exercise has also been known to induce migraines in some individuals.Avoid exercising in hot or humid weather.
Try to avoid exercising at high altitudes, if at all possible.
Make sure you stretch and warm up before engaging in strenuous exercise.
Make sure you stay hydrated before, during, and after exercise. Drink more water than usual if the weather is warm.

, Skipping meals can frequently cause migraine symptoms in many individuals. Your body can interpret a lack of food (even temporarily) as a type of stress, which can trigger a migraine.Make sure you eat three meals each day, and carry around healthy snacks (such as fresh fruit, vegetables, and nuts) in case you get hungry throughout the day.

, Certain foods and drinks have been proven to have an effect on how often or severe your migraines are. If you're a frequent migraine sufferer, you may have to reduce your consumption of certain foods/drinks, or avoid them altogether.Alcohol has been shown to increase migraines, particularly beer and red wine.
Aged cheese, chocolate, nuts, nut butter, dairy products, meat products containing nitrates, pickled foods, monosodium glutamate (MSG), and certain fruits like avocados, bananas, and citrus have all been shown to increase the symptoms of migraines.
Try keeping a journal of the foods and beverages you consume and your subsequent migraine frequency.

, One common cause of migraines that can be easily prevented is inadequate sleep. How much sleep you need will depend on factors like your age and your activity level, though everyone's body works differently.Talk to your doctor if you're worried about the quality or quantity of sleep you get each night.


Adults over the age of 18 generally need seven to nine hours of sleep each night, though some may need more.Teenagers typically need 8 to 10 hours of sleep each night. Some may need additional sleep.
School-age children usually need between 9 and 11 hours of sleep each night, though some may need up to 12 hours of sleep.

Ask your physiotherapist about kinesiology tape.",How to Treat Headaches at the Base of the Skull (Cervicogenic Headaches)," While sitting and standing, it's incredibly important to maintain proper posture to avoid pressure on the spine.Less pressure on your spine will help your cervicogenic headaches improve, as this is where the stress originates. Though it will take conscious effort initially, over time, good posture will just become habit.


While sitting, consider supporting your back with a pillow or a rolled towel. Once that's in place around your belt line, make sure your hips are firmly pressed on the back of the chair. Lean slightly forward to make yourself comfortable. This method will help reduce the pressure that is exerted on the spine when you're seated.;
, No need to do fancy exercises – simple walking can strengthen your back, leading to more manageable and fewer headaches. Aim for 20-30 minutes a day, together or in 10 minute chunks if need be. Constant exercise is great for your weight, too.


Walking on a treadmill is a decent option, too, if the weather doesn't allow you to walk outside. You can also make little efforts by taking the stairs, parking far away from the entrance of your building, or simply taking the dog the long way around the block.

, Ibuprofen is classified as a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAIDs). This drug works by blocking enzymes called cyclo-oxygenase. Take 200 to 400mg of ibuprofen (capsule or tablet) every 4 to 6 hours. However, it can cause stomach acidity, so it's best if taken after meals to prevent hyper-acidity.These cyclo-oxygenase enzymes produce prostaglandin which is responsible for the production of pain and inflammation in the area of injury. The blocking of the cyclo-oxygenase enzymes decreases prostaglandin production, in turn decreasing pain and inflammation, reducing your headache.

, Paracetamol (or acetaminophen) is categorized as a pain reliever and fever reducer. Many brands of paracetamol are over the counter, inexpensive, and easily accessible. The recommended dosage for adults suffering from mild pain due to cervicogenic headache is 500mg every 4 to 6 hours.


The recommended dosage for adults suffering from moderate pain is 1000mg every 4 to 6 hours. The maximum daily dose of paracetamol is 4000 mg for adults.

, These drugs are used to manage peripheral and central pain transmission. They are commonly recommended for migraines, head and face pain.One of the common antiepileptic drugs is Divalproex sodium. It is effective due to its dual mechanism of action. It acts on sodium channels and increases levels of aminobutyric acid. The recommended dose is 250 mg orally twice a day for 1 week.

Divalproex sodium is not recommended for pregnant women since it can cause neural tube defects.Another antiepileptic drug is gabapentin. This drug is thought to have positive effects for those suffering from neuropathic pain and migraines.Gabapentin alleviates pain responses and in certain cases can prevent them entirely. The recommended dose is 100 mg to 300 mg daily taken at bedtime.

, This exercise helps to balance the body, aligning the neck, back, and shoulders, as each set is done on one leg. Proper alignment is necessary for fewer (and less intense) headaches, reducing stress on the area. Here's how to do this exercise:


Start by standing behind the chair while holding onto it using both hands.
Lift one leg off the floor and maintain balance using the other leg for approximately 5 seconds.
Return the lifted leg to the floor and repeat this side four more times. This exercise should then be performed 5 times using the other leg, too.

, To easily strengthen your back, simply lie face down on your stomach. Stay in this position, adjusting to make sure your body is in good alignment, lying completely straight. Then, breathe slowly and deeply. This exercise helps to relieve tension and pressure on the back and the spine.


Then, prop yourself up, still in the prone position (on your stomach). On your elbows, hold this position for 1-2 minutes while breathing deeply and slowly. This exercise helps to stretch the muscles in the back and helps in reducing pain.

, These can be done either in a sitting or standing position. Working this area strengthens your upper back and spine, reducing tension and stress at the base of your neck, thus reducing your headaches. Here's how to do this type of exercise:


While sitting or standing, keep your back straight. Check that your hips are under your core and not rolled forward or backward.
Squeeze your shoulders together, backwards. Your chest will jut out.
Hold for five seconds and repeat ten times.

, This exercise can be done either standing or sitting. Move your shoulders back slightly and tuck your chin. Keep your face and eyes forward. Keep this position for ten seconds and repeat ten times.


There are different exercises that can be done at home which can minimize cervicogenic headaches, and these are just a few. The aim is to stabilize and control upper cervical spine movement. These exercises should be done 3-5 times a day. For maximum effect, gradually increase the number of times each one is done daily.

, Specific types of physical therapy can help relieve cervicogenic headaches. Since this type of headache is mostly caused by tension and stress, continuous physical therapy, done with a certified professional, can relieve cervicogenic headache.


Gradually increase your physical therapy exercises in amount of intensity. Physical therapy should start out gentle and light and gradually increase. It is suggested that six weeks of physical therapy can improve recurrent cervicogenic exercise.However, if headache is felt or aggravated after physical therapy, you should limit yourself to less vigorous exercise.



, Some physical therapy exercises that address cervicogenic headaches are cervical spine manipulation and strengthening exercises like deep neck flexors, upper quarter muscle stretches, thoracic spine thrust manipulation and C1-C2 self-sustained natural apophyseal glides. Here's how they work:Cervical spine manipulation is done lying on your back with the doctor or physical therapist gently moving your neck and adjusting it. It can also be done in a sitting or face-down position.
Craniocervical spine extensors are done by a back and forth and circular controlled motion of the head.
Co-contraction is done through self-restricted isometric rotation in a correct upright position.
Retraining the strength of the superficial and deep flexor synergy is done by lifting the head followed by cervical flexion. This must be done in a lying position. The flexion and lifting of the head must be done slowly to prevent worsening the condition.
Restraining scapular muscles can be done by moving the shoulder bones upward and backward. They are then held in that position for 10 seconds to strengthen the area.
C1-C2 self-sustained apophyseal glides are done through active and passive physiological activities with the assessment of the physical therapist.

, Most people with cervicogenic headaches complain of tightness of the muscles, including the pectoralis major and minor, trapezius and levator muscles (the muscles found on the upper part of the body). Stretching them out and contracting them against resistance (with your physiotherapist) can get rid of this tightness, lengthening the muscle.


This should only be done with the help of the physiotherapist who can apply the resistance for you. Once in place with the resistance applied, you'll exhale and relax the muscle. The exercise will then be repeated on the opposite side.

, This device can support your back so that the spine can be maintained in an optimal position. This is very important for people who have frequent back pains because it helps to reduce pressure on the spine.


The corset can be used in the office, home or in the car because it is portable, ensuring that the back is supported at all times.

, KT tape can decrease the pain in your shoulders and neck. The specific tape that is used is called a lift strip. Here's how it works:


With your physiotherapist, sit with your shoulders and neck exposed.
The lift strip is then cut to a length of 3-4 inches long (7.5-10 cm) for each side of the neck.
The paper backing that is in the center of the strip is removed, making it look like an adhesive bandage.
The kinesiology tape is fully stretched and then is applied on the shoulder area and the neck where the pain is present.
The tape should be rubbed gently to make it adhere to the skin.
The strip is left on the skin for 2-5 days. The area around the skin should be monitored for redness or a rash as this can be an indication of a reaction to the tape.

Determine if you are experiencing the prodrome phase.,
Determine if you are experiencing the aura phase.,
Recognize the migraine itself.,
A small percentage of migraine sufferers report a phase of postdrome, symptoms experienced after the migraine itself.",How to Recognize the Symptoms of Migraines," Symptoms which occur in approximately 60% of those with migraines include:


Stiff muscles (particularly the neck)
Irritable mood
Increased thirst
Craving for a specific food
Sensitivity to light and/or sound
Loss of appetite
Loss of concentration
Fatigue
Depression
Increased yawning
Euphoria;
, Approximately 20% of migraine sufferers experience auras, and they tend to last 5-20 minutes up to an hour. Not all sufferers of migraines with auras will experience an aura with every migraine. Symptoms include:


Visual Symptoms (most common):

Spreading area of visual loss
Blurred vision
Jagged lines
Flashing lights
Slowly spreading spots
Blind or dark spots
Distortion in size or shape of objects
Sensitivity to light


Sensory symptoms:

Tingling in a limb, on the face, or in the mouth
Numbness


Other Symptoms:

Sensitivity to noise;
Feelings of confusion;
Slurred speech or delayed responses;
Unable to comprehend spoken words;
Unable to read;
Anxiety or fear;
Nausea;
Weakness;
Feelings of separation from your body.



, Migraines have some qualities which make them distinct from a typical headache:


Unilateral (one side of the brain)
Pain that is throbbing or pulsating in quality
Associated with nausea and vomiting
Photophobia (sensitivity to light)
Phonophobia (sensitivity to sound)
Allodynia (sensation of pain from normally non-painful stimuli, such as brushing hair or shaving)
Migraines are usually moderate to severe, and can last up to three days for adults, and typically only a few hours for children.

, This can last several days and includes symptoms of difficulty concentrating, mood changes, and weakness. This may also include transient pain in the same area as the headache with quick head movements.

Start a headache journal.,
Setup your workstation to be ergonomically correct.,
Use pillows and mattresses that properly support your body.,
Treat your muscles with respect.,
Take a multi-vitamin.,
Stay hydrated.,
Adjust your caffeine intake.,
See your doctor to discuss specific emotional or physical problems that may be causing headaches.",How to Massage Away a Headache1," In order to help you try to narrow down what the underlying causes of your headaches may be, you can keep a headache journal. You should write in your journal every time you experience a headache, and track the following items:When the headache occurred.
Where the pain was on your head, face, and/or neck.
The intensity of the headache. You could use a personal rating scale from one to ten where you’ve defined each level based on your personal experience.
What activities you were involved in when the headache started, including where you were.
A note on how well you slept the night before you experienced the headache.
A note on what you ate, drank, heard, or smelled in the 24 hours leading up to the headache.
A note on how you were feeling before the headache started.
Any other points that you may find useful.;
, Uncomfortable and improper furniture (such as your desk, chair, keyboard, computer monitor, mouse, etc.) can cause your body to be positioned badly for long periods of time. This bad posture can cause all sorts of long-term muscle problems, which in turn cause headaches. You can either rearrange your office furniture on your own, or employ a specialized company to do it for you.You should never have to turn your head, or look up or down, when looking at your computer monitor. It should be directly in front of you, a smidgen below eye level. If your monitor’s stand won’t allow you to move it to the proper level, use books, boxes, a short shelf, or whatever else you have around that can support the monitor.
You should not have to reach far to access your keyboard and mouse. You should be able to comfortably rest your arms on your chair’s armrests while your hands touch both the keyboard and the mouse.
When you sit in your office chair, no part of your body should have to reach anywhere in order to sit in a relaxed position. Your legs should be at 90-degree angles and your feet should be flat on the ground. You arms should be at 90-degree angles with your arms or wrists being able to rest on either the armrests or desk. You should be able to lean back comfortably, with proper lumbar support. You should never sit forward on your chair with your feel on the castors! In fact, it’s best if your chair isn’t able to move around on wheels.
You should never hold a phone between your shoulder and ear. Use the speakerphone, headset, or a bluetooth device to speak on the phone if you need your hands free., Your pillow should allow your spine to remain straight whether you’re lying on your back or on your side. Don’t sleep on your stomach. Your mattress should be firm, especially if you have a sleeping partner. If your sleeping partner is heavier than you, you need to make sure your mattress doesn’t dip so much that you’re rolling into him or her. If this is happening, you’re probably unconsciously bracing yourself while you sleep to prevent yourself from rolling.If you aren’t sure if your mattress is firm enough, try sleeping on the floor or on a camping mattress for a couple of days. If you find that you get a better night’s sleep on the floor, your mattress is nowhere near firm enough.

, Lift with your legs and not your back!Take frequent breaks when you’re in the same position for a long period of time. Purposely relax your muscles and take several deep breaths every now and again. Don’t clench your jaw.Don’t carry your purse or backpack on one shoulder, wear them across your body (for purses) or on both shoulders (for backpacks). Wear only properly fitted shoes with arch support. Minimize wearing high heels. Use lumbar support on any chair or seat that you sit in for longer periods of time (like your car, work, dining chair, etc.).Make sure your eye glass prescription is up-to-date and that you’re not straining to see your book or monitor., The food we eat every day does contain some required vitamins and minerals, but it is highly unlikely that you’re getting all the needed vitamins and minerals, in the right quantities, on a daily basis. A good multi-vitamin, or a combination of more than one individual vitamin, will help ensure you’re getting what you need. Doctor’s recommend ensuring your getting enough vitamin C, B1, B6, B12, folic acid, calcium, magnesium, iron, and potassium.If you are on other medications, check with your doctor before selecting a multi-vitamin.

, If you’ve ever talked to a doctor, nurse, nutritionist, massage therapist or other practitioner, you’ve probably been told to drink more water at some point in your life! In general an adult should drink eight glasses or two quarts of water per day. And that amount should be increased if your exercising or if it’s really hot and you are sweating.It can be really hard to consume the recommended amount of water, especially if you’re busy and always on the go. If you’re having trouble, force yourself to carry a reusable water bottle with you everywhere you go and refill it at every opportunity. Always have it within reach and always give in to the temptation to take sip!

, Most people don’t like being told they have to cut back on the amount of caffeine they consume! And ironically many headache medications include caffeine as an ingredient. This is because caffeine can help a headache initially, but if you consume too much on a daily basis, the caffeine actually causes more muscle tension and other internal problems. Try to stick to the equivalent of two eight-ounce cups of coffee per day. This includes anything you consume that has caffeine, including coffee, tea, pop, medications, and some chocolate., This may include emotional problems like depression or anxiety, and physical problems like sleep problems, infections, hormone imbalances, thyroid function, blood glucose levels, and more.Your doctor will be able to assess, and if required, run laboratory tests to determine if you have any of these underlying problems and then develop a treatment plan specifically for you.

Find your trapezius muscles.,
Work the trapezius muscle while lying down.,
Perform the trapezius pinch.,
Do the trapezius stretch.,
Stretch your pectoralis muscles.",How to Massage Away a Headache2," You have two trapezius muscles, one on either side of your spine, in the shape of a triangle from the top of your neck to your shoulder to the middle of your back. The three parts of the trapezius muscle are called the upper, middle and lower trapezius muscles., To do this, lie on your back with your knees bent. Place a tennis ball under your back, about one inch out from your spine. Start at the top of your back and work your way down. Lie down on the tennis ball for eight to 60 seconds and then move it lower. Go down as far as your upper pelvis, and remember to work both sides of your back., This sounds worse than it feels! Place your elbow and lower arm on a counter or table so they’re supported. Use the opposite arm to pinch the upper trapezius muscle between your neck and shoulder. Hold for eight to sixty seconds and then do the opposite side. Don’t dig your fingers into your shoulder, just grasp the muscle itself., Lie on your back. Start with your arms down by your sides. Move your arms so your upper arms are at a 90-degree angle to the floor, and your lower arms are at a 90-degree angle to your upper arms. Then lower your hands to touch the floor behind your head. Stretch your arms out straight above your head with your palms facing the ceiling. Then move your arms downwards until your upper arms are at a 90-degree angle to your body. Repeat three to five times., While the pectoralis isn’t the trapezius, stretching it still helps your trapezius. For this stretch you’ll need to stand in an open doorway, or beside the corner of a wall. Raise the arm beside the doorway or wall so that the part from your hand to elbow is lying flush against doorway or wall. Your palm should be lying on the doorway or wall. Move the leg on the same side of your body one step forward. Turn your body out from the doorway or wall until you can feel the stretch just below your collar bone. You can move your arm higher and lower to work different parts of the same muscle."

Find your posterior neck muscles.,
Work the muscles at the base of your skull.,
Perform posterior neck stretches.,
Stretch your neck muscles while lying down.",How to Massage Away a Headache3," There are at least half a dozen specific muscles in this area on the back of your neck, between the base of your skull down to your shoulder blades. Tension in this specific area of your body is probably responsible for the vast majority of headaches. , Lie on your back with both hands behind your head. One hand should cradle the other hand. Put a golf ball in the palm of the top hand. Position your hands and the golf ball such that it’s to the side of your spine, not on your spine, then rotate your head to the side to move the golf ball. The only time you have to move your hands is to move the golf ball further down your neck. Once you’ve massaged one side of your spine, move the golf ball to the other side and repeat., You can do these stretches while sitting down or even in the shower. Sit up straight and put your hands behind your head. Use your hands to gently pull your head forwards until you feel the muscles stretching. You can also use your hands to pull your head forward and to both sides by about 45 degrees. Then put one hand on top of your head and pull your head towards that side of your body until you feel the stretch. Repeat with the other hand on the opposite side., Lie on your back on the floor. Bend your knees upwards and put your left hand, palm down, under the base of your spine. Put your right hand on top of your head. Use your hand to pull your head to the right, while looking at the ceiling, until you feel a stretch. Then use your hand to pull your head towards the right again, but this time turn your head about 45 degrees so you’re looking at the wall on your right. Finally turn your head 45 degrees to the left, so you’re looking at the wall to your left, but use your hand to pull your head back to the right. Repeat the whole process on the left side of your body, using your left hand on your head."

Find your temporalis muscle.,
Apply pressure to the temporalis muscles.,
Stretch the temporalis muscles.,
Exercise the temporalis muscle.",How to Massage Away a Headache4," Headaches caused by the temporalis muscle are very common. The temporalis muscles is located on the sides of your head, going from your upper jaw, over the top of your ear and then back behind your ear. Problems with the temporalis muscle can be linked to TMJ problems as well., While either sitting or standing up straight, press the fingertips of your index and middle fingers of both hands to the spots above your temple. While pressing, open and close your jaw several times. Move your fingers around, in that general area, to all the spots where you feel discomfort and open and close your jaw several times at each spot.As an alternative, you can simply yawn over and over again to stretch the temporalis muscles without using your hands to apply any pressure.

, Get both temporalis muscles heated up slightly before you do this stretch by putting hot packs, a heating pad at low temperature, or a warm wet cloth on both sides of your head above your ear. Once the muscles are loosened up, lie on your back and look at the ceiling. Put the index finger of either hand inside your mouth and pull your jaw down by applying pressure to the area just behind your bottom teeth., Lie on your back and look at the ceiling. Put your right index and middle fingers on your right cheek, just on top of your teeth. Put your left index and middle fingers on your lower jaw. Use your left hand to push your jaw to the left. You can repeat the same process to the right by switching the location of your hands.To do this as a stretch, your jaw should be relaxed and shouldn’t cause any resistance to the movement of your jaw to the left and right. If you’ve been working the area for a while and you want to try strengthening the muscle instead of just stretching it, you can add some resistance to the movement of your lower jaw.

Find your face and scalp muscles.,
Apply pressure to the orbicularis oculi muscles.,
Apply pressure to the buccinator and zygomaticus major muscles.,
Apply pressure to the frontalis muscles.,
Apply pressure to the occipitalis muscles.",How to Massage Away a Headache5," There are at least a half a dozen specific muscles on your face and scalp that you can work to help relieve your headaches. The areas you want to work on include: above each eye, at the rim of your eye socket, just below your eyebrow (orbicularis oculi); just above the ends of your mouth (zygomaticus major); the area to the left and right of the end of your mouth, if you pretend your mouth extended another inch or so (buccinator); directly above your eyes and eyebrows, slightly to the inside of your face (frontalis); the spots on the back of your head, at the same level as the top or mid part of your ears (occipitalis); the spots under your jaw, on both sides, if you follow the curve and direction of your ear lobe several inches downwards (platysma)., There are two ways to apply pressure to these muscles. One method is to simply use your index finger and press on the spot above your eye and below your eyebrow, on the bone of your eye socket. You’ll know you’ve found the right spot as it will probably feel uncomfortable. Another method is to actually pinch this area between your fingers and squeeze., You can work both spots with the same technique. Put your right thumb inside your mouth on the left side, with your right index finger on the outside of your mouth in the same area. Pinch the skin between your thumb and your index finger. You’ll want to move your fingers around from your cheek to the bottom of your jaw — wherever you find an area that’s uncomfortable. Repeat on the right side of your face with your left hand., This one is quite simple — just use your index and middle fingers to apply pressure to the area above your eyebrow, on your forehead. Move your fingers around to all the spots where you feel discomfort., You can work this area in one of two ways. The easy way is to simply use your index and middle fingers to apply pressure to the areas at the back of your head where you feel discomfort. You can also lie on the ground, while looking at the ceiling, and use a tennis ball to apply pressure to these areas."
"
Find your jaw muscles.,
Apply pressure to your masseter muscle.,
Stretch your mouth and masseter muscles.,
Apply pressure to the lateral pterygoid muscles.,
Apply pressure to the medial pterygoid muscles.,
Apply pressure to your digastric muscles.",How to Massage Away a Headache6," There are a lot of muscles that are attached to, or near, your jaw and help you do important things like chew. These muscles include: the masseter, which is located in front of your ear, along your teeth; the lateral pterygoid, which is attached to your jaw joint and up into your cheek area; the medial pterygoid, which is located behind your jaw bone; the digastric, which is located under your chin., To do this, put your right thumb inside the left side of your mouth, with your right index finger on the outside of the left side of your mouth. Since the masseter muscles are further back towards your ears, you may have to push your thumb a little bit to the back of your jaw, behind your cheek. Then use your index finger (and middle finger if you need to), along with your thumb, to pinch the masseter muscle. You can work your fingers from the top of the muscle (higher on your face) to the bottom of the muscle (nearer your jaw line). Once you’ve done the left side of your face, use your left hand to do the same thing to the masseter muscle on the right side of your face., Place your right hand on your forehead. Place your left index finger inside your mouth, right behind your bottom teeth. Place your left thumb under your chin/jaw. Use your left hand to pull your jaw downwards while you use your right hand to stabilize your head. Hold for eight seconds. You can do this five to six times to help stretch and exercise the muscles of your mouth., These muscles are located behind a lot of other things on your face and aren’t the easiest things to reach on your own. The best way to apply pressure to these muscles is to put your left index finger into the right side of your mouth — all the way back behind your last molar on your upper jaw. If you press your finger upwards in this area, sort of in the direction of your nose, you should be able to apply pressure to the lateral pterygoid muscle.Once you’ve done the muscle on the right side of your face, switch hands and do the muscle on the left side of your face.


Since this is a hard muscle to reach on your own, don’t worry if you aren’t able to find it. You may need to enlist the help of a professional to get to this muscle if you feel it’s the cause of some of your headaches.

, As with the lateral pterygoid muscles, the medial pterygoid muscles are located behind a lot of other things on your face and aren’t easy to get to. One method is to place your left index finger inside the right side of your mouth. Push your finger back, along your cheek, until you’re past your last molar on your upper jaw. Then push your finger against the area near your jaw joint. You can move your finger up and down in this area until you find spots that are uncomfortable, then hold the pressure on those spots for eight to sixty seconds.Repeat the whole process with your right hand for the left side of your face.

, Start by pushing the knuckle of your right index finger into the soft area under your chin, just behind your lower jaw bone. Start this process near the front of your chin and move your knuckle backwards along your jaw bone until your up behind your jaw joint near your ear. Press and hold for eight to sixty seconds in any location where you feel discomfort. Switch to your left side once your right side is complete."

Apply cold to your head or neck.,
Put moist heat on your face and neck.,
Use both hot and cold at the same time.",How to Massage Away a Headache7," Put an ice pack or ice inside a towel and apply the towel to the area of your head or neck that hurts. Leave it there for 10–15 minutes at the most.Alternatively, you can apply an ice cube directly to the muscle that hurts and move it along the muscle, back and forth, for a little while. Because you’re using ice, don’t hold the ice on your skin in one spot for a long period of time or you may damage your skin or nerves.
Applying an ice pack to the base of your skull and top of your neck can help headaches radiating around the front of your head and face.

, Moist heat, like a wet towel or water directly on your body from a shower, is recommended over dry heat, like a heating pad. You can apply the moist heat to any area of your face or neck that is in pain for 15–20 minutes.Heat doesn’t always work as well as cold because it can cause inflammation in some areas, rather than reduce it. If you don’t find heat works for you, switch to cold.

, Sometimes the best outcomes result from using both heat and cold at the same time. One such method is to apply a cold pack to the base of your head or the top of your neck, plus a moist, warm towel on your upper back and lower neck area. To add even more variety, put a cold pack on the right side of your face and a hot towel on the left side of your face — all at the same time. Switch the hot and cold items on your face every five minutes. Do this for up to 20 minutes total."

Avoid irritating your median nerves.,
Stretch your wrists.,
Take over-the-counter (OTC) anti-inflammatories.,
Use cold therapy.,
Wear a wrist splint.,
Change your sleeping position.,
Alter your work station.,
Make an appointment with your doctor.,
Ask about corticosteroid injections.,
Consider surgery as a last resort.,
Be patient with recovery.",How to Treat Carpal Tunnel Syndrome," The carpal tunnel within your wrist is a narrow passageway made up of small carpal bones and ligaments. The tunnel protects nerves, blood vessels and tendons that go into your hand. The main nerve that innervates your hand is called the median nerve.Avoid activities that compress and irritate the median nerve such as repetitively flexing your wrist, lifting heavy weights with your hands, sleeping with bent wrists and punching solid objects.


Wearing tight bracelets and watches may be a risk factor also, so make sure to leave ample space.
In many cases of carpal tunnel syndrome, a single cause is difficult to identify. Often it involves a combination of factors, such as arthritis or diabetes combined with repetitive strain in the wrist.
The wrist anatomy of people can make a difference — some have naturally smaller passageways in their wrists or have carpal bones that are positioned oddly.;
, Stretching your wrists on a regular basis can be effective at reducing or minimizing carpal tunnel symptoms.In particular, wrist extensions can help make more room for the median nerve in the carpal tunnel by stretching the ligaments that attach to the carpal bones. The easiest way to extend and stretch both wrists at the same time is the ""prayer pose"" with your palms together. Put your palms together in front of your chest and raise your elbows until you feel a nice stretch in your wrists. Hold for 30 seconds and repeat 3-5x daily.


You can also grab the fingers of the affected hand and pull backwards until you feel a stretch at the front of your wrist. You may feel more temporary tingling in your hand with this stretch, but don't stop unless you feel pain.
In addition to hand tingling, other symptoms commonly associated with carpal tunnel syndrome are: numbness, throbbing pain, muscle weakness and color changes (too pale or too red).
The only part of the wrist / hand typically spared symptoms is the little finger — it's not innervated by the median nerve.

, The symptoms of carpal tunnel are often related to having inflammation / swelling in the wrist, which either directly irritates the median nerve or crowds (pinches) it. As such, taking OTC non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil) or naproxen (Aleve), can be very helpful to reduce symptoms short term.Painkillers such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, Paracetamol) can be used for carpal tunnel also, but they don't impact swelling, only the pain.


Anti-inflammatories and analgesics should be considered short-term strategies for pain control. There isn't any evidence that these drugs improve carpal tunnel syndrome in the long term.Taking too many NSAIDs or taking them for too long significantly increases your risk of stomach irritation, ulcers and kidney failure.
Taking too much acetaminophen or taking it for too can cause liver damage.
As an alternative, rub an ointment that contains a natural pain reliever into your sore wrist / hand. Menthol, camphor, arnica and capsaicin are all helpful for relieving mild-to-moderate pain.

, If your wrist is sore and looks or feels swollen, then apply a small bag of crushed ice (or something cold) to it in order to reduce inflammation and numb the pain. Doing so may also reduce hand symptoms. Cold therapy is most effective for soft-tissue injuries that involve some sort of swelling because it reduces blood flow.Apply the crushed ice to your wrist for about 5-10 minutes 3-5x daily until the symptoms subside.


Compressing the ice against your wrist with a stretchy Tensor or Ace bandage is even more effective for fighting inflammation.
Always wrap ice in a thin cloth before applying it skin — it prevents skin irritation or frostbite.
If crushed ice isn't available, use a large ice cube, frozen gel pack or small bag of frozen veggies instead.
In some cases, cold therapy may aggravate the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome. Avoid ice if that's the case with you.

, Wearing a rigid brace or splint that holds your wrist in a neutral position during the day may reduce the compression or irritation of the median nerve and help with carpal tunnel symptoms.Splints or wrist braces can also be worn during activities that aggravate symptoms, such as working at the computer, bowling or carrying groceries. Wearing splints while you sleep can help relieve nighttime symptoms of tingling and numbness in your hands, especially if you have a habit of curling your wrists.You may need to wear a splint for several weeks (day and night) to get significant relief from carpal tunnel symptoms. For some sufferers, splints and braces provide negligible benefit.
Splinting at night can be a good idea if you're pregnant and have carpal tunnel syndrome because pregnancy tends to increase swelling (edema) in the hands and feet.
Wrist splints and braces can be purchased at most pharmacies and medical supply stores.

, Some sleeping postures can aggravate the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome.Sleeping with your fists clenched and wrists tucked in (flexed) is the worst position, but having your arms extended above your head is not great either. Instead, sleep on your back or side with your arms at your sides, and try to keep your hands open and your wrists in a neutral position. Wearing a wrist splint or brace is very helpful in this regard, although it takes a little getting used to.


Don't sleep on your stomach with your hands / wrists compressed under your pillow. People who do this frequently wake up with numb and tingly hands.
Most wrist splints and braces are made of nylon and fasten with velcro, which can irritate other parts of your body. Consider covering your splint with a sock or thin cloth to reduce irritating other body parts.

, Your carpal tunnel problem may be caused or aggravated by a poorly designed work station. If your computer keyboard, mouse, desk and/or chair isn't positioned properly for your height and body proportions, it can put strain on your wrists, shoulders, neck and mid-back. Make sure your keyboard is low enough so that your wrists are not constantly bent upwards while typing.Consider getting an ergonomic keyboard and mouse, designed to take the stress off your wrists and hands.


Putting cushioned pads underneath your keyboard and mouse can lessen the impact on your hands and wrists.
Have an occupational therapist review your body positions while performing your job.
People who work on computers for many hours each day are at higher risk of carpal tunnel syndrome., If you are feeling any carpal tunnel symptoms in your wrist and hand that persist for more than a few weeks, then see your doctor for an examination. Your doctor may take x-rays and blood tests to rule out other causes of wrist / hand pain, such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, advanced diabetes, hairline fractures or vascular problems.


Electrodiagnostic studies (EMG and nerve conduction) are usually done to confirm the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome.Your doctor will see if you can perform certain tasks that are difficult with carpal tunnel syndrome, such as: making a tight fist, pinching your thumb and forefinger together and manipulating small objects with precision.Your doctor may ask about your profession, as certain jobs are at high risk: carpenters, cashiers, assembly-line workers, musicians, auto mechanics and people who work on computers for long hours.

, Your doctor may recommend injecting the carpal tunnel area of your wrist with corticosteroid medication, such as cortisone, to relieve the pain, inflammation and other symptoms.Corticosteroids are strong and fast-acting anti-inflammatories that can quickly decrease swelling in your wrist, which relieves pressure on the median nerve. Taking oral corticosteroids (by mouth) is another option, but these drugs are not considered as effective as injections and they come with significant side effects.


Other common corticosteroid medications used for carpal tunnel syndrome are prednisolone, dexamethasone and triamcinolone.
Potential complications of corticosteroid injections include local infection, bleeding, tendon weakening, local muscle atrophy and nerve irritation / damage. As such, injections are limited to 2 per year.
If corticosteroid injections fail to significantly reduce the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome, then surgery should be considered.

, If all other remedies and treatments fail to give you relief, then your doctor will likely recommend carpal tunnel surgery. Surgery should be considered as a last resort, although it can completely relieve your symptoms for good with minimal risk, so it should not be considered as a long shot. The goal of surgery is to relieve pressure on the median nerve by cutting the ligament pressing on it.However, carpal tunnel surgery can be performed in two different ways: endoscopic or open surgery.


Endoscopic surgery involves uses a telescope-like device with a tiny camera on the end (endoscope), which is inserted through a small incision in your wrist or hand. The endoscope can see inside the carpal tunnel and cut the problematic ligament.
Endoscopic surgery typically results in the least amount of pain and the quickest recovery.
Open surgery involves making a larger incision in the palm of your hand and over your wrist in order to cut through the problematic ligament, which frees the nerve.
Surgery risks include: nerve damage, infection and scar tissue formation.

, Following the surgery (it's done on an outpatient basis), you'll be asked to often elevate your hand above your heart and move your fingers, which reduces swelling and prevents stiffness.Mild pain, swelling and stiffness in the palm and wrist can be expected post surgery for up to 6 months, and complete recovery may take a year. For the first 2-4 weeks, you may be required to wear a splint or brace, although using your hand is encouraged.


Most people's symptoms get much better after surgery, but recovery is often slow and gradual. On average, hand strength returns to normal 2 months after surgery.Carpal tunnel syndrome can occasionally recur (about 10% of the time) and may require additional surgery.

Wear a brace.,
Avoid sleeping on your side.,
Support your arms while you sleep.,
Keep your arm straight.",How to Sleep with Carpal Tunnel Syndrome1," One of the easiest things you can do to make sleeping easier if you have carpal tunnel syndrome is to wear a wrist brace to bed. This will prevent you from bending and flexing your wrist while you sleep.You may want to wear a brace during the day as well, depending on what kinds of activities typically cause you pain.
You can buy a brace at any drug store, or your doctor may suggest that you have a custom one made for you.;
, Although it hasn't been definitively proven, sleeping on your side may be associated with a higher risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome. This is likely due to the fact that the wrist is more likely to be compressed in this position. If you sleep on your side, try sleeping on your back to avoid further compressing your wrist as you sleep., It's important to think about where you normally place your arms while you sleep and whether or not this may be worsening your symptoms. Try to avoid sleeping with either arm underneath you or your pillow, as this may worsen your carpal tunnel syndrome.Propping your arms up on pillows while you sleep may help relieve tension and reduce pain. If you are sleeping on your side, make sure the side affected by carpal tunnel is on top. Place a pillow in front of you and place the affected hand on the pillow. You may need to experiment with the height of the pillow to find the most comfortable position for you.

, Bending your elbow may increase the compression on your nerve, which can make your symptoms worse. As much as possible, try to keep your elbow straight throughout the night.You may want to try wrapping a towel around your elbow so that it is difficult to bend. This may help you train yourself to keep your arm straight at night.

The trigeminal nerve is a cranial nerve that facilitates a major pain pathway. Serotonin imbalances and imbalances in other brain chemicals may also be a factor.Neuropeptides, such as substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide, may be causing neurogenic inflammation and vasodilation.There are a variety of subtypes of migraines. There are chronic migraines, medication overuse migraines, basilar type migraines, hemiplegic migraines, ophthalmoplegic migraines, retinal migraines, menstrual related migraines, childhood periodic equivalents, and status migrainosus. The treatment for these types of migraines are generally the same.;

By eliminating any distractions, it is easier to focus on your breath, relieve pain, and let go of any thoughts or sensations that may arise.Sit upright and still and close your eyes. Proper posture is a vital part of meditation. It allows your breath and blood to flow, which helps your brain learn to focus on one point. Closing your eyes will help keep distractions at bay.Breathe easily and evenly. Don’t control your breath; rather, let it come and go. An excellent technique to help your concentration is to focus solely on your breath by saying “let” on the inhale and “go” on the exhale., If you’re in a place that is making your headache worse, think of being someplace else, such as a beach. Framing is a behavioral technique that can help you shape how you think and feel about specific situations and may help relieve your headache.For example, if you have a really bad headache and have screaming children around you, take a deep breath and think of yourself on a beach in Hawaii or someplace else you’d rather be.

Track the food you eat.,
Pay attention to environmental factors.,
Track how much caffeine you consume.,
Track hormonal changes in your body.",How to Live With Migraines1," One of the most common migraine triggers is food. The exact foods that trigger migraines vary from person to person, but there are some food triggers most migraine-sufferers have in common. Tracking what food you eat and when you get a migraine can help you narrow down which foods might be triggers for you. Common migraine triggers are:Chocolate
Wine and cheese (because of the sulfates in both)
Food with monosodium glutamate (MSG) in it.
Artificial sweeteners like aspartame.
Processed foods (which usually contain nitrates).;
, Migraines can also be triggered by things like smells, lights, noises, and even the weather. If you notice you’re getting migraines pretty regularly, track what sort of environmental triggers are happening at the same time. When you're tracking your migraines, ask yourself a few questions: Do you recall always smelling the same thing before your migraine? Do you spend a lot of time under fluorescent lights? This can help you figure out environmental triggers.

, Caffeine can cause migraines if you experience caffeine withdrawal. This is most likely if you regularly drink more than the equivalent of two cups of coffee per day. Tracking your caffeine intake can show you if you have migraines on days when you don’t drink as much caffeine as you usually do., Changes in certain hormone levels – particularly estrogen – can cause migraines, especially in women. Track when you get your migraines and how this lines up with your body's hormonal changes to see if you have hormonal triggers.Women who are on birth control pills might experience migraines because of the hormonal changes the pill can cause. Some women may experience migraines shortly before their periods begin, when their estrogen levels drop.

You can also create moist air by filling a basin of hot water, bending over it (taking care not to get too close) and covering your head with a towel. Breathe in the steam. Or, you can take a hot shower, breathing in the steam. Try to breathe in moist air two to four times a day in 10- to 20-minute intervals.Your home humidity level should be around 45%. Below 30% is too dry, and over 50% is too high. Use a tool called a hygrometer to measure the levels.;
, Alternating between applying hot and cold compresses. Place a hot compress across the sinuses for three minutes, and then a cold compress for 30 seconds. You can repeat this procedure three times per treatment and between two and six times a day.You can also run hot or cold water over a towel, wring it out, and apply it to your face to get the same effect as a compress.

, Be sure to drink plenty of fluids, which can help thin out the mucus in your sinuses. This will make it easier to drain and can help with overall hydration.According to studies, men should try to drink 13 cups of water a day, while women should drink around nine.Some people find that drinking hot fluids can help.

Take antihistamines.,
Use nasal decongestants.,
Take pain relievers.,
Take prescription medications.,
Consider getting allergy injections (immunotherapy).,
Find out about surgical options.",How to Get Rid of a Sinus Headache2," These medications block histamine, a substance your body makes as a response to allergens. Histamine is responsible for the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (sneezing, itchy eyes, and itchy, runny nose). Several antihistamines can be purchased over-the-counter and are taken once a day. Second-generation antihistamines, like loratadine, fexofenadine, and cetirizine are all designed to minimize drowsiness, a problem with first- generation antihistamines (like diphenhydramine or chlorpheniramine).If seasonal allergies are the cause of your sinus headaches, try taking intranasal corticosteroids. These over-the-counter medications are the most effective at treating the allergies. Take fluticasone or triamcinolone spray daily, using one to two sprays in each nostril., You can take these medications topically (as nose sprays like oxymetazoline) or orally (as pseudoephedrine) to relieve nasal congestion. Topical decongestants can be used every 12 hours, but not for more than three to five days or you may develop rebound nasal congestion from decongestant overuse. Oral decongestants can be taken once or twice a day. These can be combined with antihistamines like loratadine, fexofenadine, and cetirizine.


Because it a major ingredient of methamphetamine, or speed, pseudoephedrine, alone and in combination with antihistamines, is highly regulated and kept behind the pharmacy counter to prevent stockpiling by methamphetamine manufacturers., You can take aspirin, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or naproxen for short-term relief of sinus headaches. Even though over-the-counter pain relievers will not treat the underlying cause of a sinus headache, they can help reduce or remove the head pain associated with sinus trouble.


Be sure to take them as directed on the packaging or by your doctor.

, Your doctor may prescribe antibiotics to treat a bacterial infection that can accompany or cause sinus headaches. Symptoms of a bacterial sinus infection include a sore throat, yellow or green discharge from your nose, nasal congestion, fever, and fatigue. Acute bacterial sinusitis is treated with 10 to 14 days of antibiotics while chronic bacterial sinusitis needs three to four weeks of antibiotic treatment.


Your doctor may also prescribe triptans, medications used to treat migraines. Research has shown that the majority of patients with sinus headaches had significant improvement in symptoms with triptans.Examples of triptans include sumatriptan, rizatriptan, zolmitriptan, almotriptan, naratriptan, rizatriptan, and eletriptan.

, Your doctor may recommend allergy injections if you don't respond well to medication, have significant side effects from medication, or have allergen exposure that's unavoidable.An allergy specialist (allergist) will typically administer the injections.

, You'll meet with an Ear, Nose, and Throat (ENT) specialist who can determine if you need surgery to prevent sinus headaches. Nasal polyps or bone spurs that might cause sinus infections can be surgically removed or your sinuses can be opened.


For example, balloon rhinoplasty involves inserting a balloon into the nasal cavity and inflating it to enlarge the sinus cavity."
"
Take a dietary supplement.,
Try herbal remedies.,
Apply essential oils to your temples.,
Consider homeopathy.,
Try acupuncture.,
See a chiropractor.",How to Get Rid of a Sinus Headache3," Research is being done to determine the extent of dietary supplements' impact on sinus headaches. The following supplements may prevent or treat sinus headaches:Bromelain is an enzyme produced by pineapples, which may help reduce sinus inflammation. Do not take bromelain with blood-thinners since the supplement can increase your risk of bleeding. You should also avoid bromelain if you're taking angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, a class of medications commonly used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension). In the due this case, Bromelain can increase the chances of a precipitous drop in blood pressure (hypotension).
Quercetin is a plant pigment responsible for producing vibrant colors in fruits and vegetables. It is thought to act as a natural antihistamine, but more studies are needed in humans to see if it behaves like an antihistamine.
Lactobacillus is a probiotic bacteria that your body needs for a healthy digestive system and effective immune system. The supplement decreases both the chances of developing allergies and gastrointestinal side effects such as diarrhea, gas and abdominal pain related to using antibiotics.

, There are many herbs that may reduce the chances of getting sinus headaches. They do this by preventing or treating a cold, boosting the immune system, or reducing sinus inflammation. Studies have shown that the herbal supplement, Sinupret, can decrease the symptoms of sinus inflammation. It's believed that it works by thinning mucus, allowing for improved sinus drainage.Other herbs that have traditionally been used to treat sinus headaches include:


Chinese skullcap. Make a tea by pouring 1 cup of boiling water over 1 to 2 teaspoons of dried leaves. Cover and steep the mixture for 10 to 15 minutes. Drink two to three cups a day to feel sinus relief.
Feverfew. Make a tea by pouring 1 cup of boiling water over 2 to 3 teaspoons of freshly chopped feverfew leaves. Steep the mixture for 15 minutes, strain it, and drink it up to three times a day.
Willow bark. Make a tea by combining one teaspoon of chopped or powdered willow bark with 8 – 10 ounces of water. Bring the mixture to a boil and simmer for five minutes. Drink the tea three to four times a day.

, Studies have shown that certain essential oils applied to your temples (next to your eyes on the side of your face), can relieve sinus and tension headaches. Create a 10% solution of peppermint or eucalyptus oil in rubbing alcohol and dab it on your temples using a sponge.To create the solution, try mixing three tablespoons of rubbing alcohol with one teaspoon of peppermint or eucalyptus oil.


This mixture can relax your muscles and reduce your sensitivity to the sinus headaches, according to research., Homeopathy is a belief and alternative therapy that uses small amounts of natural substances that are meant to cause the body to heal itself. Chronic sinus sufferers usually use homeopathy, with studies showing the majority of patients reporting improved symptoms after two weeks.Homeopathy has a large number of treatments targeting sinus congestion and headache including


Arsenic album, Belladonna, hepar sulphuricum, iris versicolor, kali bichromicum, mercurius, natrum muriaticum, pulsatilla, silicea, and spigelia.

, This is an ancient Chinese discipline that applies thin needles to acupuncture points. It is believed that these points can correct imbalances in your body's energies.To treat your sinus headache, an acupuncture practitioner will treat the sinus inflammation (or dampness) by strengthening points along your spleen and stomach.You shouldn't try acupuncture if you're pregnant, have a bleeding disorder, or have a pacemaker., Your chiropractor may be able to help your sinus headache by adjusting and manipulating misalignments within your body, although there are no trials that support this claim. In sinus adjustment, the practitioner targets the bones and the mucous membranes lining the cavities of sinuses.


Manipulation adjusts joints to correct misalignments that stimulate the nervous system. This may restore function to affected areas of the body."

Distinguish between migraines and sinus headaches.,
Recognize the symptoms and causes.,
Check yourself for risk factors.,
Know when to seek medical help.,
Get tested.",How to Get Rid of a Sinus Headache4," According to several studies, the majority of people diagnosed with a sinus headache had undiagnosed migraines.Fortunately, there are several symptoms that may help distinguish sinus headaches from migraines. For example:Migraines usually worsen with noise or bright light
Migraines are accompanied by nausea and vomiting
Migraine pain can be felt anywhere in your head and into your neckMigraines won't have thick, nasal discharge or loss of smell

, The primary cause of a sinus headache is inflammation of the mucus membranes lining your sinuses. The inflammation prevents your sinuses from secreting mucus. This causes pressure to build up and causes pain. Sinus inflammation can be caused by any infection, allergies, infections of the upper teeth, or, rarely, tumors (benign or malignant).Symptoms of sinus headaches include:Pressure and tenderness behind the forehead, cheeks, or around the eyes
Pain that worsens with bending forward
Pain in the upper teeth
Pain that is more intense first thing in the morning
Pain that ranges from mild to severe and can be unilateral (on one side) or bilateral (on both sides)

, Several factors can make you more prone to getting sinus headaches. These factors may include:A history of allergies or asthma
Persistent colds, also known as upper respiratory infections
Ear infections
Enlarged tonsils or adenoids
Nasal polyps
Nasal deformities, such as a deviated septum
Cleft palate
Weakened immune system
Prior sinus surgery
Climbing or flying to high altitudes
Traveling in an airplane while you have an upper respiratory infection
Tooth abscess or infection
Frequent swimming or diving

, If your headaches happen more than 15 days a month, or you frequently use nonprescription pain medication, you should see your doctor. You should also consider seeing your doctor if the pain medication doesn't help a severe headache or the headaches interfere with daily life (for example, you often miss school or work because of headaches).Get emergency medical help if you have a sinus headache and the following symptoms:Sudden and severe headache that lasts or increases in intensity over 24 hours.
A sudden severe headache that is described as “the worst ever,” even if you are prone to headaches.
Chronic or severe headache that commences after age 50.
Fever, stiff neck, nausea, and vomiting (these symptoms may be suspicious for meningitis, a life-threatening bacterial infection).
Memory loss, confusion, loss of balance, change in speech or vision, or loss of strength in or numbness or tingling in any one of your limbs (these symptoms may be suspicious for a stroke).
Several headaches in one eye, accompanied by redness of the eye (these symptoms may be suspicious for acute angle closure glaucoma).
A new or change in headache pattern.
If you have experienced recent head trauma.

, Your doctor will take a complete medical history and perform a physical exam to diagnose a sinus headache. During the exam, your doctor will touch your face to look for tenderness or swelling. Your nose will be checked for signs of inflammation, congestion, or nasal discharge. Your doctor may also order imaging studies such as X-ray, computed tomography (CT) scan, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. If your physician thinks allergies may be contributing to your symptoms, you may be referred to an allergist for more testing.Occasionally, a referral to an ear, nose, and throat (ENT) specialist is needed. The ENT will use a fiber optic scope to visualize the sinuses and make a diagnosis."
"
Talk to your doctor about prescription medications to prevent migraine headaches.,
Discuss acute or abortive medications with your doctor.,
Try feverfew.,
Consider butterbur to help reduce the severity and number of your migraines.Butterbur can be taken on a regular basis for up to four months, though again its helpfulness is based on anecdotal evidence and is not scientifically proven.",How to Deal With Migraines2," Your physician can prescribe preventive medication to reduce the number and severity of your migraines. There are several different preventative medications that your physician may suggest. Preventive medications are meant to be taken daily and can include:Beta blockers, which are also used to treat heart disease. Although the reason they work is not clear, doctors believe it may be that they keep blood vessels from constricting and dilating in the brain. Beta blockers include atenolol (Tenormin), metoprolol (Lopressor), propranolol (Inderal).
Calcium channel blockers are another type of heart medication that have been found to reduce the number and duration of migraine headaches. These medications include verapamil (Calan) or diltiazem (Cardizem).
Tricyclic antidepressants help prevent other kinds of headaches as well as migraines. Medications include amitriptyline(Elavil), nortriptyline (Pamelor), doxepin (Sinequan), imipramine (Tofranil).
Some anticonvulsant medications will also prevent migraine headaches, although physicians are not sure why. Some anticonvulsants that have been effective include divalproex sodium (Depakote), gabapentin (Neurontin), topiramate (Topamax).
Botox injections have been approved by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) to treat migraines. The medication helps some people and is injected in a series in the forehead, temples, back of the neck and shoulders about every three months.

, Acute or abortive medications are designed to stop the headache you currently have. Acute or abortive medications are given when the symptoms first appear. Different medications are used to treat either the pain or the associated symptoms.Triptans are some of the first medications prescribed to relieve pain, nausea, and sensitivity to light, sounds, and smells. Triptan medications include: almotriptan (Axert), eletriptan (Relpax), frovatriptan (Frova), naratriptan (Amerge), rizatriptan (Maxalt), sumatriptan (Imitrex), zolmitriptan (Zomig).
Ergots work by constricting the blood vessels but have more side effects than triptans. These are the second type of medications used to help relieve pain and the associated symptoms, which can be worse than the headache itself. These medications include dihydroergotamine (Migranal) and ergotamine (Ergomar).
Isometheptene, dichloralphenazone, and acetaminophen, known as Midrin, combines a pain reliever, sedative, and medication that also constricts blood vessels to address the needs of someone with a headache.
Narcotics, such as codeine, are used for people who can’t take triptans or ergots because of side effects, allergic reactions, or interactions with other medications. But keep in mind that narcotics may also cause dependency and rebound headaches.

, Consider using feverfew daily to prevent migraines or reduce the severity of migraine headaches. This is not proven to reduce the severity or the number of headaches from which you suffer. However, there is anecdotal evidence that suggests some effect, so it is worth considering.


Freeze dried capsules are recommended because the tea is bitter and can irritate the mucous membranes in your mouth.Speak to your physician and pharmacist about integrating feverfew into your daily routine before starting.Feverfew can interact with other medications you may already be taking.
Do not take feverfew if you are pregnant or want to become pregnant, are breastfeeding, or taking another nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication, such as aspirin or ibuprofen.
Taper off slowly if you decide to quit taking feverfew. Stopping feverfew quickly can result in the return of migraine headaches with more symptoms, such as increased nausea, and vomiting.

, Ask your doctor what extract and dose would be appropriate for your circumstances, including your weight, age, and any underlying medical conditions.


Keep in mind that if you are allergic to ragweed, then you may be sensitive to butterbur.
Women who are pregnant, nursing, or want to become pregnant should not take butterbur.

Go to bed and get up at the same time each day.,
Limit your alcohol and caffeine intake.,
Manage your stress.,
Quit smoking.,
Include daily supplements to help prevent your migraine headaches.",How to Deal With Migraines3," One of the triggers for migraines are hormonal fluctuations. Your body will manufacture and release hormones such as melatonin and cortisol in response to the number of hours of sleep you get and when you get them. These fluctuations, along with sleep deprivation, can trigger migraine headaches., Alcohol and caffeine affect your neuroregulatory system. Although the exact cause of migraine headaches has not yet been identified, most physicians agree that migraines can be triggered by changes to the neurological system.In small amounts caffeine can increase the effects of acetaminophen when taken at the beginning of a headache. One cup of coffee with acetaminophen is often enough. If you drink too much caffeine, over two cups, you can get a rebound headache later on.

, Stress triggers the release of hormones that may affect your neurological system, which can trigger migraine headaches.Not all stress reduction strategies work for everyone, so it’s important to find something that works for you.Prioritize what has to be done, take one challenge at a time and move on. Try not to get overwhelmed by the tasks that you have to complete.
Practice deep breathing. Deep breathing can lower your heart rate and reduce your stress. Positive self-talk will help to reduce your stress levels.
Get regular exercise. Exercise will reduce stress, improve your mood and enhance your self-esteem. Take a 15 minute walk after each meal, go swimming at the local YMCA, go jogging in the evening after work, or take to the bike trails with your friends.
Get plenty of sleep. Lack of sleep will not only affect your hormone levels but also your stress levels. In a study done at the University of Pennsylvania researchers found that losing just a few hours of sleep will increase feelings of sadness, stress, anger and exhaustion.Aim for seven to eight hours of sleep per night.

, The Michigan Headache and Neurological Institute recommends that you quit smoking to reduce your migraines and their severity.Tobacco triggers migraines three different ways. Smoking:


Raises the carbon monoxide levels in the blood and brain
Reduces oxygen levels in the blood and brain
Has a toxic effect on the brain and alters liver metabolism, reducing the effectiveness of migraine prevention medications

, Talk with your doctor before adding any supplements to your daily regimen.Magnesium can help to reduce migraines that are associated with a woman’s menstrual period or in people who have abnormally low levels of magnesium. Potential side effects include diarrhea and low blood pressure.
5-HTP is an amino acid that converts into serotonin in your body. Some of the prescription drugs used to treat migraines affect the serotonin levels in the body. If you already take an antidepressant or natural herbal supplement, such as St. John’s Wort, are pregnant, nursing or plan to become pregnant, you should not use 5-HTP.
Vitamin B2, also known as riboflavin, can reduce the number and severity of migraines. However, if you already take tricyclic antidepressants or anticholinergic medications, do not add vitamin B2 to your daily regimen.

Recognize when your headache requires medical care.,
Talk to your doctor about recurring migraines.,
Keep a headache diary to help identify your triggers.Record your meals, menstrual period (women), exposure to chemicals , caffeine intake, sleep patterns, and weather changes.",How to Deal With Migraines4," A true migraine headache is not caused by a tumor or other structural change in your brain. However, only your medical physician can determine if your headache is the result of a migraine or something else.Seek emergency medical care if you:Are confused or have trouble understanding what is being said to you
Feel faint
Have a fever greater than 102°F (38.9°C)
Have numbness, weakness or paralysis
Have a stiff neck
Have trouble seeing, speaking, or walking
Loss of consciousness

, For some people, migraines are a common occurrence and may even be severe. You should see your doctor if your headaches:


Occur more frequently than they had before
Are more severe than usual for you
Don’t get better with over-the-counter medications or medications your physician has prescribed
Prevent you from working, sleeping, or socializing

, Use the diary to help you and your doctor to determine what causes your migraines. After you identify your triggers, try to avoid them as much as possible. Some common triggers include:Stress
Hormonal fluctuations (during a woman’s menstrual cycle)
Skipping meals
Too much caffeine
Certain foods, such as cheese, pizza, chocolate, ice cream, fried foods, lunch meats, hot dogs, yogurt, aspartame, and anything with MSG
Alcohol, especially red wine
Sudden changes in sleep patterns
Smoking
Barometric weather changes
Caffeine withdrawal
Heavy workouts
Loud noises and bright lights
Odors or perfumes

"
Shut off the lights.,
Eliminate as much noise as possible.,
Lie down and rest.,
Take a deep breath.,
Apply a cold compress.A cold washcloth applied to your achy head can cause the blood vessels there to contract, which slows down the rush of blood to your head.,
Take a cold shower, followed by a sleep in a cool room.,
Modify your diet.There are often certain foods that can trigger migraines in people; what the triggers are will vary from individual to individual.",How to Get Rid of a Migraine Fast1," Many migraines are triggered by sensory stimuli, such as bright or flickering lights. Calm your senses down by turning the lights off and pulling down the shades, or by moving into a dark room.Stay in the dark room until your migraine goes away, or for as long as possible.
Wear sunglasses when necessary. If you have to be out and about and are unable to get to an area with soft light or no light, wear polarizing sunglasses to protect your eyes from the brightest parts of the light spectrum. This may not be quite as effective as spending a few minutes in a dark room, but it will usually still help.;
, As with light, sound is another sensory stimuli known to trigger migraines. Turn off all background noise, such as radios and televisions, or move to a quiet, calm spot.


If you cannot go to a separate room, wear noise-canceling headphones over your ears to block out external noise.
Some individuals find silence stressful or unnerving. If this is the case, run a white noise machine or air purifier in the background to provide soothing ambient sound. You could also try soothing music; however, avoid loud or exciting tunes.

, Stress and lack of sleep are other common triggers for migraine headaches. Take a few minutes to lie down on your back and close your eyes the next time a migraine comes on.


Rest anywhere from five to 30 minutes to help your migraine go away.
Note, however, that some migraines are caused by getting too much sleep. If this may be one of your triggers, you should avoid lying down any longer., Deep breathing exercises can relax the body, thereby releasing any tension that might be contributing to your migraine.Lie on your back with a pillow below your head and a second pillow below your knees. Your legs should be somewhat bent.
Place your dominant hand on your upper chest and your other hand below your rib cage.
Breathe in slowly through your nose until your stomach pushes against your non-dominant hand.
Breathe out slowly through pursed lips as you tighten your stomach.
Keep your dominant hand still throughout the entire process.
Do this routine for about five minutes.

,


Wet a soft, clean washcloth with cold water and place it over your forehead or on the back of your neck. Let it sit for 10 to 15 minutes. Take a 10 to 15 minute break before applying the compress again, and continue in this pattern until your migraine goes away.
Note that in some instances, however, cold temperatures can actually make a migraine headache feel worse. If the pain increases within the first 5 minutes of treatment, stop immediately and try something else.

, Stand under a cold shower with the water running over the top of your head for at least 15 minutes. Give yourself a head massage while you shampoo. This helps to reduce the tensions in your body while releasing the heat from your scalp.


Lightly squeeze the excess water from your hair, but keep it damp. Do not dry your hair.
Lie down in a cool room while your hair is still damp and try to sleep for a while. You can place a towel over your pillow if you are worried about it being wet.

, You can determine any dietary triggers you may have by recording what you ate prior to the onset of a migraine headache, and looking to see if there are any patterns over time. Common dietary triggers of migraine headache include:


Foods containing aspartame or MSG
Alcohol
Chocolate
Cheese
Salami
Caffeine

Buy mallow from a health food store.,
Boil water and prepare the tea.,
Use a teaspoon of mallow for every 8 ounces of water.,
Sweeten your tea with lemon or honey.,
Drink your tea.",How to Get Rid of a Headache Using Mallow1," Mallow can be purchased at some specialty health food stores, or online. Try a store that sells other herbs and/or essential oils. Some stores that specialize in traditional Chinese medicine, herbs, and healing might also carry mallow. It might be a good idea to call around to a few places to see what stores near you carry it.It’s a good idea to use fresh mallow as opposed to dried mallow. Though both are effective, fresh mallow contains more of its mucilage, which is what really gives the plant its healing properties.;
, If you are using dried mallow, boil the water before infusing it with the mallow. Let the tea infuse for 2-4 minutes in the hot water. However, if you are using fresh mallow, it’s actually a better idea to steep the mallow in cool water overnight, and then heat the infused liquid in the morning.Steeping the leaves and flowers of the mallow plant in slightly warm water for a few hours is also an option., Regardless of whether you’re using fresh or dried mallow, this is a good ratio to follow. If you’re infusing hot water with dried mallow, try using a tea infuser, which you can purchase at your nearby grocery store. If you’re using fresh mallow, simply place the leaves and flowers directly into the water to steep, then remove them before drinking., Use a small amount of lemon or honey to give your tea a more pleasant taste. If you use lemon, though, make sure to use very little. Even just the juice from one lemon wedge would be sufficient. Or, stir in a teaspoon or two of honey, to taste., If you made tea with boiling water, make sure you let it cool before drinking. If you have let it steep overnight or over a few hours, consider heating it up a little to add to its soothing properties. A nice, warm cup of tea might be just what you needed to help kick your headache.


The water may turn a light shade of blue while steeping the tea. This is normal. The color comes from the plant itself."
"
Take the right supplements.Supplements that studies suggest may help rid you of your migraine include vitamin B2, feverfew, melatonin, butterbur, co-Q10 and magnesium.,
Make tea with lavender or other helpful herbs.,
Consider consuming a little caffeine.,
Massage your temples and neck.,
Treat a mild migraine with gentle aerobic exercise.As long as the pain has not made moving around unbearable for you, light aerobic exercise can get your blood flowing to other areas of your body and cause your migraine to vanish.",How to Get Rid of a Migraine Fast2,"


Butterbur-based supplements are among the most helpful and are thought the prevent migraines and reduce their severity. It lessens inflammation and stabilizes blood flow while serving as a beta-blocker. As a result, it prevents blood vessel spasms. Take a dose of 50 mg and make sure that the supplement you use is labeled ""PA Free.""
Vitamin B2, also called riboflavin, has also been known to reduce the frequency and severity of migraines. Taking 400 mg of the vitamin daily can cut the frequency of your symptoms in half, and taking it while a migraine is already in progress may also temporarily soothe the pain.
Feverfew, melatonin, and Co-Q10 (coenzyme Q10) may or may not help to reduce the severity of your migraine after it begins. The good news though is that steady doses of any of these can help to decrease the overall frequency of migraine attacks.
Magnesium has mixed results. A 500 mg supplement can help reduce the severity of a migraine if that migraine is associated with a menstrual cycle; otherwise, its usefulness is debatable. Try taking this with riboflavin and butter bur in practice as a daily preventative regimen.

, Herbal teas can soothe your body and reduce the tension responsible for part or all of your migraine. As a result, you may find your migraine fading faster. Lavender, ginger, peppermint, and cayenne pepper are all thought to help.


Lavender reduces blood vessel inflammation and is generally the most effective herbal remedy for anxiety, stress, and migraines triggered by stress. In addition to sipping on lavender herbal tea, you could also place sachets or hot packs of dried lavender over your eyes to relieve a migraine as it starts.
Ginger, peppermint, and cayenne all have natural pain-relieving properties. Ginger and peppermint are good at reducing any nausea associated with your migraine. Note that ginger can thin blood, though, so it should be avoided if you are on a blood-thinner.
Make an herbal tea capable of chasing away your migraine by steeping a pinch of cayenne pepper, 1 inch (2.5 cm) of fresh ginger, and 1 tsp (5 ml) of dried peppermint in 2 cups (500 ml) boiling water for 15 minutes.

, Caffeine is a paradox when it comes to migraines. Too much can bring a migraine on, but taking a little caffeine after a migraine comes upon you can actually help the pain to go away.


Only take a small dose of caffeine: one soda, one cup of coffee, one cup of tea, or one chocolate bar is sufficient. Avoid energy drinks high in caffeine.
Note that this generally only works if your migraine was not originally triggered by caffeine.

, Migraines are closely linked to tension. Sometimes, giving yourself a quick, simple massage can relax your muscles and blood vessels enough to ease your symptoms.Use your index and middle fingers on both hands to gently massage your temples, the sides of your neck, and the back of your neck. Apply firm but gentle pressure in small, circular strokes.
To increase the effectiveness of this technique, dip your fingers in ice cold water before you begin. The cold water can cause your blood vessels to constrict, slowing the rush of blood to your head as a result.

,


Aerobic exercise worth trying during a migraine may include brisk walking or jogging, cycling, or swimming.
As your heart pumps, your blood circulation will improve and stabilize throughout your body, causing the blood to stop rushing to your head.
Additionally, exercise is a good way to relax and get your mind off any stresses that may have triggered the migraine.

"
Take an over-the-counter pain reliever.Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and analgesics reduce migraine pain by reducing blood vessel inflammation.,
Try an over-the-counter pain reliever with caffeine.Some non-prescription drugs combine simple analgesics with a low dose of caffeine.,
Get a prescription for triptans.These drugs work by constricting your blood vessels, thereby limiting the rush of blood to your head.,
Ask your doctor about dihydroergotamine or ergotamines.These prescription drugs also constrict the blood vessels in your brain.",How to Get Rid of a Migraine Fast3,"


Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs include Naproxen and Ibuprofen. Analgesics include Aspirin and Acetaminophen.
For this treatment to be most effective, you should take the painkiller within 30 minutes of your first migraine symptoms. It should still work even if you wait longer than that, but the migraine may last a bit longer.
Avoid taking these drugs more than twice a week. Doing so can cause you to undergo rebound migraines once the medication wears off., The caffeine narrows your blood vessels and makes these pain relievers more effective.


These drugs, such as Excedrin migraine, usually combine acetaminophen or aspirin with caffeine.
Studies suggest that these drugs can work up to 20 minutes faster than drugs with no caffeine.
As with other over-the-counter pain killers, you should take the drug within 30 minutes of your first symptoms and avoid taking the drug more than twice a week.

, Studies and trials suggest that many migraine sufferers experience significant relief within one hour of taking the drug, with complete relief coming in as little as two hours.


Avoid taking triptans more than 17 times per month. Doing so can cause you to experience rebound migraines since your body will become accustomed to existing on the drug.
These medications can cause heart attack and/or stroke by constriction of the blood vessels. If you have heart-related problems or clotting abnormalities you should not use triptans.
Triptans are clinically proven to be the number one most effective treatment for migraines.

, In addition to soothing the pain, they are also known to reduce the nausea and light sensitivity commonly associated with migraines.


These drugs are usually administered as nasal sprays or injections.
An injection might be given for a one-time treatment, but if you frequently experience migraines, your doctor may prescribe a nasal spray version.

"
"
Experiment with other herbal teas.,
Rub essential oils into your temples.,
Take a magnesium supplement.,
Try a foot bath.",How to Get Rid of a Headache Using Mallow2," There are many different herbs that are known to be effective for treating headaches when brewed in teas. Peppermint, chamomile, skullcap, and feverfew are all examples of herbs that can be used in teas to help soothe and relieve headaches. Feverfew is particularly known for keeping headaches at bay, more so than treating them once they’ve already begun. You can try taking feverfew in a capsule each morning if headaches are a regular issue for you.Ginger root tea is also a great option for helping relieve headache pain.
Some health stores may carry pre-made herbal blends that contain various combinations of these herbs, made specifically for soothing headaches. Talk to an associate at your local health food store if you need help picking out a pre-made tea blend.

, A simple drop or two of rosemary or thyme essential oils can help soothe a headache. Put a drop of one of these oils onto your fingertips, and gently rub the oil into your temples. Let the oil sit on your skin for a few minutes after you’ve finished massaging your temples. Try this remedy in a quiet, relaxed space.If you find your skin becomes irritated from the oils, try mixing them with a carrier oil such as jojoba, olive, or coconut oil before applying the blend to your temples.

, Adding a magnesium supplement to your daily routine may help you stave off future headaches. Studies have shown that those suffering from migraines actually have lowered magnesium levels in their brains as they endure a migraine, so keeping your magnesium levels up might help prevent headaches from coming on in the first place.You can also try eating foods that are high in magnesium, like pumpkin seeds, bananas, broccoli, almonds, and cashews., Simple foot baths have been widely used in naturopathic and holistic medicine to treat headaches. Find a bowl or container large enough for both of your feet to fit in and be fully submerged in water. Fill the bowl with hot water. While holding a cold compress or ice pack against the back of your neck, place your feet in the bowl of hot water. This draws your blood down towards your feet, which can help relax the blood vessels in your head that are causing the pain."

Know your symptoms.,
Complain about temple pain.,
Avoid light and noise.,
Start slow.,
Go to bed early.,
Be overly irritable.,
Show less energy.,
Look sick.,
Don't immediately get better.",How to Fake a Headache," You can't credibly fake an illness if you don't know what is wrong with you. If you are complaining about a terrible headache, make sure you know exactly the kind of headache you want to fake so you can explain to others what is wrong with you when they ask. If you are trying to get out of an event, make sure you emphasize how bad your symptoms are. This way, it won't seem as if it is not worth letting you skip whatever you are trying to avoid.;
, One of the main symptoms of a headache is the pain around your temples or forehead. Hold your hands up to your head and massage your temples as you complain about the pain. You can even moan or make uncomfortable noises to drive home that you feel terrible., Light and noise sensitivity is a common symptom of a really bad headache. To fake this symptom, close or squint your eyes, appearing as if the presence of light or interruption of noise it too much for you. Avoid going into places that have too much noise or light because it would cause you too much pain if you really had a headache.


Don't over sell this symptom. You want it to be believable, not cast suspicion on your actions. Make it subtle and not over the top., Most headaches don't start automatically, so start complaining about the symptoms slowly. You must be subtle about the issues that you have or it will seem like you are faking it. Start by first commenting how your head hurts a little bit. A little while later, rub your temples, complaining of the pressure in your head. Then mention that the lights and noises are bothering you. Showing the symptoms is the only way people will believe you., If you are trying to convince other people such as your parents that you are suffering from a headache, you need to go to bed early. Those suffering from headaches are in pain, and sleep typically helps lessen the symptoms. If you aren't actually sleepy, find quiet things to do in your room that will help you pass the time until you are actually tired. Faking a headache is meant to get you out of what you don't want to do, so use this time to do whatever it is you want to do.

, Whenever you have a headache, normal things tend to be annoying. When faking a headache, pretend that things irritate you easier than normal. React differently to those around you and get frustrated at things that normally don't bother you. This will make people think the pain of the headache is getting to you., Being sick drains energy out of you because your body is trying to repair whatever is making you feel badly. Don't walk around with a spring in your step or act too perky. Walk slower with your head down, as if the act is too complicated because of the headache pain. Do you normal routine at a slower pace and complain about being tired., People with headaches aren't bright faced and happy. Try messing up your hair, applying a light powder to your skin to make you look paler, or making dark circles under your eyes with makeup. If you want others to believe you have a bad headache, you need to look like you are drained and uncomfortable.Studies have shown that the way someone moves their mouth is related to the believably of sickness claims. Move your mouth less, grimacing and frowning without too much mouth movement., Headaches don't get better in an instant. If you are done with faking the headache, gradually remind people how you are feeling better. Just make sure it isn't too fast. Comment on how tired you are, which is a common side effect of headaches. This will help everyone believe your story and make it easier to fake a headache in the future."

Migraines are often preceded by prodrome symptoms such as nausea, dizziness, neck stiffness, and irritability. If you administer treatment when you notice these symptoms, you may be able to stop the migraine in its tracks.


Other prodrome symptoms include food cravings, gastrointestinal disturbance, a feeling of depression.
For more information on prodrome symptoms, research how to prevent migraines.;
, Many of the steps you can take to stop or minimize a migraine work best when taken at the first sign of migraine symptoms. For example, some migraines may respond well to medications taken in the first couple hours, but may not respond at all if the medications are taken later than that., Take the maximum safe dosage of ibuprofen, aspirin, acetaminophen, or another over-the-counter painkiller or NSAID (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug) at the first sign of a migraine. At least one study has found that a higher than normal dose of aspirin is nearly as effective as prescription migraine drugs. Common over-the-counter medicines include Motrin, Tylenol, Aleve, and Excedrin Tension Headaches.Some pain relievers have specific combinations that are helpful for severe migraines. Excedrin has many different types of medication that combine multiple relievers that may help.
Basic painkillers don't always work for migraines, especially if they are severe. Try them at first, but seek other options if they don't help. Make sure you never take more than the recommended dosage without first consulting your doctor.
In addition, if you find that you are having to take painkillers more than two days a week, you need to see your doctor for more effective medications or for daily preventive medication., Caffeine is well known to increase the effectiveness of many painkillers. For this reason, some painkillers come with an appropriate dose of caffeine already in them. Common brands include Excedrin Migraine, Goody's powder, and Tylenol Ultra Relief Migraine Pain., In some cases, low levels of the hormones estrogen and progesterone cause migraines in women. They also increase the frequency and severity of migraines. If your migraines occur more often in the two weeks before menses, ask your doctor to check your estrogen and progesterone levels. If your levels are found to be low, she may be willing to prescribe supplementation, birth control pills, or other preventative medication.


You doctor might prescribe your mefenamic acid, which is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory pill that helps with severe menstruation symptoms such as migraines.
There are different kinds of birth control pills that you can take. There are progesterone only pills and combination pills that contain both progesterone and estrogen. Once you get your levels tested, talk with your doctor about the right kind for you.
Although this method may help you, some patients see no change at all. For others, the migraines get worse. Notify your doctor if your symptoms increase., There are many different herbs that are natural remedies for migraines and headaches. You can find recipes online or you can find them in your local grocery store. (Suggestion: Maharaja Chai/Samurai Chai Tea Blend from Teavana. It last for about a year depending how often you use it. They usually have it out so that you can sample it.)

, Turn off the lights and close the door to ensure no one will bother you while you relax. Close your eyes and breath in and out slowly. If you want, try adding some essential oils, bath salts, or bath bombs that are not strongly scented. Candles also add a nice touch. It will also help sooth sore bodies.

, If you suffer severe migraines that don't respond to other treatments, your doctor may prescribe a medication which stops migraines or reduces the severity or duration. Abortive medications can be taken by self-injection as well as by mouth, skin patch, or nasal spray. These medications work differently for each patient. Ask your doctor about these medications to see which is right for you.The most commonly used classes of migraine-abortive drugs are triptans and ergots. Try drugs such as Axert, Relpax, Midrin, or Frova.
Your doctor may also prescribe painkillers. These can include stronger versions of over-the-counter drugs. In extreme cases, a doctor may prescribe opiates or the sedative butalbital combined with caffeine and NSAIDs. These are only used in special cases and should be taken with caution given their addictive nature., If you are suffering from a serious migraine, take time off from work. Some people may not consider migraines a big deal, but most people will understand that it's a serious health condition. Talk to your boss and your colleagues to make sure that they understand your condition.


If you have migraine too often at work, try to reduce triggers. Keep your stress low, try to manipulate the lights to a more comfortable, make sure you bring snacks in case your blood sugar drops, and schedule break times.If it isn't possible for your to take time off of work, try to take a break and go to a quiet conference room or break room. Make sure you keep some form of pain relief with you at work at all times in case you get one and you can't leave.Getting a doctor's note may help if your workplace is not understanding about your situation.

, Bright lights, sometimes even moderate lights, and noise trigger or worsen migraines. During a migraine, most sufferers are also extremely sensitive to light and noise. When you get a migraine, sit in a dark, quiet room until your symptoms ease. The removal of those external factors should help decrease their severity., Migraines are often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. Over the counter anti-nausea or anti-diarrheal drugs may help relieve these symptoms. You may find, however, that allowing yourself to purge may help your migraine go away faster. If this is the case, avoid taking these drugs unless absolutely necessary.


Vomiting, or just hard dry heaving, can often bring a migraine to a climax after which the discomfort subsides.

, Migraine can be triggered by dehydration. Once a migraine starts, try to drink some water to see if it helps ease the symptoms. Dehydration can get worse if you are vomiting or have diarrhea, so make sure you are replacing any fluids lost. Stay away from other drinks that might cause your symptoms to get worse. You can try a sports drink because they help you replace electrolytes., Once a migraine starts, apply an ice pack to the painful area for 15 – 20 minutes. This can help numb the painful areas. If the symptoms come back once you take it off, wait a little while for your skin to warm back up and then repeat. It may also be helpful to ice the back of your neck. Make sure you wrap the ice in a towel so you don't damage your skin with the cold.
Some people find that taking a hot shower or using a heat pack relieves their symptoms. This helps relieve the tension in your muscles, which is a main cause of migraines.

, When you have a migraine, try to take a nap. The rest and reduction of external stimulation often lessens the severity of the migraine or helps it go away all together. Having a migraine may make it difficult to sleep, but attempt to sleep if you can. Another positive aspect of a nap is that you're sleeping, you're not as aware of your pain. Simply lying down may help, although some migraine sufferers find that lying down makes the pain worse.

, Kneading the face, head, shoulders, back, and neck may relieve the symptoms in some people. It helps release tension in your muscles and helps your relax. It isn't effective for everyone, but studies have shown that is can help lessen the severity of the symptoms and even help you get them less often., Acupuncture has been found to help some migraine sufferers. Small studies suggest that it can ease migraine pain and help reduce the occurrence of additional headaches. Despite its helpfulness, most doctors suggest that you continue other treatments in conjunction with such treatments., Some small studies have found that lavender can reduce migraine pain.Take pure lavender oil, which can be bought from a herb, health food, or supplement store, and rub a little on the spots that hurt or massage it into your temples. You can also use an oil burner to permeate the air with the scent.Ginger and peppermint oil may also be helpful., You may experience weakness, mood change, tiredness, or difficulty concentrating.If you find yourself experiencing these symptoms, you may need more time to recover, or you may want to put off work or activities that require a lot of energy or mental power.

, Sleep plays an important role in preventing migraines and lessening their severity, according to a number of studies. Sleep regularly and get the right number of hours of sleep for your body. For most people, that means around eight hours of sleep a night. If you're having trouble falling asleep, try to be sure to wind down hours before bedtime. Put away computer screens, start dimming lights, and don't do anything that's very stimulating, like watching exciting TV.

, Exercise can lessen the pain of a migraine and also lessen the frequency of migraines in general. A recent study has shown that 40 minutes of cardio exercise, three times a week is just as effective as medicine and relaxation techniques in helping prevent the onset of migraines. However, migraines can be triggered by exercise if you're not used to it. Start with light exercise and exercise regularly. Once your body is accustomed to it, you can use a light walk or jog to relieve your pain and even prevent pain in the future., If you regularly consume caffeine, your habit could be causing your problem. Caffeine paradoxically both causes and relieves headaches. The caffeine paradox is caused by the addiction and withdrawal, since caffeine causes migraine by provoking nervous adaptation to caffeine. This renders the patient susceptible to headache if caffeine dosing is delayed, and caffeine then relieves migraine by reversing caffeine withdrawal.


If you use caffeine, caffeine withdrawal cannot be ruled out as a possible cause of your migraines. The logical strategy is to assume caffeine is the likely culprit, and to wean yourself from caffeine., Study which foods may be triggering your migraines. In some cases, migraines have be reduced 30 – 50% by removing all triggers from the diet. You should try to identify a migraine-trigger food before you eat it. Find out triggers, which include chocolate, cheese, alcohol, and citrus fruits, if you know the trigger, avoid that food, drink or element.If you aren't sure if food is triggering you, keep a food diary and note when you have a migraine. See if any patterns arise.

, Fluorescent lights are a possible trigger. Test you sensitivity to the light by avoiding them for several days and then exposing yourself to them again. If you notice that you develop nausea or anxiety within a short time of exposure, or if you develop full migraine symptoms within hours, light is a trigger for you.

, A headache diary can help you identify potential triggers. It can also help you assess the effectiveness of different treatments. Start a diary and write down the foods you eat, when you have a migraine, where you were when it occurred, what you did or took for relief, and how long the migraine lasted. This will help you track your migraines and help yourself find a path to relief."

Determine if the headache is a primary headache.,
Determine if the headache is a secondary headache.,
Evaluate the length of the headache.,
Consider the side effects.,
Consider the location of the headaches.,
Ask the right questions.",How to Evaluate the Potential Severity of Chronic Headaches1," Doctors classify headaches into two basic types, primary and secondary. Chronic primary headaches are those that are recurrent but are not caused by an underlying disease.Either primary or secondary headaches may be chronic, though chronic headaches tend to be classified as primary.Primary headaches may be caused by exposure to very cold temperatures, sexual intercourse, or coughing excessively. The main types of primary headaches are tension headaches, migraines, and cluster headaches.;
, Chronic secondary headaches, unlike primary headaches, are caused by a medical condition. If you have a chronic secondary headache, your situation is more serious. The condition underlying your chronic headaches could be life threatening, so you should see a doctor as soon as possible.Conditions that may lead to secondary headaches include concussions, whiplash (or other injury to the neck, head, or back), stroke, seizures, AIDS, meningitis, high blood pressure, dehydration, or allergies. These conditions require a doctor’s diagnosis and medical treatment., The three main types of chronic headaches – all of which are primary headaches – all last for different lengths of time. One way to evaluate the severity of the chronic headache is to identify how long it lasts.Tension headaches tend to last less than 30 minutes. They occur as a response to stress or difficulty at school, work, or another social situation. They are the most common type of chronic headache.
Cluster headaches are a bit more severe. They typically last 30 to 60 minutes and occur regularly (in “clusters”) over a period of days, weeks, or months, then disappear.
Migraines are the most intense and severe headaches. They usually last between four and 24 hours, but they can occur continuously for up to three days., Each of the three major types of chronic headaches have side effects that differ in severity. The severity of the side effects generally corresponds to the duration of each major type of headache. In other words, shorter headaches tend to have fewer side effects. Use the extremity and the number of side effects most commonly associated with the three major types of chronic headaches to better evaluate their potential severity.The side effects of tension headaches tend to be mild or moderate. The only symptom is pain in and around the head, neck, and shoulders.
Cluster headaches have more severe side effects. You could potentially experience a stuffy or runny nose, forehead or facial sweating, watery or irritated eyes, and/or a droopy or swollen eyelid (ptosis or edema, respectively) in addition to a stabbing pain in the eye or temple.Migraine headaches tend to have the worst side effects. In addition to throbbing or pulsating pain, you could experience nausea or vomiting, sensitivity to light or sound (photophobia or phonophobia, respectively), or visual disturbances.

, Chronic headaches might affect the neck, left and right sides of the head, scalp, upper back, and/or shoulder muscles. The more areas of your neck, head, and/or body that are tense or in pain, the more severe the headache is., If you are trying to gauge the potential severity of someone else’s headache, engage them in conversation. Listening to what the person suffering from the headache has to say will help you better evaluate the severity of their headache. Ask questions like:What sort of side effects are you experiencing?
How would you rate your pain on a scale of one through ten?
When did your headache begin?
Where is the pain?
Do you have any other medical issues?
Are you taking medication?
Have you recently undergone surgery?

Rank your headache.,
Consider other subjective descriptions.,
Factor the effectiveness of home care.,
Identify the suddenness of the headache.,
Evaluate the headache’s impact upon regular daily activities.",How to Evaluate the Potential Severity of Chronic Headaches2," To determine how severe someone’s headache is, you could ask them to rate their headache on a 1-10 scale. On this scale, 10 would be the most painful headache ever experienced, while 1 is the least severe headache possible.If you want to attach a verbal description to your ranking system, you might describe a headache ranked 1-3 as dull, 4-5 as mild, 6-7 as moderate, and 8-10 as intense or severe.

, People with chronic headaches might describe the feeling as having their head in a vise. If your headache is more severe, you might employ a more colorful description. For instance, you might say, “I feel as though an elephant is crushing my skull.” Think about the description you use and comparisons you make to evaluate the potential severity of your chronic headache., When people have mild or moderate chronic headaches, they are typically able to cope with them using only conventional, over-the-counter painkillers. But if you have a very severe chronic headache, commercially available medication or other treatments – including cold packs, hot packs, or a gentle massage of the temples – will not relieve your pain., Headaches that arrive suddenly – known as thunderclap or severe onset headaches – are considered the most severe type of chronic headache. These headaches also have serious consequences, or they may be a secondary symptom of an underlying condition that only your doctor can detect.Some serious, life-threatening underlying causes of a secondary headache may include subarachnoid hemorrhage or intracranial hemorrhage (bleeding in the brain), vertebral artery dissection (a tear in the artery that supplies the brain with blood), cerebral venous thrombosis (a condition that causes blood to collect in the brain) or reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (the narrowing of blood vessels in the brain).
There is no discrete time period in which a headache starts that defines it as “sudden.”

, If your chronic headache is so intense that it prevents you from working, studying, or enjoying social situations, it is more severe than a chronic headache that does not. You can use the impact of chronic headaches on your daily life to better gauge their severity.Count the occasions that a chronic headache kept you from enjoying yourself fully, sent you home from work, or prevented you from attending an event or social situation. The more occasions in which this occurs, the more severe your headache.

Talk to a doctor.,
Identify and avoid your triggers.,
Take over-the-counter (OTC) medications.,
Use prescription medication.,
Practice self-care techniques.,
Visit a massage therapist.,
Get support.,
Take it easy.",How to Evaluate the Potential Severity of Chronic Headaches3," Your doctor will be able to help you develop a treatment plan to combat and manage your chronic headaches. They might recommend self-care techniques, prescribe medication, or refer you to a specialist who can better help you cope with your condition.If you’re suffering from a secondary headache, a doctor may be able to treat your underlying condition and – hopefully – eliminate the headaches., If you have a chronic primary headache, you might be able to identify a trigger that causes the headache.For instance, if you experience a headache every time you eat figs, you should avoid eating figs. Take careful note of the conditions under which your chronic headaches begin and end in order to identify factors that might contribute to your headaches and avoid them when possible.Other foods that might cause headaches include canned soup, nuts, peanut butter, raisins, soy sauce, sauerkraut, lentils, papaya, passion fruit, avocados, aspartame (i.e. Equal or NutraSweet), processed meat, and alcohol.
Other potential triggers include allergens (dust, ragweed pollen, or other environmental contaminants) that could cause intense sneezing fits and headaches. If these are your triggers, dust and vacuum more often, keep your windows sealed tight or open (depending on your trigger), and invest in a small air purifier or air filtration system.
Cold or hot weather, or rapid changes in temperature, might also produce headaches., Some OTC medication can help you fight your chronic headaches. For instance, you might be able to take aspirin, acetaminophen (commercially available as Tylenol), ibuprofen (commercially available as Motrin), naproxen (commercially available as Aleve), or ketoprofen (commercially available as Orudis KT). You might also benefit from an OTC dug that combines more than one of these ingredients (such as Excedrin Migraine).Always be sure to follow the dosing instructions on the medication package. If the dose specified on the package is not relieving your pain, do not take a higher dose. Contact your doctor.

, If your chronic headache pain and side effects are severe, you’ll likely need prescription medication. Consult your doctor to obtain prescription medication and make sure to take them exactly as directed. Let your doctor know about any side effects you have from the medication as well. They might provide you with drugs like ergotamine (commercially available as Ergostat) or dihydroergotamine (commercially available as Migranal or D.H.E. 45). Your doctor might also recommend:Sumatriptan (commercially available as Imitrex)
Zolmitriptan (commercially available as Zomig)
Naratriptan (commercially available as Amerge)
Rizatriptan (commercially available as Maxalt)
Almotriptan (commercially available as Axert)
Frovatriptan (commercially available as Frova)

, There are several simple remedies that might help you relieve your headache pain. For instance, you might lie down in a quiet, dark room and close your eyes. Put a cool cloth over your forehead. If you are not at home, you could place your index and middle fingers on your temples and massage them using gentle pressure. Move the tips of the fingers of your right hand in a slow clockwise motion against your right temple and move the tips of the fingers of your left hand in a slow counterclockwise motion against your left temple., Deep-tissue massage can be beneficial for relieving chronic headache pain. Many hospitals offer massage therapy as part of their services, but if your local clinic does not offer such a service, you can just as easily go to a regular massage parlor to reap similar benefits., Living with chronic headaches, no matter their severity, is unpleasant. You might begin to feel worn down, depressed, and defeated. Talk to your family and friends about your condition in order to help them understand what you’re going through. Unburdening yourself in this way might improve your mood and energy levels.Check out chronic migraine or headache support groups in your area. It often helps to talk to others who are experiencing the same thing you are.Get counselling if your headaches are severe and lead to deep anxiety, anger, or depression. A trained therapist can help you find positive ways to cope with these feelings.

, Stress is one of the most common headache triggers.If you have chronic headaches, rest can help you relieve your pain. Spend extra time in bed reading a book, watching TV, listening to podcasts, or engaging in activities you enjoy (if possible). If your chronic headaches are truly disabling, cut back on your hours at work and ask family members to take on additional household chores for you."

Go for a walk.,
Apply an ice pack.,

Give yourself a head massage.,
Take a nap.,
Eat something.",How to Cure a Headache Without Medication1," Going for a walk and getting some fresh air can do wonders for a headache, particularly if it's caused by stress or staring at a screen for too long. Go somewhere quiet, breathe deeply and let your mind wander. Your headache will be forgotten about in no time.


Get as close to nature as possible. A quiet country road or a secluded, sandy beach is ideal - but if you're stuck in the city, a nearby park will do.
Pick up the pace and settle into a brisk jog, if you like. Studies have shown that aerobic exercise can help lessen the intensity of pain, and regular exercise can help reduce the frequency of headaches.;
, Try using an ice pack to ease the throbbing in your head, by placing it on your forehead, temples, or the back of your neck. The cooling effect of the ice pack will help to relax muscles and relieve pain., Headaches that are brought on by stress or tension can often be easily alleviated by just allowing yourself to relax. A hot bath scented with soothing essential oils can work wonders, but even a quick shower can help to wash away the stresses of the day.

, Use your thumb and index fingers to gently apply pressure to the part of your head that's aching - whether it's your temples, forehead, crown of the head or base of the skull. Use a steady rotating motion, combined with light pressure. Do this for 10 to 15 seconds, or longer if necessary.If they're feeling generous, you can ask a partner, friend or family member to massage your head, neck or back, or treat yourself by having a professional massage.

, Force yourself to take a nap and your headache might just miraculously disappear by the time you wake up. Find a quiet room, close the curtains and lie down on a soft surface. Close your eyes and focus on letting go of the tension in you shoulders, neck and back. Clear your mind, focus on your breathing and try to drift off into a peaceful sleep.

, Headaches are often caused by hunger. Try eating a small, healthy meal, then wait for up to half an hour for the pain to subside.


Try to eat meals at the same time everyday to avoid headaches - don't significantly delay or skip meals.
Remember to eat slowly - you don't want to end up with a tummy ache as well as a headache!

Work on being healthy.",How to Deal with a Silent Migraine," One way that people deal with migraines, even silent migraines, is to get extra rest. Some people sleep through the migraine, while others just rest in a dark room, as light can make aura worse for some people., Talk to your doctor about the possibility of taking triptans. These prescription medications can help prevent or alleviate migraine symptoms. Triptans work by helping your brain produce more serotonin, which in turn decreases inflammation in your brain.You take this medication after a silent migraine has already started. The earlier you take it during a migraine attack, the more effective it will be.
Take your medication as directed by your doctor.

, Because hormone changes can lead to migraines, taking birth control pills may reduce the number of migraines you have. For some people, taking birth control may make the problem worse, so it really depends on your body and how it responds to the medication. Nonetheless, it's something you should discuss with your doctor, particularly if you often get migraines right before or during your period., If your silent migraines are accompanied by nausea or upset stomach, your doctor can prescribe a medication to help with the nausea. While these medications don't treat the migraine, they can help you deal with the symptoms., Silent migraines by definition skip the headache portion of the migraine; however, if you have other pain associated with the migraine, you can take over-the-counter medications such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen.Always follow the package instruction when taking these medications.

, Studies have shown that high homocysteine levels may lead to an increased chance of aura migraines. To combat this issue, one study suggests taking B vitamins may be helpful. Ask your doctor if this treatment is a good idea for you.In the study, the participants took 400 micrograms of B12, 25 milligrams of B6, and 2 milligrams of folic acid.

, A silent migraine is when you have a migraine, but you skip the pain part of the process. In other words, you have other symptoms such as aura, but you don't actually get a headache. You may also go through the preliminary phases that many migraine sufferers go through, which are symptoms that warn of an oncoming migraine.These types of migraines are referred to by many names, including a migraine aura without headache, an acephalgic migraine, an amigranous migraine, or a migraine equivalent.
These types of migraines are treated similarly to other types of migraines.

, Generally, you're more at risk for silent migraines if you had migraines with auras in your teens or 20s. Because silent migraines are still migraines, they tend to show up in people who've had migraines with auras in the past., The main symptoms of a silent migraine are auras, which can include vision changes such as halos or spots in your vision, blurry vision, cloudy vision, or shimmering vision. You might also see dark areas, flashes, or odd 3D effects.You may also find you have problems with speech.
Other aura symptoms include feeling tingling or numbness, feeling like you're on pins and needles, feeling weak or clumsy, and/or feeling dizzy or off-balance.
You may also have mood swings, a loss of memory, hearing loss, stomach troubles, and/or confusion.
Some people even get hiccups or have a distorted image of their bodies. Others may have less sensitivity to touch or hypersensitivity.

, Silent migraines are sometimes referred to as ""ocular migraines"" or ""retinal migraines."" However, these conditions are not interchangeable. Ocular migraines refer to silent migraines that affect the vision. Retinal migraines, however, are different. They usually only affect one eye at a time, causing blurriness or even temporary blindness.If you experience migraine-like symptoms in one eye only, you should see an eye specialist.

, About 40% of people have warning signs before a migraine hits. These warning signs can happen as quickly as hours before an attack, while other times it may be days, and they are collectively called the ""prodrome"" period. Learning to look for these symptoms may help you predict when a migraine is coming on.Common symptoms of this period include tiredness, yawning, constipation, craving foods, frequent urination, and mood swings. You may also have muscle stiffness or neck pain.

, Some people find that certain things will trigger their migraines. For instance, stress or hormones (such as starting your period) can trigger migraines. Certain foods will trigger migraines in other people or just being too tired. Figuring out what your triggers are and reducing their occurrence can help with silent migraines.While you can't reduce the frequency of some triggers, such as your period, knowing when migraines may happen can help you prepare.

, One way to tell if you experience prodrome is to keep track both of common symptoms and migraines. Each night, make a note if you experienced any common prodrome symptoms. Also, make a note of when your silent migraines happen. You may notice a pattern that can help you predict your silent migraines.It can also help to make note of possible triggers, such as being extra tired or starting your period.

, Some people find that maintaining a healthy lifestyle helps reduce the frequency of their migraines. That means eating a balanced diet of lean proteins, whole grains, fruits, and veggies. It also means getting enough sleep (generally 7-9 hours), exercising regularly (try for 150 minutes a week), and drinking enough water (your urine should be pale or clear). Also, try to limit your alcohol."

Drink a tepid beverage.,
Take smaller bites or sips of the cold item.,
Remove the cold food from your mouth.",How to Cure Brainfreeze2," Avoid drinking a boiling hot beverage to get rid of the brain freeze, as this will shock your mouth and could lead to a serious burn in your mouth. Go for a room temperature or slightly warmer than room temperature beverage, like warm tea or water, to heat up your mouth without burning., Rather than consume that ice cream or ice cold drink very fast, take your time and eat it in small bites or sips. This will lower the chances of developing brain freeze, as it gives your mouth time to get used to the temperature of the item.You should also move the food around in your mouth before swallowing it to give your mouth time to adapt to the temperature of the food.

, To really give your brain time to unfreeze, spit out the ice cold food into a napkin or remove it from your mouth. This will prevent more intense brain freeze and give your mouth time to recover from contact with the cold food.You can then wait it out and let your mouth and brain recover from the brain freeze on their own.

Turn off your computer.,
Take magnesium.,
Avoid headache-inducing substances.,
Wear sunglasses.,
Let your hair down.",How to Cure a Headache Without Medication2," Spending long periods of time staring at a computer screen is a common culprit for causing headaches. Staring at a bright screen all day puts strain on your eyes and can too easily lead to headaches. Flashing images can over-activate your retina and the nerves in your eyes, another cause of head pain.


Try to limit your computer use whenever possible. If you need to use a computer for work, take frequent breaks; get up, walk around, go outside for some air.
Take a ten minute for every hour you're online to stave off headaches.
Take a few days every week to keep off electronics and relax. No work/business negotiations should be scheduled. Take these days to relax and reduce stress, as stress is a frequent culprit for headaches.

, When taken daily, magnesium may help reduce the frequency of headaches and migraines. This is because magnesium can help to ease nerves, which can become overstimulated during headaches and migraines. You’ll likely need more than the average multi-vitamin contains or about 400 to 600 milligrams a day.Look for amino acid-chelated magnesium (many brands contain magnesium oxide, which is not absorbed as well).
You can also increase your magnesium by eating dark green vegetables, nuts and seeds.

, Some substances are more likely to cause headaches than others. You can prevent headaches by limiting your intake of these substances:



Nitrates and nitrites. Nitrates and nitrites are found in processed meats and in monosodium glutamate (MSG), which is used to enhance the flavor of some foods. Nitrates can also be found in some heart medicines.Phenylethylamine, which is found in some chocolate and cheeses.Tyramine, which is sometimes found in nuts and fermented meats, cheeses, and soy.Aspartame, an artificial sweetener found in many foods.Caffeine and alcohol can also trigger headaches in some people., Prolonged exposure to sunshine can mess with your brain’s thalamus, which sends pain signals to your body. To protect your eyes from the glare and decrease the risk of headaches, wear polarized sunglasses with UVA/UVB protection.

, Many women get tension headaches from an unforgiving hairdo that pulls at their scalp. Loosen your bun or ponytail, or wear your hair down to minimize the risk of headaches.

Drink lots of water.,
Use lavender oil.,
Use rosemary.,
Use cloves.,
Use basil oil.,
Use ginger.,
Use cinnamon.,
Use peppermint.,
Eat apples.",How to Cure a Headache Without Medication3," Dehydration can often cause headaches. This is because the lack of water leads to reduced blood and oxygen flow to the brain. As soon as you feel a headache coming on, try drinking a cool glass of water. If the headache is caused by dehydration, drinking water can ease or cure it within minutes.


You should consume roughly about eight glasses of liquid a day to prevent dehydration. However, 20% of this you can already get from from watery foods (e.g. grapes, turkey, watermelon, etc). Drinking water is especially important after the consumption of alcohol, as alcohol causes dehydration, leading to hangover headaches.

, The relaxing properties of lavender products are well known - but did you know that lavender oil can also be very effective in the treatment of headaches? Simply take a bowl of hot water and add a few drops of lavender oil. Lower you head towards the surface of the water and place a towel over your head. Breath deeply, inhaling the lavender-infused vapors.


It is also possible to apply lavender oil externally. Try massaging a few drops of the undiluted oil into your temples for a minute or two, while inhaling deeply.
Bear in mind that you should not ingest lavender oil.

, Rosemary can be very helpful in the treatment of headaches. Try massaging your head with a little rosemary oil (which has anti-inflammatory properties) to instantly alleviate pain. Alternatively, you can drink an herbal tea made from a combination of rosemary and sage to ease headaches.


To make rosemary and sage tea, add one teaspoon of crushed rosemary leaves and one teaspoon of crushed sage leaves to a cup of boiling water. Cover and leave to infuse until the water reaches room temperature.
Drink this tea two or three times a day.

, Cloves can be used in multiple ways to ease the pain of tension headaches. Here are some suggestions:


Gently crush a number of cloves and put the pieces into a sachet bag or clean handkerchief. Inhale the scent of the crushed cloves to gain relief from headaches.
Mix clove oil with sea salt and massage into your forehead and temples. The clove oil provides a cooling effect, while the sea salt intensifies the massage.

, Basil is a strong-scented herb which can be used effectively in headache treatment. Basil works as a muscle relaxant, thus it can be helpful for treating headaches caused by tension and tight muscles. Drinking basil tea twice a day is an excellent home remedy.


Put some fresh, washed basil leaves in a cup of boiling water and allow it to sit for a few minutes before drinking. Sip the tea slowly and your headache should gently ease away.
During mild headaches, you can also chew some fresh basil leaves or massage your head with pure basil oil.

, Ginger helps to reduce the inflammation of blood vessels, and as a result it is often used in the treatment of headaches. Try adding an inch of freshly chopped or grated ginger root to a cup of loose leaf tea and let it infuse for several minutes before drinking. You can add milk or sugar to taste. Amazingly, ginger tea is said to relieve headaches by reducing inflammation just as quickly as an aspirin would.Alternatively, you can boil fresh or powdered ginger in water and inhale the vapor to get rid of a headache.
Chewing a piece of crystallized ginger candy may also help to relive headaches.

, Cinnamon can help to ease headaches, particularly those that strike in combination with the common cold. An easy way to use cinnamon for the relief of headaches is to make a paste from freshly grated cinnamon and a little water. Apply this paste to your forehead and let it sit for ten to fifteen minutes. The headaches should soon ease.


Alternatively, you can make a soothing drink by adding two teaspoons of powdered cinnamon to cup of hot milk. Stir in a teaspoon of honey for sweetness, if desired.

, The calming and soothing properties of peppermint are well known, and it can be very effective in the treatment of headaches. Use peppermint oil to massage your forehead, temples, and even your jaws. Alternatively, apply freshly crushed peppermint leaves to the forehead and leave to sit for ten to fifteen minutes, while breathing deeply.


Fresh peppermint leaves can also be used to make a soothing tea. Simply add freshly washed peppermint leaves to a cup of boiling water and leave to infuse for several minutes.
You can also use a peppermint steam treatment, by adding a couple of drops of peppermint oil to boiling water and inhaling the vapors.

, Apples can help to alleviate headaches. Apples have attributes that can balance the alkaline and acidic levels in the body, thus providing relief from headaches. Try eating an apple (with the skin on) as soon as you feel the beginnings of a headache.


Alternatively, you can add two teaspoons of apple cider vinegar - which has similar properties - to a glass full of water. Drink this solution for immediate headache relief.

Try transcranial magnetic stimulation.",How to Cure a Headache Without Medication4," In acupuncture treatments, thin needles are placed under the skin at certain pressure points around the body. This is said to realign the flow of energy in the body. You may be skeptical, but studies have shown that acupuncture treatments can be effective in the prevention of acute migraines. What's more, acupuncture treatments are accompanied by very few of the negative side effects caused by drug treatments. There is also evidence that acupuncture can provide relief for those suffering from chronic tension-type headaches., Botox injections - famous for treating and preventing wrinkles - actually have a wealth of medical uses, one of which is the treatment of chronic migraines in adults. This FDA-approved option has been proven to reduce both the severity and frequency of migraines - however, at a cost of approximately $350 per injection, this miracle cure can be pretty cost-prohibitive., This non-invasive treatment uses magnetic pulses transmitted through an electromagnetic coil to relieve headache pain. Although many patients found relief from migraine using this method, the exact science behind transcranial magnetic stimulation is still being studied, making it an experimental treatment."

Go to a doctor if you are experiencing pain in your wrists.",How to Prevent Carpal Tunnel Syndrome," Carpal tunnel syndrome is most commonly caused by repetitive flexing of the wrist. You can think of this as the position your wrist takes when you say ""stop"" with your hand. Whether you're typing, eating, or doing some other repetitive movement, you should try to maintain a neutral wrist position as often as you can instead of flexing your wrist. Think of the neutral position as the handshake position -- when you shake someone's hand, you don't have to bend your wrists at all. Carefully monitor your hands to try to maintain this position as much as possible., If you're doing a repetitive activity, whether you're typing or chopping vegetables, take a short break every 10-15 minutes to give your wrists a break. This could mean stretching, performing exercises, or just sitting there without using your wrists. No matter how busy you are, you can always take a 1-2 minute break when needed. Don't let too much time go by without resting your wrists.If you can, try to switch tasks every 20-40 minutes.
Additionally, try to change your position as often as you can. You don't want to get ""stuck"" in one position for too much time.

, Most people use more force than necessary when performing daily tasks. Whether you're holding on to a mouse, using a pen, or working a cash register, you should try not to squeeze anything too much or to use too much force. Don't punch the keys on your keyboard or push any other buttons with more force than needed to get the job done. This will keep you from putting too much pressure on your wrists., Though the best thing you can do to prevent carpal tunnel syndrome is to take care of your wrists, studies show that maintaining your overall health can help you have healthy wrists. Make sure to eat at least three healthy meals a day, get regular exercise (around 30 minutes a day), to get 7-8 hours of sleep a night, and to do whatever else you have to do to feel both mentally and physically sound.

, Wrist splints, when worn correctly, can help you maintain a neutral wrist position without causing any discomfort. You can get a relatively inexpensive wrist splint at the local pharmacy (they typically cost around $15-20), or if you want more help, your doctor or physical therapist can recommend or even order more advanced splints. You can wear these while you work to keep you from bending your wrists, and you can also wear them at night to maintain a neutral position while you sleep; a lot of people sleep with bent wrists.

, NSAIDs are nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as Advil, and they can be used to reduce pain and swelling in your wrists. Though they won't prevent carpal tunnel, they can certainly ease the pain if they are taken from time to time. Don't make a habit of this, though, because these drugs should not be a substitute for other preventative measures., If you're working in a cold environment, you are more likely to develop pain and stiffness in your hands. Try to maintain a warm temperature where you work, to wear gloves when it's cold outdoors, and to even consider wearing fingerless gloves if you cannot control the temperature indoors., Adjust your chair so that your forearms are level with your keyboard. You shouldn't have to hunch down or reach up to use your keyboard. This position is optimal for keeping your wrists in a neutral position.

, Sit up nice and tall instead of slouching. This will keep your body from feeling too much strain in any one area, including your wrists. Also, keep your work right out in front of you so you don't have to bend or twist to one side or another to reach it., This will also keep you from straining your wrists too much. If your forearms are level with your keyboard, then this should not be difficult.

, Using a mouse that is too large or too small can make you strain your wrists and use more force than necessary.

, A vertical mouse will keep your hand in the handshake position. If you use one of these, you'll never have to flex your wrist when clicking. It does take a little while to get used to the mouse, but once you do, you'll be glad you got one. Though they can be a little pricey ($70 or more, in some cases), they will be well worth it.

, The split keyboard is a keyboard that splits down the middle, allowing you to type with both hands in the handshake position. You can adjust the keyboard to split a little bit at first, moving it to split more drastically as you get used to it. You can plug it into your keyboard and rest it right over your original board. This will have a dramatic effect for preventing carpal tunnel syndrome. These keyboards range from $30 to hundreds of dollars, and it's up to you to decide what kind works best for you. Don't splurge on an expensive split keyboard if you've never used one, though, or you may find that it's not for you., Some doctors recommend that you ice your wrists several times a day, when you're feeling pain in that area., For this form of therapy, you'll need to set up two large bowls of water -- one should be ice cold, and one should be hot (just not so hot that it burns you). Set them up in your sink and place your hands and wrists into the cold bowl for one minute, and then move them into the hot bowl for one minute. Repeat this exercise for ten minutes twice daily to relieve the pain in your wrists.

, Use a mini foam roller that is about as wide as a quarter to roll your wrists up and down on it for twenty seconds on each wrist. Just place the roller on your table and gently roll your wrist up and down the roller, giving your wrists a nice, relaxing massage., Either use your other hand or get a trusted massage expert to gently massage your forearms, wrists, and palms to relieve the tension in your hands. Make sure that the massage is gentle and does not cause more pain in the areas that need to be worked out., Lie down on the roller, so that your back is lined up with the roller, and move your arms out to your sides (think of the ""shavasana"" pose in yoga). This will open up your back, reducing the strain you've been placing on your back and your arms. Hold this pose for up to a minute. You can also alternate your arms, moving one up above your head, and the other down by your sides, repeating this for a minute. This will shake out and reduce some of the tension in your arms, wrists, and back.

, There are many wrist exercises that you can try to both strengthen your hands and wrists and to relieve the tension in your hands and arms. If you make an effort to do these when you take breaks, or just a few times a day, you'll feel your wrists getting stronger. These exercises will both stretch your wrists and build strength where you need it. Here are some exercises you can try:


""Pushing the wall."" Place your hands straight out in front of you, flexing your wrists, so that you're facing the backs of your hands, as if you were going to push the wall away from you. Hold this position for five seconds, relax your wrists, and repeat at least ten times.Make fists. Simply place your hands into loose fists for at least five seconds, and then let go of the fist for 1-2 seconds. Repeat at least ten times.Make fists and bend your wrists down. Place your arms straight out in front of you, in fists. Now, bend your wrists down slightly and hold this position for five seconds, feeling a deep stretch. Repeat ten times.Stretch your wrists. Place one wrist out in front of you, in the ""stop"" position, and gently bend back your fingers, holding for five seconds. Then, move your fingers down, toward the floor, and bend your wrist downward, in the opposite direction, for another five seconds. Repeat ten times on each hand.
Shake out your wrists. Gently shake out your wrists, as if you washed your hands and were drying water off of them. Do this for about ten seconds at a time. This is a perfect activity to try during breaks, to get some of the stiffness out of your wrists. You can also try gently rolling them as well.

, If you start to feel pain, numbness, tingling, or discomfort in your wrists, then you should see a doctor to discuss next steps. One sign that you may be on your way to carpal tunnel is extreme pain when putting your thumbs into fists, and almost no pain in the pinkie finger, which is controlled by a different nerve than the rest of the fingers. A doctor can recommend further tests and treatment, and may even refer you to a physical therapist.


Physical therapy can help you learn exercises to prevent further pain, order the proper ergonomic equipment, and change your lifestyle. You may also get a soothing forearm massage, or even ultrasound treatment to help the circulation in your wrists.

Consume caffeine to constrict the blood vessels in your head.,
Take simple painkillers.,
Drink plenty of fluid to increase your blood volume.,
Turn off or dim the lights.,
Use visual imagery and distraction to reduce your focus on pain.,
Lie down to increase pressure in your spine.,
Position yourself on your abdomen instead of your back.,
Wear an abdominal binder to increase abdominal pressure.,
Try anti-emetics if you suffer from nausea or vomiting.",How to Cope with a Spinal Headache1," Caffeine is a central nervous system stimulant and causes constriction of the blood vessels within your head.


Since headache is often caused by the dilatation of blood vessels, caffeine helps constrict them and counteract this effect.
Caffeine can be taken both orally and intravenously.
A recommended dose of caffeine is 500mg once or twice daily.
A simple way to get caffeine is to drink coffee; one cup of coffee contains 50-100mg of caffeine. So, you should drink 5-8 cups of coffee daily to get an optimum result.;
, Using simple painkillers, like acetaminophen and other NSAIDs is a simple, but effective way to knock back headaches.


Acetaminophen and other NSAIDs provide temporary relief from headache by blocking the production of chemicals that are responsible for producing the pain sensation in the brain.
Take 500mg of acetaminophen or acetaminophen+caffeine three times per day, after eating a meal.
Use other non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen (400mg 2-3 times daily after meal).
Consult your doctor before any longterm usage of pain medications.
Nowadays, you can buy NSAIDs that also contain caffeine for a more pronounced headache relief effect. Caffeine constricts blood vessels within your head, so you get the cumulative effect of both the painkiller and the caffeine.
Do not forget to take an anti-peptic drug with these pain relievers to protect your stomach lining. Take omeprazole, pantoprazole, or esomeprazole at a dosage of 20 mg twice daily, 30 minutes before your meal.

, Drinking lots of fluids, especially water, will increase your blood volume and the fluid content of other parts of your body.


A portion of consumed water will go into the spinal space and increase its volume and pressure.
Increased pressure will reduce spinal headache.
Drink at least 3 liters (0.8 US gal) of fluid daily to keep yourself hydrated.

, Most people suffering from headaches are sensitive to light, so it can help to turn them off or dim them.


Overly lighted rooms or bright lights aggravate headache because the brain is unable to mediate the glare and light during an episode of headache.

, Visual imagery is done by focusing on a picture or image of pleasant scenery or events.


Another way to practice visual imagery is by repeating positive words or phrases.
Distraction techniques are done by focusing your attention on positive mental thoughts and activities.
These activities include watching television, listening to music, or talking to family.
Distraction and visual imagery help a person divert attention from the pain to other positive activities.

, Bed rest usually has no intrinsic role in reducing spinal headache, but lying vertically does.


When you are lying in bed, it can increase the pressure in your spine and reduce headache.

, Try to lie on your abdomen instead of facing up to increase your abdominal pressure.


This pressure increase will in turn transmit a signal to your spinal canal and raise spinal pressure.
Many people find pain relief in this position.

, Wearing a tight abdominal binder will raise your abdominal pressure, transmitting signals to your spinal cord that reduce headache.


You can find abdominal binders in many specialty medical stores.

, If you suffer from severe spinal headache, nausea or vomiting may accompany it due to irritation of the brain areas that control appetite and vomiting.


Take anti-emetics like promethazine, prochlorperazine or metoclopramide to control these feelings.
These drugs act by blocking the sites in the brain where certain chemicals (such as dopamine, histamine etc) responsible for vomiting act.
Take tab promethazine at a dosage of 25 mg, 2-3 times daily.
Take these drugs before you have a meal for optimum results.
Discontinue the medication as soon as you feel better.

Get an epidural blood patch for severe chronic headache.,
Try an epidural saline solution.,
Get surgery as a last resort.,
Make sure an appropriate needle is used during your spinal tap or anesthesia procedure.,
Make sure the needle is oriented properly.",How to Cope with a Spinal Headache2," If your headache does not resolve within 24 hours, despite taking steps mentioned above, get an epidural blood patch.


During an epidural blood patch procedure, a small amount of your own blood will be injected in the space just outside the perforation in your spine.
The blood will clot, sealing the perforation and restoring pressure in the spinal membrane.
This restores spinal pressure and stops further leakage, relieving headache symptoms.
The success rate of this technique is more than 70%.
Usually, 15-30 ml of your blood will be taken from your arm, and then you will lie on your side for 2 hours.
This procedure can be repeated up to 2 times if the primary attempt fails to control headache.
An epidural blood patch should not be done if you have a fever or skin infection.

, A saline solution such can be injected into the epidural space instead of blood.


It produces a similar effect as blood, but is sterile and comes with a much lower risk of infection.
However, saline solution is thin and rapidly absorbed by the epidural space, meaning that the pressure is not as effectively maintained as with a blood epidural.
1–1.5 liters (0.4 US gal) of Hartmann saline solution can be administered over a 24 hour period, starting the same day of the spinal tap or anesthesia.

, Surgery is the last treatment option for spinal headache.


When all other measures fail to stop a spinal leak, surgery can be attempted to repair the perforation.
It immediately stops the CSF leak, but carries the risk of infection and is somewhat invasive.
Therefore, your doctor will counsel you thoroughly (regarding the procedure, and its pros and cons) before undergoing surgery.

, By using a small needle, the risk of spinal fluid leak is dramatically reduced, because the likelihood of a leak is related to the size of the needle perforation.


Using an appropriately needle size and shape can minimize the likelihood of spinal headache.
A large needle bore will produce a large perforation, so it is always best to use small bore needles, usually between 24-27 gauge.
Use a pencil point needle instead of a cutting type to minimize the chance of leakage.
If possible, use a new type of needle, known as an Atraucan needle that has a narrow cutting tip and a bevel that greatly reduces the chance of spinal headache.

, Orientation of the needle is also important. If the beveled edge of the needle is kept horizontal when it is introduced, there a greater chance of tissue damage.


The beveled edge should always be kept vertical and parallel to the fibers.

Rest your wrist.,
Ice your wrist.,
Wear a splint at night.,
Take anti-inflammatory medication.,
Massage your wrist.",How to Relieve Pain from Carpal Tunnel Syndrome1," Whenever possible, allow yourself to rest while you are performing activities that flex or bend your wrist. In general, you should aim to take at least a five minute break each hour. Also, try not to participate in activities that put additional stress on your wrist. For example, if you work on a computer all day, avoid using it at night. Giving your wrist a break from these activities can help ease mild CTS pain.You can also try using an ergonomic keyboard and/or a wrist rest to relieve some of the pressure on your wrist.;
, For CTS that occurs from repetitive daily motions, applying ice to your wrist can help relieve the pain. The cold from the ice will help reduce any swelling in your wrist.


Apply ice twice daily for 15 to 20 minutes at a time.
Increase your comfort by wrapping your ice pack in a towel., You can help relieve minor CTS pain by wearing a splint that holds your wrist still while you sleep. This can help relieve symptoms of tingling and numbness throughout the night., Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that contain ibuprofen, such as Advil or Motrin, help reduce inflammation around the nerve and provide short-term relief for CTS., Massaging your wrist for five to ten minutes, twice a day, can also help ease CTS pain. To do so, apply lotion to your fingers and gently massage from your hand down to your forearm, moving the tips of your fingers across your palm and down your wrist.You may want to consider using an ointment containing arnica when possible. Arnica is an herbal treatment used to ease aches, pain, and inflammation. Dab about one-quarter teaspoon on your wrist before massaging.However, never apply arnica to an open wound or use during pregnancy or while breastfeeding. Never take arnica orally either. Limit the amount of time you use arnica for as well and always talk with your doctor before using arnica."

Stretch your wrist.,
Stretch your fingers.,
Stretch your fingers at different angles.,
Alternate exercises.",How to Relieve Pain from Carpal Tunnel Syndrome2," Stretching your wrist will help make room for the median nerve, thus relieving some pain. The following exercise will help push the carpal tunnel out.


Touch the tip of your thumb and pinky finger together.
Next, bend your three middle fingers over this bridge, toward your palm.
Using your other hand, try to straighten the three middle fingers, resisting as much as possible.
Do five reps of this stretch three times a day, holding each stretch for a count of five., Not all exercises are focused on your wrist. The following exercise will also help stretch the area around the median nerve:


First, make a fist with your hand.
Next, slowly uncurl your fingers until they all point toward the ceiling.
Do five to ten repetitions three times a day., Here is another exercise that will help stretch the carpal tunnel.


First, make a fist with your hand.
Next, release this fist and fan out your fingers, stretching them as far apart as possible.
Do five to ten repetitions three times a day., These exercises work best when you stretch the wrist in a variety of ways. While you don't need to perform all of these exercises on a daily basis, it is a good idea to alternate between several different exercises throughout the week.

Cook with St. John’s wort.,
Incorporate curcumin in your diet.,
Take flaxseed oil or fish oil.,
Eat lots of vegetables, whole grains, and legumes.,
Take dietary supplements.",How to Relieve Pain from Carpal Tunnel Syndrome3," St. John’s wort is an herb typically used as an antidepressant. It may help to ease nerve pain, however further research is required.Be sure to talk with your doctor before using this herb because it interacts with many different medications. Also, do not take St. John’s Wort if you are pregnant or breastfeeding and stop taking it at least five days before any type of surgery., Curcumin is an anti-inflammatory element found in the spice turmeric, which has been used in medicine throughout history.Keep in mind that curcumin can cause bleeding in some people, especially if you are on blood thinners., Rich in omega-3 fatty acids, flaxseed oil helps reduce inflammation. Take one tablespoon every day for about two weeks to see results.Be aware that flaxseed oil and fish oil may increase bleeding in sensitive individuals, such as those taking blood-thinning medications, which includes aspirin., These foods are rich in magnesium, which helps with nerve function and muscle relaxation, both of which can help ease CTS pain., Adding specific trace elements to your diet may be difficult to keep up with. Luckily, many natural anti-inflammatory agents come in supplement form as well.


Bromelain is an enzyme derived from pineapples. It digests inflammatory proteins and helps to reduce inflammation and pain. However, make sure to discuss taking bromelain with your doctor first. It may interfere with certain medications and increase bleeding. Also, people with allergies to latex, pineapple, wheat, and grass pollen may be sensitive to bromelain.Curcumin and magnesium can also be obtained in supplement form."

Seek help from a physical therapist.,
Get corticosteroid injections.,
Get acupuncture.,
Get surgery for long-term pain.",How to Relieve Pain from Carpal Tunnel Syndrome4," If the stretches you’re doing at home to ease CTS aren’t working, a professional physical therapist can help you with more advanced stretching and range of motion exercises.


Some physical therapists use ultrasound therapy before performing stretches. When used at higher intensities, ultrasound creates heat, which helps ease muscle spasms and relax the muscles before stretching. This allows for a deeper, more effective stretch., Injecting corticosteroids into your carpal tunnel helps decrease inflammation, thus relieving pressure on the median nerve and relieving pain.Oral corticosteroid treatments are an option as well, but have proved less effective than injections.Research is being done to determine whether Botox injections can be used to treat CTS pain as effectively as corticosteroid injections do., Acupuncture was shown to ease mild to moderate CTS pain when individuals were treated eight times over the course of a month. This technique proved more likely to reduce pain than taking medication for CTS.As an alternative, try wet cupping, an ancient Chinese acupuncture technique in which glass cups apply suction to the skin surrounding relevant acupuncture points. Studies have shown that one session can ease pain for up to a week., Surgery is used as a last resort to ease CTS pain. It is usually performed only when other treatments haven’t helped, your CTS has been persistent over a long period of time (six months or more), or if there is risk of nerve damage.Carpal tunnel release surgery is very common and is done under local anesthesia. The surgery involves severing the band of tissue surrounding the wrist to ease the pressure on the median nerve. There are two types of surgery:Open release surgery: This surgery involves making a small incision in the wrist and cutting the carpal ligament to enlarge the carpal tunnel.
Endoscopic surgery: In this surgery two half-inch incisions are made, one in the wrist and one in the palm. A camera is then inserted, allowing the surgeon to make cuts to the carpal ligament. This type of surgery generally allows for a faster recovery.

Assess your risk factors for carpal tunnel syndrome.,
Recognize the symptoms.,
Keep track of your symptoms.,
Try the Phalen's Test.,
Try the other carpal tunnel tests.,
Ask yourself if you should see a doctor.",How to Diagnose Carpal Tunnel Syndrome1," Assessing your risk factors can put you in a better position to understand the symptoms, to recognize the condition and to better treat it. Assess if you have one or more of the following risk factors:Gender and age: women tend to develop carpal tunnel syndrome more than men and it is most frequently diagnosed between the ages of 30 and 60.
Occupation: having a job that requires a lot of use of your hands, such as factory or assembly line work, puts you at a greater risk for the syndrome.
Underlying conditions: those with metabolic disorders, rheumatoid arthritis, menopause, obesity, thyroid disorders, kidney failure, or diabetes have a greater chance at developing the condition.
Lifestyle factors: smoking, high salt intake, sedentary lifestyle may increase your risk of carpal tunnel syndrome;
, If you notice any of the following five symptoms in your wrist, hand, or arm, you might be developing or already suffering from carpal tunnel syndrome:Tingling in the hand, fingers or wrist.
Numbness in the hand, fingers or wrist.
Swelling in the wrist.
Pain in the hand, fingers or wrist.
Weakness of the hand.

, Keeping track of your symptoms can put you in a better position to diagnose and treat the condition, should you have it. Your doctor can also diagnose the condition better if he/she has a more detailed history of the condition.Symptoms generally show up gradually.
Symptoms often first appear during the night. As the condition worsens, you’ll start to feel the symptoms during the day.
Symptoms that do not go away with time (unlike in the case of a temporary injury) and gradually become worse as time moves forward.

, This is an easy test that can be used in the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome.There are several ways to test this. Try the following:


Sit at a table and place your elbows on the table.
Let your wrist fall to maximal flexion to increase the pressure in the carpal tunnel.
Hold this position for at least one minute.
Another way to do the test is to place the backs of both hands together in front of you, pointing fingers down (like an opposite prayer position).
Any pain and tingling of hands, fingers and/or wrist and numbness in the fingers, specifically, at the height of thumb, forefinger, and a part of the middle finger, are positive results.

, Several tests for diagnosing carpal tunnel have been described but the specificity of these tests is questionable. You may still try them:The Tinel’s sign is done by tapping the wrist and carpal tunnel with your fingers or a tendon hammer. If it causes tingling in the fingers, it is believed to be a positive test.
The Tourniquet test is based on temporarily increasing the carpal tunnel pressure by applying a blood pressure cuff to the upper arm or forearm. Inflate the cuff between systolic and diastolic pressure to obstruct venous return from the arm and increasing blood volume in the hand. If this causes symptoms, the test is positive. However, don't perform this test unless you are comfortable using a blood pressure cuff correctly.
The hand elevation test is done by elevating the hands above the head for two minutes. If this causes symptoms, then the test is positive.
The Durkan’s carpal compression test relies upon direct pressure applied over the carpal tunnel to increase the pressure. Press the carpal tunnel with your thumb or ask a friend to do this. If this causes symptoms, the test is positive.

, If the symptoms become worse or don't go away, the pain is unbearable, or you’re having a hard time keeping up at work, consult your doctor. Your doctor can diagnose and treat the symptoms appropriately and exclude any serious, underlying conditions.

Figure out what kind of headache you have.,
Keep a headache journal.,
Study your headache journal.,
Avoid common triggers.",How to Get Rid of a Headache Naturally1," Headaches can be caused by a number of factors such as stress, colds, allergies, or dehydration. Before using remedies or seeking help from a doctor, it is important to identify the type of headache you have so you can to find an effective treatment.


Tension headaches are the most common form of headaches. They are caused by muscle tightening in the back of the neck or scalp, often triggered by emotional stress, fatigue, or depression. Tension headaches usually cause a tightening band-like sensation around the neck or head, or pain that primarily occurs in the forehead, temples, or back of the head. Chronic tension headaches may also be accompanied by changes in sleep patterns, insomnia, anxiety, weight loss, dizziness, poor concentration, ongoing fatigue, and nausea.
Cluster headaches are characterized by severe, stabbing pain that develops behind one eye. They appear to be based on hypothalamic dysfunction and tend to be familial. They bring about burning, sharp, steady pain. Ptosis, a drooping eyelid, can be an important sign of a cluster headache.
A sinus headache occurs when the sinuses become inflamed due to allergies, a cold, or the flu. Sinus headaches may also be caused by digestive problems such as gastric reflux, diarrhea or constipation. A recurring or prolonged cold may cause sinusitis. Acute sinusitis is a common nasal condition that can occur from changes in atmospheric pressure, dental problems, allergies, or an infection caused by bacteria or viruses.
Migraine headaches can cause severe pain on one side of the head, pulsating pain through the head or on one side, sensitivity to light and sound, nausea, vomiting and increased pain with exertion such as climbing stairs or exercise. Some migraine sufferers also experience “auras”, or strange smell, sight, and touch sensations approximately 30–60 minutes before the onset of headaches.
Post-traumatic headaches can result from head injury and may persist for months or years following even mild head trauma. Common symptoms are head pain, dizziness, insomnia, poor concentration, and mood swings.;
, Medications or lifestyle changes may often be the cause of headaches. Keep a diary to track recent changes to diet, lifestyle, or medications as well as triggers. When you have a headache, note it along with any recent changes.Note the date, time of day, and duration of when the headache occurs. Note down the severity of the headache as well - such as mild, moderate, or severe. For example, you might discover that you get severe headaches when you drink more than 3 cups of coffee in a day, combined with reduced sleep. Note foods, beverages, medications, and allergens that you may have come in contact with before the onset of a headache.

, Try to identify common factors. Did you consume the same food right before a headache started? Did you take any medications or dietary supplements. If so, contact your doctor and consider discontinuing those medications - if possible - to see if it changes the frequency and severity of your headaches. Were you exposed to allergens such as pollen or dust? Did you changes your sleeping patterns? Make connections and experiment on your own. If you think that one factor causes headaches, cut it out. Do this over and over. Eventually, you'll figure out what your trigger is.

, Most headaches may be caused by certain environmental or dietary changes. Common triggers that have been reported to cause or increase the severity of headaches are:Seasonal changes or changes in atmospheric pressure. Certain activities such as flying, hiking, swimming or scuba diving may cause changes in air pressure and trigger headaches.
Lack of sleep or oversleeping. Try to get plenty of rest regularly.
Exposure to smoke, perfume vapors or hazardous fumes. Allergens such as pollen or dust may also cause contribute to headaches.
Eye strain. If you wear glasses or contacts, make sure your prescription is current. Do not use lenses that cause irritation.
Bright or flashing lights
Stress or strong emotions. Try to use relaxation techniques to manage stress.
Alcoholic beverages such as red wine, champagne and beer.
Excessive intake of caffeinated beverages such as coffee, soda or tea.Artificially sweetened foods and beverages, especially with aspartame.
Snacks containing monosodium glutamate (MSG), a type of salt.
Foods such as processed meats, sardines, anchovies, pickled herring, freshly baked yeast products, nuts, peanut butter, sweetened chocolate, sour cream or yogurt."

Tell your symptoms to your doctor.,
Get a physical examination.,
Get a blood test.,
Ask for an imaging test.,
Get an electromyogram.,
Ask for a nerve conduction study.",How to Diagnose Carpal Tunnel Syndrome2," Speaking with your healthcare provider means letting them know more about the symptoms that you’re experiencing as well as the condition history.Remember, your doctor can diagnose the condition better if you’re detailed and do not leave any symptoms out.
Be aware that your doctor may refer you to a specialist in neurology, surgery, orthopedics, or rheumatology, if needed for diagnosis or treatment.

, Your physician will want to assess your wrist and hand. They will press on points to find out if there is any pain or numbness in the area. They will also check for swelling, sensation, and weakness. If the pain is intense, additional tests may be needed to rule out other health conditions.A pre-assessment where they look over the area visually is required to give indication and direction for further tests.
Your doctor may also perform Phalen's test or other carpal tunnel tests in the office.

, Blood samples may be requested to rule out additional medical issues, such as rheumatoid arthritis, a thyroid issue, or other underlying medical problems. By ruling out these problems, your physician can better diagnose the problem.Once blood tests rule out other medical problems, additional imaging tests may be needed.

, Imaging tests, such as an X-ray or ultrasound, may be requested by the physician or you can request them yourself. By having these imaging scans performed, you can be in a better position to diagnose the problem and treat the symptoms.X-ray is usually used only to aid in the diagnosis or rule out other causes of pain (such as fractures and arthritis).
Your doctor may use ultrasound to visualize the structure of the median nerve in your hand.

, An electromyogram is a test during which multiple fine needles are inserted into the muscles to measure electrical discharges. This test can determine if there is muscle damage and it can rule out other conditions.A mild painkiller can be administered prior to the test to reduce pain.

, This medical conductivity test is used to detect how the nervous system is functioning and can determine whether or not you have carpal tunnel syndrome.During the test, two electrodes are placed on your hand and wrist and a small shock is passed through the median nerve to detect if electrical impulses are slowed in the carpal tunnel.
The results can indicate how much damage has occurred to your nerves.

Apply a warm towel.,
Take steamy showers.,
Use a humidifier.",How to Get Rid of a Headache Naturally2," Heat opens up blood vessels, which increases blood flow and supplies oxygen and nutrients to reduce pain in joints and relax sore muscles, ligaments, and tendons. A warm towel applied to the forehead or neck may help relieve tension and sinus headaches.Soak a small, clean towel in lukewarm water (40–45℃) for 3–5 minutes, then wring the water out. Apply to the forehead or other sore muscles for 5 minutes, then repeat steps for 20 minutes.
You can also use a hot water bottle or gel pack to apply heat. Do not use heat higher than 40–45℃. It may burn the skin. People with sensitive skin shouldn’t use a temperature higher than 30℃.
Do not apply heat if there is swelling or fever. Use an ice bag instead to reduce your temperature. Headaches can be caused by excessive heat.
Don’t use heat on injuries, wounds, or stitches. It will cause the tissue to expand , which can limit your body’s ability to heal damages and close wounds. People with poor circulation and diabetes should practice caution when using warm compression., Warm showers may help reduce congestion headaches due to a cold or fever and alleviate stress, thus reducing the symptoms or onset of a headache. Use lukewarm water (40–45℃) when taking a shower so as not to dehydrate or burn your skin., Dry air can cause dehydration and irritate your sinuses, often leading to tension, sinus, and migraine headaches. Using a humidifier will help keep your air moist.Aim for the right humidity. The air in your home should range from 30% to 55% humidity. If the humidity is too high, mold and dust mites may thrive, both of which are common causes of allergy headaches. If the humidity falls too low, the people in your home may suffer dry eyes and may develop throat and sinus irritations — another cause of headaches.The simplest way to measure humidity is with a gauge called a humidistat, which can be purchased from most hardware stores.
Both portable and central humidifiers must be cleaned thoroughly. Otherwise, they tend to become contaminated with mold and bacterial growth that may be blown through the house. Stop the humidifier and call your healthcare provider if you develop any respiratory symptoms that you feel are related to the use of a humidifier.For a natural humidifier, consider getting a houseplant. The transpiration process of plants — in which water vapor is released from the flowers, leaves and stems — can help regulate indoor humidity. Additionally, indoor plants help clear the air of carbon dioxide and other pollutants such as benzene, formaldehyde, and trichloroethylene. Good indoor plants include aloe vera, bamboo palm, weeping fig, Chinese evergreen, and various species of philodendron and dracaena."

Drink herbal tea.,
Use ginger.,
Take feverfew.,
Add rosemary to meals.,
Use lemon balm.,
Use St John’s wort.",How to Get Rid of a Headache Naturally3," Herbal teas contain antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that can help relieve stress and soothe sore muscles. Some teas can take up to 2–3 hours to take effect.Herbal teas that help reduce the symptoms associated with headaches are:


For headaches accompanied by nausea or anxiety, use 1/2 teaspoon dried peppermint and 1/2 teaspoon dried chamomile flowers in 1 cup of warm water (80-85 C). Drink 1-2 cups, as needed during the day until your headache decreases.
For headaches accompanied by insomnia, try Valerian tea. Infuse 1/2 teaspoon of valerian in 1 cup of warm water before sleeping.Be aware that valerian has several drug interactions. Talk to your doctor before trying valerian, especially if you are taking naloxone or buprenorphine.

, Ginger can help reduce symptoms of anxiety, nausea, vomiting, high blood pressure and digestive problems that may accompany some headaches, thus reducing the severity of the headache. Studies have shown that ginger can also help reduce the chances of migraines.Ginger extract is also available in dietary capsules or as oil at most nutrition food stores. Ginger can be a strong herb, therefore the recommended daily intake is 4 grams, including dietary sources. Pregnant women should not take more than 1 gram of ginger per day.Do not take ginger if you have a bleeding disorder or if you are taking blood-thinning medications, including aspirin., Research shows that feverfew is an effective medicine for preventing or stopping migraine headaches. Feverfew supplements are available fresh, freeze-dried, or dried. They can be purchased as capsules, tablets, or liquid extracts. Feverfew supplements should contain at least 0.2% parthenolide, a natural compound found in the herb. The recommended daily intake is 50–100 mg once or twice daily. Some precautions to remember are:


People with allergies to chamomile, ragweed, or yarrow may be allergic to feverfew and should not take it.
Feverfew may increase the risk of bleeding, especially if you take blood-thinning medications. Ask your doctor before taking feverfew if you take blood-thinners.
Pregnant and nursing women as well as children under 2 should not take feverfew.
If you are scheduled for surgery, be sure to tell your doctor if you are taking feverfew. It may interact with anesthesia.
Do not stop taking feverfew abruptly if you have used it for more than 1 week. Gradually lower the dose before stopping use. Stopping feverfew too quickly may cause rebound headache, anxiety, fatigue, muscle stiffness, and joint pain., Rosemary is widely used as a spice when cooking, especially in Mediterranean dishes. Rosemary has been used medicinally to improve memory, relieve muscle pains and spasms, improve digestion and support the circulatory and nervous systems.


Do not exceed 4 - 6 grams of rosemary per day. Any more and it may cause dehydration or hypotension. It can also act as an abortifacient. , Lemon balm (Melissa officinalis) is an herb often used to reduce stress and anxiety, promote sleep, improve appetite, and ease muscle pain and discomfort from indigestion. It is also often combined with other calming, soothing herbs, such as valerian and chamomile to help promote relaxation.


Lemon balm is available as a dietary capsule supplement with a recommendation of 300–500 mg, 3 times daily or as needed. Pregnant or breastfeeding women should consult with a doctor before using lemon balm.Lemon balm should not be taken by anyone with hyperthyroid disease.

, People with migraine, cluster, or post-traumatic headaches are at a higher risk of experiencing anxiety, depression, mood swings, and personality changes. St. John’s wort is an herb used to treat mild to moderate depression. It is available as a liquid extract, capsules, tablets and commercial tea. Ask your doctor which will be right for you.


Supplements are standardized at 0.3% hypericin concentration, one of the active compounds in the herb, and should be taken three times daily in 300mg doses. It may take 3–4 weeks to show significant improvements. Don’t stop taking St. John’s wort all at once, because that may cause unpleasant side effects. Gradually lower the dose before stopping.Some precautions to remember are:
If your headaches get worse, discontinue use.
People with ADD (attention deficit disorder) and bipolar disorder should not use St. John’s wort.
Do not use St. John’s wort if you are taking medications such as antidepressants, sedatives, birth control pills or allergy drugs.
Pregnant and breastfeeding women should not use St. John’s wort.
St. John’s wort should not be used to treat severe depression. If you experience thoughts of aggression or suicide, you should see a doctor immediately."

Try aromatherapy.,
Use peppermint oil.,
Use chamomile oil.,
Use lavender oil.",How to Get Rid of a Headache Naturally4," Aromatherapy is a herbal treatment which employs the fragrance of a plant’s essential oils to treat headaches, insomnia, anxiety, depression, stress, digestive disorders, and other conditions. A licensed physician or aromatherapist can help determine what works for you.Undiluted essential oils can cause skin reactions, so they need to be mixed with a carrier oil or lotion before use. Carrier lotions are made from emulsified oil and water, which makes them non-greasy and easy to apply.
People with dry, sensitive skin should use wheat-germ, olive, or avocado oils as carrier oils, which are heavier and seal in moisture more completely. Taking a bath or shower before applying oils also increases skin moisture.
To dilute the oils, add 5 drops of essential oil to 1/2 fluid oz (approx. 15ml) of carrier oil or lotion. Store any unused portions in a dark-glass dropper bottle that has a tight screw top., Peppermint oil has a significant amount of menthol which can help relieve headaches, muscular aches, and nasal congestion.To use it as a headache treatment, apply 1-2 drops of diluted peppermint oil to the forehead and temples, then massage for 3–5 minutes. Rub in small clockwise circles. Never apply peppermint oil to the face of an infant or small child, as it may cause spasms that inhibit breathing. If you experience irritation or develop a rash, discontinue use immediately., Chamomile oil has the ability to ease pain and relax muscles. It is generally used as a remedy for insomnia, nausea, and anxiety.To use as a headache treatment, apply 1-2 drops of diluted chamomile oil to the forehead and temples, then massage for 3–5 minutes.


If you are allergic to asters, daisies, chrysanthemums, or ragweed, you may also be allergic to chamomile. Chamomile may cause drowsiness and should not be taken before driving or exercise., Lavender oil has anti-inflammatory properties essential for relieving pain and soothing sore or tender body parts. It can help with conditions such as headaches, anxiety, stress, insomnia, and muscle soreness. It also smells great. To use it as a headache treatment, apply 1-2 drops of diluted lavender oil to the forehead and temples, then massage for 3–5 minutes. You can also add 2-4 drops of pure lavender oil to 2–3 cups of boiling water. Then hold your head over the water, inhaling the vapors in the process.
Do not consume lavender oil. It is toxic, if eaten. Only use the oil externally or by inhalation. Do not get it in your eyes. If you have asthma, talk to your doctor before using lavender. Some people with asthma find that lavender further irritates their lungs.
Pregnant and breastfeeding women should avoid using lavender."

Apply light pressure to the muscles in your shoulder, arm, wrist and hand.,
Apply deeper pressure friction massage to the shoulder, arm, wrist and hand.,
Apply kneading massage to the muscles in your shoulder, arm, wrist and hand.,
Apply shaking manipulation to the muscles in your shoulder, arm, wrist and hand.,
Apply effleurage to finish the massage.,
Apply acupressure to the muscle trigger points.",How to Release Carpal Tunnel Syndrome With Massage Therapy1," Start your massage using light strokes and avoiding too much pressure (a technique called effleurage). Start from the shoulder and move down the arm to the small muscles in your wrist and fingers.


Apply effleurage for at least 30 seconds to each section/muscle between your shoulder and hand. This will prepare the muscles for a deeper massage.Use the palm of your hand and your thumb and fingers to apply the massage.
You can concentrate on the muscles and tendons on the wrist but because carpal tunnel syndrome is rarely strictly a wrist problem, massaging the muscles in the arm and shoulder area may also be beneficial.Optionally, you can use massage oil to reduce friction.;
, Friction technique accelerates the return flow of lymphatic and venous drainage and relieves edema. It also works in the treatment of scar tissues and adhesions. Apply deeper pressure using long, gliding strokes with your thumb.
Start at the wrist area by pushing into the muscle in the center of the wrist, while gliding up to the elbow at the same time.
Return back down the upper arm, into the elbow, forearm, and wrist.
You can use your knuckles to provide more pressure without straining your hand. Apply enough pressure to feel the effect in the deep tissues but not so much that it causes severe pain.
Also, massage your fingers and the palm of the hand by using light pressure and gentle stretches.
Do at least 60 seconds of friction massage on each section/muscle, concentrating on the wrist but also working the knots and adhesions in the shoulder, arm and hand.

, The kneading technique, also called petrissage manipulation, causes the metabolic residues that have accumulated in the muscles and under the skin to join back into the circulation. Kneading may also improve the tonus and elasticity of your muscles. Use the palm of your hand to apply kneading technique to the muscles in your shoulder and arm, and your thumb and fingers to knead the muscles in your hand and wrist.
Do at least 30 seconds of kneading to each section/muscle, concentrating on the wrist area.

, Shaking manipulation is shown to have a pain-relieving effect, while strengthening your atonic muscles. Extend your fingers and use the side of your hand to gently strike the muscles.You can also use the tips of your fingers or the heel to apply the technique.
Do at least 30 seconds of shaking massage to each section/muscle, again concentrating on the wrist.

, The massage should start and end with light massaging (or effleurage). Effleurage technique helps relax muscles and calms the nerves.Do at least 30 seconds of effleurage manipulation to each section/muscle to finish the series of massaging techniques.
After you have completed one hand, repeat the massage to your other shoulder, arm, wrist and hand.
The number of massaging sessions you need varies depending on the severity of the carpal tunnel syndrome. Sometimes you may see a relief in just one session, but often times you should see improvement between five and 10 sessions.If the symptoms persist or become worse, consult a doctor or a physical therapist.

, Acupressure spots, or more commonly known as trigger points or muscle knots, can refer pain to the carpal tunnel area. These spots can also be found in the neck and shoulder area. To fully get any benefit, it's important to see a health professional that is trained in trigger point or acupressure treatments.

Rest your forearm on a table, palm-up. Apply pressure to the muscles near the inside elbow — press down and see if this recreates your carpal tunnel pain. If it does, press gently for up to 30 seconds; the pain should gradually reduce.
Move down the length of your forearm, testing for spots that recreate the carpal tunnel pain, then applying pressure for 30 seconds.
Turn your arm so that it is palm-down and perform similar pressure on any tender spots you find between your elbow and wrist.
Perform this exercise daily.

Avoid stress.,
Do yoga.,
Practice tai chi.,
Go outdoors.",How to Get Rid of a Headache Naturally5," Stress leads to higher blood pressure and tension — both of which cause headaches. Find ways to relax to combat headaches.Tailor your techniques to your personality and preferences. What has the most calming effect? Here are some examples.


Slow, deep breathing in a quiet environment.
Focusing on positive outcomes.
Restructuring priorities and eliminate unnecessary tasks.
Reducing use of electronic devices. These may cause eye-strain and trigger headaches.
Use humor. Research has found humor to be an effective way to deal with acute stress.
Listening to relaxing music., Yoga improves fitness, lowers blood pressure, promotes relaxation and self-confidence, and reduces stress and anxiety. People who practice yoga tend to have good coordination, posture, flexibility, range of motion, concentration, sleep habits, and digestion. Yoga can be helpful for tension, migraine, and post-traumatic headaches, general anxiety and stress.Take a group class and be sure to focus on your breathing as well as your poses. The instructor will help you with both of these aspects of yoga., Tai chi is a gentle exercise program derived from martial arts. It consists of slow, deliberate movements, meditation, and deep breathing. Tai chi can help enhance physical health, emotional well being, coordination, and agility. People who practice tai chi on a regular basis tend to have good posture, flexibility, range of motion, and sleep more soundly at night. All of these factors help to regulate your body and decrease stress — thus alleviating many types of headaches.


Tai chi is usually taught by an instructor with weekly sessions that can last for an hour. Tai chi should also be practiced for 15–20 minutes twice daily at home, and is safe for everyone regardless of age or athletic ability., There is evidence that conscious interaction with the natural environment promotes healthier lifestyles. One study found that living in a green environment lowered stress levels and encouraged physical activity. Activities such as gardening, hiking, and playing tennis outdoors can help reduce stress and promote overall well being. Try to make time for outdoor recreational activities at least 1–2 hours per week.Take the necessary precautions if you suffer from outdoor allergens. Consider taking allergy medicines like Allegra, Claritin, Zyrtec, Benadryl, Phenergan, and Clarinex."

Get enough sleep.,
Get regular exercise.,
Avoid smoking and drinking alcohol.",How to Get Rid of a Headache Naturally6," Insomnia or changes in sleep patterns may cause headaches.Insufficient sleep can also increase stress, cause mood swings, and impair concentration. The average adult needs at least 6–8 hours of sleep., Mental stress is one of the main causes of tension headaches. Studies have shown that exercise reduces levels of the body’s stress hormones, such as adrenaline and cortisol. It also stimulates the production of endorphins — a chemical in the brain that is the body’s natural painkiller and mood elevator.A daily 30–45 minute workout with moderate exercises such as brisk walking, jogging, swimming, or a 15–20 minute vigorous workout with exercises such as weight training, hiking, and competitive sports is recommended., Alcohol, especially beer, can trigger cluster and chronic migraine headaches. Passive smoking, secondhand smoke, and other forms of nicotine (chewing gums or tablets) should be avoided as they may trigger severe headaches. Smoking can also irritate nasal passages during a cold causing sinus headaches.People with a history of migraine or cluster headaches should avoid smoking and drinking alcohol completely as these headaches are associated with dizziness, insomnia, anxiety, depression and suicidal thoughts. If you experience suicidal thoughts, call 911 or seek medical help immediately.

Avoid foods that cause inflammation.,
Eat a “Mediterranean” diet.,
Drink lots of water.,
Take magnesium.,
Take Vitamin C. Vitamin C plays a vital role as an antioxidant and in promoting immune function, managing blood sugar, and lowering risk of various chronic diseases.,
Use elderberry extract.",How to Get Rid of a Headache Naturally7," Sinus and post-traumatic headaches are often characterized by inflammation, which occurs when a part of the body becomes reddened, swollen, and painful due to infection or injury. Certain foods can slow down the body’s healing process, increase inflammation and trigger headaches. Some inflammatory foods may also cause digestive problems such as bloating, stomach acid reflux, and constipation. Try to lessen or avoid the following foods:


Refined carbohydrates such as white bread, pastries, and donuts.
Fried foods
Sugar-sweetened beverages such as soda or energy drinks.
Red meat such as veal, ham or steak and processed meats such as hot dogs.
Margarine, shortening and lard., While some foods can cause inflammation, certain foods can also help reduce inflammation that may potentially lead to headaches. A Mediterranean diet mostly consists of foods that help reduce inflammation, such as:


Fruits such as strawberries, cherries, and oranges.
Nuts like almonds and walnuts.
Green leafy vegetables such as spinach or kale which are high in antioxidants.
Fatty fish like salmon, mackerel, tuna and sardines.
Whole grains such as brown rice, quinoa, millet, oatmeal and flax seed.
Olive or canola oil, Aim to drink at least eight ounces of water every two hours. Dehydration can often lead to headaches, dizziness, muscle cramps, low blood pressure, changes in body temperature, and seizures. 2 liters of water is the daily recommendation for the average adult. If you drink caffeinated beverages, take 1 liter of water for every cup of caffeine. Non-caffeinated, glucose-free sports drinks with electrolytes can help alleviate dehydration as well., Studies have shown magnesium to be very effective in alleviating head pain. Besides its anti-stress properties, magnesium can also help reduce anxiety, chronic fatigue, chest pain, and maintain healthy blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar levels.


Natural food sources of magnesium are salmon, mackerel, halibut, tuna, dark chocolate, dark leafy greens, nuts, seeds, brown rice, lentils, soybeans, black beans, chickpeas, avocado, and bananas.Calcium can inhibit the absorption of magnesium supplements, so it is better to use more readily absorbed forms such as magnesium gluconate or a magnesium amino acid chelate. 100mg of magnesium supplements is recommended to be taken 2–3 times daily. Adults should get at least 280–350 mg of magnesium daily.

, Vitamin C can be taken as a dietary supplement with a recommended dose of 500 mg split into two or three times daily. Since smoking depletes vitamin C, smokers may need an additional 35 mg per day. You can also add vitamin C-rich foods to your daily diet. Good natural sources of vitamin C are:


Sweet red or green peppers
Citrus fruit such as oranges, pomelo, grapefruit, limes or non-concentrated citrus juices.
Spinach, broccoli and brussel sprouts
Strawberries and raspberries
Tomatoes
Mango, papaya and cantaloupe, European elder is an immunity-boosting herb also known for its anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties. It can also help reduce sinus headaches. Elderberry extract can be found as a syrup, lozenge or dietary capsule supplement at most nutrition or drug stores.You can also steep 3-5 grams of dried elder flower in a cup of boiling water for 10–15 minutes to drink as an herbal tea, up to three times per day. Some precautions to remember are:


Do not use unripe or uncooked elderberries as they may be poisonous.Elderberry should not be given to children without consulting with a pediatrician.
Speak to your doctor before taking elderberry, as it may have some side effects for pregnant women, people with autoimmune disease, and people taking diabetic medication, laxatives, chemotherapy drugs, or immunosuppressants."

Stretch your wrist flexors and forearm.,
Stretch your wrist extensors and forearm.,
Perform tendon gliding stretches.",How to Release Carpal Tunnel Syndrome With Massage Therapy2," Hold your arm straight out in front of you, palm up, and bend your hand down so that your fingers point to the floor.Optionally, you can do this kneeling on the floor by placing the palms of your hands on the floor (fingers pointing toward you). Shift your body backward until you feel the stretch.Hold the stretch for at least 30 seconds.
Repeat with the other hand.

, This is almost identical to the previous stretch except you will extend your arm with your palm downward this time. Bend your hand down so that your fingers point to the floor.Hold the stretch for at least 30 seconds.
Repeat with the other hand.

, This is a series of movements during which your fingers reach five positions: straight, hook, fist, tabletop, and straight fist.Start with the straight position by holding your fingers straight up and together.
Bend your fingertips down to lightly touch the palm (if you can).
Move your fingers to a partially closed fist.
Bend your fingers straight forward with your thumb underneath (like forming a birds head).
Finally, form a fully closed fist with your thumb relaxed on the side.
Repeat this series of movements a few times with both hands.

Visit your doctor.,
Try biofeedback.,
Try acupuncture.,
Watch for emergency symptoms.",How to Get Rid of a Headache Naturally8," While most headaches can be cured by making lifestyle changes or taking medication, some headaches may become frequent if not treated immediately and cause other illnesses. Some headaches may also be warning signs of another underlying cause and need immediate medical attention. You should see your doctor or go to the emergency room when you have any of the following:


”First” or ""worst"" headache, often accompanied by confusion, weakness, double vision, or loss of consciousness that interferes with daily activities.
Sudden, severe headache that may be accompanied by a stiff neck.
Severe headache accompanied by fever, nausea, or vomiting that is not related to another illness.
Headache due to a head injury.
The headache is severe and just in one eye, with redness in that eye.
Persistent headache in someone who has been previously headache-free, particularly in someone over age 50.
Headache and a loss of sensation or weakness in any part of the body, which could be a sign of a stroke.
New headaches in someone with a history of cancer or HIV/AIDS. , Biofeedback is a technique that trains people to improve their health by controlling certain bodily processes that normally happen involuntarily, such as heart rate, blood pressure, muscle tension, and skin temperature. Electrodes attached to your skin measure these processes and display them on a monitor. With help from a biofeedback therapist, you can learn to change your heart rate or blood pressure. Biofeedback is an effective therapy for tension and migraine headaches, anxiety, depression, seizures, high blood pressure, chronic pain, digestive and urinary problems. Biofeedback is considered safe for most people as no side effects have been reported.
Psychiatrists, psychologists and physicians can be qualified practitioners for biofeedback therapy.
There are different types of biofeedback therapy. Neurofeedback, also called electroencephalography (EEG), measures brain wave activity and may be most effective for headaches, stress, anxiety and depression. Electromyography (EMG) measures muscle tension. Thermal biofeedback helps measure skin and body temperature., Acupuncture helps stimulate specific points on the body by inserting thin needles through the skin. Studies show that acupuncture may help relieve headache pain, reduce anxiety and alleviate stress.Acupuncture is most effective for migraine headaches, but can also be useful for tension, cluster, sinus and other illness-related headaches. Acupuncture generally has no side effects when performed by an experienced practitioner.Make sure that your practitioner is licensed to perform acupuncture therapy. It is best to avoid strenuous physical activity, heavy meals, alcohol intake, or sexual activity for up to 8 hours after a treatment., Some headaches may be caused due to an infection or occur as warning signs to an underlying cause.If you experience any of the following symptoms with your headache, seek medical care immediately:


High blood pressure
Fever higher than 104℉ (40℃).
Nausea and vomiting
Light sensitivity, double vision, tunnel vision or vision loss
Impaired speech
Short, rapid breathing
Temporary loss of consciousness
Sudden change in mental functions, such a flat mood, impaired judgment, memory loss, or a lack of interest in daily activities
Seizures
Muscle weakness or paralysis."

Avoid compressing your median nerve.,
Stretch your wrists regularly.,
Shake your hands out.,
Wear a special wrist support.,
Consider altering your sleep position.,
Look at your work station closely.,
Take over-the-counter (OTC) medication.,
Make an appointment with your family doctor.,
See a health professional such as a physical therapist or massage therapist.,
Try corticosteroid injections.,
Consider carpal tunnel surgery as a last resort.,
Be patient during your recovery.",How to Deal With Carpal Tunnel Syndrome," The carpal tunnel within the wrist is a narrow passageway made from small carpal bones attached by ligaments. The tunnel protects nerves, blood vessels and tendons. The primary nerve that allows for movement and sensation in your hand is the median nerve.Thus, avoid activities that compress and irritate the median nerve, such as repeatedly flexing your wrists, lifting heavy weights, sleeping with bent wrists and punching solid objects.


Make sure to keep your wrist watch and any bracelets loose around your wrists — having them too tight may irritate the median nerve.
In most cases of CTS, a single cause is hard to identify. CTS is typically caused by a combination of factors, such as repetitive wrist strain combined with arthritis or diabetes.
Wrist anatomy can make a difference — some people have naturally smaller tunnels or oddly shaped carpal bones.;
, Stretching your wrists daily can be helpful for reducing or minimizing CTS symptoms.In particular, extending your wrists helps to make more space for the median nerve within the carpal tunnel because it stretches the surrounding ligaments. The best way to extend / stretch both wrists at the same time is making the ""prayer pose."" Place your palms together about 6 inches in front of your chest and raise your elbows until you feel a stretch in both wrists. Hold it for 30 seconds and repeat 3-5x per day.


Alternatively, grab the fingers of the affected hand and pull back until you feel a stretch in the front of your wrist.
Wrist stretches may temporarily trigger more CTS symptoms, such as tingling in the hand, but don't stop them unless you actually feel pain. The symptoms will diminish with time.
In addition to hand tingling, other symptoms commonly associated with CTS include: numbness, throbbing pain, muscle weakness and/or color changes (too pale or red).

, If you notice your hand(s) falling asleep or feel achy pain in your wrist / hand, a quick (albeit temporary) fix is to give your hands a good shake for between 10-15 seconds — sort of like you're trying to shake water off your hands in order to dry them. The shaking can help to promote blood circulation and nerve flow within the median nerve and temporarily get rid of symptoms.Depending on what your job is, you may have to resort to shaking your hands out many times throughout the day to keep CTS symptoms at bay.


CTS symptoms most often occur (and begin) in the thumb, index finger, middle finger and part of the ring finger, which is why people who have the condition often drop things and feel clumsy.
The little finger is the only part of the hand not affected by CTS because its not innervated by the median nerve.

, Wearing a semi-rigid wrist support, brace or splint during the day can help prevent CTS symptoms because they keep the wrist in a neutral position and prevent it from flexing.Splints or wrist braces should also be worn during potentially aggravating activities, such as typing on a keyboard, carrying groceries, driving and bowling. Wearing wrist supports during sleep can help relieve the occurrence of nighttime symptoms, particularly if you have a habit of tucking in your hands to your body.You may need to wear wrist supports for several weeks (day and night) to get significant relief from CTS symptoms. However, for some, supports only provide negligible benefit.
Wearing wrist splints at night is a good idea if you're pregnant and have CTS because pregnancy tends to increase swelling in the hands (and feet).
Wrist supports, splints and braces can be bought at most pharmacies and medical supply stores.

, Some sleeping postures can definitely aggravate the symptoms of CTS, which leads to reduced amount and quality of sleep.More specifically, sleeping with your fists clenched tightly and/or hands tucked into your body (flexed wrists) is the worst position for triggering CTS symptoms, although extending your arms above your head is not a good position either. Instead, sleep on your back (supine) or sides with your arms close to your body, and keep your hands open and wrists in a neutral position. This will promote normal blood circulation and nerve flow.


As noted above, wearing wrist supports while sleeping is helpful for preventing aggravating positioning, but it may take some time to get used to.
Don't sleep on your stomach (prone) with your wrists compressed under your pillow. People who have this habit often wake up with numbness and tingling in their hands.
Most wrist supports are made of nylon and fasten with velcro, which can irritate your skin. Therefore, cover your support with a sock or thin cloth to reduce skin irritation.

, In addition to your sleep position, your CTS symptoms may also be caused or aggravated by a poorly designed work station. If your computer keyboard, mouse, desk or chair isn't properly positioned to accommodate your height and body proportions, it can put strain on your wrists, shoulders, neck and mid back. Thus, make sure your keyboard is positioned so your wrists are not constantly extended back while typing.Consider getting an ergonomic keyboard and mouse, which are designed to reduce stress on wrists and hands. Your employer might cover the costs for you.


Put thin cushioned pads underneath your keyboard and mouse to reduce the impact on your hands and wrists.
Have an occupational therapist review your work station and suggest ergonomic changes tailored to your body.
People who work on computers and registers (such as cashiers) for a job are at much higher risk of CTS., The symptoms of CTS are often related to inflammation / swelling that develop in the wrist, which secondarily irritates the median nerve and nearby blood vessels. Thus, taking OTC non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil) or naproxen (Aleve), can be very helpful for reducing CTS symptoms, at least in the short term.Painkillers, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, Paracetamol), can also be used to combat the achy pain of CTS, but they don't impact the inflammation / swelling.


NSAIDs and analgesics should be considered short-term strategies for controlling pain. There isn't any evidence that these medications cure or improve CTS in the long run.Taking NSAIDs for too long (or too much at any time) significantly increases your risk of stomach irritation, ulcers and kidney failure. Always read the labels for dosage information.
Taking too much acetaminophen or taking it for too can cause liver damage.

, If you are experiencing the above-mentioned symptoms in your wrist / hand for more than a few weeks, then make an appointment with your doctor. Your doctor will exam you and likely take x-rays and a blood test to rule out problems that can mimic CTS, such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, diabetes, stress fracture in the wrist or vascular problems.


Electro-diagnostic tests (EMG and nerve conduction) are often done to confirm the diagnosis of CTS by measuring the function of the median nerve.You might be asked to perform specific tasks that are difficult with CTS, such as making a tight fist, pinching your thumb and forefinger together and moving small objects with precision.Your doctor may also inquire about your job as some are high risk for CTS, such as carpenters, cashiers, assembly-line workers, musicians, auto mechanics and people who use computers extensively.

,


Physical therapist. Most of the time, carpal tunnel syndrome symptoms can be treated conservatively. A physical therapist will asses your joints, muscles and ligaments to see the underlying cause of your carpal tunnel symptoms. Treatments may include modalities such as ultrasound for reducing inflammation and promoting healing, exercises to increase flexibility and strengthen the associated muscles, and ergonomic education to assess your workplace or daily activities while providing modifications to reduce any stresses.
Massage therapist. In some instances, carpal tunnel syndrome type of symptoms can be associated with Myofascial Pain Syndrome, a condition associated with the presence of trigger points, or more commonly known as muscle knots. Research has shown that trigger points are common in those with carpal tunnel symptoms.In addition, a study found that treatments on these knots have led to improvements., Your doctor may recommend injecting a corticosteroid medication (such as cortisone) into your wrist or base of your hand to relieve the pain, inflammation and other symptoms of CTS.Corticosteroids are potent and quick-acting drugs that can decrease swelling in your wrist and relieve pressure on your median nerve(s). Taking oral steroids by mouth are another option, but it's not considered nearly as effective as the injections, plus the side effects are more pronounced.


Other common steroid medications used for CTS are prednisolone, dexamethasone and triamcinolone.
Possible complications associated with corticosteroid injections include local infection, excessive bleeding, tendon weakening, muscle atrophy and nerve damage. Thus, injections are usually limited to two per year.
If steroid injections don't significantly reduce your CTS symptoms, then surgery should be considered.

, If all other home remedies and treatments fail to eliminate your CTS symptoms, then your doctor may recommend surgery. Surgery should be thought of as a last resort due to the risks of causing more damage, although it can completely relieve symptoms in a decent proportion of patients. The goal of CTS surgery is to relieve pressure on the median nerve by cutting the primary ligament pressing upon it.CTS surgery can be performed in two different ways: endoscopic or open surgery.


Endoscopic surgery involves using a thin telescope-like device with a tiny camera on the end (endoscope), which is inserted into your carpal tunnel through an incision in your wrist or hand. The endoscope allows the surgeon to see into the tunnel and cut the problematic ligament.
Endoscopic surgery usually results in the least amount of pain and side effects, as well as the quickest recovery.
In contrast, open surgery involves a larger incision in your palm and over your wrist in order to cut through the ligament and liberate the median nerve.
Surgery risks include: nerve damage, infection and scar tissue formation — all of which can potentially make CTS become worse.

, Following the outpatient CTS surgery, you'll be asked to frequently lift your hand above your heart and wiggle your fingers, which helps to reduce swelling and prevent stiffness.Mild pain, inflammation and stiffness in the hand / wrist can be expected post-surgery for up to 6 months, and complete recovery may take a full year. For the initial 2-4 weeks post-surgery, you may be asked to wear a wrist support, although using your hand is encouraged.


Most people's CTS symptoms get better after surgery, but recovery is often slow and gradual. Hand strength typically returns to normal about 2 months after surgery.CTS recurs about 10% of the time post-surgery and may require follow-up surgery many months or a few years later.

Follow a doctor-recommended rehabilitation plan.,
Keep your wrist elevated as much as possible.,
Move your fingers.,
Do finger abduction and adduction.,
Use your hand for simple everyday activities.,
Apply ice to relieve any pain or swelling.,
Have the post-surgery dressing removed.,
Wear a wrist brace.,
Introduce thumb flexion exercises into your previous routine.,
Do a thumb stretch exercise.,
Try a forearm extensor exercise.,
Perform a forearm flexor exercise.,
Do some wrist curls.,
Get your stitches removed.,
Gradually use your wrist brace less and less.,
Start strengthening exercises, such as the forearm extensor exercise and wrist curls.,
Try an ulnar glide exercise.,
Work on some grip exercises.",How to Exercise after Carpal Tunnel Surgery," This plan will involve healing of your soft muscles, preventing wrist stiffness, and repairing your nerves and tendons. You will most likely have to check in with your doctor and/or physical therapist regularly to make sure that everything is going according to plan.;
, This is particularly important in the first four days after surgery to limit swelling. You can use an arm sling while standing or moving around to keep your wrist elevated.


When sitting or lying down, prop your wrist up on a cushion so that your hand and wrist are elevated above your chest. Doing this will help to limit swelling, which can also limit the pain you experience.

, Gently and slowly move your fingers, extending them so that they are straight as much as possible. After extending your fingers, bend them at the knuckles to try to touch the bottom of your palm with your fingertips. Repeat this process 50 times within an hour. Doing this will help to strengthen your weakened tendons.


Switch between these finger motion exercises until you feel like you can do them relatively easily without stress of pain.

, This is a simple exercise aiming to train your fingers to move with the flexor tendons. Doing this can also help to reduce swelling. To do this exercise:


Open your hand and keep your fingers straight. Open your fingers as wide as you can, then squeeze them back together.
Repeat this exercise ten times.

, While exercises are very beneficial, simply using your hand to do commonplace things will give it a good workout. However, don’t use your hand for prolonged periods of time, particularly if the activity involves pressure on the wrists like typing on your laptop.


As a reminder, you should not return to work for at least two weeks after your surgery so that your wrist muscles and tendons can heal. If you force yourself to begin typing again, your pain will get triggered again and your weak tendons will become irritated.

, Apply ice routinely, every day, especially in the first four days after your surgery. The cold temperature will help to reduce swelling and pain, as the cold constricts your blood vessels.


Wrap ice or a cold compress in a hand towel so that you do not apply the ice directly to your skin, as applying ice for too long a period of time could cause skin damage. Leave the cold compress on your wrist for 15 to 20 minutes.

, You will receive a heavy duty band-aid to cover the stitches. You will have to replace the band-aid as it gets soiled; when you remove it, take the time to clean your wrist and around your stitches.


While you will now be able to take a shower and get your wrist wet, you should not dunk your wrist in a pool or bowl filled with water.

, Your doctor will give you a wrist brace to wear during your second week after surgery. You should wear it during the day, and when you are sleeping at night. The brace is meant to keep your wrist safe and in a fixed position.


You should remove the brace when taking a shower and when doing the exercises listed in the following steps.

, Keep on performing the previous finger motion exercises; they should be much easier to perform this week. Add in the “thumb flexion”. Do this by opening your hands and extending your fingers. Place your palm face up, then bend your thumb, trying to reach the base of your smallest finger to the other side of your hand. Return it back to its original position.


Repeat this process about ten times.

, An exercise called “Thumb stretch” is made by opening your hand palm, straightening all your fingers and turning your palm up. Grab your thumb outside so that it is pulled back.


Count to five then release. Repeat this process ten times.

, This exercise can be done by extending your arm in front of you, while keeping your elbow straight and your palm pointing towards the ground. Use your other hand to hold your fingers of the extended arm and gently push it down until you feel a stretch. This will help to stretch your muscles in your forearm and the back of your wrist.Hold this position for five seconds. Repeat this process five times throughout the day.

, This exercise can be done by extending your arm in front of you, while keeping your elbow straight and your palm pointing to the ceiling. Use the other hand to hold your fingers of the extended arm and gently push down until you feel a stretch. Pull your fingers toward your forearm. Hold this position for five seconds, then release. Repeat this process five times.


Transition into the next part of this stretch. Point your palm down and use your other hand to grab your fingers. Move them up toward your forearm until you feel a stretch. Count to five and then release. Repeat this process five times.

, This one is done with the aid of a table, chair or with your other hand. Extend your arm in front of you and make a fist. Place your forearm on the table and hang your hand off the edge. Face your palm down towards the ground.


Move your hand up and down by bending your wrist; do this very gently. Repeat this process ten time, then rotate your arm so that your palm points towards the floor. Move your hand up and down another ten times.
You can use your other hand, rather than a table, to support your elbow.

, Head to the doctor’s office to get your stitches out. You will be allowed to soak your wrist in water three to four days after your stitches have been removed. You will have to wait so that the small stitch holes can heal and close.


Use lotion or cream to rub on the scars that the stitches may have left. Doing this will help to heal scar tissue that may have formed. Do not use perfumed lotion, as this may irritate the area where the stitches were.
Massage the area with lotion for five minutes, twice a day.

, You will no longer have to wear your wrist brace at night but you should still wear it during the day. You will soon be able to limit the amount of time you wear it to when you are doing physical activities.


If you decide to go back to work, you should continue to wear your brace for roughly six weeks after you return to work.

, Make a fist with your hand to increase the pressure on your wrist and stretch in your forearms while performing the extensor exercise described in the previous section. This will deepen the exercise and make it more rewarding.


The wrist curls described in the previous section can be enhanced by holding a light weight, like a water bottle or tennis ball. This extra weight can increase the intensity of the exercise by increasing the resistance put on your wrist.

, This exercise is done by sitting with your back straight and looking forward. Bend your head to the side opposite to the affected arm, raise your affected arm to your side in your shoulder line. Form the “okay” sign with your hand by pushing your thumb and index finger together.


Raise your arm, then bend it toward your head while raising your elbow so that the circle made by your thumb and forefinger is placed next to your eye. The other three fingers should be placed on your face and ear. Apply pressure to your face with your wrist to fully extend your wrist. Count to five, then repeat ten times.

, Grip exercises are done at this time too to build up and strengthen your muscles at the forearm, wrist and grip area. They can be done using a chair. You can add some weights on the chair to increase the exercise intensity and give yourself more challenging exercises.


Lie on the floor on your stomach in front of the chair so that if you extend your arms you could grab its first two legs. Hold them tight with your hands while keeping your elbows straight and resting on the floor.
The first exercise is to try to elevate the chair up in the air for ten seconds without making it touching the floor again, then return it back to the floor, the second exercise is the same but with elevating the chair for 30 to 40 seconds, you should have the minimal rest between each exercise and the other as much as possible to be able to work on the all forearm muscles group.
The third exercise is done by raising the chair for two seconds, then lowering it down quickly without making it reach the floor, then raising it again for two seconds and lowering it and so on, the reason for the two seconds that you don’t want to perform much quick up and downs.
The last exercise is done while making twisting motion that need more stability and strength from your muscles, just raise the chair above the floor for about twenty to thirty seconds while making a twist motion bringing it slightly quickly right and left.

Minimize stress.,
Get the right amount of sleep.,
Stay hydrated.,
Eat healthy meals at regular intervals.,
Take regular breaks.",How to Avoid Migraine Triggers at Work1," Try to operate with a clear schedule and goals in mind for each day. Share your work burden with others and discuss successes and setbacks. Take advantage of flexible work conditions whenever possible, such as flex hours. Incorporate a relaxing ritual into your work day, like a five-minute office yoga session.Even a quick neck massage can relieve some of your tension. Stress is a major cause for both regular headaches and migraines.Be particularly watchful of your stress levels during periods in which your work schedule is disrupted, such as holidays.;
, Aim for at least eight hours of undisturbed sleep per night. Adjust your bedtime so that you have plenty of sleep before getting up to go to work. If you are sleep deprived, you might even try to get a quick nap in over your lunch break. However, be warned that even naps can trigger migraines for some people., Drink water throughout the day. Aim for a total of 8 eight-ounce cups. Reduce or eliminate your caffeine intake, as it can contribute to dehydration and the development of migraines. Use water trips as an excuse to stretch your legs and walk over to the cooler instead of staying at your desk., Eat a snack or full meal every 2-3 hours. Don’t ever skip meals or snacks, as this can drop your blood sugar levels and trigger a migraine. Avoid high-sugar snack foods for the same reason. Instead, stash healthy fruits and vegetables in your office fridge.Once you identify any trigger foods, do your best to avoid eating them. For example, certain aged cheeses can cause a migraine to develop for some people. Eliminate suspicious foods from your diet and see if your health improves., Step outside and get some fresh air every few hours, even if just for a couple of minutes. Walk around the office and talk to your coworkers. Read a paper magazine to get your eyes away from the computer screen. Close your eyes and lean back in your chair for a few minutes.It has been shown that office building air can contain a number of toxins that can injure your health. Getting fresh air can reduce these health concerns."

Adjust the lighting.,
Keep the temperature on a moderate setting.,
Keep the noise to a minimum.,
Stay away from strong smells.,
Maintain good posture.",How to Avoid Migraine Triggers at Work2," Request to dim, or turn off entirely, the overhead fluorescent lights in your part of the office. Replace these lights with lamps and natural light. If this isn’t possible, you can even put a cover over some of your workspace to block out the lights. If the overhead lighting is flickering, ask to have it repaired or replaced.If adjusting the lighting is not possible, then visit your eye doctor and discuss getting a pair of rose-colored glasses to minimize eye strain.
If your computer screen hurts your eyes, then attach a glare screen to the monitor. You can also attach a hood to the top of the monitor to keep it from reflecting any surrounding lights., If the room is too hot and you become overheated, it can trigger a migraine. The same is true for extreme cold temperatures. Invest in a cooling fan or space heater for your office, if needed. Try to also keep the thermostat on a consistent temperature, as fluctuations can cause problems as well.There isn’t one “magic” temperature, so just watch for what your body reacts the best to.

, Invest in a noise machine if you have a loud work area. Perhaps purchase a pair of high quality headphones. Create a soothing playlist on your computer to play when work noises get to be too much. Be aware that certain pitches, such as beeps, can trigger migraines, too.For example, if you are in an office with phones constantly ringing, talk with your coworkers about implementing a ring-free period where you just use the phone lights to identify incoming calls.

, Avoid wearing heavy perfumes, aftershaves, or other personal products, as they may linger in your work space over the day. Try to stay away from work spaces with heavy odors, such as break rooms. Steer clear of cleaning closets, as the products therein can trigger headaches.Printer and copier odors, in particular, can be problematic. You may need to ask a coworker or assistant to make any copies for you if you suspect that this could be a trigger.Buzzing lights and buzzing office equipment can trigger a migraine as well. Florescent lights are a trigger for some.

, Pay attention to how you are sitting in your chair. Keep your back straight and your shoulders pulled back. Stand up and stretch every 30 minutes or so. Prop up your feet on your desk, if you can, to reverse the downward blood flow. Position your computer, so that you are not arching your neck in an uncomfortable way.Place an alarm on your computer or phone to alert you when you need to stand and stretch. Keep a pillow by your chair to use behind your back to help with your posture, and change positions in your chair often as needed.

Keep a migraine diary.,
Look for migraine patterns.,
Target individual triggers.,
Set realistic expectations.,
Talk with your doctor.",How to Avoid Migraine Triggers at Work3," For at least one month, write down all of the details of your migraine attacks. Make note of when they begin, how long they last, and any other physical symptoms. Most importantly, create a list of details describing what you were doing and feeling when you first noticed the symptoms.You can also include the details of any activities that you were undergoing at the same time as the migraine attack. For example, did you take ibuprofen two hours beforehand?Consider downloading a migraine app to your phone. These apps allow you to record all of the details surrounding each migraine incident. Some of the apps will even go through your data and look for trigger patterns., Read through your notes, paying particular attention to the “before” descriptions. Try to find similarities over time that point toward certain circumstances acting as a trigger. You can find these connections in both actions and emotions. Compile these patterns into a list of possible triggers that you will then explore and address individually.For example, you may notice that you are always sleep deprived prior to each attack, or perhaps your stress levels at work are particularly high.
Some migraines are preceded by a warning before hand which may include flashes of light, blind spots, and tingling on one side of the face or in the arms or legs.
Many migraines are one sided and include a stabbing or throbbing sensation through the eye or one side of the head.

, You simply cannot control all possible triggers at once, so try to focus on a couple, or even one, from your list. Do your best to eliminate this trigger from your life. Make note of your efforts in your diary. See if your migraines reduce during this trial period. If so, then you might be on the right track. If not, then this still could be a trigger, but you need to test out other options as well.For instance, if alcohol consumption is on your list of possible triggers, then go ahead and stop drinking for a few weeks. See if you notice any changes in the frequency and severity of your migraines.
Be aware that it is quite possible that a number of triggers contribute to your migraines. To see real results, you may need to continue testing until you identify more than one.

, It is unlikely that you will be able to eliminate your migraines entirely. Instead, aim to manage them so that they do not interfere with the quality of your work and home life. If your goal is reduction, then you can also celebrate each trigger identification and avoidance. Keeping a positive attitude is important, as stress and depression can lead to even more migraines., If you are concerned about how migraines are impacting your work, then make an appointment with your primary physician, or a migraine specialist, to talk about your options. They will not be able to test your claims, as no migraine test exists. However, they can make sure that your migraines do not stem from other physical conditions, such as illness."

Recognize the symptoms.,
Remove the offending substance.,
Warm the roof of your mouth with your tongue.,
Drink a warm substance.,
Make a mask with your hands to cover your mouth and nose.,
Press a warm thumb against your palate.,
Wait it out.",How to Stop Brain Freeze1," Brain freeze is a painful sensation that occurs when a cold substance touches the back of your throat and the surrounding blood vessels constrict rapidly in response. When the blood vessels begin to dilate again, they activate the trigeminal nerve, which controls sensation to much of the face. This can feel like a sharp or stabbing pain in the sinuses or forehead. Brain freeze will subside on its own within a few minutes.The mechanism that causes brain freeze has also been linked to migraines. If your headache doesn’t go away after 5-10 minutes, or if you get brain-freeze-type pains without consuming cold things, consider seeking medical treatment.;
, If you just chugged a frozen Coke or bit into an ice pop and were rewarded for your efforts with brain freeze, the first thing to do is stop consuming the cold stuff., You can relieve brain freeze pain by quickly warming the roof of your mouth (also referred to as the soft palate and hard palate; the hard palate being the part with bone, and the soft without) after it's already been cooled. If you do this soon enough, you may be able to ease the surge of blood flow to your brain.Touch your tongue to your soft palate. If you can roll your tongue in a ball, press the bottom of your tongue to the roof of your mouth. The underside of your tongue may be warmer than the top side (which was probably cooled by the Slurpee you just chugged.)
Some people find that firmly pressing your tongue against the roof of the mouth alleviates brain freeze, so try applying extra pressure!

, The beverage doesn’t have to be extremely hot, it just needs to be room temperature or above to restore your mouth’s normal temperature.


Sip the liquid slowly and swish it around your mouth a bit. This will warm up your palate.

, Breathe quickly into your cupped hands. This will trap your warm breath and raise the temperature inside your mouth.

, Obviously, make sure your hands are clean before you do this, but since your body temperature is much higher than the temperature inside your suddenly-freezing mouth, the warm contact may help relieve the pain., The brain freeze will usually pass on its own within 30-60 seconds. Sometimes the shock of the brain freeze makes it seem worse than it really is, but if you expect it and know that it'll come and go, it doesn't have to be a traumatizing experience.

Make or get a diary.,
Include fields for information about your headache.,
Include information about potential triggers.,
Document your headache treatments.,
Include any other information that you think might be useful or that your doctor asked you to record.

,
Fill out a diary entry each time you get a headache.,
Look for patterns.,
Avoid likely triggers.,
Consult with your doctor.",How to Use a Headache Diary," Unlike other diaries, there are very specific things you need to include in your headache diary. In order to make sure you remember to include these items (and also to make your headache diary more easily readable) it's best to structure each diary entry as a form with pre-written fields. You can write or type these out on a sheet of paper, or you can search for ""headache diary"" online and print out a diary form from one of a number of sites. Your doctor may also provide you with a diary template. Make copies of your template and put them in a three-ring binder to keep them together.;
, This can help you identify patterns in the frequency and severity of headaches. It can also help your doctor make an accurate diagnosis.


Date/time the headache started and date/time it ended: Some migraines can last a few days
Any warning signs: Migraine headaches in particular are frequently preceded by so-called prodrome symptoms which may include visual disturbances (migraine with aura), neck stiffness, and irritability. For a more complete list of these symptoms, see the article on preventing migraines. Keep in mind, though, that you may experience none of these symptoms, or you may notice other warning signs.
Location, type, and severity of pain: Describe the location of the pain as specifically as possible. Use adjectives such as throbbing, pounding, splitting, blinding, killing or any other word that accurately describes the type of pain. Rate severity on a scale of 1-10.
Accompanying symptoms: Did you feel nauseated or vomit? Did you also have a fever or diarrhea? List any symptoms that occurred in conjunction with, or right after, the headache.
How the headache impacted you: Were you able to function normally, or was the headache completely debilitating?

, Migraines and other headaches seem to be linked to, or triggered by, certain factors, including sleep, diet, and certain activities. These triggers vary widely from person to person, so it's important to identify the specific things that may trigger your headaches.


What you ate and drank: Record everything you ate and drank on the day of the headache and, if possible, the day before.
What you did on the day of the headache: Record your activities on the day of the headache and/or on the night before. Be sure, of course, to include any unusual activities, but don't leave out the more mundane ones, either.
How much sleep you got: Record what time you went to bed on the night before your headache, and what time you got up. Think also about the quality of the sleep (e.g., whether you woke up several times during the night).
Any medications you took before the headache: Record prescription and non-prescription drugs as well as herbal or nutritional supplements. While you especially want to focus on any unusual intakes, it's also a good idea to write down drugs that you take regularly.
Any stressful or unusual events that occurred in the day or two before the headache: Was there anything causing you excitement, anxiety, or other types of stress? Record these events, and also record how you were feeling, (happy, depressed, angry, etc.), before the headache occurred.

, While your headache diary will hopefully help you to reduce the number of headaches you experience, you may never be able to eliminate headaches altogether. As a result, it's important to assess the effectiveness of any treatments you use.


List any preventative medications you're taking: If you suffer frequent or severe migraine headaches, your doctor may prescribe preventative (also called prophylactic) medications. It can take a lot of trial and error to determine which medicine will work for you, so it's important to keep track of what you're taking, and when.
List any painkillers or abortive medications you took: When you get a headache, you might take either abortive medications (medications that stop the migraine mechanism), painkillers, or both. As with preventative drugs, you need to find out which medications work best for you, so document what you took, when you took it, and how well it seemed to work.
Document any other steps you took to alleviate the pain: There are many steps people can use to try to get rid of headache pain, from lying down in a dark room to drinking a cup of coffee. Record what you did, when you did it, and how well it worked.

,, Even if the headache isn't severe, it deserves an entry. Record all the information as faithfully and thoroughly as possible.

, The more diary entries you have, the more likely you'll be able to find patterns either in the triggers or in the effectiveness of your treatments. That said, you can often accurately identify potential triggers after just two or three headaches.

, If you identify a possible cause of your headache, try to avoid that food, activity, or situation. You'll be able to reference your diary to determine how long you go without a headache and how severe your headaches are, and this information can help you figure out if the trigger you suspect is indeed a culprit.

, Bring the diary to your doctor. Inform the doctor of any patterns you noticed, and then let him or her take a look at the diary, as your doctor may notice things you didn't. Based on your history, including your diary, your doctor may also make changes to your medications or other treatments as needed.

Understand what causes brain freeze.,
Prevent cold food from touching the roof of your mouth.,
Consume cold foods and drinks slowly.,
Take a break from the cold.",How to Stop Brain Freeze2," Surprisingly, scientists still don’t know exactly what causes brain freeze, but recent research has given them some very solid theories. Two mechanisms seem to be at work in your mouth when something extremely cold is unexpectedly introduced. (Remember, your body temperature is around 98.6°F, but the ideal serving temperature for ice cream is around 10°F!)When you quickly consume a very cold substance, it unexpectedly and swiftly changes the temperature in the back of your throat where your internal carotid artery and your anterior cerebral artery meet. This temperature change causes a rapid dilation and constriction of these arteries, and your brain interprets this as pain.When the temperature in your mouth plummets unexpectedly, your body quickly dilates blood vessels in the area to ensure a steady flow of blood (and warmth) to the brain. Your anterior cerebral artery (which is located in the middle of your brain, right behind your eyes) expands to carry this blood into your brain. This sudden expansion of the artery and influx of blood can cause a spike in skull pressure, leading to a headache sensation., Obviously, you're not going to give up cold foods just so that you can avoid brain freeze. Rather, let the bite or sip warm on your tongue before you let the substance touch the roof of your mouth. If you’re eating ice cream, use a spoon and angle it so that the ice cream doesn’t hit the roof of your mouth.Avoid straws when drinking cold beverages if possible. Slurping a milkshake through a straw could be your ticket to brain freeze. If you have to use a straw, angle it away from the roof of your mouth.

, Chugging cold beverages or eating half an ice cream cone in one bite may be fun, but it also makes you much more likely to succumb to brain freeze.One explanation for this is that eating more slowly keeps the cold from overwhelming the blood vessels in your mouth with sudden temperature changes.

, If you feel a brain freeze coming on, or if your mouth feels very cold, take a break from the food or beverage for a minute to allow your palate to warm up again."

Distinguish migraine symptoms from other headaches.,
Visit your doctor for a referral to a neurologist.,
Know the warning signs of an emergency.",How to Treat a Migraine1," Before trying to treat a migraine, you want to be sure you really do have a migraine and not another type of headache. Migraines generally occur as throbbing pain on one side of your head along with nausea or vomiting, and/or noise and light sensitivity, though it is possible to have a migraine and experience no head pain. You may experience forewarning signs an hour or two before the migraine, such as blind spots, auras, flashing lights, weakness, tingling, or even difficulty speaking.They usually last from four to 72 hours and feel worse when you’re being active. Know the basic features of other types of headaches, and consider whether your symptoms seem more like a migraine:Tension headaches feel like a tight band around your head or a weight on your head, often with neck and/or shoulder tension. They occur without throbbing, nausea, or vision changes. They are the most common type of headache, causing mild to moderate pain.

Cluster headaches cause extreme pain usually over one eye, temple, or forehead; pain tends to come on quickly, last five to 60 minutes, then disappears for a time before returning. Sometimes your eye will water or nose will run on the same side as the headache. These are the least common types of headache.;
, If you suffer from frequent or severe headaches, your family doctor can refer you to a specialist called a neurologist. This doctor can diagnose your headaches by doing a physical exam, talking to you about your symptoms, and discussing your family history. This is usually enough to diagnose migraines or other types of headaches. If your headaches are severe or abnormal, they may rarely have you do more testing such as:An MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) or CT (computerized tomography) to rule out tumors, bleeding, or other problems inside your brain
A blood test to check for toxins or infection in your body
A lumbar puncture (or spinal tap) to check the pressure in your skull and rule out other problems

, Even if you get migraines frequently, don’t ignore the warning signs of a more serious problem. Some types of headaches can indicate dangerous medical conditions. See your doctor right away or visit the emergency department if you experience any of these symptoms:A sudden “thunderclap” headaches that feels like the worst headache of your life
Headaches with stiff neck, fever, confusion, seizures, weakness, or difficulty speaking
A headache after you injure your head, especially if it worsens over time
A headache that doesn’t really go away and gets worse if you move quickly, cough, or strain
You develop headaches for the first time after age 50

Take over the counter headache medication.,
Ask your doctor about prescription medication.,
Try acupuncture.,
See a chiropractor.,
Ask your doctor about massage therapy.,
Have your eyes examined.",How to Relieve a Tension Headache1," These include acetaminophen (Tylenol), ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) naproxen sodium (Aleve), and aspirin. Never take more than the amount recommended on the package, and use the lowest dose that relieves your headache.Keep in mind a combination of over the counter (OTC) headache medications and caffeine can cause liver damage if used in high doses or for a long period of time, especially if you also use alcohol or have liver problems.
Talk to your doctor if you take over the counter headache medication for more than a week and are still having tension headaches.
Don't take OTC headache medications for more than a few days a week, and don't take them longer than a week or ten days without consulting your doctor. Overusing pain medications can cause rebound headaches, which occur with long-term use of headache medicines. You can become reliant on the medication and have headaches if you stop taking it.;
, If your tension headaches do not go away with OTC drugs or lifestyle changes, your doctor may prescribe stronger medication. These include naproxen, indomethacin, and piroxicam.These prescription medications can cause side effects such as bleeding and upset stomach and raise your risk of heart problems. Your doctor should tell you about any side effects or complications before prescribing these to you.
If you experience chronic tension headaches and migraines, your doctor may prescribe a triptan to relieve the pain. But opiates and narcotics are rarely prescribed because of their side effects and the risk of addiction or dependency., Acupuncture involves the insertion of fine needles into specific points in your body. The needles are then manually stimulated or stimulated electrically. This increases blood flow to the area around the needles and releases any tension or stress.Studies suggest that it may be helpful to relieve chronic tension headaches.Acupuncture causes very little pain or discomfort and should only be performed by a certified acupuncture specialist. When performed correctly, acupuncture is proven to help reduce tension headaches.Dry-needling is another type of treatment that involves acupuncture needles. However, it is not based on the principles of traditional Chinese medicine, as acupuncture is. It involves inserting acupuncture needles into trigger points to stimulate the muscles to relax, lessening the tension that can cause headaches. It can be performed by healthcare professionals trained in the procedure, such as physical therapists, massage therapists, and doctors., Studies suggest that spinal manipulation therapy performed by a licensed chiropractor may help treat tension headaches, especially if they are chronic.You can find a list of Chiropractic Licensing Boards in several countries at the Federation of Chiropractic Licensing Boards website. Always have treatments performed by a trained, licensed chiropractor.

, Medical massage therapy is a little different than massages given just for relaxation. Targeted massage therapy for the neck and shoulders has been shown to be effective at treating tension headaches and reducing their occurrence.Ask your doctor for a referral for medical massage.


Health insurance companies may not cover massage. However, they are more likely to do so if you have a doctor's referral. Speak with your health insurance provider to determine whether this option is covered.
You can find licensed and certified massage therapists with the directory search provided by the American Massage Therapy Association here.

, Eye strain is a common tension headache trigger. If you have frequent headaches (two or more per week), schedule an eye examination. Difficulty with your vision could be contributing to your headaches.


If you wear glasses or contacts, consider contacting your eye doctor for a new exam. Your vision can change, and if your prescription is no longer what you need you could be straining your eyes.

Consider acupuncture to avoid CTS.",How to Avoid Carpal Tunnel Syndrome," The carpal tunnel protects a variety of blood vessels, tendons and nerves, but the main nerve related to the symptoms of CTS is the median nerve — it allows for most of the movement and sensation in your hand.As such, avoid activities that pinch and/or irritate the nerve, such as repeatedly flexing your wrists, lifting heavy weights and sleeping with your wrists bent.


Keep any watches and bracelets loose around your wrists — keeping them too tight may irritate the median nerve.
CTS is usually caused by a combination of factors, such as repetitive wrist strain combined with arthritis or diabetes, for example.
In addition to throbbing hand pain, numbness and tingling, other symptoms commonly associated with CTS include muscle weakness, loss of dexterity and color changes (too pale or red in the hands).;
, If you work at a high-risk job for CTS, such as a cashier, construction worker or computer programmer, then consider wearing wrist supports, braces or splints while working. These semi-rigid supports can help prevent CTS from developing because they keep the wrist in a neutral position and prevent it from flexing too much.Wearing wrist supports at night while in bed can help relieve or prevent nighttime symptoms of CTS, particularly if you have a habit of clenching your fists or collapsing your wrists in.Wearing wrist splints at night is a good idea if you're pregnant and wanting to avoid CTS, as pregnancy tends to increase swelling in the hands (and feet).
Be aware that wrist supports restrict movement and are not appropriate for some jobs that require lots of dexterity or flexibility of the hands.
Wrist supports, splints and braces can be bought at most pharmacies and medical supply stores.

, Stretching your wrists on a regular basis can be helpful for avoiding or reducing CTS symptoms.Too much repetitive wrist flexing tends to irritate the median nerve, so stretching should focus on extending the wrists to make more space for the nerve within the carpal tunnel. The best way to extend and stretch both your wrists at the same time is by making the ""prayer pose"" with your hands.


Place your palms together directly in front of your chest (fingers pointing up) and raise your elbows until you feel a stretch in both wrists. Hold the pose for about 30 seconds and repeat between three to five times daily.
As an alternative stretch, grab the fingers of one hand and pull back until you feel a stretch in the front of your wrist.After 30 seconds, do the other wrist even if you typically use just one hand while at work.
Remember that stretching the tight ligament and tendons of your wrist may temporarily trigger some numbness and tingling in your hand, but don't stop unless you actually feel pain.

, Strengthening the muscles around your wrist and forearms will avoid any additional stresses on the nerve. Strengthening exercises can be performed once pain has considerably been reduced.

First, start with isometric exercises. Keep your wrist in a neutral position with your palm down, and place your other hand on top of your wrist. Keep fist slightly closed and try extending your wrist back, while at the same time providing just enough resistance with your other hand to keep your wrist from moving. Hold position for 10 seconds and repeat five to 10 times.You can perform this exercise 3 times per week.You can now position your hand so that your palm is facing up, with your hand in a comfortable closed position. Place other hand on top of the closed hand and try flexing your wrist, while applying just enough resistance with the other hand so that your wrist is not moving. Hold this position for 10 seconds and repeat five times.Isotonic exercises refer to the use of weights. You can use a light weight or an elastic resistance band to perform these exercises. Hold the light weight in your hand with your palm facing up. Lightly clench the weight and flex your wrist. Perform this five to 10 times. Rest and repeat again for another two to three sets. Once finished, you can flip the wrist over 180 degrees so the palm faces down. Lightly clench the weight and extend your wrist. Perform this five to 10 times. Rest and repeat again for another two to three sets.
You can perform these exercises two to three times per week.

, Some sleeping postures put you more at risk for CTS than others.For example, sleeping with your fists clenched tightly or your hands tucked into your body (with wrists flexed) are the worst postures for triggering CTS symptoms. Instead, sleep on your back or on either side with your arms against your body, hands open and wrists in a neutral position. Training yourself to sleep like this will promote normal blood circulation and nerve flow and help you to avoid CTS.


Don't sleep on your stomach with your hands / wrists contorted under your pillow either. You might wake up with numb hands and a stiff neck.
Wearing wrist supports at night is a good idea, but most are made of nylon and fasten with velcro, which can irritate skin. Thus, cover your support with some soft material — cut the ends off an old pair of socks and slide it over your wrist support.
Your wrist anatomy makes a difference — people with naturally smaller carpal tunnels or oddly shaped carpal bones are at higher risk of CTS.

, CTS symptoms can also be triggered by a poorly designed work station that doesn't suit your body size and dimensions (ergonomics). If your keyboard, mouse, desk or chair isn't properly positioned, it can put strain on your wrists, as well as your shoulders, neck and mid back. As such, make sure your keyboard is positioned so your wrists are in a neutral position while typing, and not too flexed or extended.Consider getting an ""ergonomic"" keyboard and mouse, which are designed to reduce stress on your wrists and hands and prevent CTS.
Put cushioned pads underneath your keyboard and mouse to reduce the impact on your hands and wrists.
Make sure that any hand tools you use are the right size for you. The size and shape of the tool should allow you to grip it comfortably.
The majority of CTS cases occur among people who do repetitive hand activities at work.

, Repetitive strains to the ligaments and tendons of the wrist is often the primary cause of CTS. Strained ligaments and tendons eventually lead to pain, inflammation and nerve irritation. Before your wrists become symptomatic, get regular deep tissue massage as it can reduce tightness, combat inflammation and promote relaxation.Start with a 30 minute massage, focusing on your hands, wrists and forearms. Allow the therapist to go as deep as you can tolerate it without wincing.


If a 30-minute session isn't enough therapy for both wrists, then get 1 hour massages.
For CTS prevention, consider massage therapy on a monthly basis, although some people may benefit from more frequent visits.
Always drink lots of purified water immediately after a massage in order to flush out inflammatory by-products and lactic acid from your body. Failure to do so might cause a short-term headache or mild nausea.

, Chiropractors are not just spinal specialists, they also diagnose and treat problems in peripheral joints, such as those of the wrist and arm. In some cases, CTS is caused by entrapped or pinched nerves near the elbow or base of the neck.The nerves can get irritated from bones and joints that are slightly out of position. Chiropractors can diagnose and treat such issues before they lead to symptomatic CTS. The type of treatment usually given is called manual joint manipulation or an adjustment, which creates a ""popping"" sound.


Chiropractic adjustments unjam or reposition joints and bones that are slightly misaligned, so they don't generate pain or irritate nearby nerves.
Although a single adjustment can sometimes completely fix a joint / nerve issue, more than likely it will take 3-5 treatments.
Your chiropractor may be able to provide you with a wrist support or ergonomic advice on how to avoid CPS.

, Acupuncture involves sticking very thin needles into specific points within the skin in efforts to reduce pain and inflammation, as well as improve nerve and blood flow.Acupuncture treatments for avoiding or preventing CTS is not well established by research, but some people claim its effective. If your budget allows for, acupuncture is likely worth a try because its so safe with no serious side effects.


If acupuncture interests you, consider giving it at least 3 treatments before judging its effectiveness. Each treatment typically lasts from 15 to 30 minutes.
Acupuncture points that may prevent or relieve CTS symptoms are not all located near the wrist or hand — some can be in distant areas of the body.
Acupuncture is practiced by a variety of health professionals including some physicians, chiropractors, naturopaths, physical therapists and massage therapists — whoever you choose should be certified by NCCAOM.

Anxiety, stress (emotional, mental, or physical), changes in sleep patterns, activity levels, and even changes in weather can all trigger migraines. Some people experience only one trigger, while others can have several before developing a migraine.Usually, your migraine triggers will remain the same over time, so once you identify them you can avoid them or learn to cope.;
, Write down everything you eat and drink, what the weather is like, what physical activities you do, how well you slept, if you're stressed, and if you're menstruating. Do this until you can see a pattern emerge about what triggers your migraines. If you get them, be sure to write down any warning signs (known as auras) that come before you get a migraine.Track this information for as long as you like or until you've had several migraines. This way, you'll be able to use the information from the days leading up to the migraines to determine your triggers.

, Warning signs (auras) are what you experience right before you get a migraine. It can help to write these in your daily journal. Auras can be visual (like flashes of light or blind spots), auditory (like ringing in your ears), or physical (like tingling in the arms or legs). You may also have problems speaking.Some people get warning signs in the days before getting a migraine. These prodromes are unique and might include constipation, food cravings, irritability, frequent uncontrolled yawning, hyperactivity, depression and stiffness or discomfort in the neck.

, Unfortunately, you may have a migraine trigger that you can't avoid or control. For example, you can't change the weather, but if you know your migraines are triggered by weather changes, you can prepare for them by making certain no other triggers are around when that weather changes from dry and warm to cold and rainy. Focus on avoiding the triggers you can control and learn to cope with the triggers you can't avoid.


When you know you can't avoid a trigger try to cope by spending some time relaxing in a dimly lit room, putting an ice pack on your neck or head, and massaging your head.

, If you suspect a particular food is triggering your migraines, check your journal. If you developed a migraine within 24 hours of eating the food and you notice that that food triggers migraines more than half of the time you eat it, then it is a trigger. Try to avoid eating trigger foods. Common trigger foods include:Foods with nitrates: processed foods, cured meats, deli meat
Foods with monosodium glutamate (MSG): Chinese food, soy sauce, food seasonings
Alcohol: especially wine and champagne
Caffeine: coffee, soft drinks, energy drinks
Foods with food additives and artificial sweeteners

, If your trigger is a medication you're taking, continue to take it until you can talk to your doctor. Your doctor may be able to prescribe an alternative medication or lower dosage. If your migraines are triggered by hormonal shifts, your doctor may be able to give some advice particular to your situation (especially if you're pregnant, have an irregular period, or have had a hysterectomy).If you get infrequent migraines (less than 9 a month), try taking an over-the-counter pain reliever designed for migraines at the first sign of a trigger., Unfortunately, most people who are sensitive to light triggers react most strongly to sunlight. If you find that going from dim, interior lights to bright outdoor sun triggers a migraine, try putting on sunglasses before going out. Filtered or fluorescent lights can also trigger migraines. You may want to switch to incandescent bulbs or use curtains instead of blinds.If the flickering light of an older computer triggers your migraines, wrap the screen with an anti-glare screen.

, Noise is another sensory stimulus that triggers migraines. The noise can be very loud or just repetitive. Use your journal to determine if specific noises or situations trigger your migraines. For example, listening to music through headphones or listening to the music while you're on hold during a phone call could trigger your migraines. Cope with noise triggers by going somewhere quiet.If you can't go somewhere quiet to get away from the noise, always carry earplugs with you so you can at least try to mute the noise until you can get away from it.

, Sleep is a well-known trigger for migraines and headaches. To reduce your risk for migraines, get 7 to 8 hours of sleep every night. But, try not to oversleep or sleep in quick short shifts since these could increase the severity of your headaches. It may take up to 4 weeks of regular sleep before you notice a reduction in migraines.People with migraines are 2 to 8 times more likely to develop sleep disorders than people who don't get migraines.

, Being dehydrated can easily trigger migraines. This is because your blood volume drops causing less blood and oxygen to be delivered to your brain. Your brain might even be more sensitive to pain. Men should drink 13 cups of liquid a day and women should drink 9 cups. You can drink water, juice, or tea. Caffeine and alcohol do not count towards your daily intake.Pay special attention to drinking enough water during the summer. Research shows that migraine risk increases by 8% for every 9 degree increase in temperature.

, The neurons in the brains of people who get migraines are more sensitive and easily excited. When you smoke tobacco, these neurons can become hyper-excited which triggers your migraine. Research has shown that smoking more than five cigarettes a day can trigger a migraine.Ask your doctor about cessation programs. Your doctor may be able to prescribe a medication or offer an effective strategy to help you quit.

, Some people experience weekend headaches or tend to get their migraines only after the work week. This may be because your weekly routine of sleeping, eating, and consuming caffeine may be very different on your days off. Since what you eat, drink, and how much you sleep can all trigger migraines, try to keep to your schedule even on your days off.This doesn't mean that you can't enjoy your weekend. For example, just because you wake up at 6am doesn't mean you have to wake up at 6am on the weekends too. You should just avoid large differences in routine (like waking up around noon).

, Since stress and anxiety can trigger your migraine, teach your body how to respond to stress. Try a relaxation method like deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or visualization as a form of meditation. Coping with anxiety can prevent or treat your migraine.Choose a place that's comfortable and where you won't be interrupted. Make sure you can feel relaxed and close your eyes. Remember a favorite place of yours and try to picture it in your mind. Breathe deeply as you consider the details of that place and feel yourself relax.

Prevent low blood sugar.,
Avoid foods with tyramine and nitrites.,
Be aware of food allergies.,
Stay hydrated.,
Avoid certain types of lights.,
Limit your exposure to intense stimuli.,
Reduce your exposure to loud noise when possible.,
Notice weather changes.",How to Prevent Migraines1," Low blood sugar, also known as hypoglycemia, can cause migraines. It is brought on by lack of nutrients or by eating too many refined carbohydrates, which turn to sugar in the blood. Small frequent meals are important if you want to control your blood sugar. Do not skip any meal throughout the day. Avoid refined carbohydrates like sugar and white bread. Whole grain breads should be fine.


For each of your small meals, choose options such as fresh fruits and vegetables with a protein like an egg or lean meats. This will help you keep your blood sugar steady throughout the day.;
, Tyramine is a substance that can release a chemical in your brain called norepinephrine, which can lead to headaches. There are many common foods containing tyramine or nitrites. Foods such as eggplant, potatoes, sausage, bacon, ham, spinach, sugar, aged cheese, beer, and red wine contain these compounds.


Other tyramine-containing foods include chocolate, fried food, bananas, plums, broad beans, tomatoes, and citrus fruit.
Foods with high levels of seasoning such as MSG or artificial additives might also contribute to triggering a migraine.
Soy products, particularly fermented ones, can contain high tyramine levels. Tofu, soy sauce, teriyaki sauce, and miso are examples of such soy products. , An allergy to a certain type of food can trigger a migraine in susceptible people. This is caused by the inflammation that happens with an allergic reaction. Try to avoid all foods that you are allergic to as well as those you think you might be allergic to.


If you find yourself with a migraine, list what foods you have had throughout the day. This way, you can keep track and start to pinpoint which foods are causing your allergies. You can also get allergy tested by your doctor.
Common food allergies include wheat, nuts, dairy, and certain grains.If you have established which foods seem to trigger your migraines, eliminate them from your diet. If you aren't sure, go without the food for a period of time to see how you feel and respond. Alternatively, you could ask your doctor about testing for food allergies.
Be aware that not everyone will have the same food triggers or responses. A food that triggers a migraine in someone else may not do the same for you.

, One of the major triggers of migraines is dehydration. Since the body needs so much water a day, the body responds to a lack of water by causing pain and discomfort. It causes other symptoms such as fatigue, muscle weakness, and dizziness.The best source of hydration is plain water. Other beverages that are low in (or free of) sugar or artificial sweeteners and caffeine-free can also help you stay hydrated.

, When trying to prevent migraines, you should avoid bright light. Certain colors of light can also trigger migraines in some people. This sensitivity is called photophobia. It happens when the light increases your headache pain. Nerve cells inside the eye called neurons are activated with bright light. When this happens, it can take 20-30 minutes of darkness to start to relieve the pain because the neurons are still active., Since bright or flashing lights can sometimes lead to migraines, you should wear sunglasses on sunny days or even bright winter days. The glare from snow, water, or buildings can trigger a migraine response. Sunglasses should contain good quality lenses with side panels if possible. Some migraine sufferers find that tinted lenses are helpful.Rest your eyes periodically when watching TV or using your computer. Adjust the brightness and contrast levels on computer screens and TV screens. If you're using a screen that reflects, decrease the reflection with filters, or by drawing blinds and curtains when the sun is shining.
Non-visual stimuli, such as strong scents, can also cause migraines in some people. Once you've been exposed to a certain scent that seems to trigger a migraine, try to avoid that scent., Migraines can be triggered by loud noises, especially when they are continuous. The reason for this is unclear, but some scientists think that migraine sufferers may not be able to suppress loud noises. Others suggests that the inner ear channel may be the cause., Changes in the weather or climate, which is linked to the barometric pressure, can trigger a migraine. A dry atmosphere or a warm, dry wind can have an effect on your body that causes a headache. This happens because of the imbalance of chemicals in your body due to the pressure change. "

Take your medication as early as possible.,
Try over-the-counter pain relievers.,
Get a prescription for indomethacin.,
Try prescription triptan medications.,
Try ergot medications.,
Treat your nausea.,
Ask your doctor about opioids or steroids as your last option.",How to Treat a Migraine2," As soon as you recognize you are having a migraine, take your medication.Lie down in a dark room after you take your medicine to potentially improve your migraine symptoms more.

, If your migraine is mild try aspirin, or ibuprofen products like Advil or Motrin; for some people, acetaminophen (Tylenol) helps, as well. For moderate migraine pain, try an OTC medication marketed for migraine headaches, such as Excedrin Migraine which contains aspirin, acetaminophen, and a small amount of caffeine.Talk to your doctor before taking any medications. Long-term or overuse of some OTC pain medicines (non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, or NSAIDs) can cause stomach bleeding, ulcers, and other problems.
Always follow the dosing instructions on the packaging.

, Indomethacin (Indocin or Tivorbex) is an NSAID like aspirin and ibuprofen; however, it is available in suppository form (instead of swallowing a pill, you place it in your rectum). This may be helpful if you experience severe nausea or vomiting when you have a migraine. See your doctor and ask about getting a prescription., Triptans like sumatriptan (Imitrex) and zolmitriptan (Zomig) are by prescription to take when you have a migraine. Triptans help migraine pain by blocking pain pathways in the brain and constricting blood vessels, and can be taken as a pill, nose spray, or injection.Your doctor can prescribe these medications if you have severe or frequent migraines.


You shouldn’t take triptans if you’ve had a heart attack or stroke.Taking triptans and SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) or SNRIs (serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors) together may cause a serious medical problem called serotonin syndrome.If you take an antidepressant like Zoloft or Cymbalta, talk to your doctor about taking triptans. It’s possible to take the two together if you know what symptoms to look out for, but your doctor may want to prescribe you something different.
The medication Treximet combines two different pain relievers called sumatriptan and Naproxen, and seems to be very effective., Also by prescription, ergot medications seem to be somewhat less effective than triptans, but are good if your migraines last over 2 days.Ergotamine is the usual choice, though it can worsen nausea for some people. It’s usually combined with some caffeine, like in the medicines Migergot and Cafergot. Migranal is a similar medicine with fewer side effects available as a nasal spray or injection.Take your ergot medication as soon as possible after your migraine symptoms start to improve its efficacy.

, Ask your doctor about anti-nausea medications if nausea and vomiting are frequent migraine symptoms for you. Chlorpromazine, metoclopramide (Reglan), and prochlorperazine are often prescribed., Opioid medications are sometimes used to treat severely painful migraines, but because they contain narcotics they can be dangerously habit-forming and are only used if nothing else works. Your doctor might give you glucocorticoids like prednisone or dexamethasone in combination with other medication to improve pain relief, but these aren’t good to use often because of the side effects.Opioids are prescribed as little as possible because they can be addictive or easily abused, and you have to slowly wean off of them. Steroid medicines also must be stopped gradually, not all at once.

You may also experience blind spots, tingling on one side of your face, arm, or leg, weakness, or difficulty speaking.If you recognize a migraine early, you can try to prevent it from worsening or alleviate symptoms.


Some people even experience what’s called a “prodrome” phase up to a day or two before the headache. This might be a change in mood (sadder or happier than usual), food cravings, constipation, yawning a lot, stiff neck, or more frequent urination and increased thirst., Bright lights, strong scents, and loud noises often worsen migraine symptoms.When you first recognize signs that you may have a migraine approaching, shut off as much sensory stimuli as possible. Lie down in a quiet, dark room and rest.

, Stress and muscle tension can worsen migraines, and being stressed a lot is a possible trigger for migraines.Use relaxation techniques on a regular basis to reduce your stress level and during your migraine to ease discomfort. Try meditation or deep breathing exercises during your headache, while resting in a dark place. Regularly practice mindfulness, go for walks in nature, listen to music – whatever helps you relax.

, Put an ice pack or cold compress on your neck or head to help numb the pain. If you don’t own an ice pack, fill a plastic baggie with ice and wrap it in a thin towel; this helps prevent damage to your skin from having ice directly on it. You can also try a heating pad, which can relax tense muscles and possibly alleviate migraine pain., The effect massage has on muscle tension and stress may help reduce the frequency you get migraines.More studies are needed to prove its efficacy, but some people have found relief through massage therapy. If you can't get a professional massage, try some self-massage. Use light pressure with your fingertips to massage in gentle circles or a back-and-forth motion on your temples and scalp; don't let your fingers slide over your skin, try to rub the muscles underneath., Biofeedback may be effective in decreasing the pain of migraines. A professional uses specialized equipment during this relaxation exercise to teach you to recognize and control some physiological responses your body has to stress.Learning to recognize stressors that trigger migraines can be help you avoid or change these situations. If your migraine has a slow onset, you may be able to use biofeedback to avoid a full attack., Cognitive behavioral therapy, or CBT, is a psychiatric tool that teaches you how to change your patterns of thinking and behavior.A professional therapist can work with you to learn CBT. It works similarly to biofeedback, except using mental processes rather than physical. CBT may help alleviate or prevent migraine symptoms., Studies have shown that acupuncture may be a helpful therapy in treating migraines.A professional will insert small needles into your skin at special points with the goal of minimizing pain. Consider trying a session if you hope to treat your migraines naturally.

, Some studies show that feverfew might reduce the severity of migraines or help prevent them, though this isn’t scientifically proven.Feverfew may be available as capsules containing dried leaves of the herb at a pharmacy or health food store.Ask your doctor before using herbal remedies. Do not take feverfew if you are pregnant or breastfeeding, and do not give it to children under 2 years old."

Minimize your alcohol intake.,
Avoid drinking lots of caffeine.,
Set a regular sleep schedule.,
Ask your doctor about your birth control pills and heart medicine.,
Keep a headache journal.",How to Treat a Migraine4," Fasting or skipping a meal can trigger a migraine in some people. Aged cheese and salty and processed food may also be triggers. Decrease salt in your diet by avoiding potato chips and other snack aisle foods, and seasoning your meals with spices and herbs instead of table salt. Avoid frozen and pre-packaged meals, as well as fast food.Food additives, like aspartame (an artificial sweetener) and MSG in various foods, can trigger migraines in some people.Avoid these products by using natural sweeteners and asking restaurants if they use MSG – request your meal be MSG-free!
Nitrates are also a common trigger, and can be found in processed meats like pepperoni, hot dogs, and lunch meat., Drinking alcohol, especially wine, can trigger migraines.Stop drinking alcohol or limit your intake to moderate amounts – 1 glass a day for women and men over 65, and 2 glasses a day for men under 65 is considered “moderate.”, Highly caffeinated beverages like espresso drinks and energy drinks may trigger migraines due to the “caffeine crash” a few hours later.A sudden drop in caffeine level is potentially a migraine trigger. If possible, drink tea instead of coffee, and try to keep your caffeine to a minimum to avoid the crash.


If you drink a lot of caffeine now, don’t stop all at once – that can cause headaches and other withdrawal effects. Taper down. For instance, if you currently drink 2 cups of coffee a day, drink 1 cup for a week or two, then drink half-caff (half regular, half decaf).

, For some people, migraines are triggered when they change their sleep habits and get too little, or even too much, sleep. If you’re prone to migraines, set a regular bedtime and wake time for yourself so you get approximately 8 hours of sleep nightly.Jet lag can also be a trigger. If you are travelling into a very different time zone, try to minimize the disruption to your sleep schedule as much as possible.

, Vasodilator medications like nitroglycerin can make migraines worse, as can oral contraceptive pills.Of course, these medications are important, so do not just stop taking them if you have migraines. Talk to your doctor, and they may be able to switch your medication to something different that is less likely to worsen migraines.

, It can be difficult to determine your triggers unless you pay careful attention and write things down. Keep a journal, and when you have a headache note what you did that day, what you ate in the last 12 hours, and any other stimuli you encountered (someone’s strong perfume, only getting five hours of sleep, etc.). This may help you recognize patterns so you can avoid triggers in the future.

Eat lots of dark green vegetables such as broccoli, spinach, and kale. You can also eat eggs, yogurt, and low-fat milk to gain healthy proteins. These foods contain vitamin B which helps prevent migraines.


Eat foods rich in magnesium. Magnesium relaxes blood vessels and ensures proper cell function. Magnesium-rich foods include nuts such as almonds and cashews, whole grains, wheat germ, soybeans, avocados, yogurt, dark chocolate, and green leafy vegetables.Oily fish may help prevent migraines. Consume oily fish such as salmon, tuna, sardines, or anchovies three times a week to increase your omega-3 and fatty acids intake., Tobacco use is known to trigger migraines. If you feel that you cannot quit on your own, talk to your physician about strategies or medications that can help you quit. One study has shown that smoking more than 5 cigarettes per day is more likely to trigger migraines. If you are unable to quit, limiting yourself to fewer than 5 each day might have some benefit., Caffeine is something that affects people in different ways. Some people find that caffeine triggers their migraines, while others are helped by caffeine. If you regularly use caffeine and suspect it may be causing migraines, try to cut back a little at a time. Sudden caffeine withdrawal can precipitate migraines, so be aware of that and wean yourself off of caffeine slowly.Caffeine is the prime ingredient in some migraine relief medications, so it is known to help. If you are an everyday caffeine drinker, caffeine may not help you because your body may have already built up a tolerance.
Include caffeine containing food and beverage in your migraine diary and elimination trials to see the effects in your own case.

, A disturbed sleep routine reduces your energy and tolerance to certain stimuli. Lack of sleep and insomnia increases the chances of a migraine. Too much sleep can also cause a migraine. If your body is not getting adequate rest, then headaches happen because of the lack of a regular sleep pattern.Migraines may also happen when you get more sleep than usual, change your working shifts, or suffer from jet lag.

, For many migraine sufferers, alcohol can trigger headaches, nausea, and other migraine symptoms that last for days. There is a lot of tyramine, a trigger ingredient, in alcohol, especially in beer and red wine. Make use of your headache diary to determine your threshold.


Some migraine sufferers find that alcohol doesn't affect them at all, while others can't tolerate even a little bit., Migraines tend to worsen with stress because of muscle tension and increased dilation of blood vessels. Managing stress through the use of relaxation techniques, positive thinking, and time management can help ward off migraines.

Evaluate your hormonal medications.,
Take preventative medications.,
Take non-prescription supplements.",How to Prevent Migraines3," Many women who suffer from migraines find that they are more likely to develop migraine headaches and nausea before or during menstruation.

If pre-period migraines are a problem for you, you might need to avoid or change the way you use oral contraceptives with estrogen in them because the drop in estrogen may be worse when taking them, creating worse headaches.


High-estrogen birth control products and hormone replacement therapy may worsen the problem for many women. It may be best to avoid these medications. If you're already taking them and notice an increase in the severity or frequency of migraines, talk to your doctor about discontinuing use.Be aware that the solution may not be as simple as removing oral contraceptives from your routine. Some women find that they help reduce the occurrences of migraines. Others find that migraines are triggered only when they are off of the active pills for a week each month. You can change to a different type of pill to help or you may take the active pills continuously without a break. Talk to your doctor about possible solutions to these problems., If you suffer from frequent or severe migraines, ask your doctor about preventative medications. These medications, also known as prophylactic medications, are available only by prescription. Many have possible serious side effects, so they should only be used under a doctor's supervision and only after discussing all the other preventive possibilities. Because of the number of medications available and the uniqueness of every migraine case, finding the right preventative combination can take a while.Cardiovascular medications, including beta blockers such as propranolol and atenolol, calcium channel blockers such as verapamil, and anti-hypertension medications such as lisinopril and candesartan, can be taken to help with migraines.
Anti-seizure medications such as valproic acid and topiramate can help with migraines. Be aware that valproic acid can cause brain damage if the migraines are due to a urea cycle disorder.
Antidepressants including tricyclic, amitriptyline, and fluoxetine have proven effective in many migraine cases. These medications in their normal doses may have significant unwanted side effects, but newer tricyclics such as nortriptyline used in a low dose to treat migraines have far more limited side effects.
Cannabis is a traditional migraine remedy that has recently sparked renewed scientific interest. It's illegal in many jurisdictions, but is legal or available by prescription in others. Find out the laws in your area and speak to your doctor., Prescription drugs aren't the only remedies that have been shown to help migraines. Certain herbs and minerals also help with migraines. Researchers have found fairly strong correlations between magnesium deficiency and the onset of migraines. Some studies have found that regularly taking magnesium supplements may help migraine sufferers.


Keep in mind that you should always consult with your physician before taking any herbal or nutritional supplements, especially if taken in conjunction with prescription medications. Several herbal supplements have been purported to reduce migraine frequency. Extracts of the feverfew and butterbur plants and kudzu root could possibly help. These supplements should not be taken by women who are pregnant.Fairly high doses (400mg) of vitamin B2, also known as riboflavin, may help prevent migraines. Metabolic and hepatology studies also show that coenzyme or active B-6 assists with liver amino acid metabolism, glucose metabolism, and neurological transmissions. Active B-6 helps keep the chemicals like serotonin in balance in the brain. This helps you avoid a chemical imbalance, which can trigger migraines."

Talk to your doctor about your headaches.,
Learn what a migraine is.,
Know if you are at risk.,
Recognize the prodrome phase.,
Identify characteristics of the aura phase.,
Understand the active headache phase.,
Understand the resolution phase.",How to Prevent Migraines4," If you have never been officially diagnosed as having migraines, it is very important to speak with your doctor about your headaches. Severe chronic headaches can also be signs of more serious ailments such as brain tumors. Your physician should rule out other potential headache causes before you start treating symptoms of migraines yourself.


A doctor can also prescribe medications and alternative treatments for migraines.

, A migraine is a headache that starts dull and becomes increasingly worse. It can range from minutes to days. The pain is described as a pounding, pulsating, throbbing headache. It may travel to one side of the head, to the back of the neck or head, or behind one eye. It may be accompanied with increased urination, chills, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, numbness, weakness, tingling, no appetite, sweating, and sensitivity to light and sound.


After the migraine subsides, a clouded thought pattern may happen as well as the need to sleep and neck pain., There are certain types of people who are more prone to getting migraines. Migraines are most common in people between the ages of 10-40 years old. Once you hit 50, migraines tend to lessen. Migraines seem to run in families. If one parent has migraines, a child has a 50% chance of having migraines. If both parents suffer from them, a child has a 75% chance of having them.Women are 3 times more likely to have a migraine than men. This may be due to a connection between estrogen levels and migraines. Women who are going to have a period soon often have headaches because of the drop of estrogen., There are phases associated with certain parts of migraines. The prodrome phase is the first phase. It can begin up to 24 hours before the migraine actually begins. This happens in up to 60% of sufferers. Taking special care to relax and to avoid potential triggers when you notice these signs may prevent an impending migraine or lessen its severity. It's also important to try to keep a positive attitude if you notice these symptoms, as experiencing stress or anxiety can speed up or worsen the migraine.


Mood changes, including depression, euphoria, and irritability, can be an early sign of a migraine.
You may also suffer from increased thirst or fluid retention. Many migraine sufferers notice an increased thirst before a bad headache starts. You can also have a marked increase or decrease in appetite.
You can experience fatigue, restlessness, difficulty communicating or understanding people, difficulty in talking, stiffness in the neck, dizziness, weakness in an arm or leg, or lightheadedness that leads to the loss of balance. If these symptoms are new to you or more severe than usual, call your doctor right away.

, The aura phase follows the prodrome phase. Only about 15% of sufferers experience this. During the phase, a headache will most likely start. Those who have auras complain of seeing spots or flashing lights and a loss of vision. They can last for 5 minutes up to an hour before the migraine begins.The aura may also manifest itself as tingling or numbing sensations in the skin. You can also experience auditory disturbances.
A rare form of migraine aura called ""Alice in Wonderland Syndrome"" involves an altered perception of one's body or surroundings. This type of aura is most often seen in children, but is sometimes seen in adult migraine patients as well., The headache phase is next and is the worst for most patients. The headache usually begins in a pinpoint spot of the head and can move to another part of the head. Patients complain of a throbbing, pulsating headache. Moving around will often make the headache worse. Other factors such as light and noise can make it worse as well.


Patients often cannot carry on a conversation because of the pain in their head.Diarrhea, nausea, or even vomiting can accompany the headache phase., The last phase of a migraine is the resolution phase. It is the phase where your body recovers from the trauma of the migraine. Many patients complain of pure exhaustion after a migraine episode. Some suffer from irritability and mood shifts soon after the headache phase is over."

Use breathing exercises.",How to Get Rid of a Headache1," This includes: tension headaches, stress headaches, chronic daily headaches, (in that case, you most likely know what to do) chronic, non-progressive headaches, and many others. Knowing this can help you find out the best way to treat your headache.;
, Most painkillers won't kick in for about 1-2 hours, so take a dose as soon as you start feeling the headache coming on.Earlier treatment is always better to address a headache. Even if you're already in the depths of misery, a quick dose of ibuprofen, acetaminophen, naproxen, aspirin or even a capsaicin nasal spray can take the edge off.


Be careful not to take medications daily unless you’re told to by your doctor. Everyday use of even over-the-counter medications can be linked to Medication Overuse Syndrome, where a person takes medication they don’t actually need because they’re afraid of future headaches.This misuse can actually cause frequent, recurrent headaches called “rebound headaches”.
If you frequently take headache medication 3+ times a week, see a doctor. The more medication is used for treatment, the more tolerant of that medication a patient may become. This can lead to side effects such as a lower pain tolerance and increased occurrence of ""rebound headaches.""
The treatment for “rebound headaches” is to reduce or stop taking the pain medication. Speak with a doctor to figure out how to effectively manage your medication.

, If your headache includes other symptoms, it may be a sign of a more severe condition, such as stroke, encephalitis, or meningitis. See a doctor immediately or call the emergency services if your headache also includes:Trouble seeing, walking, or talking
Stiff neck
Nausea and/or vomiting
High fever (102-104F)
Fainting
Difficulty using one side of your body
Feelings of extreme weakness, numbness, or paralysis
Also see a doctor if you have frequent or severe headaches, your medication doesn't work, or you can't function normally.

, Though caffeine (which is included in some OTC pain relievers) can initially help a headache, it can also lead to more headaches over time by developing or worsening a caffeine dependence. During headache attacks, adenosine is elevated in the bloodstream. Caffeine helps by blocking adenosine receptors.


Limit caffeine treatment of headaches to no more than twice a week. More often than this and your body can become dependent on caffeine, especially among migraine sufferers. If you're a heavy caffeine drinker (more than 200 milligrams per day, or about 2 cups of coffee) and you suddenly take it out of your diet, headaches are a common side-effect.This is because daily use of caffeine dilates the blood vessels in your brain. When caffeine is withdrawn, these blood vessels constrict, causing headaches. Learn how to slowly and effectively overcome caffeine withdrawal if you consume too much caffeine and think this might be contributing to your headaches.
If you have frequent headaches, it’s ideal to avoid all caffeine whenever possible.

, Dehydration can lead to a headache, especially if you've vomited recently or you're hungover.Drink a tall glass of water as soon as your head starts to hurt, and try to continue drinking small sips throughout the day. You may gradually feel the pain start to ease.


For men, drink at least 13 cups (3 liters) of water a day. For women, drink at least 9 cups (2.2 liters) of water a day. You should drink more if you exercise frequently, live in a hot or humid environment, have an illness that causes vomiting or diarrhea, or are breastfeeding.Another way to calculate your daily water needs is by weight; every day, you should try to drink between 0.5 and 1 ounce of water for every pound that you weigh.Don’t drink water that’s too cold if you already have a headache. Extremely cold or iced water can trigger migraines in some people, especially if they’re already prone to migraine headaches.Room-temperature water is a better option.

, If you can, try to lie down and relax for at least 30 minutes. Shut the blinds, turn off the lights, and focus on your breathing.This sensory reduction can help you relax and heal.


Request absolute peace and quiet. If you're forced to rest around other people, explain that you have a headache and ask that they please try to be quiet and leave you undisturbed. Pre-emptively asking for cooperation can help you avoid an ugly interruption later. If you'd like, get some sleep or take a short nap.
Make sure your bed or couch is comfortable and that your head is supported in a position that doesn't increase the tension to your neck. If one side of your neck is stretched and the other is cramped, adjust your position so that your head and neck are evenly supported.
Adjust the lighting. Avoid bright, unnatural light, as light makes headaches worse -- even for blind people.You can also wear an eye mask to block out light.
Adjust the room temperature. Some people can only relax in a cool room, while others prefer a large blanket or a space heater. Try to create whatever conditions work best for you when you go to sleep at night.

, Progressive muscle relaxation can help ease headache pain.Other exercises focused on relaxation, such as gentle yoga or meditation, can also help.


Lie down in a comfortable position. Close your eyes and breathe deeply.
Beginning at your forehead, tense all the muscles in a specific group for five seconds.
Relax the muscles and focus on the feeling of release that you experience in your muscles.
Move to the next group of muscles. Muscle groups to tense and relax include: forehead, eyes and nose, lips-cheeks-jaw, hands, arms, shoulders, back, stomach, hips and buttocks, thighs, feet and toes.

, Placing something soft and cool over your forehead and eyes can help the blood vessels constrict, which will reduce inflammation and may ease your headache pain.This works particularly well if the problem is concentrated in your temples or sinuses.


Wet a washcloth with cool water, and lay it over your forehead. Refresh it with more cold water as soon as it starts to feel uncomfortably warm.
Prep a heavy-hitting compress. Put a wet washcloth in a resealable plastic sandwich bag, and place the bag in the freezer for 30 minutes. Remove it and place on your forehead for a long-lasting compress — the washcloth will be extra cold, and the bag will keep the icy wetness off of your skin.If your headache is a tension headache, such as one caused by stress, anxiety, or sore muscles, a hot shower or warm compress may help relieve the pain more effectively than a cold compress., Particularly if you suffer from tension headaches, massage can help improve circulation and relieve tension, which will help relieve the pain of your headache. Tension headaches can be caused by a variety of things, from poor posture to jaw clenching to strained muscles. Anxiety and depression may also trigger tension headaches.Place your thumbs on your temples (the soft spot between your upper ear and the corner of your eye). Keeping your thumbs on your temples, use very firm pressure and move your fingers in small, circular motions from your temple to the center of your forehead.Gently massaging the bridge of your nose can help relieve sinus and migraine headaches.
Do a scalp massage. Hop in a hot shower and treat yourself to a long scalp massage as you shampoo your hair. Or, for a dryer version, pour a little bit of coconut or argan oil on your fingers and rub into your scalp.

, Tension in your neck and shoulders can cause headaches.Fortunately, although tension headaches are the most common type of headache they’re also one of the easier headaches to treat.


To massage your neck and shoulders, sit and place your hands on your shoulders with your fingers pointed toward your shoulder blades.
Exhale and relax your neck, letting your head fall backward. Squeeze your fingers to apply pressure on your shoulder muscles. Move your fingers in small, deep circular movements toward the base of your skull.
Interlace your fingers behind your head. Allow your head to drop forward, letting the weight of your arms gently stretch the muscles of your neck and shoulders.
Find two tennis or racquet balls and put them in a sock. Lie on a flat surface and place the two balls just below the base of your skull and relax. You may feel sinus pressure or minimal discomfort at first but it will go away. This is especially helpful for sinus headaches.

, Stretching and strengthening your neck muscles can help relieve chronic headaches,but they may help in the moment as well. Here is a simple routine to stretch your neck muscles:Slowly lower your chin to your chest without moving your shoulders. You should feel the stretch in the back of your neck. Return your head to the upright position.
Slowly twist your head to one side. Hold for 15-30 seconds. Return to facing forward, then repeat, looking the other direction. Return to looking straight ahead of you.
Slowly lower your head so that your ear is approaching your shoulder (but do not lift the shoulder). Hold for 15-30 seconds. Lift your head to the upright position, then lower your other ear towards the shoulder and hold for 15-30 seconds.
Do not stretch to the point of pain. Repeat exercises as necessary.

, Acupressure may help you relieve tension and headache pain, especially if your headaches are caused by muscle tension or stress.Stimulating acupressure points in your neck, shoulder, and hands can help relieve headaches.


Locate the mastoid bone just behind your ear, and follow the natural groove in your neck to where the muscles attach to the skull. Apply deep, very firm pressure for 4-5 seconds while you breathe deeply.Locate the point on your shoulder muscle about halfway between your neck and the edge of your shoulder. Using your opposite hand (right hand on the left shoulder, left hand on the right shoulder), pinch the shoulder muscle between your fingers and thumb. Use your index finger to apply firm downward pressure for 4-5 seconds.Massage the soft part of your hand in between your index finger and thumb. Apply firm, circular pressure for 4-5 seconds. However, this should be avoided during pregnancy because it might induce labor.You can also place ping pong balls in a sock and lean back against a chair (or the seat of a car), placing the balls between the seat and your back to activate pressure points.

, People around the world use a variety of tricks to distract themselves from pain. If you're in the midst of a headache, don't worry about learning something new — stick to whatever is closest to your comfort zone. Some popular options include:



Meditation.

Prayer.

Deep breathing.

Visualization.
Listening to binaural beats
Try to just calm down. If you can fall asleep, that might help.

, Sometimes, breathing itself can be a cure. It sounds obvious, because breathing is just something we do, but relaxation and deep breathing can actually be something that you need to focus on. Deep, regular breathing can remove tension and relax you and your headache in minutes.Find a cool, dark, quiet place.
Make yourself comfortable: lie down or sit comfortably, and remove or loosen tight clothes.
Inhale slowly through your nose. You should feel your abdomen expanding as you fill your lungs with air.Hold for 2-3 seconds, then exhale slowly through your mouth until your lungs feel empty.

Admit that you are powerless over your addiction—that your live has become unmanageable.,
Believe that a power greater than yourself could restore you to sanity.,
Make a decision to turn your will and your life over to the care of God or your higher power.,
Make a searching and fearless moral inventory of yourself.,
Admit to yourself, others, and to God or your higher power the exact nature of your wrongs.,
Be entirely ready to have God remove all these defects of character.,
Humbly ask God or your higher power to remove your shortcomings.,
Make a list of all people you have harmed, and become willing to make amends to them all.,
Make direct amends to those you have harmed wherever possible, except when doing so would injure them or others.,
Continue to take personal inventory and promptly admit when you are wrong.,
Seek through prayer and meditation to improve your conscious contact with God or the higher power.,
Carry this message to addicts and/or alcoholics to practice these principles in all their affairs.",How to Do the 12 Steps," Addiction is a disease. Denial is part of the disease that tells us we do not have a problem. You are powerless when the driving force of your life is beyond your control. Your inability to manage your life is the outward evidence of your powerlessness. When you accept this, you will have surrendered and can begin to move on to recovery.;
, A power greater than yourself can change from situation to situation— it can be anything that makes you aware of the insanity of a situation if you act out on a defect or negative will. This power can be God or whatever higher power you choose.

, Decision is an action: it is a beginning— a starting point. While the first two steps were reflective, requiring only acceptance, step three calls for affirmative action. The first step restores you physically; the second step restores you mentally; the third step restores you spiritually. This is about choosing to follow your chosen higher power.

, You do not have to be ""fearless"" to take a fearless inventory; you only need to be willing. Look at the characteristics that cause you or other people pain, whether that be guilt, fear, shame, anger and so on.

, Remember that the second step says that you must do things differently if you want a different outcome. You must reach out in trust to be delivered from the insanity of your isolation. The two most important qualities you will get from doing this step are open-mindedness and willingness. You will realize that you are not alone.

, Living through steps one through five makes you entirely ready, you just need to recognize this and know that your defects can be removed. Share your defects with others and/or your higher power, and be ready to let go of guilt, anger and whatever other defects you have that are causing pain.

, Shortcoming is the acting out of the defect. Get in touch with the higher power of your choice and learn to practice opposites.

, The first two names on this list should be God or your higher power and yourself. Remember that your problem is how you treated other people.

, This is the last of the cleansing and releasing steps. Many doors in our recovery will begin to open for us after we complete this step. Get rid of guilt and fear by making amends.

, This is the first of the maintenance steps. It is a very important step— by taking a daily inventory we can eliminate the buildup of many things we dealt with in the fourth through ninth steps. Do not go back to the old behavior that leads you to your old ways of suffering.

, Pray only for knowledge of their will for you and the power to carry that out. Every day pray, meditate and write. Here the work we put into the steps seems to all come together. We have been practicing prayer and meditation in the previous ten steps. Now we will work to consciously improve prayer and meditation to the higher power of our understanding. There is no set way. It is a personal decision between you and your higher power. Prayer is the talking part. Meditation is the listening. Be a good listener. Grow in a spiritual manner.

, The steps do not end here. They are only a new beginning. You have received a spiritual awakening - the greatest gift. We can only keep what we have by giving it away. We reinforce our recovery by sharing it with others.

Keep a headache diary.,
Identify your triggers.,
Create a management plan for migraines.",How to Prevent Migraines5," Although there are some common triggers for migraines, you need to figure out exactly what triggers your specific migraines. A headache diary can help you determine this. It can also help you and your doctor monitor the effectiveness of treatments. Being able to review a record of things done, eaten, experienced, and felt during the 24 hours prior to the onset of a migraine can teach you a great deal about your personal triggers.


Start the diary by asking yourself these questions: When did I start having the headache? How often would I say they are now? Any specific days? Times? How can I describe the pain of the headache? Any triggers? Do I have different types of headaches? Does anyone else in the family experience headaches? Do I notice vision changes with your headaches? Do I get them around the time I have a period?
Track the date, the time from start to finish, the pain rating from 0-10, any triggers, any symptoms beforehand, medications you took for it, and the relief of the migraine.
If you have a smart-phone use one of mobile application for migraine to keep track of your migraine, triggers, aura, medication etc. You can find migraine apps for android by searching for migraine or related keyword in google play store.

, There isn't one singular trigger for migraines. It is unclear exactly what causes migraines and it varies from person to person. Migraines seem to be triggered by a wide variety of different things. It can be something you eat, smell, hear, or see. It can often be linked to your sleeping patterns or daily activities. Make sure you document all the things you do each day so you can pick out your personal triggers after some time has passed., While it will probably not be possible to avoid all migraines, it should be possible to manage them. Go through your migraine diary and try to see what patterns have developed. Look for patterns to find your triggers. Look for particular times of the day, the week, or the season that cause more problems than others.


Map out an approach to managing the prevention of your migraines once you have found the pattern. Put the plan into action, avoid triggers, and be aware of sensitivities. Record the outcomes and stick with anything that works for you to head off migraines.
Other possible changes may be taking pain medication at the start of the headache and letting others know the pain you are going through.

Use natural remedies with caution.,
Try herbal remedies.,
Use aromatherapy.,
Use food-based remedies.",How to Get Rid of a Headache2," There are some natural remedies that might work to treat your headache. As with any natural remedy, always know the side effects and allergy potential of the remedy, as well any times you should not use the remedy (such as while pregnant, if you’re already sick, etc.) Be aware that natural remedies are often not backed with scientific research or approved by the FDA or other licensing agencies.

, Look for standardized herbal supplements that contain a specified amount of the active ingredient in every dose. There are several herbal remedies that are considered to have value for getting rid of headaches.Note, however, that the scientific support for or extensive studies on the effectiveness of many of these supplements varies. As with any treatment, use with caution, and stop using them immediately if you experience unpleasant side-effects.Butterbur. Studies show that butterbur can reduce migraine frequency.Take two 25mg capsules daily for 12 weeks to reduce the occurrence of migraines by up to 60%. Do not consume butterbur plants directly, as they contain toxic elements that are removed when made into capsules.Ginger. In addition to treating headache pain, ginger can help treat nausea and vomiting, which are common side-effects of a severe headache. The American Academy of Neurology has found that concentrated ginger supplements are more effective at reducing headache pain than placebos.Coriander. Coriander seeds can be used to decrease the inflammation that causes headaches. The seeds can be chewed, used in food or tea, or taken orally in extract form.Feverfew. Feverfew can be taken in capsule or tablet form, as a tea, or even eaten in a sandwich (beware, it tastes bitter). There is mixed evidence to support the effectiveness of feverfew, but it has been relied upon for centuries, so it might be worth trying.There are no serious side effects, although you might experience a sore tongue, mouth ulcers, nausea, digestive problems and bloating. Coming from the long-term use of fever, few can disrupt sleep and actually cause headaches.
Willow. Willow is used in 300mg tablets and may reduce the frequency of migraines when taken twice daily.Tea: A cup of tea made from passion flower, rosemary, or lavender might alleviate a headache. Peppermint or chamomile tea can help to relax you., Aromatherapy preparations vary considerably, but some of the more commonly used essential oils for headache treatment include lavender, sweet marjoram, and chamomile. Use for neck massaging, in a bath, or to inhale.For the relief of aches and pains: Mix five drops rosemary oil, five drops nutmeg oil, five drops lavender oil in a carrier oil such as olive or coconut oil. Massage onto the neck and upper back area.

, Lack of food can cause a headache, so make sure you've eaten something recently. Some foods and beverages may also trigger headaches (red wine, MSG, and chocolate are common culprits).Be mindful of what you eat, and don’t eat foods that you notice routinely cause headaches. You may also be able to help treat headache pain by eating certain foods.


Eat almonds. Almonds contain magnesium, which may help relax blood vessels and relieve headache pain. Other magnesium-rich foods such as bananas, cashews, and avocados can also help.Eat hot, spicy foods. The effectiveness of spicy foods on headaches depends on the person and the type of headache. However, if you have a sinus headache, spicy foods may help decrease congestion and allow you to breathe better, which can help reduce headache pain.Try spinach. Spinach really is food with a high density of nutrients, and that offers many potential health benefits. It may help decrease blood pressure and relieve hangover-related headaches. Use fresh spinach instead of lettuce in a salad or on a sandwich.Drink a cup of a caffeine-containing beverage. Caffeine constricts the blood vessels, which can lessen head pain. Too much caffeine may trigger migraines in some people so instead of coffee, you might try tea, which tends to have less caffeine.

"
Get plenty of sleep.,
Limit your exposure to fragrances.Though perfume and scented products such as soaps and lotions might make you smell nice, they could be causing your headaches.,
Change your diet.,
Treat musculoskeletal problems.,
Do yoga.,
Set up an ergonomically correct workstation.,
See a range of health professionals.,
Calm down.,
Keep a record of your headaches.,
Quit smoking.",How to Get Rid of a Headache3," Having good ""sleep hygiene""-- getting plenty of good quality sleep-- can help you feel better generally and can reduce headache occurrences. Adults should get at least 7-8 hours of sleep each night.If you have trouble sleeping, try some of the following techniques:


Limit your ""screen time"" before bed
Only use your bed for sleep and intimacy
Limit caffeine consumption in the later part of the day
Begin dimming the lights and giving yourself time to ""wind down"" before preparing for bed

, Try switching to unscented products and ask those to whom you spend a lot of time in proximity to do the same. Remove or unplug scented air fresheners from your living or working space as well.

, Although this won't alleviate your headache straight away, making dietary changes in the longer term can potentially remove a source of headaches for you in the future. If you don't know where to begin, see your doctor or a dietician/nutritionist.Find out whether you have any particular food allergies and eliminate those foods from your diet.
Reduce your intake of caffeine. Caffeine can induce headaches. Ironically, withdrawal from caffeine will probably cause a temporary headache, but once you're through the withdrawal period, you'll notice a positive difference.
You might consider avoiding or minimizing potential headache-triggering foods, especially those containing MSG, nitrites and nitrates (cured meats), tyramines (aged cheese, wine, beer, and processed meats), sulphites (dried fruits, condiments, and wine), and salicylates (tea, vinegar, and some fruit)., If your back or neck are misaligned, or you're suffering from poor posture and muscle tension, it's important to fix this source of pain. While you can try to improve your musculoskeletal problems through exercise such as stretching, yoga, or Pilates, it is usually important to also see a specialist such as a physiotherapist or a chiropractor to assess and treat your condition.

, Yoga aimed at reducing tension can remove or minimize headaches and prevent them from reoccurring. Simple neck rolling or relaxation yoga exercises are best.

, The way that you're sitting at the desk and using a computer might be contributing to your headache. Be sure that everything is at the right height and distance for your size.Make sure you can keep your neck in a neutral position while you work. We often end up slouching and pushing our necks out of alignment when using computers and other digital devices. If your neck is usually bent forward, move your computer so that you can look straight ahead while working.
Take regular breaks from all desk work and computer use. Exercise your eyes by looking at different distances for a few minutes every hour and do some basic body stretches.

, Many health issues can cause headaches, so if your headaches continue to be a problem for you, seeing specialists to address other problems can help you reduce your headaches.


See your dentist: If you clench your teeth or have jaw misalignment, tooth decay, abscesses, or post-extraction infection, these can be a source of headaches.
See your optician: If you need glasses, but it has gone undiagnosed, your eyestrain could be causing unnecessary headaches.
See your ear, nose and throat specialist: If you have untreated infections, perforations, or other problems with your ears, nose, and throat, these could cause headaches.

, If you're angry, irritable, frustrated, etc., you may be building up daily muscle tension to a point where it has become unmanageable and caused headaches. Anxiety, stress, and depression can also cause headaches. Seek professional counseling or psychological help for mapping out some fruitful ways to manage your emotions if they're dominating your approach to life every day.If you clench your jaw or grit your teeth, make an effort to relax your face. Try yawning to reduce facial tension.
Practice relaxation exercises before stress-producing events like exams, getting married, taking a driver's test, etc.

, This will help you to identify patterns that bring about headaches, such as after a particularly stressful period at work, after communication problems, after eating certain foods, starting your period, etc. Once you know what triggers your headaches, you can start learning to head off a headache before it even begins to develop.


This information can also be very helpful to your doctor if you experience frequent headaches. Bring your headache journal along with you to doctor’s appointments.

, If you’re a smoker, you may be aggravating your headaches. Cigarette smoke contains substances that are known to cause headaches, such as carbon monoxide. Cigarettes also contain things like nicotine that constrict blood vessels, causing headaches, and also keep the liver from being able to process headache medication.Quitting smoking can help you get fewer headaches, especially if you get “cluster headaches,” or headaches that occur in intense cycles throughout the day.Studies have shown that people who cut their tobacco use also cut their headache frequency in half.


Headaches can also be caused by exposure to second-hand smoke, especially if you have a smoke allergy or sensitivity. If you don’t smoke but frequently are in places where cigarette smoke is common, you may still experience headaches.

Prevent a hangover headache by drinking water.,
Prevent an allergy or food-induced headache by knowing your triggers.,
Prevent other headaches by changing your personal care routine.",How to Get Rid of a Headache4," Most headaches are tension or lifestyle induced and aren't harmful, even though they're painful and can prevent you from fulfilling your tasks. If you experience frequent headaches, a severe headache, a headache that won't respond to analgesics, or a headache that is accompanied by other symptoms, consult your doctor or health professional for immediate investigation and a proper diagnosis.There's a wide variety of possible causes, which is why it's so important to seek further treatment if your headache issue doesn't resolve.

, Tension headaches are the most common type of headache. Usually, they aren't as painful as other headaches, but they can last for hours or even days. A tension headache tends to form as a result of muscle contraction, and is commonly felt like a band behind the eyes and across the forehead.A headache may be dull or recurrent if the source is not dealt with, and can be accompanied by feeling generally unwell, especially if the sufferer also has anxiety or depression. This type of headache tends to respond well to painkillers, rest, and alleviation of the source of stress.Massage, acupuncture, yoga, and relaxation therapies are good ways of preventing tension headaches.""Talk therapy,"" where you work on your anxiety and stress with a mental health professional, can also help prevent and reduce tension headaches., Migraines may be genetically linked, although researchers are not certain exactly what causes migraines.Migraines cause throbbing pain accompanied by severe nausea and possible vomiting. There are sometimes visual problems—called ""aura""— such as seeing stars, flickering objects, and even partial loss of vision. Some migraines also cause numbness or weakness. Migraines can be caused by reactions to food, stressors, hormonal changes, an accident, medications, or other unknown triggers. Migraines require special medical attention If you frequently experience them, see a doctor.Regular exercise, especially aerobic exercise, can help you prevent migraine headaches by reducing tension in your body. Obesity may also be a migraine trigger, so exercise can also help prevent migraines by helping you stay at or reach a healthy weight.Warm up gradually before you exercise! Intense or sudden physical exertion without a gradual warm-up period can trigger migraines. Even brisk sexual activity can trigger a migraine in the very sensitive.Migraine headaches can also benefit from increased water consumption and a balanced diet.

, Researchers don't know exactly what causes cluster headaches, so you can't prevent the first onset of a cluster headache.Cluster headaches are one of the most painful headaches, with intense pain around your eye area (usually on one side of your head). They can also involve drooping eyelids, nasal discharge and watery eyes.If this type of head pain is occurring, take it seriously and see your doctor for advice and treatment. There are some drugs and treatments that can alleviate the symptoms.Avoiding alcohol and nicotine can help reduce your risk of future cluster headaches, although it may not have any effect on your pain while a cluster headache is occurring.Oxygen therapy, where you breath in oxygen through a mask, has proven especially helpful for cluster headaches.Studies have shown that taking 10 milligrams of melatonin before bed may reduce the frequency of cluster headache onset.This may be because cluster headaches can occur when your sleep cycle is disturbed., The medication overuse headache (MOH), or ""rebound headache"", stems from withdrawal symptoms from the long-term use of pain relief medication (usually for tension headaches). MOH headaches are treatable. In most cases, just stop using the medication and your headaches should stop within a few days. The symptoms of an MOH headache are often similar to those of tension headaches.Avoid using headache painkillers, even over-the-counter types, for more than 2 or 3 days per week. If your symptoms are severe enough to require more frequent medication, see a doctor.Use over-the-counter painkillers no more than 15 days per month.Avoid painkillers that contain opioids (codeine, morphine, hydrocodone, etc.)or butalbital (Fioricet, Ezol, Phrenilin, etc.).

, Hangover headaches are very common, and they're estimated to cost the US about $148 billion a year in lost productivity (from sufferers who call out sick or do a terrible job at work because they're hungover).Symptoms include throbbing pain, nausea, and feeling generally lousy. The only guaranteed way to prevent a hangover headache is not to drink, but staying hydrated by drinking plenty of water can help you avoid the pain of an alcohol-induced headache the next day.


A good rule of thumb is to drink four times as much water (or other non-alcoholic, non-caffeinated liquids) as you do alcohol. Since many cocktails contain between 1-2 ounces of liquor, you should plan to drink a full, large glass of water for each alcoholic beverage you consume.Other liquids, including sports drinks or even broth, can also be helpful. Avoid alcohol (obviously) and beverages that include caffeine. Alcohol and caffeine both dehydrate you.

, Allergies and sensitivities can cause nasty headaches that often include a runny nose, watery eyes, and an itching or burning sensation as well as headache pain. Some allergies are seasonal, such as pollen allergies, and can be treated with antihistamines. You might also have a food allergy or sensitivity, which can trigger headaches. If you have frequent headaches with symptoms like itching or watery eyes, consider having an allergy skin test done by a medical professional. These tests expose you (safely!) to a variety of allergy triggers and can help determine whether your headaches are caused by things you're exposed to.MSG can sometimes induce headaches. Someone with an MSG sensitivity may also experience facial pressure, chest pain, burning sensation on trunk, neck and shoulders and throbbing head. Nitrites and nitrates in meat can induce a moderate to severe headache.If you eat ice cream or drink a cold drink too quickly, you can induce a temporary ""brain freeze"", or ""ice cream headache"" which is severe but passes quickly.

, Headaches can sometimes be caused by eyestrain, hunger, strained neck or back muscles, and even by things like wearing your hair in a certain style (such as in a tight ponytail or wearing a headband that puts pressure behind your ears). These headaches are likely to have similar symptoms to tension headaches. Making minor changes to your routine, like setting up an ergonomically correct workstation or not wearing your hair in a tight ponytail or bun, can help prevent these headaches.Eating on a regular schedule can also help prevent everyday headaches. If you don't eat regularly, your blood sugar drops, and this can trigger intense headaches and nausea.Avoiding processed foods may also help reduce your headaches and make you feel better in general.
Be sure that you follow a regular sleep schedule and get at least 7-8 hours of sleep every night."

Drink alcohol in moderation.,
Cut back on caffeine.,
Avoid staring at screens for long periods.,
Reduce your exposure to the sun.,
Avoid food triggers.",How to Avoid Headaches1," Notice if certain foods or smells cause a headache or whether you tend to have headaches when you're sleepy or stressed. Identifying your triggers can help you adjust your lifestyle to help avoid headaches.It can help to keep a headache diary where you note each time you have a headache and any factors that may have caused it.;
, Drinking too much can cause headaches due to dehydration. Stick to one or two drinks and avoid darker liquors.If you have frequent headaches already, you may be very sensitive to even a small amount of alcohol. It may be best to avoid indulging at all.

, There is nothing wrong with caffeine in moderation. However, consuming high amounts of caffeine can lead to headaches. If you experience frequent headaches, drink less caffeine. If you find you're very sensitive to caffeine, work on eliminating it altogether to avoid headaches.Avoid energy drinks, as these have a lot of caffeine in addition to other unhealthy additives that could potentially cause headaches.

, Too much time in front of the computer is a common cause of headaches. If you work in front of a computer, take breaks once every 30 minutes. Get up and stretch or at least look away from the screen for a few minutes., If you live in a sunny area, too much sun may be causing your headaches. Bright sunlight can trigger other common causes of headaches, like dehydration and eyestrain. If you go out in the sun, wear sunglasses and bring an umbrella to reduce the likelihood of developing a headache.If you feel overheated, seek a shaded area or a building with air conditioning right away.

, Keep track of headaches that occur after eating. If you have an allergy or sensitivity to a certain food, it may cause a headache. If you notice headaches tend to come after eating certain foods, eliminate those foods and see if you notice a difference."

Treat your loved one the same.,
Don't feel guilty.,
Help your loved one get involved.,
Discuss the condition with your friends.,
Talk to your loved one's school.",How to Help Loved Ones with Tourette's Syndrome1," Despite your loved one having TS, you should not treat them as if there is something wrong. It is a medical condition, not a character trait or single defining factor in your loved one's life. Your loved one will still have the same dreams, desires, interests, and hobbies as any other family member. The worst thing you can do is treat your loved one's TS as if it is a detriment to you family that you always have to focus on.


This does not mean that you should ignore your loved one's TS, but make sure you don't make it seem like a burden.
Encourage your loved one's dreams, such as singing, writing, or sports. All these activities are possible with TS.;
, If your child is diagnosed with TS, understand that there is no need to feel guilty. Trying to decide if something you did caused your child's condition or if your genes contributed to the condition is not helpful. If another family member has TS, you should also not feel guilty for not having it or feel sorry for them because they have it.


This can only make your loved one feel bad about having TS, which is not at all what you want. This can make your life and your loved one's life unnecessarily uncomfortable and stressful., Getting your loved one involved in an activity can help manage the tics. Often times, getting engrossed in an activity will help your loved one's tics become less frequent and milder.


Even less active activities, such as painting, playing music, or writing can help.
This includes sports, hobbies, exercise, or any other activity that keeps your loved one's mind occupied., If your loved one has TS, you want him or her to feel comfortable whenever anyone visits your house. This is true for your friends as well as your loved one's friends. Even just mentioning the condition to your friends will help them not be surprised when your loved one tics.


It can be as easy as explaining your loved one's specific tic so your friends know what to expect.
Your loved one's friends will already know about the tics, but if you find that his or her friends want more information or are curious, offer your knowledge to them. If you see your loved one's friends being disrespectful, take them aside and discuss the behavior with them., Having TS can make school problematic for your loved one. The tics may cause other students to tease or bully your loved one or be distracted in class. Your loved one's tics may also be bad enough to cause difficulty writing or reading in class. This can make school an unhappy place to be, which is the opposite of what you want.


Collaborate with your loved one's school administrators and teachers to come up with a way to handle the situation. This can be an intensive process, but with classroom management techniques, educational policies, and some other special considerations, your child can have a great school experience.Your child may try to stop the tics, which can cause distraction in class.

Inform yourself.,
Get a diagnosis.,
Find out if you will need medications.,
If you're taking neuroleptics, consult your physician if you intend to stop the intake, as side effects might occur.,
Consider therapy.,
Try to be in an understanding environment and don't be ashamed by your condition.",How to Cope With Tourette Syndrome," Tourette Syndrome has been portrayed as a rare disease, but the fact is that 200,000 Americans have the most severe form of TS, and one in 100 show milder forms.;
, A formal diagnosis is given after verifying that the patient has had both motor and vocal tics for at least 1 year.

, If you have a mild form of Tourette Syndrome, you probably won't need any medication, since tics don't typically cause impairment. If the tics do affect your daily life, there are medications available, such as Neuroleptics, used for tic suppression.

,


TS is sometimes linked to other conditions, such as ADHD or OCD. If this is your case, consult with your doctor on which medications you should take to lessen the effects. There are no universal medication for Tourette Syndrome, so you'll have to discuss with your doctor which option is the best fit for you.







, Psychotherapy is highly recommended. Tourette Syndrome is not caused by psychological problems, but it make result on these due to the social and emotional problems that it might cause.

, You might have special needs when studying, such as untimed tests or oral examinations. Speak to your teachers about it, as a tolerant feedback will highly reduce the stress that coping with TS may carry.

Start the conversation sooner rather than later.,
Do your homework.,
Be clear that it is a “big deal” and it isn’t a “rite of passage.” According to many popular movies, TV shows, songs, and other media, it may seem like every teen smokes marijuana at least sometimes, but none of them face consequences more severe than getting into occasional hijinks.,
Prepare together to handle challenging situations and peer pressure.,
Set and enforce clear expectations and consequences.,
Recognize signs of ongoing marijuana use.,
Identify specific ways in which the person’s marijuana use is causing harm.,
Reiterate the dangers of teen marijuana use.,
Support the user without becoming an enabler.,
Help the user get help.",How to Discourage Teen Marijuana Use," As with most potentially awkward conversation topics you need to broach at some point with your child — alcohol, tobacco, sex, etc. — it is best to initiate the discussion earlier than you think is necessary. While the majority of teens never smoke marijuana, those that do try it may begin even before they are officially “teenagers.” Many experts on the topic advise that you begin talking about the dangers of drug use by the time your child is ten or eleven years old.Don’t give a lecture, though; start a real dialogue with your child. Start by asking questions — “Do you know what marijuana is?” “Have you ever heard kids talking about it in school, or heard people talking about it on TV or movies?” “What do you think marijuana does to someone?”. This can help reduce awkwardness, give you a better idea how to continue approaching the subject, and spur an ongoing conversation with your child.;
, Simply saying “marijuana is bad for you and illegal, so don’t use it” is unlikely to be sufficient. Especially if you are not particularly knowledgeable on the subject, take some time beforehand to research marijuana’s medical, physical, emotional, and social impacts. Don’t barrage your teen with data points, but do have some specific evidence at the ready.To name but a few examples, you might mention some of the following: marijuana smoke is more hazardous to the lungs than tobacco; smoking marijuana makes you twice as likely to be in a car crash; today’s marijuana is twice as potent as it was twenty years ago; and most teens don't use marijuana., However, the reality is clear: most teens don’t use marijuana, but some of those who do become hooked and suffer negative consequences. Come to the discussion armed with the facts and be prepared to counter popular perceptions.Explain to your teen that it is possible to become addicted to marijuana and teens are more likely to become addicted than adults.You may feel like a hypocrite or be hesitant to take a strong stance if you smoked marijuana as a teen and suffered no significant negative consequences. However, remember that marijuana is now much more potent than even twenty years ago.
Instead of concealing or “running away” from your own experience, you can embrace it and use it as a teaching tool.For example, you might tell your child about a time when you felt pressured to use marijuana, how it felt when you used it, and what you did as a result.

, While you may experience some initial resistance from your teen or feel awkward in the attempt, one of the most helpful things you can do during your conversation is engage in situational role playing. Create possible scenarios your child could face and practice making responses that can help counter temptations and peer pressure.For instance, create a scenario at a party in which the teen is being pressured to try marijuana. Practice responses that change the subject, raise practical concerns (like that big test the next day), or simply but clearly express a “no” by the teen.

, At some point during the conversation, you as a parent need to “lay down the law.” Clearly state that using marijuana is not acceptable behavior, and clearly establish punishments or other consequences for doing so. Strive to be firm but fair.Make it clear that you won’t “brush off” or “let slide” an error in judgment by your teen, but at the same time that your primary focus is his or her health and well-being. Try to find a balance which will discourage your teen from using marijuana but not discourage him or her from coming to you if he or she does try it.

, In movies, the effects of marijuana use are always obvious and usually played for laughs — the glassy red eyes, the slow speech, the “munchies,” etc. These signs do in fact indicate potential marijuana use, but there are also many other physical and emotional signs you should watch for in a teen who might be using.


Watch, for instance, for changes in mood or behavior, usually trending toward lethargy, confusion, and sometimes fearfulness. Excessive “goofiness” or changes in sleep patterns can also be indicators.
Look for signs of drug paraphernalia in the teen’s possession if you suspect possible marijuana use.
Check out this wikiHow article on identifying teen marijuana use for more examples.

, If you already know that the teen is using marijuana, take some time to account for all the ways in which his or her using has negatively impacted the teen, you, and your relationship. Bring these specific examples to his or her attention when you decide it is time to address the problem.For instance: “I’ve been late to work three times this month because you were too wasted to drop me off.”; ""We never play basketball or go running anymore because you have no interest or energy.”; “Your grades have gone from As and Bs to Cs and Ds almost overnight.”

, No matter how many times a person has been told before, keep repeating yourself about the physical, mental, and emotional (not to mention legal) risks of ongoing marijuana use. Don’t give a lecture, but also don’t hold back from expressing the facts.Mention, for example, that teens who regularly use marijuana have a higher dropout rate, higher instance of anxiety and social disorders, decreased memory and problem solving skills, and a greater likelihood of using other drugs, among many other important bits of evidence at your disposal., A teen marijuana user who wants to quit, or needs to quit but won’t, requires a lot of love and support. However, some “tough love” may also be in order. Be compassionate without being a pushover.


Tell your teen you’ll help, such as by helping him or her to find alternate ways to relax and by listening when your teen feels like smoking marijuana. Don’t however, become an enabler (especially as a parent) by letting disrespectful or disobedient behavior continue.
See this wikiHow article on helping someone overcome marijuana addiction with the aid of both compassionate and rigid measures.

, Despite claims to the contrary, marijuana is addictive and can be very difficult to give up. At some point, practically every user will want to quit, and he or she will immediately benefit from your efforts to help find the right therapist.Help the teen find a therapist who specializes in drug abuse. Go to sessions with the user if it is permissible and/or helpful. Make it clear that you are there to help for the long haul.
Many drug abuse therapists utilize cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for recovering users. CBT helps a user identify his or her stressors, habits, and many other factors of drug abuse, as well as guidance on how to go about quitting and getting on with life.

Explain the disorder to your other children.,
Discuss the disorder with your loved ones.,
Accept that your family will be different.,
Take time to adjust your life.",How to Help Loved Ones with Tourette's Syndrome2," When your child is diagnosed with TS, you need to explain the condition to your other children. Your child's siblings may feel left out if a brother or sister if getting more attention because your family is dealing with TS.


Some siblings will step up and take care of his or her sibling.
This can be tough to manage, but just make sure you pay attention to each of your children in their own way. This may be tough to understand, but each of your children want to know they have your attention and love.Tell your other children, ""Although I may spend a little more time with your sibling, he/she needs my help more than you do sometimes. This doesn't mean I love you any less.""
For example, if you have to do something specific with your child that has TS, make some time to spend one on one with your other children so they don't feel left out or as if they aren't getting the same attention.

, If a loved one with TS isn't your child but another family member, such as a grandpa, grandma, aunt, or uncle, you need to make sure you discuss the condition with your family. Your children may not understand the condition or be afraid of it because they aren't sure what it means.


Just be honest with they and make them aware of the condition so no one is surprised or confused.Tell your family, ""Someone in our family has Tourette Syndrome. This means he/she has motor and verbal tics that he/she cannot control. Don't stare or make fun of him/her.""

, It may be hard to get used to having a family member with TS, but this doesn't mean your life will be hard. Your life will likely not look exactly like others, especially if your loved one's TS tics are severe. But try to see this new family structure as a strength.


Pay attention to your loved one with TS in public. Embrace the new way your family looks by joining other families with TS in events. Just try to do activities that make the TS part of your life instead of ignoring it., Once you accept your new life, learn to adjust to your new life in a way that will not make your loved one with TS feel like an burden. Look on the difference in your family as a strength, not a weakness.


This means that you should keep doing as much as possible of those things that you did before your child was diagnosed. Go on vacation, go to the store, go to the movies if possible. If you keep doing all those things that your family always loved to do that are still possible, the Tourette Syndrome will fee less like a burden.
If you are the main caregiver of a loved one with TS, you may need a break from time to time. This will help you recharge and not feel overwhelmed by your caregiver tasks."

Figure out treatments for TS.,
Look for additional conditions.,
Ask the doctor.,
Do online research.,
Find a local support group.",How to Help Loved Ones with Tourette's Syndrome3," One of the best ways you can help your family member is to get more informed about the condition. TS affects the nervous system, which manifests as tics. Tics are sudden movements, twitches, or sounds that people perform without the ability to stop. Tics will get worse when the person is stressed or worried and will calm down when the person is focused on an activity. When your child's TS is first manifesting, the tics will likely be in the head and neck area. The tics can manifest as:


Motor tics, which are movements of the body such as shrugging the shoulders, jerking an arm, or blinking
Vocal tics, which are sounds made with the voice such as clearing the throat, humming, or yelling a phrase or single word
Simple tics, which only involve a few parts of the body such as sniffing or squinting the eyes
Complex tics, which involve multiple parts of the body and completed in a pattern, such as shaking the head while lifting the arm then jumping in the air., The treatment options for your loved one's TS will vary depending on the severity of the tics. If the tics are not extreme or do not disrupt normal activities and everyday life, your loved one may not need any treatment options. However, if the tics are disruptive, violent, or severe, your loved one may be on medication, do therapy such cognitive behavior therapy or talk therapy, or undergo a combination of these treatments.


The treatment options for your loved one may also change over time as the TS evolves.

",How to Prepare for a Tourette Syndrome Diagnosis," Since Tourette Syndrome is genetic, ask yourself, ""Have any relatives experienced symptoms?"" Sometimes, Tourette Syndrome appears to arise spontaneously without any family history of the condition. Therefore, someone might have the genes, but not experience any symptoms. This is called 'Shadow Tourette Syndrome'. Whether or not relatives have experienced symptoms does not influence the outcome of a diagnosis, but is helpful information for the doctor to have.;
, There are six types of tics (listed from the most common to the most rare):Simple Motor Tics - eye blinking, throat clearing, head shaking, facial grimaces
Simple Phonic Tics - repeating certain sounds, grunting, barking, squeaking, sniffing
Complex Motor Tics - moving whole ligaments, slapping one's head, twisting one's body
Complex Phonic Tics - repeating entire words or sentences
Copropraxia - inappropriate gestures
Coprolalia - saying socially inappropriate phrases, swearing, death threats

,, This is because many Tourette's patients will show the least amount of symptoms when in the doctor's office.

, In this case, a diagnosis of Tourette Syndrome Plus might be made. Perhaps the patient might not fit the criteria for a diagnosis, but still experiences some symptoms. This is called a 'Shadow Syndrome'. Also consider other possibilities, such as:


Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) - involves obsessions (distressing thoughts) and compulsions (behaviors to neutralize the thoughts)
Attention Deficit/ Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) - involves lack of attention
Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) - another term for depression
Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) - difficulties in social situations

Autism Spectrum Disorder - difficulty communicating, sensory issues, disorganization, and more
Learning disabilities - include dyslexia, dyscalculia, or dysgraphia.

, These are circumstances which worsen the frequency and severity of tic symptoms. Here are examples of tic triggers:


Certain emotions or mental states (hyper, anxious, embarrassed)
Hearing certain 'triggering words'
Intrusive thoughts (if OCD is present)
Being in crowded places
Being alone with one's thoughts.

, This is a feeling of tension or discomfort in the area of the tic. Some people describe it as the urge to sneeze or scratch an itch.

, If so, set an appointment with the doctor.

, The first step is 'acceptance', acknowledging that you have a lifelong condition. Don't allow the Tourette Syndrome label to define you as an individual.

Understand that these tics come from changes in your brain's development and structure. Tourette's isn't harmful to your body, but it's a neurological condition that needs to be monitored.
Understand that your tics may occur more often when stressed, anxious, excited, or nervous. Try focusing on how to stay relaxed and comfortable.
Some kids with Tourette's will suppress their tics, but then find that those tics will build up later and become ""a tic attack."" By keeping your tics in, they aren't necessarily going away but could just be stored up for later.

Recognize that each person's symptoms may vary.,
Think about how you may have fewer tics as you get older.,
Look at the positives and negatives of your condition.,
Evaluate if there are other conditions that need treatment.",How to Deal with Tourette Syndrome As an Adolescent3," While anyone who is diagnosed with Tourette's has motor and/or vocal tics that have occurred for a year or more, there is a wide variation of how those symptoms present in each person. Tics with sudden, rapid, and recurrent movement or vocalization are not one and the same.Tics can start usually between the ages 5 to 18. They may start out as motor tics of the face, limbs, arms, or trunk. But tics can change patterns or frequency over time. The tics you have now may not stay the same as two years from now.
Vocal tics aren't just involuntarily shouting obscene words. The more common vocal tics are grunting or barking, snorting, throat clearing, or repeating other's words or sounds. Help others to understand uttering inappropriate words is not the most common symptom.
Males are more likely to have Tourette's, but it can be found in either gender.
There is usually a family history of Tourette Syndrome, ADHD, or OCD in the family. Think about any relatives who you know that have Tourette Syndrome, ADHD, or OCD. They may have insight about their condition, and how it developed into their teens.

, As a teen, you may be concerned about how long you'll have these tics, and whether they will get worse. Some good news is that most research shows an improvement in the condition in a person's late teens and early adulthood.


While your tics may peak in early puberty around age 10-12, they are more likely to decrease after your mid-teens.
About 85 to 90% of those affected with the condition will see improvement by adulthood. While the symptoms may not fully go away, the condition may be less bothersome for you. Think positively about how your symptoms will likely improve over time.

, While it may seem like there are no positives to having Tourette Syndrome, think about how this condition has made you stronger, more understanding, and possibly more accepting of differences in people.Avoid focusing only on the negative aspects of feeling different or weird. Don't let others determine your worth and value.
See how your condition makes you unique. It may help you to learn to appreciate others more. It may teach you to be kind to others who face similar challenges. It gives you a sense of originality. You're not boring and ordinary.

, Be self-aware and recognize if there are other conditions that need attention. Many teens who have Tourette Syndrome may also have ADHD, OCD, anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, or a substance use disorder.Having another condition is common, and thus it's important to really look at your overall mental health.
If you've had Tourette's for many years, you may feel sad, anxious, or upset about feeling different or having difficulty with talking to other people. Look at ways to get help, feel more accepted, and be happier with who you are.

Refrain from judging the person.",How to Deal With Someone Who Is Having Problems With Drugs or Drinking," Trying to change someone else’s actions usually ends in frustration, because you cannot control another person’s behavior. However, you can change your own behavior.


For example, if a friend is having trouble with alcohol, you can avoid drinking alcohol around her. Offer other options for socializing, such as going to the movies instead of the bar.
Remember that you are not responsible for the person’s behavior, or its consequences. For example, if the person’s substance abuse is interfering with their ability to hold down a job, it is not your responsibility to pick up the slack. Doing so may actually enable the other person to continue abusing the substance.You do not have to make excuses for the other person, or cover up their substance use. You do not have to give the other person money to buy substances.;
, Boundaries are meant to protect both of you. They can help protect you from feeling abused, manipulated, or endangered. They can help the person you love know what is and what isn’t acceptable behavior.Consider what behaviors you are willing to be flexible with, and which are “hard lines.”
For example, the person may be hostile or rude to you, especially when s/he is using the substance. This is unacceptable behavior, but depending on your relationship, you may be willing to tolerate some level of it.
However, physical abuse or prolonged psychological abuse cause substantial damage. This is particularly true if young children are involved in the environment. As hard as it may seem, setting hard boundaries that absolutely prohibit this type of behavior is important to protect you and the other people affected by the user’s behavior., There is a fine line between keeping yourself healthy and safe, and confronting your own prejudices and assumptions regarding substance use. It is important that the person with the substance issue know that you will not be bullied or manipulated into supporting their addiction. However, it’s also important that the person knows you are a source of the support they need, rather than the behaviors they might want from you.Enforce consequences, especially for hard line boundaries. These could be very small, such as not rescheduling plans to accommodate the other person. Or, they could be more significant, such as leaving the house or setting up a separate bank account.There is a difference between being flexible and putting yourself in danger. If you believe that you are in danger from the person using drugs or alcohol, call for help and leave the situation. 911, emergency services, and numerous hotlines are available.Alcohol and drugs can cause violent and unpredictable behaviors even in those who don’t have a history of such actions., Caring for or even interacting with someone who is having problems with drugs or alcohol can be emotionally, mentally, and physically taxing. You may find it helpful to find your own sources of support, such as a support group or counseling.


Nar-Anon and Al-Anon are support networks for family and friends of those struggling with drugs or alcohol. Nar-Anon offers support meetings for family and friends of drug abusers.Al-Anon offers support meetings for family and friends of alcohol abusers.You may also find meeting with a therapist helpful, particularly if you have feelings of guilt or responsibility for the other person. In some cases, the person may choose drugs or alcohol over you, and a therapist can help you work through that.

, It’s important to take care of your body, as well as your emotions. Caring for others is a very stressful experience, and can put you at increased risk of becoming ill.Taking proper care of yourself also sets a good example of self-care for your loved one.


Get enough sleep. Try to avoid stimulants in the evening. Don’t use screens for a few hours before going to bed. Establish a regular “routine” for before bed.Eat well. Eat plenty of fruits, vegetables, and high-fiber complex carbohydrates. Stress can wreak havoc on your immune system, and the antioxidants in fruits and vegetables can help boost your body’s ability to fight off illness. Complex carbohydrates, like sweet potatoes, brown rice, and legumes, may cause your brain to produce serotonin, a relaxing hormone.Exercise. Exercise will not only keep you fit, it can reduce the effect of stress.Exercises that focus on your breath and mindfulness, such as Yoga and Tai Chi, may be particularly helpful.

Reduce stress. You may find meditation helpful. Listening to quiet, slow music may relax you.Breathing exercises, such as deep breathing, can help you feel calm and can even reduce your blood pressure., Caring for and supporting someone struggling with drugs or alcohol abuse can be exhausting. Don’t stretch yourself too thin, or put yourself in dangerous situations. If you don’t take care of yourself, you won’t be able to care for the other person either. There is no shame in respecting your own limitations and caring for yourself.People using alcohol and/or drugs may blame you for their problems. They may attempt to manipulate you by threatening to use or self-harm if you do not give them what you want. You will need to remind yourself that you are not responsible for anyone’s actions but your own.Alcohol and drugs can cause people to be in denial about the severity of their issues. They may lie to you about their behavior. They may steal or even use threats or violence to get more of the substance. Detaching from this situation may be your best option., Express your care for the person first of all. Tell the other person you love him or her and you are concerned about the behaviors you’ve observed. Offer your support in specifics, such as being willing to go find help with them.Don’t use emotional appeals to “guilt trip” the person. This could make the compulsion to abuse the substance worse.Don’t try to talk with the person when s/he is under the influence of drugs or alcohol. S/he will not be in a rational mindset, and his or her judgment may be impaired., There are many resources available for substance abuse, and many are free or low-cost. The most popular and widely successful option is process-oriented group programs, such as Alcoholics Anonymous.These programs are valuable for a variety of reasons, but especially because they emphasize building and reinforcing a strong network of social support.These networks, which often include 24-hour mentorship and a community of shared experiences, are usually very helpful for both users who are struggling and for people who are trying to stop using.“Contingency management” programs can be helpful in treating alcohol, stimulants, opioids, marijuana, and nicotine abuse. These programs are often run at local clinics and involve providing “rewards” or other positive reinforcement for staying off the abused substance., Many counselors and therapists are trained to provide support for those struggling with addiction. Because addiction is often present along with other psychological issues, such as depression, PTSD, or anxiety, seeking help from a mental health professional can help the person figure out some of the underlying reasons behind their substance abuse.Family therapy can be a good option if the person you are helping is a relative or partner. Research shows that Family Behavior Therapy (FBT) can help change dysfunctional patterns within family relationships that contribute to or aggravate substance abuse. It can also teach both you and the person struggling how to cope with addiction.Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) can be helpful in treating the abuse of alcohol, marijuana, cocaine, methamphetamine, and nicotine.CBT focuses on improving a person’s sense of self-efficacy by teaching them to identify and challenge problematic thoughts and behaviors.
Motivational Enhancement Therapy (MET) can be used to help a person overcome resistance to starting a treatment plan for substance abuse. It is commonly most effective for people who abuse alcohol or marijuana. It is usually not as effective at motivating people who are abusing other drugs, such as cocaine or heroin., If you have immediate concerns, an inpatient rehab center may be appropriate. These programs are particularly important if the person is using substances such as cocaine, crack, heroin, or certain prescriptions. Withdrawal from these substances must be managed by medical professionals; drastic or sudden alterations in the use of these substances could cause severe medical complications or even death.These centers completely remove individuals from their outside situation. The person will “detox” under medical supervision. Often, these centers combine medical management with counseling or other education programs. Inpatient programs offer 24-hour supervised care, which can be useful if the person is still highly motivated to seek out and abuse substances.These centers also remove social and environmental triggers. For example, a person may be more likely to use substances if they are around friends who do so, or if they are in a particular place that is associated with substance use for them.
These programs can be costly and require a significant time commitment. In most cases, the person must be willing to enter rehab.
“Detoxing” alone is rarely enough to overcome an addiction. Behavioral change, such as that promoted by therapy, is necessary to fully recover.The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration has a ""Behavioral Health Treatment Services Locator"" on their website., If an inpatient facility is inappropriate or too expensive, the person with the substance use issue should consult with a doctor to come up with a plan for treatment. The person using the substance should be under medical supervision when implementing this plan, in order to avoid severe complications or even death.


The American Society of Addiction Medicine has a “Find a Physician” feature on its website.The American Academy of Addiction Psychiatry has a Patient Referral Program.The doctor or treatment provider may also help you come up with ways to support the person through the plan., Each individual’s situation is unique, and thus, his or her treatment will need to be tailored to suit that situation. You may need to explore many types of support and treatment options before you find one that works.Remember that this will be a process, not an immediate result. You and your loved one may experience many setbacks and relapses. Stay patient.

, Research supports the idea that humans fundamentally need social relationships. Social support can help support personal well-being, and is particularly helpful in situations involving substance abuse problems.How the person understands his or her support network is equally important. For example, if everyone in the person’s “local context,” or community, is constantly telling them that they are a “bad person” or that they will never get better, the individual might feel compelled to continue using the substance because they don’t feel they have better alternatives.On the other hand, communities that support a person struggling with substance abuse may help that person feel stronger and encouraged to succeed.

, Focusing on even small successes can help motivate a person who is struggling with drugs or alcohol to keep going. “Preaching” at a person or emphasizing failures will not be effective, and could actually encourage the person to abuse the substance to assuage their guilt.For example, you could ask questions such as “What has been going well for you today?” or “What have you been struggling with the most?”
Praise even small successes and efforts. Alcoholics Anonymous is famous for its “One day at a time” motto, which focuses on overcoming addiction on a daily basis, rather than as a monumental task.Check in frequently with the person and encourage any positive behaviors, no matter how small.

, Changes in the person’s daily routine may signify that s/he has started using substances again. Unusual mood swings or increased aggression or defensiveness may occur.Missing school or work regularly, or a drop in performance, may also be a sign of substance abuse.

, Don’t assume that the person’s behavior or attitude is due to substance abuse. Ask directly about problems you’ve observed, but try to avoid sounding accusatory or judgmental.


For example, if your teenager has missed school all week, you could approach him this way: “I just got a call from the school. They told me you haven’t attend all week. Can we talk about the reason why you missed school this week?” This approach offers the other person the chance to share their experience with you, rather than putting them on the defensive.
Avoid harsh or accusative language. For example, an unproductive way of confronting your teenager could look like this: “Your school called and you haven’t shown up all week. Are you using drugs again? You’re grounded.”

, Demonstrate your support for the other person without constantly reminding them of their problems. You don’t want the only time you interact with the person to be when you confront them about their drug or alcohol issues. Socialize with the person. Ask about his or her life. Go out to the movies or dinner. Help them feel comfortable around you, and they may be more comfortable opening up to you.


Offering other opportunities to find enjoyment may also help the person realize that they don’t need to rely on drugs or alcohol as much.

, Addiction is a highly complex neurobiological state.Many of the behaviors that become addictive initially cause a state of intense pleasure, or a “high.” They may also temporarily relieve a sense of sadness or debility, which may cause the person to seek them out as relief.


Most addictive behaviors, such as drug and alcohol use, cause a spike in dopamine, a neurotransmitter in the brain that causes a feeling of pleasure. This heightened level of pleasure can become seen as the “standard” by the person engaging in the addictive behavior. Activities that used to be pleasurable often can no longer compete with the dopamine rush offered by drugs or alcohol.
Addiction changes a person’s reward circuitry. Even in the face of adverse consequences, an addicted person may pursue the reward or relief offered by the substance.
Dependence on a substance happens when more and more of the substance is required to produce the desired effect. Dependence is highly dangerous; larger and larger doses of the substance may be consumed, and this often results in overdose and even death.Several substances, including alcohol and cocaine, damage the frontal lobes of the brain, which help control impulses and manage delayed gratification.Without such regulation, individuals may have significantly impaired judgment and difficulty understanding consequences.Genetic factors also help determine whether an individual will develop an addiction., Research suggests that the availability of social stimulation may play a role in using and developing addictions to substances.Those living with fewer resources, such as individuals living in isolation or poverty, may be more inclined to use harmful substances because of a lack of other options to experience pleasure.


One study showed that rats living in a “resource rich” environment, with sources of pleasure, recreation, and socializing, were less likely to use or become addicted to substances than rats living in “resource poor” environments.It is important to understand how the person’s environment can increase or decrease the potential for him or her to use substancesFor example, parental or family conflict, peer pressure, and high levels of stress are all associated with higher levels of substance abuse., Addiction is more than biology or social pressures. Each person’s unique psychology, their emotions and desires, can affect their predisposition to addiction and how they handle it.Protective factors such as supportive family and friends can help boost an addicted individual’s “resilience,” or ability to deal with their addiction.However, the individual must be motivated to work on his or her behavior.

, The abuse of substances involves a highly complex set of issues, and each person’s situation is unique to him or her. Judging an addicted individual will not help him or her “wake up” to the danger of the situation; it could, however, drive the person away from a source of emotional and moral support. Remember that this person is a person, not merely an “addict.”


Society promotes many myths about addiction. Common beliefs include the idea that substance abusers “have no willpower” or that certain drugs will immediately cause mental illness or psychosis if they are tried “even once.” These beliefs are not supported by research and can promote prejudice against people struggling with substance abuse.Research has shown that many people are less likely to show empathy to someone who is suffering if we believe they somehow “deserve” what they are experiencing. Understanding the complex and tangled web of factors that contribute to addiction may help you avoid falling into this simplistic way of thinking."

Sights and sounds are the most common types of triggers.For example, you may identify your triggers as seeing a commercial or billboard for a casino, seeing people playing cards, watching a lottery drawing, hearing the sound of jingling change, smelling cigarette smoke, etc.
Tell your doctor about the medications you take, including vitamins, herbs, or supplements.

, When you see a doctor or mental health professional, he or she will ask you a lot of questions pertaining to your gambling. You should answer all these questions as honestly as you can. Remember, the goal of seeing a doctor is to cure your gambling addiction, which starts with admitting your problem and being honest.Your doctor may ask when you first started gambling, how many times a week you gamble, and if you have tried to quit gambling before. Your doctor may also ask about how much money you usually bet and if you have ever bet material things instead of money.
Your doctor may ask about your relationships with your family and friends.
Your doctor will probably also ask you if you are serious about treating your gambling problem.

, Only a mental health professional can diagnose you with a gambling disorder, so it is important for you to seek help. A mental health professional may diagnose you with a gambling disorder after giving you a diagnostic test. If you meet the criteria on the DSM-5 test, you will be diagnosed with a gambling disorder. You must have four or more of the listed criteria in a 12-month period to be diagnosed. The criteria includes:The need to gamble more with more money for more excitement
Inability to stop or limit gambling due to feelings of frustration or irritability, or inability to stop or limit gambling when trying
Obsessive thoughts of gambling or ways to get money
Tries to win back money after losing large sums
Lies to family and friends, or has damaged relationships, careers, or education due to gambling
Has to borrow or steal money
Behavior is not due to bipolar or manic episodes

, After you have honestly answered the DSM-5 criteria test, you will be given a score. Your score determines the severity of your gambling problem. The severity of your gambling can help your mental health professional and you figure out the appropriate treatment plan.You have a mild gambling disorder if you meet four to five of the criteria.
You have a moderate gambling disorder if you meet six to seven criteria.
You have a severe gambling disorder if you meet eight to nine criteria.

, The criteria and some additional information provided by you can help your mental health professional decide more specifically what kind of disorder you have. For example, you may have episodic or persistent gambling. If you have episodic gambling disorder, you meet the criteria on the DSM-5, but there are large stretches of time where you don’t gamble. With persistent gambling disorder, you meet the criteria for a sustained, continuous amount of time.Your doctor may also determine if you are in remission. Early remission means you haven’t met any criteria for three months, but you have in the last year. Sustained remission means that no criteria has been met in over a year.

, After you have been diagnosed with your specific gambling problem, you and your mental health professional can figure out a proper treatment plan for you. Since gambling is an addiction, it is not easy to overcome and takes a lot of hard work and dedication on your part. Though the chance for relapse is possible, if you stick with your treatment plan, you can overcome your addiction and regain your life. Common treatment options for gambling disorders include:Cognitive behavioral therapy. This is where your doctor helps you change negative behavior patterns that lead to your gambling. You will work on identifying triggers. You will also learn healthier ways to deal with stress.
Support groups. Gamblers Anonymous is a popular program that can be a helpful treatment for people with a gambling addiction.

So you smoke a pack a day.,
Get someone to help you.,
Make a coin jar.,
Resist the temptation.,
Make a list.,
Keep working your way up.",How to Deal With Addiction2," Take away one cigarette from that pack each day and throw it away. So one day you smoke 20, and the next 19, and so on. Once you get down to half the amount of smoking, or whatever it is, than you had before, you're ready for the next step.;
, Alright, so keep doing half those cigarettes as you had before, or that one glass of wine a day as opposed to two. And get a family member or close friend to make sure you don't cheat and do more. Because after all, you're only cheating yourself. But you may still need some help. Get them to encourage you!

, Many people do this for cursing. Every time you smoke one more than you should (or cheat) you have to put a quarter or a dollar in the coin jar. When it fills up (which it shouldn't) donate the money to charity and start again. No one likes to lose money, right? So it'll break that habit.

, Just one cigarette wouldn't hurt, right? Wrong. You know you want it, but you shouldn't have it. No, it's not right to cheat at any time. Be strict with yourself. Just stop buying it,and make sure that person is still helping you.

, Make a list of all the reasons why you shouldn't do or eat that addiction, and post it by your bedside, or in your wallet, or just somewhere you'd see it daily. That'll remind you.

, Or down, as the case may be. Smoke (or curse or drink or Tweet or whatever) less and less each day. Set yourself a goal every week. If you can't reach it, put more money in that jar. Have friends and family encourage you. Look at that list. You can do it!

"

This is harder, but more effective.,
Busy yourself, so you don't think about whatever the addiction is.,
Have friends/family support you.,
Encourage yourself.",How to Deal With Addiction3," Throw all your cigarettes...or beer, or whatever away. Yes, wasting money, but then there's no way you could be cheating. Just throw it away. Don't buy more. Resist completely. Don't look back. Have someone else do it if you have to.

, Join a club. Go to school. Get a job. Do something! Anything to take your mind off of it, and eventually you'll forget about it altogether.

, Don't let them catch you sneaking a smoke or a Twitter update every now and then. Set yourself a punishment for when you do. Don't make a goal- you know what your goal is- to defeat your addiction. The question is, can you do it?

, It may be hard, even painful at times, but keep reminding yourself why you're doing this. You can get through!

Consider whether you may have an obsession with gambling.,
Reflect on how you use gambling.,
Examine how you feel about gambling.,
Ask yourself if you can quit gambling.,
Think about your relationships.,
Look at your risk factors.",How to Diagnose Compulsive Gambling2," One of the major symptoms of compulsive gambling is an obsession and preoccupation with gambling. You may think about gambling all the time and want to be gambling when you are not. You may get cranky when you can’t gamble, or schedule your life around your gambling.You may spend your time not gambling thinking about your past gambling experiences.

, Many people with a compulsive gambling disorder use gambling to escape from everyday life and troubles. Perhaps you use gambling to help you with your feelings of guilt or helplessness, or use gambling to make you feel better because you are depressed.When you feel depressed or stressed, you feel the need to gamble more than at other times. You distract yourself from your real life with gambling and finding money to gamble.

, People with a gambling problem become addicted to the thrill of betting. They feel excitement from placing bets and taking risks, especially when they place big bets. Due to the nature of the addiction, the risks generally continually get bigger and bigger, which can lead to debt and other serious problems.Because you may need a bigger bet to get the same thrill, you may start betting things you don’t have, like large sums of money, or placing bets with things you can’t lose, like cars, personal items, or homes.
You may find yourself having to borrow money or steal so you can keep gambling and making bigger bets.

, Compulsive gamblers are different than social gamblers because they do not set a limit for themselves. If a compulsive gambler loses all of his or her money, he or she won’t just get up and walk away. A compulsive gambler will keep playing so he or she can recover the money lost. This leads to more losses.Compulsive gamblers spend time they should be at work or with family and friends to gamble. They are unable to control the impulse to gamble.
You may have tried to stop gambling in the past but have been unable to stop.

, Another way to determine if you are a compulsive gambler is to look at your relationships. This includes your family or your work relationships. Compulsive gambling can lead to strains in your relationships because you are lying and hiding your gambling from your family. You may face problems at work because you are missing work or your work is not up to par because you are distracted.You may have put strain on relationships because you have asked to borrow money or failed to pay back loans you’ve received from friends used to pay your gambling debts. You may have upset friends by asking for money multiple times.

, Most people will be able to gamble socially throughout their lives without any problems. However, anyone can develop a gambling problem. There are some characteristics that increase your risk for a gambling addiction. These include:Other mental disorders. For example, compulsive gamblers are often alcoholics or have another substance abuse problem. Mental disorders such as ADHD, major depression, or bipolar may also contribute to it.
Age and sex. Being a compulsive gambler is more common in younger or middle-aged men. However, women can also develop a gambling addiction, especially if they are bipolar or have anxiety or depression disorders.
Family history of gambling.
Being competitive, restless, a workaholic, or easily bored.

Provide a self-assessment of your RA.,
Answer the medical questionnaire.,
Get baseline testing.,
Take prescribed medications as directed.,
Track your progress at home.,
Respond to the standardized questionnaire again.,
Determine progress with testing.,
Switch medications as necessary.,
Schedule a follow-up visit with your rheumatologist.",How to Use Treat to Target Therapy for RA," A rheumatologist is a doctor who specializes in treating arthritis. If you have RA and would like to try TTT, schedule an appointment with your rheumatologist or rheumatic disease expert. The doctor can discuss your TTT options with you and help formulate the best treatment plan for your specific case of RA.Locate rheumatic disease experts who may practice TTT online by consulting organizations such as the American College of Rheumatology.Keep in mind that early detection and recognition of RA is essential for treatment, so see a rheumatologist as soon as you notice symptoms.;
, Whenever you meet with your doctor to discuss TTT for RA, you’ll undergo a multi-part examination. This helps establish the baseline for measuring your progress. During your first visit, talk to your doctor about your specific goals for TTT, which often include complete RA remission.Ask your doctor questions about his or her goals for you. Make sure that you and your doctor are on the same page about your TTT. For example, “I would like this TTT to significantly decrease my symptoms. What do you envision the treatment protocol doing for me? Oh… you think remission is possible? That would be my ultimate goal.”
Let your doctor know about any concerns you have or how the TTT protocol will look for you. For example, “Are there possible negative side effects?""

, Any initial or follow up appointments with your rheumatic disease expert should include a self-assessment of your RA. For this, you will talk to your doctor about how you are feeling and any issues that you may be experiencing.Keep a daily journal to note your symptoms and how you are feeling. This can serve as a useful tool for you to track your own progress. A journal can also cue your doctor in to how you’re doing on a daily basis and determine effective treatments. For example, “I feel a lot of inflammation and burning in my hands and feet today” or, “My joints were really stiff when I got up from my desk after work.”

, The second part of any exam for TTT is a medical questionnaire. This is standardized and your doctor will ask you a specific set of questions about your symptoms. From this and your self-assessment, the doctor can make a determination about your symptoms and begin formulating the best targeted treatment for you.Be honest when you answer the doctor’s questions. You shouldn’t feel ashamed of any of your answers. Remember that your doctor is trying to relieve your RA. For example, “Dr. Bob, I spent most of last week in bed. I had a fever and was so tired that I couldn’t move. Then this made my joint stiffness worse. I really feel like once I get one symptom, then more quickly follow it.”

, Your doctor will prescribe laboratory tests as the third part of your exams. These tests measure things such as the amount of inflammatory proteins in your blood. They’ll help your doctor set a baseline against which to track your progress during treatment., In most cases, target-to-treat therapy for RA is a combination of medications that you take. Over time, these are adjusted as necessary to control your RA symptoms. It’s important to follow your doctor’s instructions on how to take your medications to get maximum benefit from the treatment.Recognize that TTT and conventional medical treatment for RA usually includes so-called DMARDS, or disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, as the initial medication. Early use of DMARDs is important when treating RA. Methotrexate is the most common DMARD used.
For example, a TTT drug protocol for RA might include: a weekly 15-milligram dose of methotrexate that is increased to 25 milligrams if you respond poorly to it. Your doctor may add sulfasalazine after 12 weeks if it is necessary. If you are still not responding at 6 months, your doctor may replace the sulfasalazine with an anti-TNF biologic agent such as etanercept (Enbrel) or tofacitinib (Xeljanz).You may also want to discuss anti-inflammatory agents with your doctor, such as steroids and over the counter NSAIDs like ibuprofen and naproxen.

, Your doctor will schedule a follow up visit to check your progress every one to three months. Tracking how you feel at home during treatment can help you identify progress, however small, in your RA symptoms. It can also help your doctor track your progress between visits.Write how you are feeling and any issues in a notebook every day. Provide your doctor with it at each visit, which can inform decisions about treatment going forward.

, At each checkup, your doctor will ask you the same questions about your symptoms from your first visit. This clinical tool can also help measure your progress with specific medication protocols.Some typical questions your doctor may ask at follow up visits include:Do you notice any difference in your symptoms with the medication?
Where do you have pain? Has it gotten better or worse since your last visit?
Do you have difficulty performing daily activities such as bathing or dressing?

, Your doctor will use your baseline tests and counts to gauge your progress with a specific treatment protocol. This requires undergoing subsequent rounds of testing. Lab tests will again measure the inflammatory proteins in your blood, which can show how treatment is affecting your RA.In addition, examining your joints can provide a “disease activity score,” or DAS, that can indicate any progress.


Joint counts examine a specific set of joints and counts how many are swollen and/or tender. When combined with other factors, the tally of the joint count generates the DAS. This can provide further tangible evidence that your treatment is working or may need tweaking., If your medication relieves your RA symptoms for three months without needing to be switched, your doctor may consider you in remission. However, you may not have any measurable progress with your current treatments. If this happens, your doctor will adapt your treatment protocol to try a new medication. You may take the new drugs for another one to three months to see if your RA gets better. If not, your doctor will continue to try new medications until one puts your RA in remission.Ask your doctor to switch any medications that cause you uncomfortable side effects. These may include: nausea, vomiting, mouth sores, rash, or diarrhea. Seek prompt medical attention if you develop shortness of breath or a chronic cough., Effective treatment of RA includes regular appointments with your doctor. This can help manage symptoms, adjust treatment as necessary, or simply check to ensure you’re in remission. Your doctor may suggest appointment every month to every six months."

Watch for the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis.,
Understand the risk factor for getting rheumatoid arthritis.,
Learn how rheumatoid arthritis is diagnosed.",How to Use Aloe Vera to Treat Rheumatoid Arthritis," Gel from the aloe vera plant is a traditional treatment for wounds, burns, infections and some kinds of joint pain and arthritis.You can use it directly on the joints or drink aloe vera juice to decrease inflammation. Aloe vera may be useful for RA because of its anti-inflammatory properties, its property as a pain-reliever (likely due to the anti-inflammatory properties) and in speeding up wound-healing.It is also a safe moisturizing and anti-aging agent.The gel comes from the central part of the aloe leaf, known as the ""inner fillet."" It contains larger complex sugars than aloe juice does. These complex sugars are thought to be responsible for the benefits of aloe.The juice is extracted from the outer leaves and also contains complex sugars.;
, If you have a mature aloe plant, cut off a leaf using a pair of sharp scissors and peel away the outer leaf to reveal the clear gel inside. Use your fingers to get the gel out or cut the end off the leaf and squeeze the gel out.


If you want to purchase the gel, check online or at your local health food store. Buy organic aloe vera with no additives or preservatives.

, At first, apply the aloe to a small area to test for any possible reactions. If a rash or other problems develop, stop using it. If there's no skin irritation, spread the gel onto the areas that are bothering you the most. Apply it like you would any other lotion. This will give you temporary relief from the pain of rheumatoid arthritis. As long as there's no skin irritation, you can keep treating the pain with aloe vera as long as you want.


Most people don't experience side effects, but aloe may cause redness, a burning or a stinging sensation and rarely, a short-term rash., Aloe vera juice has been reported to decrease immune responses which may be helpful in RA. Drinking aloe vera juice can cause cramping, diarrhea and gas.If this happens, stop drinking it. Drinking aloe vera juice can lower blood sugar and interfere with diabetes medications, so don't drink the juice for more than 3 to 4 weeks. It can also decrease the absorption of steroid creams, and decrease potassium levels if you drink the juice. Always talk to a knowledgeable healthcare professional before combining any medications with supplements, including topical or oral aloe vera.


While there are no long-term studies of internal aloe vera's effects, one study found a link between the juice and colon cancer.The Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) does not recommend drinking aloe vera. But, it strongly recommends using aloe vera topically., Look for organic aloe vera juice (like Lily of the Desert or Nature's Way) with no additives or preservatives. Start with small amounts, like 2 to 3 ounces once a day, to see how you react to the juice. Work your way up to 2 to 3 ounces 3 times a day. It does taste a little bitter and may take some getting used to. You can try adding 1 teaspoon of honey to the juice or mix it with a fruit juice till you like the flavor.



Never drink the gel since it contains a strong laxative and can cause diarrhea., Try to eat mainly organic foods. These contain no pesticides or other chemicals, like hormones and antibiotics, which may be related to an increased risk of inflammation. You should also limit the amount of processed and pre-packaged food you eat. This will limit additives and preservatives that may cause increased inflammation in some people.This will also ensure you're eating complex carbohydrates, not simple carbs which can increase levels of inflammation.


Try to cook from scratch, using whole foods. This will preserve most of the vitamins, minerals, and nutrients.
A rule of thumb is that if the food is too white-- like white bread, white rice, white pasta, it has been processed. Instead, eat whole grain breads, brown rice and whole grain pasta., Aim for 2/3 of your total diet coming from fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.Fruits and vegetables have high levels of antioxidants which might decrease inflammation. Try to choose fresh produce. Frozen can also be used, but you should avoid eating vegetables in any sort of fattening creamy sauce. Avoid fruits that have sugar or heavy syrup. Instead, choose brightly colored fruits and vegetables with lots of antioxidants. These include:


Berries (blueberries and raspberries)
Apples
Plums
Oranges
Citrus
Leafy green vegetables
Winter and Summer squash
Bell peppers

, Fiber can decrease inflammation.Try to make sure you're getting a minimum of 20-35 gm of fiber daily. High-fiber foods include whole grains, fruits, vegetables, beans and legumes, and seeds. The following are great sources of fiber:Brown rice, bulgar wheat, buckwheat, oats, millet, quinoa
Apples, pears, figs, dates, grapes, berries of all kinds
Leafy green vegetables (spinach, mustard, collard, Swiss chard, kale), carrots, broccoli, brussel sprouts, bok choy, beets
Peas, lentils, all beans (kidney, black, white, lima)
Pumpkin seeds, sesame seeds, sunflower seeds, and nuts including almonds, pecans, walnuts and pistachio nuts.

, If you do eat meats, make sure the beef is lean (preferably grass fed since it has the natural ratio of omega-3 and omega-6 fats), and the poultry is skinless. Any meat you eat should be raised without hormones or antibiotics and you should trim the fat. Limiting meat will help reduce your saturated fat intake, something the American Heart Association recommends that you limit to less than 7% of your total daily calories.You can avoid saturated fats by not using butter, margarine, and shortening in your cooking. Instead, use olive or canola oils.
The AHA also recommends that you avoid all trans fats. Read food labels and avoid any that have ""partially hydrogenated fats."" This means the product has trans fats, even if the label says ""0 trans fats."", Fish is good quality protein and has good amounts of the healthier omega-3 fats. Higher omega-3 fat intake is associated with a decreased level of inflammation. Fish with higher levels of omega-3 fats include: salmon, tuna, trout, sardines and mackerel.


Don't forget to drink plenty of water and stay hydrated.

, Certain spices and herbs can reduce the pain associated with rheumatoid arthritis inflammation. Several of these exist as supplements (garlic, turmeric/curcumin, omega-3 fatty acids, and vitamin C and E), but be sure to talk to your doctor before taking them. It's better to get them from diet, rather than supplements. These herbs and spices include:Garlic
Turmeric/Curcumin
Basil
Oregano
Cloves
Cinnamon
Ginger
Chili peppers

, Exercise can help maintain overall health and strong muscles and bones. A physical therapist can help you determine the most beneficial type of exercise. But, don't forget that exercise can mean low-impact activities like aerobics, weigh training, walking, hiking, Tai Chi, or yoga. All these can help maintain strength and flexibility.Be sure to balance rest and exercise. If you have a rheumatoid arthritis flare up, it's more helpful to take a short break instead of prolonged bed rest., These include anti-inflammatory agents. Your doctor may also prescribe antibodies made against tumor necrosis factor. It's not clear how these drugs function in rheumatoid arthritis, but they're usually used alongside anti-inflammatory drugs.Or, you may also be prescribed a newer agent, biologics which are human genetically engineered proteins, combined with anti-inflammatory agents.Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and analgesics are used along with other medications.


DMARDs, like methotrexate can cause serious liver injury and hypersensitivity reactions. Other side effects can include fever, fatigue, cough, and trouble breathing., The first signs and symptoms are tender and swollen joints that often feel warm to the touch. Many people with rheumatoid arthritis have relatively mild pain and stiffness but experience periodic “flare ups” where the signs and symptoms get worse. Other people have constant, chronic symptoms. As the disease progresses, joints and bones can become damaged, leading to increasing loss of function, although early treatment can limit the damage.Other symptoms may include:


Fatigue, muscle pain, and general stiffness that lasts at least 1 hour after waking or after a long rest period (unlike the pain and stiffness of osteoarthritis, which dissipates faster).Suffering from other disorders more frequently than those without the disease. These may include other autoimmune diseases (like Sjogren's Syndrome), vasculitis (an inflammation of the blood vessels), anemia (lower than normal numbers of red blood cells that carry oxygen to tissues), and lung disease.
Rheumatoid nodules, which develop in up to 35% of individuals with rheumatoid arthritis. The nodules show up as bumps under the skin near the affected joint, most commonly near the elbows. They're not usually painful, are freely movable under the skin and can range in size from a pea up to the size of a lemon., While the cause of rheumatoid arthritis isn't known, it seems to be linked to genetic factors. It's likely that inheriting a group of genes, not a single gene, increases your risk of rheumatoid arthritis. Hormones and environmental factors also play a role in developing the disease.Men and women of any race or ethnic background can get rheumatoid arthritis, but it occurs in women more frequently than in men. Women are about 2 to 3 times more likely to get the disease, which most often begins in middle age.

, Rheumatoid arthritis is diagnosed using your signs, symptoms, medical and family history along with a physical exam. Your doctor will then use the diagnosis to create a treatment plan, with the primary goal being reduction of the pain by reducing inflammation and minimizing any damage to the joints.To diagnose rheumatoid arthritis, your doctor will do:


Lab tests, including x-rays or other imaging of the affected joints
Blood samples, specifically one to examine blood for Rheumatoid Factor (RF) and other non-specific tests. The RF test can diagnose rheumatoid arthritis, while the non-specific ones indicate underlying inflammation.Diagnostic tests to rule out other conditions that mimic rheumatoid arthritis (such as infectious arthropathies - painful joints from infection, Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), ankylosing spondylitis -which primarily affects the spine and larger joints, and fibromyalgia)."

Knowing your risk factors will dictate when you start getting screened. Being aware of certain medical and lifestyle risks can help you catch colon cancer early and give you a high chance of survival. Most colon cancers occur after age 50, and African-Americans are at higher risk than other races., If you have one or more relatives who have had colon cancer, your chances of getting the disease increases.If you have a family history of colon cancer, you should consult your doctor and see if he would recommend screening.

, Inflammatory bowel diseases like Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis can increase your risk for colon cancer. If you've been diagnosed with either of these conditions, you are at an increased risk and should consult with your doctor regularly. Certain genetic conditions like familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (Lynch syndrome) or diabetes can increase your risk of colon cancer., Certain lifestyles put you at greater risk for colon cancer. There are a number of these, including:Being overweight or obese.
Sedentary lifestyle.
Smoking.
Drinking heavily (more than two drinks a day)A diet high in red meat and processed foods or low in fiber, fruits, and vegetables

, If you have experienced any of the following, you should visit a doctor.


Blood in your stool.
Persistent stomach pain.
Rapid weight loss without trying.

, Fortunately, colon cancer often begins as benign colorectal polyps. Removal prevents them from growing into cancerous tumors.Because of this, medical experts agree that the most effective way to prevent colon cancer is through regular screening.


For normal adults with no risk factors, screening should begin at age 50.
Adults with specific risk factors should begin earlier. Consult your doctor and see when he would recommend you begin screening if you have one or more risk factors for colon cancer.

, While your doctor can recommend which test will work best for you, it helps to know what to expect with some of these tests.


Colonoscopy. This test involves inserting a camera into the colon and getting a full internal view. This is usually considered the most accurate test. Another advantage is that if the doctor spots any polyps or growths, he can remove them on the spot.CT Colonography. Also known as a virtual colonoscopy, this involves using a CT scanner to create a digital picture of the inside of your colon. This is an option if you cannot undergo a full colonoscopy.Flexible Sigmoidoscopy. This is similar to a colonoscopy, except the doctor uses a smaller tube to examine only the lower third of your colon.Stool test. This detects blood in your stool, which is an early symptom or sign of colon cancer., This usually varies from every five to ten years, depending on the particular test and the findings of your last screening. Sticking to this regular schedule can significantly decrease your risk for colon cancer. However, your doctor may recommend stool tests more frequently.

, Fiber helps waste move smoothly through your digestive system. This is significant because waste buildup is thought to cause polyps that eventually develop into cancer. Not only can increasing your fiber intake help prevent cancer, but it is good for your overall health.There are several high-fiber foods that you could easily add to your diet.Fresh fruits, especially berries with seeds. Leave the skin on all the fruit you eat, as this will give you the highest amount of fiber.
Vegetables. Leafy and crunchy vegetables usually offer the highest amount of fiber. For potatoes, leave the skin on to get the most fiber.
Whole grains. White products have been bleached and lack many of the nutrients found in whole grain products. Switch to whole grain bread, pasta, cereal, and oatmeal to easily increase your fiber intake.
Beans. You can easily incorporate beans into soups and salads to get a high dose of fiber.
Brown rice. Like white bread, white rice doesn't offer many nutrients. Convert to brown rice to add more fiber to your diet.
You could also try a fiber supplement like Metamucil or Konsyl if you're not getting enough fiber out of your regular diet.

, The acid these foods produce in the colon can stimulate tumor and polyp growth.Animal fats are generally linked to cancer and should be eaten in moderation. Red meat like beef and pork specifically should not be eaten in excess.Processed and frozen foods can also be high in fat and other chemicals that could increase your risk for colon cancer.

, Evidence exists that folic acid can help prevent and fight cancer. Some good sources of folic acid are citrus fruits and leafy green vegetables like spinach.Make sure you get your folic acid from food. Tests are unclear whether folic acid supplements will help prevent cancer., Evidence suggests that calcium helps prevent the formation of precancerous polyps.Some good sources of calcium are:


Dairy products like milk, yogurt, and cheese. Dairy products are most commonly cited among foods high in calcium. Softer cheeses like ricotta and mozzarella generally have higher concentrations of calcium.
Green vegetables. Spinach, broccoli, broccoli rabe, and kale contain high doses of calcium.
Sardines and salmon. While all fish is good for your health, these two in particular are high in calcium. Canned sardines contain some of the highest concentrations of calcium in any food.
Soybeans. Eating soybeans plain or incorporating soy-based products into your diet is a great way to give your body a high dose of calcium.

, Antioxidants help repair cells and can bolster your body's defense against precancerous polyps.You don't need to take supplements to give your body antioxidants. There are several foods packed with antioxidants that you can easily add to your diet.Berries. Blueberries, strawberries, and raspberries in particular contain antioxidants and help fight inflammation that could cause precancerous polyps.
Nuts. Different nuts often contain different kinds of antioxidants. For example, walnuts are high in omega-3's, while Brazil nuts are high in selenium. Eat a variety of nuts to add a plethora of antioxidants to your diet.
Green, leafy vegetables. In addition to fiber, calcium, potassium, and magnesium, these vegetables are also a great source of antioxidants. Spinach, kale, broccoli, and lettuce will add a multitude of cancer-fighting nutrients to your diet.
Green tea. While all tea offers valuable nutrients, green tea contains the most potent and plentiful antioxidants. You can look for decaf options if you are sensitive to caffeine.

, The nutrients on this list can also be found in a number of dietary supplements. If you aren't getting enough out of your diet, the following supplements can also help reduce your risk of colon cancer. Your doctor can advise you about supplements if you are unsure of your needs.


Calcium.
Magnesium.
B vitamins.
Omega-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids.
Vitamin D.

, If you smoke, quit. If you don't smoke, don't start. Smoking has been linked not only to multiple types of cancer, but a wide array of other health problems. It is overall best to avoid this habit altogether., While a small amount of alcohol is actually considered beneficial and healthy, more than this can jeopardize your health. If you average more than two drinks daily, you may be at an increased risk for colon cancer.If you are a heavy drinker, it is best to cut back and lower your chances of adverse health effects.

, Being overweight or obese puts at a greater risk for a number of health problems, including colon cancer. You can help improve your chances of avoiding cancer by either maintaining a healthy weight or losing weight if you have to. Work with your doctor to find out what your ideal weight is, then stay as close to this goal as possible., A sedentary lifestyle puts you at increased risk for colon cancer. Regular physical activity can help prevent cancers and is also great for over physical and mental health. An ideal goal is at least 30 minutes of physical activity daily.

Learn as much as you can about your particular treatment plan and how chemotherapy may affect your body.,
Get pre-chemotherapy tests, such as X-rays and heart scans.,
Focus on improving your overall health to reduce potential chemotherapy side effects.,
Be prepared to deal with chemotherapy's side effects.,
Make backup plans for work, school and childcare so that when you are feeling crummy, someone else can step up and handle your daily responsibilities.,
Think positively about your chemotherapy treatment.",How to Prepare for Breast Cancer Chemotherapy1," Ask about how long treatments will take and how many chemotherapy sessions the doctor has prescribed.


Discuss in detail with your doctor the particular drug cocktail that will be part of your chemotherapy. Do some research. Remember that you have the final say in what goes in your body for treatment.
Find a breast cancer support group so that you can share some of your concerns and learn from others. While knowledge can help ease some anxiety, remember that not everyone will be affected in the same way.;
, You'll also need to decide how you want your chemo to be delivered: through a regular IV or a port. A port requires minor surgery prior to chemotherapy.

,


Get plenty of sleep overnight and rest often during the day if possible.
Minimize stressful situations. Try meditation and yoga as relaxation techniques or take a bubble bath and listen to relaxing music. Deep breathing exercises can also help.
Eat a balanced diet with plenty of vegetables, fruits and whole grains.
Avoid infections by steering clear of people who are sick. Schedule an appointment with your dentist and ask your doctor if you need any additional vaccinations to help protect your body during chemotherapy.

,


Have a supply of anti-nausea drugs at the ready. Your doctor may even suggest taking them for several days prior to your chemotherapy treatment.
Chemotherapy sometimes causes hair loss. If this is the case with you, have your hairdresser shave your head, and buy a wig, scarf, or hat as you will most likely experience hair loss as part of your chemotherapy side effects.

,


Get advice from a counselor about how to talk to your children about your chemotherapy. Discuss what kind of changes they can expect in not only their daily routine, but also your appearance.

, Visualize it working and reducing your tumor.

You will probably not be allowed to drive, and you may be sent home with JP drains that will need care. Share this information with the people who will be taking care of you after your surgery.


Ask how long you are likely to be in the hospital after your surgery. Some people go home the same day, others stay a day or longer.;
, Ask your family doctor to recommend a surgeon, and meet with your surgeon and anesthesiologist before your surgery. Ask any questions you have. They will talk to you about your medical history and make a plan for what type of surgery you will have and when.Tell your doctors about any medications, vitamins, or supplements that you’re taking.If you take aspirin or a blood-thinner, you will have to stop taking it temporarily before your surgery.
You cannot eat or drink for 8-12 hours before your surgery; your doctors will give you specific instructions that you must follow.

, Take a robe and slippers to the hospital to keep comfortable during your stay. Bring your toothbrush and other hygiene products. Pack a book, some magazines, and other items to occupy your time during your initial hospital recovery., You will need to recover at home for a while, possibly for as long as six weeks. Talk to your head of Human Resources department at work, and your supervisor. Your doctor can give you an idea of how long you should miss work, and if necessary they can write a letter to your employer. You may need to:


File paperwork for short-term disability
Plan for others to take over large projects that you are working on
Share information that others will need to take over your daily tasks

, You may need help caring for yourself at first - you will have difficulty bathing, and you will not be able to drive for several weeks. Enlist friends, family, or professional staff to help you. Set up your sleeping arrangements to be near a bathroom, and avoid the use of stairs - you will likely be sent home with medications that may make you dizzy. Plan for child-care if you usually take care of the kids., After your surgery, you should concentrate on recovering. You may want to do the following beforehand:


Clean your house
Do your laundry
Pay your bills
Trim your hair (short enough that someone can shampoo it in a sink for you)

, There are a few things that you will want to have on hand, such as gauze bandages, bandage tape, antibiotic ointment, and over-the-counter pain relievers. The doctor may give you some of these, but it's good to have some just in case. Get supplies at your local pharmacy or drug store.

, Stay away from complicated ""cancer cure"" diets and concentrate on eating wholesome, balanced, protein-rich foods, and a good complement of fruits and vegetables. Stock up on these items before your surgery so you have a stocked fridge when you get home.


Consider signing up for a service that delivers meals, or purchasing frozen pre-prepared meals for a couple of weeks to make your mealtimes easier., You will not be allowed to get your incision site wet for several weeks. You can learn to sink bathe or sponge bathe, but you may prefer a hand-held shower attachment.


You may find it much easier to wash yourself in the bathtub sitting on a bath stool.
Dry shampoo can be handy for the first couple of weeks, until you can wash your hair again., A week or two before your surgery, try doing things one-handed with what will be your ""good"" arm. Try brushing your hair, tying it up, brushing your teeth, washing yourself, and eating. Remember that while you'll be able to move your affected arm, you won't be able to raise it above your shoulder for a week or two. You will also have little strength in the affected arm, or only have strength in certain directions.


If you’re having a double mastectomy, be sure to have plenty of time to recover and people to help you with tasks and daily activities.

, You will need several changes of loose, comfortable clothes that open completely in the front. For several weeks, you will not be able to put on anything over your head, or wear anything that is close around your body or under your armpits, including a bra.Acquire some comfortable items such as:


Several nightgowns or nightshirts that button open completely in the front
Two or three pairs of sweatpants or yoga pants with elastic waistbands
Slippers with non-slip soles
A loose coat or blanket to wear if it's cold
Special mastectomy bras or bra inserts, if available, You may not be able to lie on your side or stomach for several weeks after surgery. Try to obtain a ""bed wedge"" or wedged pillow, and several extra pillows. While not essential, a wedge-shaped pillow will make you much more comfortable than a stack of pillows. You will probably want some more pillows to prop you up as you sleep, and to support your affected arm.


Look for affordable wedge pillows at big box stores or your local pharmacy, or shop online.

, You will likely be sent home with some medications such as pain relievers. Many of these have side effects, which often include constipation. Have some gentle laxatives available, and use them as directed by your doctor if constipation is a problem.

, You will not be able to do anything strenuous or active for a while, and prescription pain relievers are likely to affect your memory and thinking, so don't plan on making any important decisions while you're using them. Plan for some gentle activities that bring you pleasure. Choose activities that can be picked up and put down easily. Select reading material that isn't demanding, learn to knit, binge-watch your favorite television programs, or pick up a new hobby!

, Think about how open you want to be about your upcoming surgery. Some people you really do need to tell, but generally it is up to you. There is no etiquette in cancer, and there are no social protocols for you to follow. Think carefully, and then do what's right for you.


You do not have to go through this alone! Share your feelings and needs with those who make you feel comfortable, safe, and cared for.

, You will need help after you get home from the hospital. Many health plans offer visiting nurse services to assist with changing your bandages, but they will not bathe you, cook, or do your laundry. Talk to people you are emotionally close to, and try to have someone stay with you while you recover. Share your thoughts and feelings with your partner, family, friends, therapist – people who are supportive and caring.


Join a support group in your community or online, or consider seeing a therapist who specializes in cancer. You can find professionals in your area through the American Psychosocial Oncology Society (APOS) Helpline., Do stress-relieving activities before your surgery like yoga, meditation, deep breathing, taking walks – anything that helps you relax. Practice these skills now and continue them after your surgery. Practice mindfulness meditation on a daily basis.Get clearance from your doctor before doing anything physical like walking or yoga.

, Work on building up your strength and flexibility before surgery – this can help you feel stronger and more in control afterwards. For breast surgery, try to focus on your upper body and back.Feeling physically strong may help you recover better and feel emotionally strong, as well., Breast reconstruction surgery can make your breast feel and look more natural following your mastectomy. This procedure can be done during your mastectomy or in a separate surgery afterwards.Breast reconstruction may not be important to you, or it may be a big part of the healing process – everyone is different. Spend some time thinking about what feels important to you, and whether further surgery may help you feel more comfortable in your body.

Consider talking to a therapist and/or a plastic surgeon about your feelings and options.Every surgery has risks, including breast reconstruction; talk to your doctor for more information.
Some organizations, such as AiRS Foundation, help women to afford breast reconstruction surgeries.

Make a treatment plan.,
Make lifestyle changes.,
Go in for your radiation simulation.,
Eat healthy meals.,
Enlist help from a caregiver, friends, or family.,
Join a support group.",How to Prepare for Cancer Treatment2," This should be your first step after your cancer diagnosis. To begin, locate a cancer center or oncologist. Ask your primary care doctor for referrals or recommendations for an oncologist that specializes in your type of cancer.If you live in the United States then you can call the American College of Surgeon’s Commission on Cancer at 312-202-5085 or visit their website to find an accredited cancer treatment center.Look into your local cancer treatment centers as well.
If you do not live in the United States, then you can visit the International Cancer Information Service Group website for a complete list of cancer treatment centers and phone numbers in your country.Try to find the cancer treatment center that is closest to you.
Meet with your new cancer specialist or oncologist. It’s important to meet face-to-face as soon as possible; cancer can be an aggressive disease, and you’ll want to begin treatment as soon as possible. Any preparation you do before treatment will help ease your feelings of anxiety.
Bring up any questions related to treatment. These can include questions about the length of ongoing treatment, success rates and risks and side-effects you may experience from the treatment.
Ask the oncologist about alternative treatments or remedies they may have for your cancer.

, Chemotherapy and radiation treatment can take months, and may require dramatic lifestyle adjustments. You may need to take time off from work if the treatment will temporarily incapacitate you or require you to relax.


To make the most of your time at home, rearrange your living space so everything is situated for comfort and convenience.Find a set of bedside drawers to keep your medications in, and make sure you have easy access to water from your bed or couch.

, You’ll only need to do this if you’re undergoing radiation therapy. A radiation simulation is done so your oncologists can find the best position to target the tumor and kill the cancer cells during your upcoming treatments. The simulation also gives the doctors an opportunity to determine what dose of radiation you’ll receive.You will not receive actual radiation during the simulation.

, This will strengthen your body and increase your energy before treatment. Throughout your treatment process, your tastes may change and you may also experience nausea. To ensure that you get the nutrition you need, try to eat more foods that are high in protein and calories.


Buy food that doesn’t require lots of preparation or cook meals in advance and freeze them before your treatment. This will help make the healing process easier and more relaxing.
It’s also important to keep hydrated during your treatment. Water is best, but drinking soda or even broth is better than nothing. Keep fluids around you in every room of your house.Speak to your oncologist or cancer specialist before you implement a diet change, especially if you have experienced weight loss.

, It’s crucial that you have a support network during this time. You’ll feel mentally and physically exhausted, and will need the emotional (and sometimes physical) support of people close to you.


Don’t be afraid to ask for help. Contact friends and family or hire a housekeeper to assist you with chores such as cleaning, cooking, laundry, and more.
Depending on the severity of your cancer treatment, you may need to hire a caregiver to administer medication on a regular basis or to help you with activities such as eating or bathing., It’s important that you can share the experiences you’re going through with other individuals who are also going to cancer treatment. You can comfort and reassure one another, and share treatment tips and experiences to help you cope with your treatment.


Speak to your cancer specialist or oncologist about support groups for people with your specific cancer type, such as breast cancer or lung cancer.
You could also join an online support group. Although these will not provide face-to-face connection, they’ll still allow you to connect with people and receive support.

Talk with your surgeon about what surgery will entail.,
Take the tests that your doctor requires.,
Prepare for the operation itself.,
Make a recovery plan.",How to Prepare for Cancer Treatment3," Find out as much information as you can about the side effects, benefits, and risks of the procedure.If the cancer is resectable (can be removed completely with surgery), then surgery is often used as a first step in cancer treatment. If the surgery works, your cancer will be removed; if surgery doesn’t remove all of the malignant tissue, you may need to be treated with chemotherapy or radiation. Ask your doctor:


“What are the chances of this surgery removing all the cancer?”
“Will I need to receive any other treatments before or after surgery?”
“Exactly what will you do or remove in this surgery?”

, In the weeks before surgery, you’ll need to visit your doctor’s office to take a number of pre-surgery tests. These tests will help your surgeon get a full picture of your health, and then plan your surgery.Pre-surgery tests will include:


Blood tests, to measure your blood sugar level, blood cell counts, how quickly your blood clots, and how well your liver and kidneys are working.
Chest x-ray to check your lungs.
Electrocardiogram (EKC) to evaluate your heart’s electrical system.

, Work with your doctors and follow any directions they give you. Prior to surgery, you should avoid eating food or drinking anything for 12 hours.Your doctor may also ask you to shave hair off of the area of your body closest to the cancer, so they can make a clean incision.
Be careful to protect yourself from getting sick prior to surgery. Your immune system may be weakened from the cancer and treatment, so make sure that you are not exposed to sick people, avoid large crowds, and practice good hand hygiene to avoid getting sick.

, After your surgery, you’ll need to spend time recovering at your home. Depending on the severity of your surgery, you may have decreased mobility at first. In this case, you should have someone rearrange things about your house so you don’t need to go up and down stairs.Talk to your doctor and see if you need to be on a special or modified diet for any length of time following your surgery.
Also ask your doctor about how long it will be before you can return to your normal daily activities. For example, you may not be able to drive or have sex for two to three weeks after your surgery."

Limit exposure to radiation.,
Understand what kinds of radiation do not cause brain cancer.,
Change your eating and nutritional habits.,
Exercise regularly.,
Learn the symptoms.,
Have a doctor diagnose brain cancer.,
Treat brain cancer.,
Learn the risks of not getting treatment.",How to Prevent Brain Cancer," Doctors do not know what causes brain in most cases, but there are certain factors that can increase your risk. Knowing these factors can help you identify your risk and potential symptoms, and get regular checkups.The main risk factors for brain cancer include age, exposure to radiation, a family history of brain tumors, and currently having cancer that could metastasize (spread) to your brain from another area of your body.The brain, like the liver and lungs, has a lot of blood vessels. If a “seed” of cancer travels from elsewhere in the body, the chances of it settling in these areas with many blood vessels is higher. This is why having cancer elsewhere in your body puts you at elevated risk.;
, Any person, from children to the elderly, can develop brain cancer; however, your risk for the disease increases the older you get.Recognizing this and being aware of your body may help you to seek a medical opinion if you notice any symptoms of brain cancer.Some brain tumors and cancer, such as brainstem gliomas and astrocytomas, are almost exclusively present in children., Keep a detailed record of your family’s medical history, including cases of cancer and tumors. If you have a family history of brain tumors or certain genetic syndromes that increase risk for brain cancer, you are at a higher risk of developing cancer of the brain or surrounding areas.Understanding your family medical history of brain cancer can identify potential symptoms and treatment options.


It’s always wise to keep a personal record of your family’s medical history and to have one at your doctor’s office.
Only 5 – 10% of all cancers are hereditary.A family history of Li-Fraumeni syndrome, neurofibromatosis, tuberous sclerosis and Turcot syndrome may make you more susceptible to brain cancer., Different types of radiation can increase your risk of developing brain cancer. Limiting your exposure to radiation may help you prevent developing the disease.Ionizing radiation, which is present in some radiation therapies for cancer or atomic bombs, increases your risk of brain cancer. You may not be able to limit your exposure to ionizing radiation if you are undergoing treatment for another cancer. The likelihood of being exposed through an atomic bomb or nuclear meltdown is low.Ultraviolet radiation, which the sun emits, can also increase your risk for brain cancer. Wearing sunscreen and a head cover and limiting sun exposure may decrease your risk., People are often exposed to more common forms of radiation including electromagnetic fields or radiofrequency radiation.Although some people believe that these types of radiation cause brain cancer, there is no evidence linking them to brain tumors.Studies have not linked radiation from power lines, cell phones, smartphones, or microwaves to brain cancer.Stay abreast of research on radiation exposure, which may help identify your risk factors.

, There is some evidence that nutritional habits during fetal development, childhood and into adulthood may decrease your risk of developing brain cancer. Eating plenty of fruits and vegetables and lowering cholesterol may help you prevent brain cancer.If your mother ate fruits and vegetables during her pregnancy and/or gave them to you as a part of your diet during childhood, you may be at a lower risk of developing brain cancer.Continuing to eat a diet rich in different fruits and vegetables may keep your risk for brain cancer lower.Lowering your cholesterol and limiting how much fatty food you eat may minimize your risk for brain cancer., Aim to exercise most days of the week. Doing cardiovascular exercise can help you stay healthy and may minimize your risk of developing brain cancer.Aim to walk 10,000 steps a day, which translates to walking about 5 miles (or 8 km) per day.Wearing a pedometer can help you make sure you’re taking enough steps per day.
You can do any type of cardio training to maintain your health. Beyond walking, consider running, swimming, rowing, or biking.

, There are many different symptoms of brain cancer that you may have. The signs and symptoms of a brain tumor can vary significantly. They depend on where in your brain the cancer is and the rate at which it is growing. There are several general signs of brain tumors that may alert you to seek medical treatment.Changes in a person's memory, personality, coordination, sensations, motor functions, etc. can be important clues to help locate the tumor. The following are possible signs of brain cancer:New headaches or a change in the pattern of your headaches.
Unexplained nausea or vomiting.
Vision problems, including blurred vision, double vision or loss of peripheral vision.
Gradual loss of sensation or movement in your arm or leg.
Difficulty with balance, speech, or general confusion in everyday matters.

, If you have any symptoms of brain cancer, see your doctor as soon as possible. They will confirm a diagnosis and develop a treatment plan, which is the only way to treat brain cancer.Your doctor will conduct a neurological exam that looks at your vision, hearing, balance, coordination, strength and reflexes. This may give them clues about whether you have a brain tumor and, if so, what kind.Your doctor may order imaging tests such as an MRI, CT scan, PET test to look more closely at your brain. This may help identify tumors or cancer.Your doctor may take a biopsy of your brain tissue for analysis to assess whether you have brain cancer.There may be other reasons for your symptoms, such as stroke, multiple sclerosis, an infection, or more. This is why it is essential you see a doctor for an evaluation.

, If your doctor confirms a diagnosis of brain cancer, they will develop a treatment plan for and with you. The type of treatment depends on what kind of brain cancer you have an how severe it is.Your doctor may perform surgery if the cancer is in a spot accessible to remove the tumor.Your doctor may prescribe radiation therapy to combat a brain tumor or cancer.You may need chemotherapy to treat brain cancer.Your doctor may prescribe targeted drug therapy with medications such as Avastin to kill cancer cells in your brain., If you suspect that you have or present the symptoms of brain cancer, it’s important to see a doctor as soon as possible. It is easier to treat brain cancer the earlier you are diagnosed. Ignoring signs or symptoms or avoiding treatment may make your condition worse or cause you to die."

Learn what is pheochromocytoma.,
Know the hormones that are involved in this disorder.,
Know also their physiological effect.,
Epinephrine and norepinephrine are unique compounds in that they can function as neurotransmitters as well as hormones.,
Know the cells that mediate this disease.,
Learn about the symptoms of this disorder.,
Other compounds besides epinephrine and norepinephrine can also be secreted by the chromaffin cells such as the catecholamine dopamine.,
In addition other compounds can also be secreted such as adrenocorticotropic hormone or ACTH which its secretion lead to distinct symptoms that are usually associated with Cushing disease such as increased cortisol level in the blood with its symptoms of increased cellular metabolism in addition to weight gain and hyperglycemia which in turn can develop diabetes in affected individuals.

,
Learn the clinical picture of this disorder.,
Dopamine as was already mentioned is very important clinically due to the diseases that its excess and its deficiency can cause in the affected individuals.,
Epinephrine and norepinephrine are important due to their dual function as neurotransmitters as well as hormones.,
Other sites that can be affected by pheochromocytoma are the urinary bladder and the disorder is called paraganglioma of the urinary bladder.

",How to Learn and Understand the Medical Syndrome of Pheochromocytoma," Pheochromocytoma refers to a medical disorder that affects neuroendocrine cells at various sites in the body and which are called chromaffin cells. This type of cells is spread among the body tissues at various sites. This tumour of chromaffin cells is characterized by its excessive secretion of different types of compounds into the circulation.;
, The most important of which are the catecholamines and, in particular, epinephrine and norepinephrine. These two compounds are important due to their clinical effect on inducing hypertension in affected individuals. These two compounds are usually secreted by the sympathetic division of the nervous system.

, They mediate a stress situation such as increased heart beat rate and increased perspiration, in addition to increased wakefulness. In addition these two compounds increase the constriction of blood vessels including arteries and veins. Thus it induces a state of increased blood pressure and hypertension.

, In the neuron synaptic cleft they function as neurotransmitters which transmit electric signals between neurons. In the adrenal medulla, they are secreted to the circulation as hormones.

, The most important chromaffin cells are present in the medulla of the adrenal gland. As a result of a tumor to this part of the gland it oversecretes autonomously increased amount of several compounds of which epinephrine and norepinephrine are the most important. As a result a state of hypertension occurs and which does not respond to medications.

, Accompanying symptoms include increased activity of the sympathetic nervous system which includes increased perspiration and heart beat rate. Other stressful symptoms can also occur such as dilatation of the eye pupils.

, Its excessive secretion can lead to distinct symptoms that are typical for dopamine such as psychotic symptoms in addition to increased sexual desire.

,, The clinical picture of this syndrome usually depends on the type of compounds that are secreted by the affected chromaffin cells. Catecholamines which are usually secreted in this type of tumors are derivatives of amino acids and which are by themselves clinically important.

, Its excess as occurs in certain types of pheochromocytomas can predispose to psychosis. In addition its deficiency can cause Parkinsonism as occurs sometimes in people taking dopamine antagonists. An example is the drug risperidone.

, Chromaffin cells associated with pheochromocytoma usually secrete these two compounds in an endocrine fusion exerting their effect on blood vessels as hormones.

Review your health insurance plan.,
Ask your doctors and health care providers for an estimate.,
Purchase additional insurance.,
Determine whether you will be able to continue working.,
Ask for help.,
Research public health options.,
Budget for your other bills.",How to Prepare Financially for Cancer," Whether you have group coverage from your employer or your spouse's employer, or you have an individual plan, read through it several times until you completely understand what it covers and what it excludes. Many of your initial expenses will likely be covered, and you want to make sure you are prepared for further costs that you will have to pay for out of pocket. If you have any questions, contact your health plan administrator or the customer service department of the insurance company and ask for help.


Check the insurance plan for caps. Most insurance policies will have a maximum amount that they will pay on claims in your lifetime.;
, Physicians may hesitate to give you an estimated cost of treatment and care right after the diagnosis, but the sooner you have a ballpark number, the better you can plan. Ask for a list of treatments, office visits, surgeries, and prescriptions you know you will need.

, If you know your total cost of care and treatment may exceed your insurance policy's lifetime cap, or if your out-of-pocket expenses will be hard to pay, consider changing plans or buying catastrophic insurance. A catastrophic insurance plan will begin paying after your health insurance reaches its cap. This type of policy is typically expensive, but it might be worth it if your medical bills will continue to climb as treatment progresses.

, If you get your insurance plan through your employer, talk to them about the time off you may need to undergo treatment. If you will be too sick to continue working, make sure you are able to take advantage of COBRA after you leave.

, Reach out to friends and family if you will need help in paying your medical bills. Even if they cannot help you with your cancer treatment costs, they might be able to help provide food, medicine, care at home, or help with transportation.

, You may qualify for Medicare, Medicaid, or Social Security. If you are a veteran, you are probably entitled to help through Veteran's Affairs. Contact a social services agency in your area to see if you are eligible for any public assistance as you manage your cancer treatments.

, Manage your mortgage or rent, electric and water bills, as well as other monthly bills so that you do not drop behind in those payments. Most utilities and companies will allow you to sign up for recurring payment schedules so the money is taken right out of your account when the bill is due.

Use the hand mirror to check hard-to-reach areas.,
Check your scalp with a comb.,
Repeat every month.",How to Perform Melanoma Skin Checks1," The first step to doing a melanoma skin check is to undress completely. Make sure you are in a well-lit area. Stand in front of a full-length mirror.Have a hand-mirror nearby to help you check your back and other difficult to see areas.
You may want to ask a spouse, family member, or friend help you check those hard-to-see areas, as well as to check your neck and scalp.;
, Face the mirror and check everything you can see. Check your face, ears, neck, chest, and belly. Remember to note all your moles and note any abnormalities.Women should lift their breasts to check the skin underneath.

, After checking your upper body, move on to your arms. Check your underarms, both sides of both arms, the tops and the palms of your hands, between your fingers, and your fingernails., Sit down somewhere comfortable. Check the fronts of your thighs, shins, tops of your feet, in between your toes, and your toenails.Using the hand mirror, check the bottoms of each foot, each calf, and the backs of each of your thighs.

, To check your hard-to-reach areas, you can either stand or sit, whichever is more comfortable. Use the hand mirror to check your buttocks, genital area, lower and upper back, and the back of the neck and ears.It may be easier to look at your back in the full-length mirror by using a hand mirror — or asking your spouse, friend or family member to check.

, You should also check your scalp for melanomas. Use a comb to part your hair and check your scalp. At this time, a spouse, friend, or family member may be needed to check the back of your head and neck.

, If you are in one of the groups at risk, you need to check yourself regularly. You can do this once a month to keep track of your moles and notice any developing irregularities.For those who are not at high risk, you can check yourself every three, six, or even 12 months, depending on other risk factors like exposure to the sun or amount of moles."

Monitor for changes using the ABCDE rule.,
Keep a log of your moles as you check yourself and use the ABCDE rule to help monitor changes.,
Check for other warning signs.",How to Perform Melanoma Skin Checks2," Melanomas can be identified by checking the moles on your body. This includes a change in the way your skin looks or feels around a mole. You can use the ABCDE rule as a guide to check for changes. If you have any of these warning signs, let your physician know.Asymmetry: One half of the mole looks or feels different than the other half.

Border: Normal moles have regular, relatively smooth borders. Melanomas tend to have irregular, notched, ragged, blurry, or uneven borders.

Color: If the color of the area of skin is uneven, like if it contains various shades of brown, black, or other colors, it may be a sign of skin cancer.

Diameter: Any spot of different-looking skin larger than ¼ inch should be checked.

Evolving or changing spot: The changes in the area can be in size, shape, color or texture, like. bumpy versus smooth.

, Write down the date of your mole check and make detailed notes about your moles— include the specific location, size, color, shape and anything else you observed during your check. You can print out a picture of a human body and mark the areas where you have moles, too. There are even apps that help you monitor you moles, allowing you to upload photos and mark their location on a 3D model.

, Though checking the moles on your body are the best ways to find symptoms, there are other warning signs you can look for. Additional warning signs include:A sore that does not heal
Spreading of pigment from the border of the spot into the surrounding skin
Redness or swelling extending beyond the border of the spot
Any change in sensation, such as increased itchiness, tenderness, or pain
Any change in the surface of a mole, like scaliness, oozing, bleeding, or the appearance of a bump or nodule
A new mole

Check your body if you’ve had UV exposure.,
Look for moles on the body.,
Be aware that fair skin can lead to melanoma.,
Check yourself if you have a history of sunburn.,
Be aware of other risk factors.",How to Perform Melanoma Skin Checks3," The major risk factor for melanomas is exposure to Ultraviolet (UV) light. This exposure can be from the sun, tanning beds, or tanning lights., The presence of moles on the skin is another risk factor. Most people have moles. They are pigmented and often slightly raised areas of the skin that are non-spreading tumors. Someone who has more than 50 moles is at a higher risk for melanoma.If you have moles, make a habit of keeping an eye on them. Normal moles are usually evenly colored and can be flat or raised above the skin a bit. Moles are usually round or oval and smaller than about ¼ inch.
Some people have a condition called dysplastic nevi, which are atypical moles. They look different than a normal mole. Usually, they're larger, and sometimes they differ in color, texture, or shape than a normal mole. These atypical moles increase your chance of getting skin cancer, and sometimes melanoma can happen inside the dyplastic nevus., Another risk factor for melanoma is skin color. People who have fair skin, light hair, and freckles are at a greater risk for melanoma.It is thought that since these are people who also are at higher risk for sunburn, UV radiation from the sun plays an important role in the development of melanomas.
However, even those with darker skin can have melanoma on the lighter areas of their bodies. These areas include the soles of the feet, the palms of the hands, and under the nails.

, Since UV exposure can lead to melanoma, a history of sunburns is a risk factor for skin cancer. You are also at risk if you sunburn easily. If you have had multiple sunburns, check yourself regularly.If your sunburns were severe, you are at a higher risk. Severe sunburns include peeling, blistering, or other adverse side effects.

, There are other risk factors for melanoma. If you have a family or personal history of melanoma, you may be at risk. People who are older are at a greater risk, as are people who have weakened or suppressed immune systems.


If you live at higher elevations or close to the equator, you are at higher risk because of the elevated level of UV rays.Men tend to have higher rates of melanoma than women.
Individuals with a condition known as xeroderma pigmentosum have a higher risk of melanoma.

"
"
Check yourself often if you are at high risk.,
Check your body even if you are a low risk candidate.,
Learn where melanomas occur.",How to Perform Melanoma Skin Checks4," Individuals at high risk for melanoma should check themselves monthly for melanomas. Those who should be especially careful and perform a melanoma skin check every month are:Those with a family or personal history of melanoma
Those who have fair hair, light skin, or many freckles
Individuals who have more than a few scattered moles

, Everyone should check their skin for melanomas. It is a good idea to keep an eye on any moles to see if they change shape, color, size, or texture. Even if you are not at risk for melanoma, check your skin once every three to twelve months using the melanoma skin check process.If you are a low risk candidate, decide if you want to check yourself every three, six, or 12 months. If you have had more exposure to the sun and UV rays, or you have a lot of moles, you may want to check yourself more often than if you don't.If you are unsure about how often you should check yourself, contact your doctor.
Almost every skin cancer caught early can be treated and cured. The chances of cure decrease with later detection.

, Melanomas often occur on the chest and the back in men. In women, they usually occur on the legs. Melanomas can often be found on the face and neck in both sexes.


Much less commonly, melanomas can develop on the eyes, the mouth, the genitals, and around the anus."

Avoid tobacco products.,
Drink less alcohol.,
Practice safe and informed sex.,
Manage your acid reflux or gastroesophageal reflux disease.,
Maintain good nutrition.,
Stay away from secondhand tobacco smoke.,
Pay attention to your work environment.,
Maintain good dental health and oral hygiene.,
Watch out for local environmental threats.,
Learn about what causes throat cancer.,
Identify symptoms particular to throat cancer.,
Learn about treatment.",How to Lessen the Risk of Throat Cancer," One of the biggest causes of throat cancer is tobacco use. As a result, eliminating tobacco from your life can definitely reduce the risk of throat cancer.


Common tobacco products include: cigarettes, cigars, and chewing tobacco.
Long-term use of tobacco products can increase risk of throat cancer exponentially.
Some studies have shown that even short-term use of tobacco products can increase risk of throat cancer substantially over individuals who have never used tobacco.;
, Drinking excessive amounts of alcohol can increase the chance of throat cancer. As a result, if you are a heavy drinker, you should try to decrease consumption as soon as possible. Consider:


Even moderate alcohol consumption, such as more than one drink per day, may increase your chances of throat cancer.
If you have questions about what is considered “excessive” consult your doctor. If you feel like you need to cut down or need and “eye opener” in the morning, then you may have a problem with alcohol.

People who drink too much and use tobacco products have the highest risk level., Another major risk of throat cancer is the human papillomavirus infection (HPV). HPV is transmitted through vaginal and oral sex. In recent years, studies have shown that throat cancer is sometimes linked to HPV. In order to decrease your risk of throat cancer, practice safe and informed sex.


If you are in a relationship with someone with HPV, avoid high-risk sexual activities (that may transmit HPV from the genitals to your mouth and throat) like oral sex.
HPV can increase your risk of getting certain types of cancer (like throat cancer) by 22 times., Acid reflux and related illnesses are another major risk factor for throat cancer. This is due to the fact that over long periods of time, acid splash back from the stomach causes skin cells in the throat and esophagus to change into cells that are more prone to cancer.


Take over-the-counter medicine that helps reduce acid in your stomach.
Consume a diet that does not aggravate your reflux. Avoid fried foods, high-fat foods, and citrus. Focus on most fresh fruits and vegetables, meats like chicken and fish, and other low-fat foods.
Actively manage your reflux with your medical profession. Do not let long periods of bad reflux occur without consulting your doctor., Poor nutrition and a lack of vitamins and other nutrients in your diet can increase your chances of throat cancer. This is because without certain vitamins and nutrients, your body will not have what it needs to fight off cancer cells in their early stages.


Eat lots of green, leafy vegetables and consume a wide array of vegetables and fruits. These contain antioxidants which help to fight against cancer.
Those who eat more fruits and vegetables have been show to have a lower risk of throat cancer than those who eat more meats and nitrates.
Take vitamin supplements.
Consult your physician about a proper diet if you have concerns., Secondhand smoke is another leading cause of throat cancer. While many people quit smoking or never smoke in the first place, they can still get cancer because they’ve had long term exposure to secondhand smoke.


Encourage family and friends to quit smoking.
Avoid sitting in smoking sections in public accommodations, like restaurants and sports stadiums.
Disassociate with people who smoke around you despite your requests for them to not. After all, your health is more important than a friendship or association with someone who does not care about your well-being., Studies have identified a wide variety of chemicals that increase the chances of cancer, including throat cancer. As a result, you need to be vigilant in your work environment and pay attention to what chemicals and fumes you work with on a daily basis.


If you work in an industrial setting, make sure your employer provides proper ventilation and other safety equipment.
If you are in construction or a similar field, make sure you handle all materials in an appropriate fashion and follow government guidelines and regulations.
If you work in a newly renovated building or an older building with potential environmental issues, be aware of any potential issues or hazards.
Always be concerned and proactive. Do not trust that your employer is following the law or has your safety as their number one priority.
If you have any specific concerns, review Material Safety Data Sheets for your certain products and substances provided on the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's website (www.osha.gov)., Poor dental health is another potential risk factor for throat cancer. Risks are increased considerably if you do not maintain proper oral hygiene because bacteria will build up in your mouth. In addition, poor dental health will increase risk of cavities and other health problems — some of which have been connected with throat cancer.


Make sure to floss regularly — every day.
Brush your teeth twice a day.
Have your teeth professionally cleaned on an annual or semiannual basis., Pollution in the environment around us is also a cause of throat cancer. As a result, make sure to be aware of your surroundings — where you live, work, and recreate.


If you live near a coal power plant or an industry that contributes to air pollution, you may be at higher risk.
If you live next to a major road or interstate, you could be at a higher risk.
Talk to your local or state environmental monitoring agency for more information about potential risks in your area.

, Throat cancer is caused by a wide variety of factors in our environment. As a result, if you are seriously interested in lessening your risk of throat cancer, you need to understand potential causes and go out of your way to avoid them. Consider that throat cancer can be caused by:The use of tobacco products — this includes chewing and inhalation
Drinking excessive amounts of alcohol
Poor nutrition
Acid reflux or gastroesophageal reflux disease
Human papillomavirus (HPV)
Occupational exposure
Genetic Factors
Radiation
Immunodeficiency
Chewing betel nut

, Throat cancer has numerous symptoms that can be confused with many other ailments. These symptoms are especially worrisome if combined with other symptoms that can signal throat cancer. As a result, it is important to stay vigilant about your health and to visit a doctor if you have any concerns or any new and unexplained medical problems. Major symptoms of throat cancer include:Coughing
Voice changes, like hoarseness
Problems swallowing
Ear aches or pains
Sore throat or sores or lumps in the throat
Unexpected weight loss

, Treatment for throat cancer varies and has come a long way over the last several decades. Different treatments come with different associated problems. As a result, you should consult your doctor and ask if you have any questions or concerns about treatment.Radiation therapy

Eat 100% whole grains.,
Aim for 5-9 servings of fruits and vegetables.,
Include high fiber protein sources.,
Consider adding in a fiber supplement.,
Eat fortified foods.,
Write a meal plan.,
Keep a food journal.,
Drink more water.,
Increase your fiber intake slowly.,
Talk to your family and physician.,
Maintain a healthy weight.,
Give up alcohol and smoking.,
Increase your physical activity levels.",How to Lower Your Breast Cancer Risk with Fiber," There are a variety of foods that offer a decent amount of fiber. Some of the highest fiber foods are 100% whole grains.


You want to choose whole grains over refined grains because these foods are minimally processed and leave all the fiber containing parts intact with the grain.Include a serving of whole grains at most meals and snacks to help increase your intake of fiber. Measure out 1 oz or 1/2 cup of whole grains.Whole grains to try include: whole wheat pasta, whole grain bread, brown rice, quinoa, whole wheat English muffins.;
, Another two food groups that offer a lot of fiber are fruits and vegetables. In addition to providing fiber, these foods are also high in vitamins and minerals.Make half of your plate a fruit or vegetable. This helps you get the recommended 5-9 servings in daily. Or you can count out and measure servings of 1 cup of vegetables, 2 cups of salad greens or 1/2 cup of cut up fruit.Specific fruits and vegetables that are very high in fiber include: raspberries, blueberries, blackberries, pears, apples, artichokes, peas, broccoli, turnip greens and brussels sprouts., You may be surprised to find out that there are some protein sources that are also high in fiber. Including these is another easy way to increase fiber each day.


Proteins like chicken, fish or beef do not contain fiber. However, protein sources like beans, lentils, nuts and seeds do contain fiber.
Swap out a serving of non-fibrous protein for one that's higher in fiber. For example, instead of serving grilled chicken over a salad, top your salad with beans.
Measure out 1/2 cup of beans or lentils and 1 ounce of nuts or seeds.Items that are particularly high in fiber include: all beans, lentils, pistachios, almonds, pecans, flaxseeds and chia seeds., In addition to eating more fiber-rich foods, you can also increase your daily fiber intake by taking a fiber supplement.


Fiber supplements are an extra way to sneak in more fiber to your diet. They can come in a variety of forms including tablets, capsules, powders and even gummies.
Although its best to get fiber from foods (because they also have vitamins and minerals) adding a fiber supplement daily shouldn't be harmful and can help you increase your daily intake.Always talk to your doctor before starting any over-the-counter supplements to make sure they are safe and effective for you.

, In addition to whole foods, like fruits or vegetables, food manufacturers are also trying to increase the fiber content of many processed food items.


Many foods like fruit juice, soy milks and yogurts now have added fiber to them. All of these have fiber added to them during processing.
Specific items to try to include are: OJ, yogurts, soy milk, breads, cereal, crackers and granola bars. Make sure the label says ""with added fiber."" Not all drinks for every brand will have added fiber.

, Whenever you're trying to change your diet or how you eat, it'll be beneficial to write yourself a meal to plan to help you plan for your changes.


Start by writing up all the meals you plan to eat during the week. Include breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks and beverages. This will help you visually see where you can add in more fiber-rich foods.Review your meal plan and see where there are areas that you can add in more fiber-rich foods. For example, if you're planning on making a chicken and vegetable stir-fry on Monday night, plan to serve it with brown rice instead of white rice.
Also use your meal plan to help build a grocery list for the week. You'll know exactly what fiber-rich foods you need to stock up on.

, Like a meal plan, a food journal is another great tool to use when you're trying to make and track changes in your diet.A food journal can be done with paper and pencil or using a food journal app. An app on your phone or computer will be beneficial as many of these apps automatically calculate your total fiber intake each day.
Track each meal that you eat on a daily basis, plus the serving sizes of foods. Ensure to track breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks and any beverages (especially those that you may mix with a powdered fiber supplement).
Track your total fiber intake (you may need to do this manually if not using an app) to see how much fiber you get in a typical day. Then, start adding in more fiber-rich foods and see how much you can increase your intake.
Use your food journal as a guide to whether or not you should continue trying to increase your fiber intake.

, If you are working on increasing your fiber intake (especially if you were eating a low-fiber diet previously), you'll also want to make sure you increase your water intake as well.


Dietary fiber or supplements work best when they are paired with adequate amounts of water. Fiber and water together help keep you GI system moving at a good pace.Ensure you're drinking the minimum of amount of water daily. If you're not, work on increasing your fluid intake as well as your fiber intake.
Most people need about 8-13 glasses of hydrating fluids daily.Aim for fluids like: water, flavored water, sparkling water or decaf coffee and tea.

, It's a great goal to try to reduce breast cancer risk by increasing your fiber intake. However, you need to be careful about how you go about increasing your fiber to make sure you stay healthy overall.


Although fiber is a great nutrient to prevent cancer and even many GI issues, too much fiber or increasing your fiber too quickly can cause other issues.If you increase your fiber too much or too quickly you can experience some mild, but frustrating side effects like: gas, bloating and cramping.Slowly increase your fiber intake by a few grams each week. This allows your body, specifically your GI system, get used to your new diet.

, If you're worried about your risk of breast cancer and are thinking of ways to reduce your risk, it's important to speak with your physician.


Your doctor will be able to review your family and personal medical history thoroughly with you and explain what risks you may have from genetics and/or other medical issues (like radiation therapy or previous changes in your breast tissue).Speak specifically about your desire to increase your fiber intake. Although increasing your fiber intake is most likely not harmful, its still something to be discussed with your physician.
Also talk with your doctor about your diet and lifestyle and ask what other changes you can make in addition to increasing fiber to reduce your breast cancer risk.

, One important factor to consider when trying to reduce your risk of breast cancer is your weight. Studies have shown that women who are overweight or obese have an increased risk of developing breast cancer.Fat cells produce estrogen in your body. With an increased amount of fat cells, your body produces more estrogen which can support the growth of breast cancer cells.If your BMI is 25.0-29.9 you're considered over weight. A BMI of 30.0 or greater is considered obese.If your BMI falls into these ranges, consider losing weight to help reduce your risk of developing breast cancer.
In the Nurses’ Health Study, women who gain 10 lbs or more since menopause had a higher risk of cancer than those who maintained their weight., Studies have consistently shown that both alcohol and smoking have shown a positive correlation with increased risk for developing breast cancer.Discontinue these habits to help reduce your risk.


Studies have shown that women who drink 3 or more drinks per week have a 15% higher risk of developing breast cancer.
Although its considered safe for women to have 1 drink daily, consider decreasing your consumption to just a glass occasionally or stopping altogether.
More recent studies have confirmed that smoking also increases a woman's risk for developing breast cancer.Since smoking is always considered to be an unhealthy behavior, stop smoking immediately.

, Participating in regular amounts of physical activity has also been shown to reduce your risk of developing breast cancer. Start or increase your exercise amounts.


Physical activity is known to help manage and control weight. Exercising for at least 2 1/2 hours weekly has been shown to help manage your weight - another important risk factor.Exercise also helps your body use blood sugar (blood glucose) and insulin more effectively. Studies have shown that when you have more insulin growth factor, you have a higher risk of developing breast cancer.
Although the CDC recommends only 2 1/2 hours of moderate-intensity physical activity, up to 4 hours has been recommended to decrease your risk of breast cancer."

Eat smaller meals and drink slowly.,
Avoid foods with powerful tastes and smells.,
Wear loose clothing.,
Freshen your mouth often.,
Try herbal teas to reduce nausea.,
Avoid any “miracle” cures.,
Consult your doctor for an anti-nausea medication.,
Ensure you take all of your medications in the correct order.",How to Minimize the Side Effects of Chemotherapy1," Large meals and large quantities of fluids can intensify nausea symptoms. Whenever possible, try to eat smaller meals throughout the day as opposed to a usual breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Sipping beverages can also help., Overly sweet or fatty foods, as well as fried foods, are more likely to cause nausea and vomiting than bland foods. The smell of food is just as important when it comes to preventing nausea, and you may find that eating foods cold makes them less aromatic.By cooking and freezing meals in advance of your next chemotherapy treatment, you can avoid nausea related to cooking smells.You may find other smells, such as soaps, detergents, or anything else, that also trigger your nausea. Do what you can to minimize your exposure to other triggering scents., Pressure from a belt or a tight shirt against your abdomen can worsen the sensation of nausea. Try wearing loose shirts and pants during the worst of your symptoms to avoid increasing them, especially directly after meals., A bad metallic taste in your mouth is another common side effect of chemotherapy. The taste can lead to nausea or a simple lack of desire to eat. Rinse your mouth with a mouthwash or chew sugar-free gum to help combat any bad taste from the chemotherapy.


Another rinse you may want to try is adding one half teaspoon each of salt and baking soda to a quart of water., Some herbal teas are known for their ability to combat nausea. One study showed that ginger tea helped reduce nausea (but not vomiting) caused by chemo.Peppermint tea is another herbal tea that has been used to treat nausea; however, it lacks research with regard to nausea caused by chemo., Any high-priced (or even low-priced) herbal remedy or “superfood” that claims to cure nausea caused by chemo should be viewed with some skepticism. Look into the proven results (published studies in reputable sources) of any option before spending money on it.


You should also ask your doctor before taking any type of supplement to ensure that it won’t interact with any of your prescription meds.

, Your physician will have a large selection of different anti-nausea medications to choose from, but the right choice for you will depend on the severity of your symptoms, as well as the type of chemotherapy you are receiving.Commonly prescribed anti-nausea medications include:Dexamethasone
Ondansetron (or Zofran)
Metoclopramide (or Reglan)
Motion sickness treatments such as Gravol (Dimenhydrinate) are often used to control nausea that persists for more than several days after chemotherapy treatment.
Cannabinoids
Anti-anxiety drugs such as Ativan
Proton pump inhibitors and histamine H2 receptor antagonists

, You’re likely to have quite a regimen of medications as you undergo chemotherapy. Ask your doctor for clear instructions on a medication schedule that will make any anti-nausea medication as effective as possible.Note that timing the anti-nausea medications properly in relationship to your other meds is key to effectiveness.
Also, since your treatment plan depends upon you taking all of your meds on schedule, contact your doctor immediately if you’re having trouble keeping liquids or your medications down.In severe cases, this may require intravenous delivery of your medications (as well as fluids to help keep you hydrated if you are vomiting a lot).

Learn what is colon cancer.,
Study the anatomy of the colon.,
The colon is divided anatomically into several structures that begin at the cecum at the junction between the small and large intestine.,
Learn about the role of the colon in digestion.,
These roles are partly the reabsorption of electrolytes and water into the blood.,
The feces in the colon are expelled from the body by a peristaltic motion of the colon muscles which is typical for all segments of the gastrointestinal tract.,
Study about the enteric nervous system.,
Learn about the causes of colon cancer.,
Also polyps in the colon can be a source of malignancy in the colon if they are big enough.,
The last cause of colon cancer that is discussed here is due to the presence of fatty material in the colon.",How to Learn and Understand How Colon Cancer Occurs," Colon cancer, or as it is often called colorectal cancer is a potentially fatal type of cancer due to its metastatic potential. It is a common disease and is a leading cause of death among the elderly people. Before I discuss this disorder it is useful to give an overview about the structure and function of the colon itself. All these in addition to the causes of colon cancer will be discussed here in the context of this article.;
, The colon or as it is often called the large intestine is the last part of the intestine and is connected with the small intestine by a valve which is called the ileocecal valve. The colon is connected at its first part with the ileum which is the last part of the small intestine. The ileocecal valve makes sure that food in the colon does not backflow to the small intestine and is propelled in one direction.

, This is in addition to four other parts of the colon itself that are called the ascending and transverse colon in addition to the descending and sigmoid colon which connects with the rectum and the anal canal.

, The colon does not have an apparent role in the digestion process which occurs mainly in the small intestine. Its main role is as a reservoir of food residues that collect in the body that are subsequently expelled from the body by the process of defecation. The colon has however certain roles in the body other than its being a reservoir of food residues.

, In addition, one important function of the colon is to secrete mucus by its lining epithelial cells. This mucus is important for the process of food propulsion in the large intestine. This function is similar to that which is observed in the esophagus. The esophagus also secretes mucus that helps in propelling the food into the stomach.

, This peristaltic movement is mediated by a special type of nervous system that is characteristic of the gastrointestinal tract. This system is called the enteric nervous system. This nervous system is considered part of the autonomic nervous system in addition to the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system.

, The enteric nervous system has synapses with neurons from both the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. The most important part of the autonomic nervous system for the function of the colon is the parasympathetic nervous system in which neurons in the vagus nerve synapse with neurons in the enteric nervous system in the colon which in turn induce peristaltic motion of the colon muscles.

, Cancer of the colon is mostly caused due to a genetic factor as this disease runs in families and relatives. Also carcinogenic compounds can be a cause of this disease by inducing mutagenesis that can occur by different mechanism according to the type of the carcinogen. For example acridine is a carcinogen due to its flat structure that can penetrate between DNA bases that are adjacent to each other, thus changing the pairing manner of DNA bases on different DNA strands.

, Polyps are usually benign structures that occur anywhere in the gastrointestinal tract and are caused by the segmentation movement of the muscles of the colon. Usually polyps that are bigger than 1 centimeter (0.4 in) can be transformed into cancerous tissue and must be excised.

, Usually, in the colon there are not harmful bacteria that are part of the residents of the colon mucosa. On the other hand, some bacteria that feed on fatty food can secrete carcinogenic compounds that can harm the colon by inducing mutagenesis. This fat encourages these bacteria to grow increasing the likelihood of causing cancer in the colon.

Try to stay active.,
Ration your energy.,
Take breaks.,
Control insomnia.,
Watch your blood cell counts.,
Try some relaxation techniques.,
Eliminate other forms of stress.",How to Minimize the Side Effects of Chemotherapy2," Although it sounds contradictory, those who stay active tend to preserve energy levels more so than those who try to stay off their feet completely in the days after chemotherapy treatments.While you should stay active, don’t push yourself too hard.


Instead of vigorous exercise, simply try to take one or two walks a day.Generally speaking, try keeping up the activities you enjoy, but try shorter, easier versions of them.Some forms of chemotherapy are particularly exhausting in the days after treatment. If this is the case for you, and it is too hard to even get out and walk or exercise, be forgiving of yourself and speak to your doctor for additional advice and guidance.

, Keep track from day to day, and you’ll likely notice a trend for when you feel most up to activity. Schedule your favorite or most important activities for this time period.Some people have a few ""bad days"" immediately following treatment, followed by ""good days"" before the next treatment begins. You can use these ""good days"" to be more productive and to get the things done that you need to do.
On your ""bad days,"" it is important to give yourself permission to rest to allow your body to heal.

, Listen to your body. Don’t feel guilty for napping during the day if you need to. Try to keep naps to an hour or less and take them in a comfy chair rather than in your bed because this makes it easier to get up and resume your day., Depending on the type of cancer, anywhere from 30 to 75 percent of patients have reported insomnia as a symptom.Proper rest is more important than ever while your body and immune system battle both the cancer and the effects of the chemo. Consult your doctor who will be able to prescribe sleep medications as needed.Some of the best ways to fight insomnia include avoiding stimulants like caffeine in the evening and ensuring that your room is quiet, dark, and comfortably cool in temperature.
You can find more info on controlling insomnia at How to Prevent Insomnia.

, One of the most common side effects of chemotherapy is diminished red blood cell and white blood cell counts.Low red blood cell counts is called anemia. It leads to increased fatigue. Treatment includes iron and Vitamin B12 supplements, as well as the option of Epogen injections which are given by some physicians between chemotherapy cycles to boost your blood cells counts.
Address underlying anemia. Low levels of red blood cells can also cause fatigue. If you have anemia, you may be particularly susceptible to fatigue during chemotherapy treatments. Ask your doctor for help if you are experiencing very low energy levels.
White blood cells also drop during chemotherapy and this is called neutropenia. White blood cell are important for fighting infection; therefore, talk with your doctor throughout your chemotherapy treatments to monitor both your red and your white blood cells.

, Often, people going through chemotherapy develop anxiety which in turn leads to fatigue. To combat this feeling of anxiety, try some relaxation techniques. Activities like meditation, yoga, and different breathing exercises can help to calm you down and reduce your anxiety-induced fatigue.Join a support group to interact with people who are sharing your experience. Or, ask for a referral to see a psychologist who works specifically with patients with cancer.
If you’re specifically interested in yoga and the spiritual side of meditation, you can even try visiting a local Buddhist temple for more info—and for much cheaper than attending most yoga classes.

, While going through chemotherapy is stressful enough, you may have other stressful things you are dealing with as well. If you can, eliminate them from your life. Other stressful things and ways to combat them include::


Chores - you can have a friend or loved one help around the house. You can also schedule your activities to take advantage of your good days. For instance, prepare meals for the week on your day off and refrigerate or freeze them, so you don’t have to worry about cooking after work.
Work - ask your employer about the possibility of working from home for part of your day during the worst of your side effects. While you might not be able to take time off work, you may be able to split up your workload in a way helps you manage your fatigue.

Stay hydrated.,
Eat fiber-rich food to prevent constipation.,
Stay active.,
Take a stool softener.,
Consult your doctor for persistent diarrhea.",How to Minimize the Side Effects of Chemotherapy3," It is essential to drink plenty of fluids while going through chemotherapy. Added fluids can also prevent constipation. Aim to drink eight 8-oz. glasses of water each day, or more if you exercise, are sweating a lot, or if it is very hot outside. If you desire, add mint or fruit to your water to flavor it., Fiber-rich foods will add bulk to your stool, which helps keep it moving along your digestive tract. Many fiber-rich foods also fall into the low-sugar, low-fat category that will make them more appetizing while combating nausea. Foods that are high in fiber include:

Whole grain Breads: Bran flakes, wheat bread, and rye.
Fruit: Prunes, apples, mangoes, pears, raspberries, strawberries, and blackberries.
Legumes: Pinto beans, kidney beans, lentils, and black beans.
Nuts: Almonds, pistachios, pecans, walnuts, and peanuts.
Vegetables: Artichokes, brussel sprouts, winter squash, broccoli, soybeans, peas, spinach, okra, and carrots.

, In addition to helping to fight fatigue, physical activity also helps to keep your digestive system active.Even if you can’t exercise vigorously, try to go for at least one walk each day.

, A wide array of stool softeners are available both over the counter and with a prescription if you are struggling with constipation.Speak to your doctor for suggestions specific to the type of chemotherapy regimen you are on.

, While some people experience constipation due to chemotherapy, others experience diarrhea. Uncontrolled diarrhea can lead to dehydration and dangerously low levels of potassium, which your body needs to function. Consult your doctor if your symptoms persist for more than a day or two.Choose high protein well cooked foods such as lean meat, fish, eggs, poultry instead of fried or fatty foods.
Choose cooked vegetables instead of raw ones.
Choose fresh fruits without the skin or canned fruit (except prunes).
If you have only occasional mild diarrhea, drink extra water to stay hydrated.
Severe diarrhea warrants seeing a physician, and may require a dose reduction in your chemotherapy treatments."

Ask your doctor if your should expect hair loss.,
Treat your hair gently.,
Apply a hydrocortisone cream for any itchiness.,
Consider shaving your head.,
Cover your head.,
Wear head protection.",How to Minimize the Side Effects of Chemotherapy4," Not all chemotherapy treatments cause hair loss.One of the best ways to cope with chemo-related hair loss is simply to be prepared for it. Talk to your oncologist and ask if your should expect hair loss due to your treatment. If the answer is yes, then expect to begin losing your hair anywhere from seven to twenty-one days after your first treatment., Avoid bleaching, perming, or other harsh treatments to your hair (even preceding your chemotherapy treatment) to give yourself the best chance of keeping it.You should also use a soft brush and a very gentle shampoo, such as baby shampoo, to try to keep your hair.Baby shampoo will also help reduce any associated scalp itching.

, You may also experience itchiness on your scalp. An over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream can help reduce scalp itch. Apply as directed.


You can ask your local pharmacist for help in picking this out at the drugstore.

, You can help control itchiness caused by the hair-shedding process by simply shaving your head when the symptom starts.For some patients, getting the hair loss process over with by shaving their heads also helps prevent the embarrassment and anxiety related to the shedding process and associated patchiness.

, Many people who lose their hair after cancer chose head coverings such as a scarf, turban, hat, or wig. You can find scarves in beautiful patterns and fabrics, as well as fun and fancy hats. Some insurance plans will even cover the cost of a head covering., If you do experience hair loss (or shave your head), it is important that you protect your scalp from both sunlight and extreme cold. Make sure to put on sunscreen before going out in sunlight, even if you are wearing a head covering."

Recognize changes in mood.,
Talk to your medical doctor.,
Seek help from a mental health therapist.",How to Minimize the Side Effects of Chemotherapy5," Sometimes chemotherapy patients have mood changes after receiving treatments. Changes in mood can include anxiety, fear, uncertainty, anger, and sadness. Think about how you feel each day, or keep a journal to record your moods so you can recognize changes., Speak to your doctor if you are concerned about your mood changes. They may be able to help you determine if the changes are due to stress or are directly related to your treatments and/or medications. They may be able to change your medications to ones with less side effects., A mental health therapist can help you learn strategies to cope with your mood changes. You may be asked to participate in cognitive behavior therapy or other therapeutic methods. Sometimes, medication is prescribed to combat mood changes, as long as it won’t interfere with your current treatment plan and chemotherapy medications."

Avoid crowds and sick people.,
Keep clean.,
Protect your skin from germs and scratches.,
Cook your food thoroughly.",How to Minimize the Side Effects of Chemotherapy6," Chemotherapy patients are more susceptible to infection than others. To reduce your risk of infection, avoid sick people or anyone with cold, flu, fever or any other infection. You should also avoid crowds such as in schools, shopping malls, and public gatherings., To reduce risk of infection, it is important to wash your hands regularly and especially before eating, after using the bathroom, blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing or petting animals. You should also bathe every day. Be sure to clean feet, groin, armpits and other moist, sweaty areas.Don’t get into hot tubs, and don’t wade, play or swim in ponds, lakes, rivers, or water parks. There may be germs in the water that could make you sick.

, Dry skin is more easily wounded, so keep your skin moist by applying lotion daily. Wear gloves and other protective gear when doing activities that could lead to injury. If you do get a scrape, be sure to clean it immediately. You should also cover the scrape with a bandage to prevent germs from entering your system. Avoid contact with dirt and dirty objects.Avoid contact with cat litter boxes, bird cages, and fish or reptile tanks.
Wear gloves when gardening and wash hands afterwards.
Don’t keep fresh flowers or live plants in your bedroom.

, Undercooked or raw food can lead to infections. Steaks, roasts, and fish should be cooked to 145º F (65.5º C) and poultry to 160º F (71º C). Be sure to keep raw meat, poultry, seafood, and eggs away from ready-to-eat foods to avoid contamination. Keep cutting boards, counter tops, and utensils clean.Choose pasteurized products rather than unpasteurized ones, such as dairy and honey.

Stay away from certain foods.,
Avoid alcohol or caffeine.,
Keep your teeth or dentures clean.,
Take medication to get rid of your mouth sores.",How to Minimize the Side Effects of Chemotherapy7," Avoid spicy, salty, or acidic foods, such as oranges or hot peppers. You should also avoid food with sharp edges, like potato chips or cereal. Patients have reported that sucking on popsicles or ice cubes, as well as eating ice cream (warmed up a little bit), may soothe and decrease the inflammation caused by mouth sores., Both of these substances can irritate your mouth sores. Try to stay away from any alcoholic beverage, coffee, tea, or energy drinks. If you do consume one of these drinks, rinse your mouth with water immediately following your drink.


Whether or not you should drink alcohol at all during your treatment depends on the specific chemotherapy drugs you’re on. Consult your doctor to ensure that alcohol won’t interact with your treatment., Use a soft swab or very soft toothbrush to clean your teeth to avoid irritating any mouth sores or inflamed parts of your mouth. You should also rinse your mouth with a teaspoon of salt dissolved in warm water after every meal. This will help to clean the mouth sores and ultimately heal them.Avoid any alcohol-based mouthwashes as they can be irritating.

, Your doctor may prescribe mouth rinses such as ""Magic Mouthwash"" (a combination of Maalox and Lidocaine gel) to help reduce mouth sores and ulcers.Most often, mouth sores that persist can be easily treated by your doctor with medicated mouth washes.

Contact a national cancer support group.,
Decide if your support group will provide strictly group support services or cancer counseling.,
Screen new group members.,
Set the tone for group discussions.,
Enforce group rules.,
Provide resources.,
Invite guests.,
Summarize each meeting.",How to Lead a Cancer Support Group," Seek out someone in a leadership role on the national level to gain guidance on how you should manage your local cancer support group.


Ask for tips about organization of meetings, confidentiality agreements, and typical length and frequency of meetings.
Discuss the forms of publicity the national support group uses to spread the word about group activities. You may consider contacting the public relations department if your group is affiliated with a hospital or clinic, posting flyers and posters at medical facilities, community centers, and doctors' offices. An advertisement in your local paper and on online cancer support forums will also garner attention for your group.
Talk with the national contact about ways to fund your group. Some methods your contact may suggest include filing claims with members' insurance companies, applying for grants, conducting fund raising activities, or accessing funds allocated by the hospital your group is affiliated with.;
, Group support sessions are run by and attended by non-counselors who are cancer survivors, while cancer counseling sessions should be facilitated or co-facilitated by a trained and licensed counselor.

,


Schedule one-on-one meetings before accepting new members into the support group. Discuss the goals and rules of the group and ask about the potential member's reasons for joining the group. Find out what the new member expects to gain from the support group.
Ask the new member to complete a pre-evaluation form. The form should allow the prospective member to express goals and expectations for the group. You can compare this form to the post-evaluation form when the member leaves the group to determine if you met the member's goals.
Have the new member sign a confidentiality agreement stating that information shared in the group is not to be discussed with non-support group members. Inform the new member that signing the agreement is a requirement for joining the group and allows group members to feel safe sharing personal information. You can get copies of confidentiality agreements from your contact at a national cancer support group, the hospital or clinic your group is affiliated with, or you can download a confidentiality agreement template from the Internet and tailor it to your group's needs.

,


Create an atmosphere of trust by reminding members at the beginning of each session that the information shared in the group is confidential. Encourage reluctant members to participate by addressing them directly and asking their opinions about a topic. You can choose to structure meetings around a theme that you encourage each member to comment on.

,


Encourage group members to follow rules that relate to listening and speaking to each other in a respectful manner. Monitor the mood and emotional tone of the group. Help members to confront feelings and problems in a non-harmful way.

,


Add value to the information the members gain from talking about a specific topic by providing articles and reading recommendations that will deepen their knowledge on a subject.

,


Contact physicians and other health care workers who provide services to cancer survivors and ask them to speak on a specific topic or to participate in a session in which the group members get to ask questions about issues such as long-term care and alternative treatments.

,


Plan for 10 minutes at the end of each session to summarize the main points that have come out of the discussion. This approach will reinforce the structured nature of your meetings and bring about closure at the end of every session.

Understand the connection between diet and diabetes.,
Eat more fruits and vegetables.,
Select fruits and vegetables in a variety of rich colors.,
Eat complex carbohydrates.,

Recognize Type 2 Diabetes risk factors that are controllable.,
Acknowledge risk factors for diabetes that you cannot control.,
Act early.,
Return for testing.",How to Avoid Type 2 Diabetes," Eating excessive sweets and fatty foods increases your risk for pre-diabetes and Type 2 diabetes development. You can reverse high-normal blood sugar (pre-diabetes) and reduce your risk for Type 2 Diabetes by reducing unhealthy foods, watching your portions, and eating a balanced diet.;
, Aim for seven to nine daily servings of fruit and vegetables.Frozen and dried fruits and vegetables offer some health benefits, but fresh, in-season produce always packs the most nutritional power.Try to reduce your intake of canned vegetables because they have higher salt content.

, Deeper colors often mean more nutrients, so it is best to eat a variety of different fruits and vegetables that offer an array of bright colors. Some produce to focus on includes:


Dark green veggies like broccoli, spinach, kale, and Brussels sprouts
Orange veggies like carrots, sweet potatoes, pumpkin, and winter squash
Red fruits and vegetables like strawberries, raspberries, beets, and radishes
Yellow foods such as squash, mango, and pineapple

, Skip the pastries, cakes, fries, and other processed carbohydrates. Fill up instead on carbohydrates that are healthy, including fruits, vegetables, whole grain cereals, and fresh breads. Look for choices with high fiber content; fiber has been shown to lower blood sugar by acting as a ""mop"" slowing down the digestive process and the speed with which glucose enters the bloodstream.Eat legumes such as black beans, garbanzo beans, kidney beans, pinto beans, split peas, lentils.
Select whole grains, whole grain rice, breakfast cereals with 100 percent whole grain content, and whole grain pasta.
Choose whole-wheat bread products such as bagels, pita bread, and tortillas.

, You should aim to quench your thirst with water most of the time. If you're worried about its quality, purchase a filter. If you are accustomed to drinking sugary drinks, your body will crave sweetened drinks initially until you wean yourself from the habit.


Sodas, soft drinks, fruit juice, cordial, fruit drinks, flavored water, energy drinks, etc., are all sources of invisible sugar that your body does not need. Leave these drinks for treats only and rely on drinking water and milk.
If you get tired of plain water, soda water and sparkling mineral water are free of sugar, and a few drops of freshly-squeezed lemon or orange juice can be sufficient to flavor these drinks pleasantly.
Coffee and unsweetened tea can also be enjoyed in moderation.

, Refined carbohydrates such as white flour products almost instantly turn to sugar when you eat them.Sugar resides in many snacks from the obvious cakes, pastries, candies, and chocolate, to the less obvious fruit bars and sweetened yogurts. Sugar is cheap and it satisfies cravings, provides a quick pick-me-up for after-lunch crashes, and is serves a never-ending need for fast energy fixes. Don't stock up on sugary treats and don't reach for them when you feel like a lift.


Be aware that sugar can “hide” where you may not expect it, like in breakfast cereals. Opt for cereals with less sugar that are 100 percent wholegrain. You can also substitute sugary cereals with oatmeal, amaranth, or other grain-based options. Try making your own muesli. Read the ingredients list on all products that you're considering buying.

, Replace sugary snacks with fruit, vegetable sticks, nuts, and other healthy items. Fresh, seasonal fruit can satisfy a craving for something sweet. Salted nuts can be a good substitute for salty snacks like chips, but they provide increased nutrients like of fiber, healthy fat, and protein.

, There is a common misconception that all fat is bad. It’s true that deep-fried fast food is an unhealthy source of fat. However, salmon and nuts have a high fat content that offer a variety of health benefits. Avocado is another food that's high in healthy fat. It’s more important to try avoid processed fats, hydrogenated, saturated or mostly saturated (especially avoid trans fats), and vegetable oils than to cut fat entirely out of your diet. Look for unsaturated, monounsaturated, or polyunsaturated fats instead., It may seem like punishment to cut all sugar out of your life forever. However, you can still indulge in the foods you like from time to time without derailing all of your eating habits. You may even find that saving your favorite sweet treats for special occasions, rather than indulging in them daily, can make the experience of eating the treats even sweeter.

, Thinking of your new way of eating as changing your eating habits rather than a temporary “diet” can help you maintain the new habits with less effort. You may also find that you will lose weight with less effort or stress.


Keep in mind that the goal of being healthy is lifelong, and remember that even extremely overweight people have lowered their diabetes risk by 70 percent just by losing 5 percent of their total weight., If you are pre-diabetic, you may need to avoid eating anything other than a light protein snack near bedtime. You should also limit your beverage consumption to water only, cutting out alcohol or drinks with sugar or caffeine.


If you feel hungry after dinner, try eating a low calorie and carbohydrate food that will have less of an impact on your blood sugar. Some options include:Celery sticks
Baby carrots
Green bell pepper slices
A handful of cranberries
Four almonds (or similar nuts),
A cup of light or air-popped popcorn



, Try to differentiate eating as emotional response from eating due to actual physical hunger. Remember that physical hunger can be satisfied by almost any food, while emotional hunger often manifests as a craving for one specific food., It takes about 20 minutes for your stomach to send a signal to your brain that you are full. In that lag, you may eat too much: far more than you need.


Consider seeing a psychologist or a dietitian if you feel that you cannot control emotional eating on your own.

, If you want to make changes to your diet to reduce your risk of developing diabetes, consider talking to a registered dietitian and CDE (Certified Diabetes Educator). These nutrition and diabetes experts will be able to guide you towards a more appropriate diet., It has been shown by the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) that people who lost 5 to 7 percent of their body weight and exercised for a half hour each day 5 days a week cut their risk of developing diabetes by 58 percent. Whatever your weight, exercise is an important part of keeping healthy. Excessive body fat hinders the breakdown use of glucose, which is essential for energy. Even a mere 30 minutes of heart-rate-elevating exercise per day can help you avoid diabetes and maintain a healthy weight.

, If you feel as though you don’t have time to exercise, try walking for half an hour during your lunch break for 5 days a week. This can be a way to “sneak in” exercise.

, You can avoid the traffic rush hour by visiting the gym or going for a brisk walk or jog outdoors for 45 minutes to an hour after you get off work. You may arrive home a little later, but you will feel more relaxed because of the exercise the reduced stress level from avoiding rush-hour traffic.

, Dogs make it easier to exercise and are a form of responsibility that obliged you to get out. If you don’t have a dog (or don’t want to get one), offer to walk a neighbor’s dog.

, Unless you've got heavy packages to carry, walking locally makes good sense. Recruit a friend or family member to join you for company; conversing while walking makes the walk seem shorter.

, Load your iPod or MP3 player with your favorite upbeat music. Give yourself a great excuse to walk or run while listening to your music selection. You can even create a playlist that mirrors your workout, with a slow “warm-up” song, 30-minutes of upbeat walking/jogging music, then a 3-4 minute “cool-down” song. Using a timed playlist can help you ensure that your exercise session is the appropriate length.

, Stress is linked to high glucose levels that can lead to diabetes.This is because when your body recognizes that you are stressed, it primes itself for a “fight or flight” response that throws off your hormone levels. This hormonal change can also increase your chances of gaining weight. To reduce your stress:



Identify why you are stressed. Figuring out why you are stressed will help you address and reduce that stress factor and lower your stress levels.

Learn to say no. Taking on more than you can handle can lead to high stress levels. Recognize your limits and learn to say no to things or ask for help if you need it.

Express your emotions. Sometimes talking to someone about your stress will help you to feel less stressed. The person might also be able to see your situation from an outsider’s perspective that will help you to find a solution.

Manage your time well. Learn to prioritize things and know when other things can be pushed to the side. Try to estimate how long a task will take you and plan your day out accordingly.

, Adults need at least 6, but preferably 7 or more hours of sleep every night for recovery time for the nerves and all other systems to settle and rest. Getting enough sleep is essential to maintaining blood sugar and blood pressure, both of which are related to diabetes.


If you are unable to sleep at night, try reducing your “screen time” before bed, sleeping in a dark room with a noise machine, and limiting your caffeine consumption during the day.
Talk to your doctor about medicinal or herbal sleep aids if you are still unable to sleep well at night.

, Diabetes affects the way that blood sugar (glucose) is processed in your body. An essential energy source, glucose is present in the bloodstream after digesting food. Insulin, normally produced by the pancreas, assists the glucose out of the blood and distributes it to the liver cells, muscles, and fat, where it is turned into usable energy for the body. Diabetes is identified as Type 1, Type 2, and Gestational Diabetes.Type 1 diabetes: This condition involves destruction of more than 90 percent of the insulin-producing cells of the pancreas, causing the pancreas to cease making insulin or to make very little. Type 1 diabetes tends to occur prior to the age of 30 and it may involve environmental factors and genetic predisposition.Type 2 diabetes: While the pancreas continues to produce insulin, or even higher levels of insulin, the body develops a resistance to the insulin, causing the insulin to not be used properly for the body's needs and blood sugar levels remain consistently too high. While this type of diabetes can occur in children and adolescents, it usually begins in people over 30 and becomes more common as people age. Being overweight is a major risk factor for developing type 2 diabetes.

Gestational diabetes: This type of diabetes develops in some women during pregnancy. Left undiagnosed and/or untreated, serious side effects can injure the mother and affect the unborn child. Having gestational diabetes that resolves after delivery increases your chances of developing Type 2 Diabetes at some point of your life.

, Understanding how diabetes can disrupt your life can help motivate you to make the necessary lifestyle and diet changes to prevent the disease. Some of the complications from Type 2 Diabetes can be quite severe. Possible complications include:


Lowered blood supply to the skin and nerves
Fatty substances and blood clots clogging blood vessels (called Atherosclerosis)

Heart failure, heart attack, or stroke
Damage to the eyes, which may cause permanently poor vision
Renal (kidney) failure
Nerve damage (with numbness and pain and loss of function)
Inflammation, infections and skin breakdown especially of the feet

Angina (heart pain)

, Some of the factors that increase your risk for developing diabetes are within your control. Risk factors for diabetes that can be controlled with diet and lifestyle changes include:



Obesity: Based on body mass index, a BMI over 29 increases your odds of diabetes to one in four.Losing weight can drastically reduce your odds of developing Type 2 Diabetes.

A diagnosis of heart disease or high cholesterol: Cardiovascular risks include high blood pressure, low HDL cholesterol, and high LDL cholesterol, and a study showed that one in four people in Europe suffering from these risk factors were also pre-diabetics.Diet and exercise can both help reduce your risk of heart disease and high cholesterol.

Eating a diet high in sugar,cholesterol, fat, and processed food: Diet is tied closely to diabetes. Focus on eating healthier foods.

Irregular or no exercise: Exercising less than 3 times per week increases your risk for diabetes.Work on integrating physical activity into your daily life.

, There are some risk factors for developing Type 2 Diabetes that are not within your control. However, being aware of these factors can help you assess your overall risk for developing the disease. Risk factors include:



Being older than age 45: Note that pre-menopausal women are probably helped by the levels of estrogen, which helps to clear away fatty acids that cause insulin resistance, and helps insulin absorb glucose more rapidly.Having a parent, sibling, or other family member who has or did have Type 2 diabetes: This can indicate a family gene predisposing you to diabetes.Being of Hispanic, African American, Native American, Asian, or Pacific Islander descent: These subgroups are at almost double the risk of white Americans.Experiencing gestational diabetes during pregnancy: Up to 40 percent of women who experienced gestational diabetes are at risk of developing type 2 diabetes later in life.

Being born with a low birth weight: A low birth weight increases your chances of developing diabetes by 23 percent for babies born under 5.5 pounds and by 76 percent for babies under 5 pounds., High blood sugar can be corrected before lasting damage sets in.If you have the risk factors associated with diabetes, it is important to get regular blood or urine screening tests and to respond by controlling your lifestyle factors. If tests reveal that you have pre-diabetes, you have an increased chance of being diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes in the future. Pre-diabetes is a part of metabolic syndrome which is ""a group of risk factors -- high blood pressure, high blood sugar, unhealthy cholesterol levels, and abdominal fat.""While such a diagnosis can be frightening, it's also an opportunity to take back your health and to slow, reverse, or avoid Type 2 diabetes through lifestyle changes.


Pre-diabetes exists where your blood glucose is higher than normal. It's a key indicator of metabolic breakdown taking place, which indicates a movement towards Type 2 Diabetes.Pre-diabetes is reversible, but left ignored, the American Diabetes Association warns that your odds for getting Type 2 diabetes within a decade are almost 100 percent.The CDC recommends that anyone aged 45 or over should be tested for diabetes especially if you're overweight., and people under 45 should be tested if they are overweight and have any other risk factor for diabetes.

, After 6 months of improving your diet and exercise habits, return for a test to see how your blood sugar levels have changed.


Always keep monitoring with your doctor. Follow your doctor's advice. In rare cases, your doctor may recommend taking medication such as Metformin, to reduce your risk of type 2 diabetes.If you need help, consider speaking to a registered dietitian who can assist you with developing a meal plan.

Call emergency services.,
Stay in the hospital.,
Increase your fluid intake.,
Replace your electrolytes.,
Undergo insulin therapy.,
Test for a diabetic ketoacidosis trigger.",How to Treat Diabetic Ketoacidosis1," Diabetic ketoacidosis can be a life-threatening condition. If you are experiencing symptoms like your blood sugar not lowering, you should immediately call emergency services or visit the emergency room.Symptoms that require you to call emergency services include severe nausea, being nauseous for four or more hours, vomiting, being unable to fluids down, inability to get your blood sugar levels down, or high levels of ketones in your urine.Leaving DKA untreated can lead to irreparable damage and even death. It is important to seek medical care as soon as you suspect you are having a problem.;
, Ketoacidosis is usually treated in the hospital. You may be admitted to a regular room or treated in ICU depending on the severity of your symptoms. During the first hours you are there, the doctors will work on getting your fluids and electrolytes back up, then they will focus on other symptoms. Most of the time, patients remain in the hospital until they are ready to return to their normal insulin regimen.Often, patients will have to spend the first 24 to 48 hours in ICU.The doctor will monitor you for any other conditions that may cause complications, like infection, heart attack, brain problems, sepsis, or blood clots in deep veins.

, One of the first things that will be done to treat your diabetic ketoacidosis is to replace fluids. This can be in the hospital, a doctor’s office, or home. If you are receiving medical care, they will give you an IV. At home, you can drink fluids by mouth.Fluids are lost through frequent urination and must be replaced.
Replacing fluids helps balance out the sugar levels in your blood.

, Electrolytes, such as sodium, potassium, and chloride, are important to keep your body functioning properly. During diabetic ketoacidosis, your body doesn’t produce enough insulin. Low levels of insulin in the body reduces the amount of electrolytes, which can interfere with your body functions.Generally, electrolytes are given to you intravenously.

, Insulin helps reverse diabetic ketoacidosis. Insulin helps reduce the acid in your blood and balance your blood sugar level. This therapy is usually given intravenously by a medical professional.Insulin therapy is commonly stopped when the blood sugar levels reach below 240 mg/dL.

, Many times, diabetic ketoacidosis is triggered by a condition or situation. Your doctor may want to test you after your body has returned to normal to see if they can find a possible cause of the condition.Sometimes, DKA is the first sign that someone has diabetes.
For example, you may have a bacterial infection, pneumonia, or a urinary tract infection. Some illnesses or infections can produce hormones like adrenaline and cortisol, which can block the effects of insulin.
Missing treatments of insulin can also trigger diabetic ketoacidosis.
Some medications or alcohol and drug abuse may also trigger the condition.

"
"
Recognize the symptoms.,
Rehydrate.,
Take an increased dose of insulin.,
Create an emergency plan for DKA.,
Go to the emergency room.",How to Treat Diabetic Ketoacidosis2," Diabetic ketoacidosis is a potentially fatal condition. It happens when blood sugar levels are too high for an extended period of time. When high blood sugar does not get treated, ketones gather in the blood and urine, which can cause major problems. Symptoms include:Excessive urination
Extreme thirst
Abdominal pain
Extreme fatigue or weakness
Breath that smells slightly fruity
Nausea
Vomiting
Breathlessness
Dry mouth
Disorientation and confusion
Loss of consciousness
Pain in the abdomen

, One of the main problems that occurs with diabetic ketoacidosis is dehydration due to excessive urination. To help reverse the DKA, drink large amounts of non-calorie or low-calorie beverages, such as water. This should be done as soon as you suspect you have DKA.Because you lose a lot of electrolytes with DKA, try diluting low-calorie Gatorade or Powerade or drinking electrolyte children’s drinks to replace electrolytes.
Try to drink at least eight to 12 ounces of fluid every half hour.

, With diabetic ketoacidosis, your blood sugar becomes too high due to the lack of insulin. You may consider taking an increased dosage of insulin to help try to lower your blood sugar. Generally, you will need 1.5 to 2 times the normal insulin dose. If this doesn't help, do not increase anymore because it can be unsafe. Instead, contact your doctor immediately.Try to get your blood sugar below 200 mg/dL and a negative reading of ketones in your urine.
You should have discussed the potential for DKA with your doctor, so you may know how to administer an increased dose of insulin in case of increased blood sugar levels. If you haven't, call your doctor first before increasing your dosage.

, If you have type 1 diabetes, you should have an emergency plan in place for diabetic ketoacidosis. You should discuss this with your doctor so you can be prepared in case you have diabetic ketoacidosis.Your plan can outline steps to take to rehydrate yourself. You may keep Gatorade or an electrolyte drink around just in case of an emergency.
You should discuss with your doctor the procedure for increasing your insulin dosage to quickly get down your blood sugar levels.
Your emergency plan may also include instructions on how to check your urine for ketones.
Your plan should also include any numbers for doctors or hospitals in case you can't get your DKA reversed.

, This is a life-threatening condition that needs a quick response. If you believe you have diabetic ketoacidosis and the at-home treatments have not worked, you should immediately go to the emergency room or call emergency services.If your blood sugar doesn't lower, your at-home treatments are not working, or your symptoms worsen, you should seek immediate medical attention.
You should also see a physician or emergency services if you have been nauseous for four hours or the nausea is severe. If you have started vomiting or cannot keep fluids down, seek medical treatment immediately.

Follow your diabetic management plan.,
Keep an eye on your blood sugar.,
Take your insulin as directed.,
Monitor your ketone levels.",How to Treat Diabetic Ketoacidosis3," One good way to prevent diabetic ketoacidosis is to follow your management plan. This includes making sure you eat a healthy diet and avoid foods that can affect your blood sugar level.You should also consistently engage in physical activities.

, You should monitor your blood sugar and always know where your levels are. This ensures you are keeping your levels within your target range. Any abnormalities can be treated before it turns into diabetic ketoacidosis.You may need to check your blood sugar multiple times a day to get an accurate picture.

, You should make sure to take your insulin doses as your doctor recommends. Missing multiple insulin doses is a common risk factor that leads to diabetic ketoacidosis. You should discuss with your doctor how to adjust your insulin as needed to keep your blood sugar within your range.You should talk with your doctor about how to adjust your insulin based on your blood sugar level, the foods you eat, your health, and your activity level. You may say, ""I would like to know how to control my blood sugar levels no matter what happens. Can you help me figure out how to adjust my insulin depending on my activities or blood sugar levels?""

, Often, ketones increase when you are sick or under a lot of stress. During these times, you should monitor your ketone levels in your urine to make sure they are not at a moderate or high level. If they are, you should seek immediate care.You can check your ketone levels at home by using an at-home blood ketone testing kit. You can also get a urine ketone testing kit to use at home.Low levels of ketones can let you know you need more insulin.

Consider your age.There is a very strong correlation between your age and your risk of developing prostate cancer.,
Understand your family medical history.Another thing that increases your risk of developing prostate cancer in your lifetime is if you have a family history of prostate cancer.,
Be aware that certain races are at higher risk for prostate cancer.African Americans have been shown to have a higher risk of developing prostate cancer than either Caucasian or Hispanic men.,
Tell your doctor if you are experiencing problems with urination.One of the telltale signs of a possible prostate cancer — and certainly something that indicates that you are at higher risk for a possible prostate cancer — is problems with urination.,
Take note of blood in your semen.Blood in your semen is another sign that is suspicious of prostate cancer, and increases the risk that you may have it.,
Inform your doctor if you are experiencing pain either in your pelvic area, hips, or spine.Pain in your pelvic area may be due to a tumor of the prostate.,
Discuss the pros and cons of prostate cancer screening with your physician.The choice of whether or not to screen for prostate cancer is a highly controversial one right now.,
Ask your doctor to perform a DRE (digital rectal exam).A digital rectal exam (DRE) has limited and perhaps no value for screening (when a man has no symptoms); however, it can be essential when investigating symptoms, such as difficulty urinating or blood in semen.,
Get a PSA (prostate specific antigen) test done if you have symptoms.A small amount of PSA can normally be detected in the blood; however, if your blood test shows an unusually elevated PSA, it may be an indication of prostate cancer.,
Receive an ultrasound.If your clinical signs and symptoms and/or tests (such as a DRE or PSA) are suspicious for a possible prostate cancer, your doctor will likely recommend that you proceed with an ultrasound.,
Opt for a prostate biopsy.If the ultrasound shows a mass, your doctor will likely use a needle to take several small samples of the prostate mass for a biopsy (that is, to be examined under the microscope).",How to Know if You're at High Risk for Prostate Cancer," You are unlikely to develop prostate cancer before the age of 40, and about six in ten cases of prostate cancer are in men over the age of 65.


Even if you are diagnosed with prostate cancer later in life, it is key to understand that many men outlive their prostate cancer.
What this means is that, even if you are diagnosed with prostate cancer, many forms are very slow-growing and do not need treatment. They may never move beyond the prostate and may never cause you serious problems.On the other hand, some prostate cancers are more severe and can spread throughout the body.;
, There appears to be a genetic tendency that can be passed on from generation to generation. Your risk of having this tendency relates to the number of men in your family who have had prostate cancer (as well as how closely related to you they are).If you have a family history of breast cancer, this may also increase the chances that you, as a man, may develop prostate cancer. Some studies have linked these two diseases to similar genetic mutations.

,


People of Asian descent have a lower incidence of prostate cancer than Caucasians or Hispanics.

, Let your doctor know if you have been experiencing dribbling of urine, incomplete emptying of your bladder, or awakening several times per night to go to the bathroom.


Each of these may be signs of an enlarged prostate.
The most common cause of an enlarged prostate is benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), which is not cancer. In some cases, however, prostate cancer can cause urinary symptoms and can enlarge the prostate.
It is worth seeing your doctor to determine the underlying cause and to evaluate for the possible presence of prostate cancer.

, It is thus important to tell your doctor about it. Your doctor will then likely advise that you receive investigative tests to look into whether or not prostate cancer is the root cause.

, Pain in your hip bones or spine may be due to metastatic prostate cancer. This is because the most common place that prostate cancer spreads to is your bones. Inform your doctor if you are experiencing pain in either or both of these areas.

, While screening for prostate cancer has been shown to detect prostate cancers earlier, it has not been shown to reduce the number of deaths from prostate cancer. As such, the benefits of prostate cancer screening tests are questioned by the medical community.


Detecting prostate cancer earlier via screening tests does not tell your doctor much about how the cancer may progress or affect your quality of life (if at all). It can be difficult to decide whether or not to proceed with treatment. Surgery may or may not prevent complications and deaths, and may or may not have adverse effects such as impotence and urinary incontinence.
The choice of whether or not to move forward with screening tests for prostate cancer is normally discussed on an individual basis between each man and his doctor. Each person's situation will require careful thought and decision making.

, This is a short procedure in which your doctor inserts a gloved finger through your anus and up your rectum until they can feel your prostate. Your doctor will then evaluate the contour of your prostate to see if there are any unusual areas or masses.


The DRE exam normally only takes a couple of minutes to perform.
It can be done in the office setting and does not require any special preparation.

, (Note that this test is not accurate enough to be diagnostic of prostate cancer.)


An elevated PSA may also indicate a prostate infection, prostate inflammation, or prostate enlargement. It is not specific to prostate cancer.

, An ultrasound probe will be inserted through your rectum to provide the clearest view of your prostate.


If a cancer is present, a mass will most likely be able to be seen on ultrasound.

, The appearance of the suspicious tissue under the microscope can confirm for sure whether or not it is prostate cancer.

Be aware of what causes diabetic gastroparesis.For people who have had diabetes for a while (normally at least 10 years with the disease), gradually complications start to occur such as damage to the nerves.,
Monitor your blood sugar levels.If you have diabetic gastroparesis, or are at risk of developing the condition, it is especially important to watch your blood sugar levels closely.,
Take your insulin after meals rather than before.When suffering from diabetic gastroparesis, it is advisable to take your insulin injections after eating meals instead of before.,
Eat smaller, more frequent meals.To ease the symptoms of diabetic gastroparesis, it is advisable to eat smaller, more frequent meals instead of infrequent larger ones.,
Practice chewing your food properly.,
Avoid foods that are high in fat.It is hard for the body to digest fat since it is insoluble in water.,
Avoid eating food that is rich in fiber.Although fiber is healthy for most individuals, if you suffer from diabetic gastroparesis too much fiber can make your digestion problems worse.,
Start exercising.,
Do not lie down after eating.,
Take medications to increase the rate of digestion.,
Optimize your blood sugar control.If you are finding that your blood sugars are not properly under control (or are not meeting the targets your doctor set for you), your doctor may prescribe higher doses of medication or of insulin.,
Know that your doctor may put you on a liquid diet.,
Undergo electrical stimulation of the gastric muscles.This is reserved for more severe cases.,
Opt for surgery.,
Look for a feeling of fullness.An early symptom of diabetic gastroparesis is a feeling of being full most of the time.,
See whether you feel bloated.Bloating is caused by the delayed stomach emptying that may be caused by impairment of the abdominal muscles.,
Identify abdominal pain.Abdominal pain due to gastroparesis is felt in the upper abdomen and is caused by accumulation of food in the stomach and delayed digestion.,
Watch out for changes in your general blood sugar levels.Diabetic gastroparesis may cause a reduction in your overall blood sugar level after eating.,
Consider whether you've lost any weight.,
Identify an acidic sensation in the throat.",How to Treat Diabetic Gastroparesis," This is why people with diabetes are known to have reduced sensation in their extremities (most commonly the feet) over time, as nerve damage goes hand-in-hand with chronically elevated blood sugar levels. One nerve that can get damaged in the long-term with diabetes is the vagus nerve, which is responsible for helping with digestion. Damage to the vagus nerve as a result of high blood sugars is what causes diabetic gastroparesis.;
, This is because too much time spent with elevated blood sugar levels will speed up the rate of damage to the vagus nerve, further impeding digestion. Therefore, if you consciously monitor your blood sugars and make an effort to keep them in the ""normal range"" for as much of the time as possible, you will minimize the rate of any further damage.


The normal value for blood glucose ranges from 70mg/dl to 110mg/dl. If you blood sugar is outside of this range, you may need to take insulin (or higher medication doses) to lower blood sugar levels. Speak to your doctor about what strategies are best in your particular case.
You can purchase a glucometer in any drugstore to monitor your sugar levels at home. To use a glucometer, use a lancet device to prick the tip of a finger. Place a drop of blood on the strip and wait for a few seconds as the device counts the blood sugar level.

, This will ensure that the effects of insulin are delayed (given that the rate of digestion is delayed) and that the blood sugar levels are controlled.


Be sure to consult with your physician before switching your insulin regime.

, This is due to the fact that smaller meals are easier to digest, and important nutrients can be absorbed by the body more quickly.


Smaller quantities of food also prevent blood sugars from spiking too high, which reduces the need to for insulin production. This is very important for diabetic people.
Try to eat six small meals a day instead of three large ones.

, Chewing food properly helps with digestion. This is due to the fact that proper chewing breaks down the solid texture of food, making it much easier for the stomach acid to digest.


Proper chewing of food involves chewing for longer periods of time, eating small portions, and swallowing slowly. Don’t be in a hurry when eating - take your time and concentrate on chewing every bite thoroughly.

, Therefore, digesting fat takes more time and effort. Fatty foods should be avoided whenever possible, especially if you have diabetic gastroparesis.


Foods that are high in fat include: butter, cheese, processed meats, canned goods, and any fried meat.
Acidic and spicy foods can also increase symptoms in those with gastroparesis.
In addition, avoid carbonated beverages, as it can worsen abdominal distention.

, Speak to your doctor before making significant changes to your diet; however, your doctor may recommend cutting back on high-fiber foods such as oranges, broccoli, apple with the skin on, wheat, beans, nuts, kale, and red cabbage.


If you do need to cut back on fiber, try cutting out soluble fiber, eating small amounts of insoluble fiber instead. Insoluble fiber includes things like celery and wheat bran.

, Exercise can also help to improve digestion and blood sugar control. Exercise not only helps to utilize the sugar in your bloodstream faster, it also develops channels for absorbing sugar that are ""insulin-independent.""


What this means is that exercise improves your overall ability to digest and to absorb the sugar from your food without causing further nerve damage if you suffer from diabetic gastroparesis.

, It is important to sit up straight while you eat and to avoid lying down for at least two hours after eating. This will aid digestion due to gravity.

, If you have been diagnosed with gastroparesis, your doctor may prescribe several medications to help with the digestion process.These include:


Metoclopramide: This drug helps in stimulating the contraction of the stomach muscles. It also helps to speed up the emptying of the stomach, allowing the patient to eat. The drug also helps to prevent nausea and vomiting. It should be taken half an hour before meals and before going to bed. The dosage is generally 10 mg three times daily.
Antibiotics: Certain antibiotics, such as azithromycin and erythromycin, may be used to increase the rate of GI motility.
Ranitidine: This drug is usually used to treat heartburn, but is sometimes used off label to treat gastroparesis. acts by increasing the motility of the digestive tract. The dose is usually 1 mg per kilogram, taken twice daily in the form of oral tablets.
Know that nausea is quite common alongside diabetic gastroparesis, due to an ""overly full feeling"" in your stomach.For this reason, Metoclopramide or other anti-nauseants such as Ondansetron (Zofran) may be of help.

, As previously mentioned, ensuring proper blood sugar control via both dietary strategies and medication is key to minimizing the progression of diabetic gastroparesis. In other words, the better your blood sugars are controlled, the less damage to your digestive process in the long run.


Certain diabetes medications, such as pramlintide, liraglutide, and exenatide may delay gastric emptying. If you take these medications, talk to your doctor about switching to a different medication.

, In some cases of diabetic gastroparesis, your doctor will advise you to go on a liquid diet, as liquefied foods are easier to digest. Acceptable liquids include porridge, tea, milk and soup.


The liquid diet is often temporary until exacerbations of your gastroparesis settle down.

, To receive this treatment, a battery-operated device is implanted into the abdomen. The device sends electrical pulses to the muscles of the abdomen. This helps to increase gastric emptying, and to reduce nausea and vomiting.


This procedure is done surgically under general anesthesia, which means that you will be put to sleep so you will not experience any pain.

, More invasive surgery may be necessary in the most severe cases of diabetic gastroparesis. During this surgery, a jejunostomy tube is inserted directly into the small intestine through the abdomen.This tube will allow you to be fed by sending the food directly into the small intestine.


The jejunostomy tube can also be used to decompress the GI tract to relieve symptoms.

, This is caused by the delayed emptying of the stomach.


When one has ingested food, the food is stored in the stomach and then taken to the intestines after initial digestion has taken place.
When there is delayed emptying of the stomach, you are more inclined to feel full all the time.
Nausea and vomitus that contains recently ingested food is also a symptom.

, These muscles help in the digestion of food.


When they are not in good working order, digestion and emptying are delayed, causing gases to be trapped in the stomach and intestines instead of being released.
This gassy build-up may cause you to feel bloated.

, This may cause you to feel pain and discomfort as the food does not go through the normal process of digestion and stomach emptying.

, This is because the food that is eaten is broken down into sugar, so when there is delay in digestion, you may have a reduced amount of sugar in the blood.


In addition to a lower than normal blood sugar right after eating, you may also have unexpectedly higher blood sugar levels later on as the food that was digested more slowly finally enters your bloodstream.

, Weight loss is caused by delayed emptying of the stomach that makes you feel full most of the time.This causes many people to eat less food because they feel less hungry.

, An acidic feeling in the throat is caused by the regurgitation of food into the esophagus, which can happen as a result of delayed stomach emptying.


The esophagus helps to connect the mouth and the stomach. When there is a lot of food in the stomach and it is not being emptied, the food may move upwards into the esophagus.
This food is usually mixed with gastric juices and, when it is regurgitated, it causes a burning sensation in the esophagus (the feeling of ""heartburn"")."

Find out how serious your diabetic retinopathy is.,
Consult with your primary care physician.,
Control your blood sugar.,
Consider surgical treatment.,
Find out if you have diabetes.,
Identify symptoms.,
Take your blood sugar level into consideration.,
See an eye doctor.",How to Treat Diabetic Retinopathy," There are four stages of diabetic retinopathy, with the first being the least severe and the fourth being the most severe. When you visit your optometrist, tell them that you have diabetes. They can perform a basic dilated eye exam. They may refer you to a more specialized eye doctor, an ophthalmologist, who can let you know how serious your condition is.Knowing what stage you are will help you to understand the severity of your condition and what steps will need to be taken to get your condition under control. The stages are:Mild nonproliferative retinopathy: At this stage there are small areas of weakness and bulging in the blood vessels. These are called microaneurysms. These microaneurysms may allow fluid to leak into the retina.
Moderate nonproliferative retinopathy: At this stage the blood vessels are bulging and distorting. They may also become blocked or no longer move blood around the eye.
Severe nonproliferative retinopathy: At this stage there are numerous blood vessels that have ruptured or are blocked. This causes a lack of blood supply to areas of the eye. When this occurs, the areas lacking blood supply begin to signal that new blood vessels should be established. However, these new blood vessels will grow weakly and in inappropriate areas, further damaging vision.
Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR): This is the advanced stage of diabetic retinopathy in which the eye begins growing replacement blood vessels that are not strong and located in areas that can impact your vision negatively. This usually includes the inside surface of the retina. At this stage there is usually excessive scar tissue, which can cause the retina to detach. This detachment can cause permanent blindness.;
, If you are having trouble maintaining your blood sugar and you are concerned that it might be affecting your vision, you should make an appointment with your doctor, in addition to your eye doctor. Getting your diabetes in control is an important part of treating diabetic retinopathy.


Your primary care physician will help you to address the difficulty you are having with maintaining your blood sugar levels.
Controlling your blood sugar is the best way to prevent diabetic retinopathy from occurring in the first place.

, Even if you and your doctor make a good plan for how you will control your blood sugar in the future, it is up to you to do so on a daily basis. Controlling your blood sugar include both taking your medication when you should and also maintaining a lifestyle that promotes a healthy blood-sugar level.Lifestyle changes that you may need to make include changing your diet to eliminate spikes in your blood-sugar level, losing weight, and increasing the amount of exercise that you do.

, If your diabetic retinopathy is advanced and affecting your vision, you may need to get surgery to save your eye sight. There are several types of surgery that may be suggested to you. Your eye doctor will suggest the treatment they think will be most helpful for your specific condition. The surgical procedures used to treat diabetic retinopathy include:Medication injections: With this treatment, medication is injected straight into the back of the eye. This medication, usually a steroid, stops the eye from growing new weak and abnormal blood vessels. The procedure is done in a doctor's office and requires that the eye is dilated and numbed with anesthesia.
Laser surgery: Laser surgery is used to shrink abnormal blood vessels and reduce swelling. It is usually done as an outpatient procedure in a doctor's office.
Vitrectomy surgery: This type of surgery is done to remove scar tissue and blood vessels that have formed on the surface of the retina. This allows light into the retina, which in turn improves vision. This is a more invasive surgery than laser surgery and it needs to be performed in a surgical room or hospital. However, it usually done on an outpatient basis or with just a short hospital stay.

, Diabetic retinopathy is a condition that only afflicts diabetics. If you are concerned about it, then the first step is to find out if you have diabetes. Go to your doctor and have them do a blood test to find out if you have diabetes. If you do not have diabetes, then you do not have diabetic retinopathy.However, if you are having trouble with your sight you should see an eye doctor, no matter what your diabetic status is.

, Diabetic retinopathy affects your ability to see in a variety of ways. The fluid that builds up in the retina can blur your vision, it can cause you to see spots or floating shapes, and it can create a dark or empty space in the middle of your vision that you cannot see anything in. Also, diabetic retinopathy can make it difficult for you to see at night.These symptoms could signal a variety of medical problems in your eyes. If you have any of them, you should make an appointment with an eye doctor to get checked out.
Cataracts are also more common in people with diabetes. These can be detected early with an annual eye exam.

, If you know that you have diabetes and you are having problems with your sight, it is more likely to be diabetic retinopathy if you are having a hard time controlling your blood sugar.Long periods of high blood sugar can cause fluid to build up in the eyes.

, If you are having trouble with your vision, you should make an appointment with an eye doctor immediately. They will discuss your symptoms with you, do a visual acuity test, measure the pressure in your eyes, inspect your eyes when they are dilated, and they may even do imaging tests of your eyes. These tests will allow them to diagnose, or rule out, diabetic retinopathy.Everyone with diabetes should get an annual vision checkup that includes getting the eyes dilated. This lets the doctor see to the back of the eye, which allows them to inspect the retina and the optic nerve.

Use an omega-3 fatty acid supplement.,
Take a vitamin supplement.",How to Treat Insulin Resistance," 90 to 95% of your daily carbohydrates should be complex. Complex carbs take longer for your body to process because they're more complicated on a molecular level. This gives your body a better chance to process the glucose. Complex carbs are found in whole, unprocessed foods like whole grains, peas, lentils, beans, and vegetables.Simple carbohydrates are often found in processed foods (which include added sugars like glucose, fructose, and sucrose) and are quickly broken down by the body.;
, Sugar itself does not cause diabetes, but ingesting more sugar-filled beverages (especially those containing high-fructose corn syrup)for example is linked higher blood sugar levels and to an increased risk of Type 2 diabetes.Avoid any added sugars and try to choose unprocessed foods. You'll need to read labels carefully to determine the amount of sugars in a food. Make sure to check the labels for all products you buy, since sweeteners are often used many products.To make it simple, you can avoid ""white"" foods. Don't eat white bread, white pasta, or white rice, in addition to desserts or sweet treats.
Understand that manufacturers are not required to list added sugars on the label.

, Processed foods should be avoided because they include both simple carbohydrates along with added sugars. Your food should be as whole and natural as possible. Cut back on processed or prepared foods and cook from home as much as you can. This way you can control food quality and additives like sugar and fat.

, Fiber, along with whole grains, can reverse type 2 diabetes, according to research.Try to include fiber along with every meal. An easy way to get fiber is to sprinkle a tablespoon of ground flaxseed over your meal. Other good sources of fiber include:Brans: corn bran, oat bran, wheat bran
Beans: navy beans, lentils, black beans
Berries: strawberries, raspberries, blackberries
Whole grains: bulgur, brown rice, barley, oats
Vegetables: peas, leafy greens, squash
Seeds and nuts
Fruits: pears, prunes, figs

, Eat more fruits and vegetables of all varieties and colors for the most nutrients. You shouldn't avoid eating fruit because of their sugar. The sugars in fruit are combined with fiber so your body slowly absorbs the sugar.


Dried fruit contains more sugar than its fresh counterpart, so try to include more fresh fruits. Berries are one of the best choices., Choose fish and skinless poultry. The skin can be high in animal fat and added hormones and antibiotics. Eat a few helpings of wild-caught fish each week. Look for salmon, cod, haddock and tuna. These are all good sources of protein and omega-3 fatty acids which are anti-inflammatory.While red meats don't contain carbohydrates that could raise your blood sugar, you should still limit the amount of red meat you eat.Red meat may raise your cholesterol.

, In addition to improving your diet, treatment of insulin resistance includes regular physical activity.Aim for 150 minutes of moderate exercise each week (or 30 minutes five days a week).You can also increase your baseline activity level by doing small things like taking the stairs instead of the elevator or parking your car farther from the door.


Do not jump into a rigorous exercise routine if you are out of shape or have not exercised in a while. Speak with your doctor about what is appropriate for you and ease into activity.

, Several factors can overwhelm the natural balance of blood sugar, leading to too many periods of hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) followed by periods of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). These factors include eating too many simple sugars, having a family history of diabetes, obesity, and a lack of exercise.Eventually, blood sugar imbalance can weaken your blood sugar control system, leading to insulin resistance and diabetes (after months to years of insulin resistance)., If you are concerned about your blood sugar levels (perhaps because diabetes runs in your family), see your doctor. Inform your doctor of any lifestyle or diet changes you've made to control your blood sugar. You should be seeing your doctor for regular checkups and blood tests if you're trying to prevent diabetes.


Remember to ask your doctor before taking herbs or supplements, including minerals. High amounts of trace minerals can cause toxicity, so always follow the doctor's and manufacturer's advice concerning dosage.

, There are a large number of herbs that you can add to your diet to help control blood sugar levels. Use them to flavor your meals since they are safe with no side effects. These herbs may help you get over some of those sugar cravings as well. Try:


Cinnamon
Fenugreek
Okra (not quite an herb, but more of a side-dish)
Ginger
Garlic and onions
Basil

, Studies have shown several herbal supplements may improve glucose tolerance. Try bitter melon which prevents the intestines from absorbing sugar. Or, take the coptis chinensis supplement which comes from plant roots and is shown to increase the body's responsiveness to insulin. You can also include a gymnema sylvestre supplement which supports the pancreas in producing insulin.Some of these herbal supplements, like bitter melon, may interact with other glucose-regulating medications. Always talk to your doctor before introducing a supplement.

, Take alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) and CoEnzyme Q10 (CoQ10). These antioxidants can control blood sugar levels. ALA stabilizes blood sugar levels and CoQ10 is an antioxidant produced in all cells. CoQ10 levels are lower in diabetics, so supplementing may reduce your risk of the disease.You may want to take carnitine, which comes from amino acids. Carnitine can control blood sugar and blood fats by converting fat into energy., Healthy fats like omega-3s can reduce the inflammation caused by high blood sugar levels and may. Consider taking an omega-3 fatty acid supplement, evening primrose oil supplement, or flaxseed oil. These are all good sources of healthy fats.


Research has shown that omega-3s work well when combined with additional treatment for insulin resistance., Several B-vitamins work to regulate glucose, prevent nerve damage, and prevent cholesterol. Look for biotin (a B-complex), niacin (another B-complex vitamin), vitamin B6, and vitamin B12. You may want to include a vitamin C supplement because it can reduce insulin resistance. Vitamin D may also be helpful in improving insulin sensitivity.Always follow the manufacturer's dosing instructions for vitamins.


Include minerals in your supplement. Several important minerals can maintain blood glucose levels. These include magnesium, zinc, chromium, vanadium, potassium, manganese, and selenium.

Be aware of the following signs and symptoms.,
Take note of your lifestyle choices.,
See your doctor.The only way to truly confirm whether or not you have diabetes is to see your doctor for diagnostic testing (in the form of blood tests).,
Get tested by a physician.,
Get your HbA1c (hemoglobin A1c) levels measured.This is a newer test that is being used by some doctors for diabetes.,
Treat diabetes.,
Seek follow-up tests.",How to Tell if You Have Diabetes," If you have two or more on the list below, it is best to see your doctor for further evaluation. Common signs and symptoms of both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes include:Excessive thirst
Excessive hunger
Blurry vision
Frequent urination (you wake 3 or more times in the night to urinate)
Fatigue (particularly after eating)
Feeling irritable
Wounds that don't heal or heal slowly;
, People who live a sedentary life (with little to no exercise) are at a heightened risk of Type 2 diabetes. People who are overweight or obese, or who eat more sweets and refined carbohydrates than is ideal are also at significantly higher risk of developing Type 2 diabetes.Note that Type 2 diabetes is acquired in one's life, most often related to poor lifestyle choices, versus Type 1 diabetes which is a condition one is born with that most often presents in childhood.

, The numbers that come back on your blood tests will help to classify you as ""normal,"" ""pre-diabetic"" (meaning you are at very high risk of soon developing diabetes if you do not make some dramatic lifestyle changes), or ""diabetic.""


It is best to know sooner rather than later whether or not you have the disease, because if you do, prompt treatment is key.
The damage that results to your body as a result of diabetes is mostly long-term damage resulting from ""uncontrolled blood sugars."" What this means is that, if you receive treatment that helps to control your blood sugars, you can avert or at least ""push off"" (delay) many of the long-term health consequences of diabetes. It is for this reason that prompt diagnosis and treatment are key.

, Your primary care physician can perform 2 different tests to check your blood glucose test.Normally, a fasting blood test is used to check for diabetes, but a urine test can also be performed.


Normal blood glucose levels are between 70 and 100.
If you're borderline diabetic (""pre-diabetic""), your levels will be between 100 and 125.
If your levels are above 126, you're considered diabetic.

, It looks at the hemoglobin (a protein) in your red blood cells and measures how much sugar is attached. The higher the value, the more sugar is attached, which directly correlates to your risk of having diabetes. (After all, diabetes is the heightened prevalence of sugar in the bloodstream.)


To explain the normal correlation between HbA1c and average blood sugar levels is as follows. An HbA1c of 6 equates to a blood glucose level of 135. An HbA1c of 7 = 170, an HbA1c of 8 = 205, an HbA1c of 9 = 240, an HbA1c of 10 = 275, an HbA1c of 11 = 301, and an HbA1c of 12 = 345.
In most labs, the normal range for HbA1c is between 4.0-5.9%. In poorly controlled diabetes, it is 8.0% or above, and in well controlled patients it is less than 7.0%.
The benefit of measuring HbA1c is that it gives a more reasonable view of what's happening over the course of time. It reflects your average sugar levels over the past 3 months, rather than a simple glucose test which is a one-time measurement of your sugar levels., To treat diabetes, you may need to take insulin injections or pills daily, and you will be asked to watch your diet and to exercise.Sometimes, in more mild cases of Type 2 diabetes, the only thing needed is diet and exercise. Sufficient lifestyle changes can actually reverse diabetes and put you back into the ""normal"" range for your blood sugars. Talk about some great motivation to make changes!
You will be asked to cut back on sugars and carbohydrates, and to exercise for about 30 minutes a day. If you follow through with these changes, you will likely see a noticeable reduction in your blood sugar levels.
Type 1 diabetes, on the other hand, will always require insulin injections because it is an autoimmune disease where the body fails to produce insulin.
It is extremely important to properly treat diabetes. Note that, if left untreated, the elevated blood sugars from diabetes can lead to more serious health issues, such as nerve damage (neuropathy), kidney damage or failure, blindness, and severe circulation problems resulting in difficult-to-treat infections that can progress into gangrene necessitating amputation (particularly in the lower extremities).

, It is important to get repeat blood tests every 3 months or so for people who fall into the ""pre-diabetic"" or ""diabetic"" range. The reason for this is to monitor either improvement of the condition (for those who make positive lifestyle changes), or worsening of the condition.Repeat blood tests also help your physician to make decisions about insulin doses and medication doses. Your doctor will be trying to ""target"" your blood sugars to be within a particular range, so having the numerical values from repeat blood tests is key.
It can also provide motivation for you to exercise more, and to make positive changes to your diet, knowing that you may very well see tangible results on your next blood test!

Get a glycated hemoglobin (A1C) test.,
Undergo a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) test.,
Have the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) test.,
Get a random plasma glucose test.",How to Test for Diabetes," Type 1 diabetes is characterized by the body's inability to produce insulin, a hormone that regulates the amount of sugar (glucose) in the blood and helps to transfer the glucose to your cells for energy. If your body isn't producing insulin, this means that the glucose stays in your blood and your blood sugar level can become too high. By contrast, type 2 diabetes is characterized by the body's inability to utilize and store glucose properly thanks to insulin resistance, which is usually connected to being overweight. In cases where there is excess weight, the muscle, liver and fat cells do not process insulin properly and the pancreas simply can't produce enough, causing blood glucose levels to increase.Type 1 diabetes (formerly known as juvenile diabetes) is usually diagnosed in children or teens, and can develop within just a few weeks. Meanwhile, type 2 develops over a period of time and with age, though it is becoming more and more common for children to experience early onset type 2 diabetes due to obesity.
Approximately 10 percent of all diabetics are type 1 and require insulin to survive, whereas the overwhelming majority of diabetics are type 2 diabetics who suffer from an impaired glucose metabolism that leads to insulin deficiency.There's also gestational diabetes, which occurs only during pregnancy. Because of the increase in hormone production during pregnancy, the amount of insulin is also increased to control glucose levels in the blood; however, if the body can't meet this demand for more insulin, then diabetes results. Gestational diabetes usually disappears after the birth, but can put the mother at a higher risk for type 2 diabetes later in life.;
, Get tested if you exhibit the classic triad of diabetic symptoms: increased thirst (polydipsia), increased urinary frequency (polyuria), and increased hunger.You can assess whether you're experiencing an increase in these symptoms based on what is usually ""normal"" for you. For example, if you usually urinate seven or so times per day, but now urinate a lot more and have to get up in the middle of the night, something is not right and you should consult your primary care physician. Other symptoms include:


A compromised immune system (e.g., wounds that don't heal quickly, persistent and recurring infections, such as a foot fungus or athlete's foot, yeast infections in the genitals or mouth, etc.)
Tingling or pain in the hands or bottom of the feet (peripheral neuropathy)
Lethargy and fatigue
Blurred vision
Increased appetite
Unexplained weight loss

, Most of of the symptoms and risk factors for diabetes hold true for people age 45 and over; however, they're also being seen more often in obese people under age 40 and especially in obese teens. Major risk factors for developing diabetes include:A family history of diabetes
High blood pressure (140/90 or higher)
High level of triglycerides (250 mg/dL or higher)
Low high-density lipoprotein, or HDL (good cholesterol) level (35 mg/dL or lower)
Ethnicity (African-American, Hispanic, Native American or Pacific Islander)
Obesity (a body mass index (BMI) higher than 25)
A history of gestational diabetes
Delivering a baby who weighed more than 9 lbs
Diagnosis of Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome
Existing cardiovascular disease
The diagnosis of prediabetes

, Healthy individuals without risk factors should get screened for diabetes at age 45 and then every three years thereafter. For those in high-risk groups, there is no clear-cut consensus on when screening should start, but the American Academy of Endocrinology has offered that a baseline screening should be sought for all those in the high-risk groups listed above.Note that those who belong to higher risk ethnic groups (African Americans, Hispanics, Native American, and Pacific Islanders) should get screened for diabetes at age 30, according to the American Academy of Endocrinology.
If you have have been diagnosed with prediabetes, you should be checked for type 2 diabetes everyone one to two years.
If you're younger than 45 but are overweight or obese, consider getting screened for prediabetes or diabetes.
More than one-third of diabetics go for several years without a diagnosis, so it is best to follow these screening guidelines, as early diagnosis and treatment improves outcomes and decreases the likelihood of developing related health problems and conditions., These tests all involve testing your blood, although they do all not measure the same thing. Testing must be conducted in a certified and sanitary health care facility, such as a physician's office or medical laboratory. Each test usually needs to be repeated on a different day so that there are then two tests that can be used to reliably diagnose diabetes.There are three main tests used to diagnose whether someone has prediabetes (meaning you are at greater risk of developing diabetes) or diabetes: a glycated hemoglobin test, a fasting plasma glucose test, and an oral glucose tolerance test.Note that if the blood glucose level of your blood is considered higher than normal according to one of the tests below and if you are showing classic symptoms of high blood glucose, your doctor may not require a second repeat test to make a correct diagnosis., This blood test provides information about your blood sugar levels over the past two to three months by measuring the percentage of blood sugar attached to the hemoglobin in the blood. Hemoglobin is a protein that carries oxygen in the red blood cells. The higher your blood sugar levels, the more sugar will be attached to the hemoglobin. A level of less than 5.7% is considered normal, while a level of 5.7% to 6.4% is considered to prediabetes, and 6.5% or higher is indicative of diabetes. This test is the standard test for diabetes assessment, management, and research.You won't need to make a special appointment at a blood lab, but instead show up with your requisition form and get a standard blood sample drawn that is then sent to the laboratory for testing. In addition, this test is advantageous in that you don't have to fast or drink anything prior to testing. It can also be performed at any time of the day.
Usually you will be tested twice, with each test occurring on a different day, to assess the average percentage of blood attached to your hemoglobin.
The A1C test is not recommended if it is suspected that you have type 1 or gestational diabetes., This test assesses your fasting blood glucose levels. ""Fasting"" means that you refrain from eating or drinking anything but water, black coffee or unsweetened tea for eight hours prior to the blood test. Your doctor will look at a variety of factors from this blood test, including the glucose level, cholesterol and levels of enzymes in the liver and kidneys, as these organs are affected by diabetes. This test is the most common diagnostic tool for diabetes because it is more convenient and cost-effective than the oral glucose tolerance test.A normal reading is considered one of less than 100 mg/dl, while a reading of 100 to 125 indicates pre-diabetes. An FPG level of 126 is indicative of diabetes.
Note that you will need to plan ahead for this test since you have to fast. For your own ease and comfort, this test is usually done first thing in the morning, before breakfast.
Your doctor may want to repeat the same test on another day to confirm that the results are reliable.
If your FPG level is very high, if you are showing symptoms of diabetes, or if you have been previously diagnosed as pre-diabetic, your doctor may want to move on to the next test in his arsenal, the oral glucose tolerance test to get a quick and firm diagnosis.

, This is a two-hour test that evaluates your blood glucose levels before and after you have a drink that is specially sweetened so your doctor can see how your body processes sugar. To prepare for this test, you'll need to make an appointment in advance for this test and fast eight hours before.At the beginning of your appointment, the doctor or nurse will test your blood glucose level (most likely with a simple finger-prick test, where your finger is pricked and the sugar in your blood is calculated via a digital monitor). You'll then drink a glucose beverage and sit for about two hours before someone tests your blood again.
A level of 139 mg/dl or below is considered normal, while a reading of 140 to 199 indicates pre-diabetes, and 200 or higher indicates diabetes.
Pregnant women undergo the OGTT to determine gestational diabetes; however, their glucose levels are tested four times with high (diabetic) levels being 95 or higher fasting, 180 or higher after one hour, 155 or higher after two hours, and 140 or higher after three hours.

, Also called a Casual Plasma Glucose Test, this test is a blood check that occurs at any time of the day (meaning is not predicated on fasting the day before). This is usually reserved for individuals who have severe diabetes symptoms.In this test, diabetes is diagnosed when your blood glucose is 200 mg/dl or higher.

Get a glucometer.,
Use the lancet provided with the glucometer to prick your fingertip for a sample of blood.,
Place a drop of blood on the test strip provided with the glucometer.,
Read and record your result.",How to Treat Diabetes Related Hypoglycemia1," A glucometer is a small, battery-powered medical device used to check the glucose level in your blood.


If you don’t have a glucometer at home, you can have your blood glucose level checked at a hospital.
Each glucometer comes with test strips. Extra test strips can be purchased at any drugstore.;
, This is a quick piercing action and takes only a second to complete.


This should not hurt, and will be unnoticeable within a minute.

, The lancet should prick one droplet of your blood.


You can then drop or place the blood gently on to the test strip for the glucometer to read.

, The glucometer will take a few moments to read.


To confirm hypoglycemia, your blood sugar level will have a result of less than 70 mg/dl.
The normal blood glucose level is between 70 mg/dl (grams per liter) to 110 mg/dl.
Another level determinant is in mmol (millimoles per liter). A normal blood sugar level is at 4.4 mmol - 6.1 mmols.
When the sugar level is above 6.1 mmols, the patient is hyperglycemic. When it is below 4.1 mmol, the patient is hypoglycemic.

"
"
Call the Emergency Services and arrange for the person to be taken to the hospital.,
Kneel on one side of the person.,
Manipulate the person's limbs into recovery position.,
Open the person's airway.,
Monitor the person closely until you reach the hospital.",How to Treat Diabetes Related Hypoglycemia2," Unconsciousness due to hypoglycemia requires immediate medical intervention as sugar levels are continuing to decrease.


If sugar levels drop too low, coma can occur.
This can lead to brain damage and other long term side effects.

, This is the first step in prepping the patient for “recovery mode,” which helps to ease the breathing.Kneeling gives you good leverage from which to maneuver the person without abrupt motions.

, Place the arm nearest you at a right angle to the person's body.


The hand should point upwards towards their head.
Place the other hand on the side of the head.
This leaves the back of the hand touching the cheek.
Bend the right knee at a right angle. Do this gently with both hands.
Roll the patient gently onto his side.
This is done by gently pulling on the bent knee.
The top arm is left to support the head and the bottom arm will stop the person from rolling too far.

, Open the person's airway by tilting their head back gently and lifting the chin.


The person should not have anything blocking their airway.
When the person is unconscious, don't give them any fluids or foods, as this can cause the patient to choke.
The patient should not be given any insulin as this will lower the sugar levels even more.

, Ensure the person is still breathing and that nothing is obstructing his airway.


This is a critical time, as the person is not aware of their surroundings and is susceptible to further harm.
Make sure that they are being cared for properly.

Give an injection of glucagon.,
Take medication for nausea if consciousness was lost.The person should be able to regain consciousness within 15 minutes of receiving the injection, but there may be nausea caused by the abrupt increase of sugar in the blood.,
Receive a glucose intravenous injection, if necessary.,
Check blood sugar level.",How to Treat Diabetes Related Hypoglycemia3," If blood sugar continues to decrease with accompanying symptoms of confusion and severe body weakness, you should get a glucagon injection.Glucagon is a hormone that stimulates the liver to release stored sugar into the bloodstream.
This remedy is also used if someone has already lost consciousness due to severe hypoglycemia.
Glucagon is generally sold in kits. 1 mg of glucagon is injected into the buttocks, arms or thighs. It can be injected intramuscularly (IM) or subcutaneously (SC).
Follow instructions on the manufacturer’s manual as terms of dosage may differ, or seek medical help.
It is important to train family members on how to give glucagon in emergency situations, as a prolonged hypoglycemic episode can lead to coma.

,


Take metoclopramide at 10mg orally to help reduce nausea and prevent vomiting.

, This injection will raise the blood sugar within 5-15 minutes.


The person is typically injected with 50 mls of 50% glucose. Also known as a Dextrose solution, these injections are generally administered by a medical professional via a catheter placed in a large central vein., The blood sugar level should continue to be checked every 15 minutes until it normalizes.


This can be performed with the glucometer.

"
"
Eat 15 mg to 20 mg of simple carbohydrates or any sugary product.,
Use glucose gel or honey.,
Check your blood sugar level.Checking the blood sugar level should be done 20 minutes after consuming 15 to 20 mg of fast-acting carbohydrates.,
Consume another round of simple carbohydrates if your blood sugar level is still less than 70 mg/dl.,
Consume complex carbohydrates if your blood sugar level is normal.These types of foods help maintain and stabilize blood sugar levels.",How to Treat Diabetes Related Hypoglycemia4," While in a hypoglycemic state, one of the fastest and most effective treatments is to increase your blood sugar levels by consuming simple carbohydrate food sources and sugary foods.Simple carbohydrates are easily digested and contain large amounts of glucose, which can effectively raise low blood sugar levels.
Examples of simple carbohydrates and sugary foods are: saltine crackers, a tablespoons of raisins, a cup of milk, 1 tablespoon of honey, 1 tablespoon of corn syrup, 1 cup of fruit juice, a can of soda (not diet), 3 glucose tablets, 1 serving of glucose gel, 12 teaspoons of corn syrup or honey, hard candies, jellybeans, and gumdrops.

, This can be applied to the inside of the cheeks.


After application, the outside part of the cheeks should be massaged gently.
It may take approximately 10-15 minutes for the gel to work.
Do not apply gel when drowsy.

,


This can be performed with the glucometer.

,


Take 15-20 mg more of simple carbohydrates.
Eat another four saltine crackers or two tablespoons of raisins, for example.

, Examples of complex carbohydrates are:


A cup of oatmeal
A sandwich
1 to 2 servings of fruit
A glass of soy milk
1 carton of low-fat yogurt
6 biscuits and cheese

"
"
Don’t inject insulin.,
Avoid eating complex carbohydrates while blood sugar levels are low.,
Don’t provide food or drinks if the person is having seizures, body weakness, or fainting episodes.Providing food or drink will place the person at a greater risk of choking due to their inability to swallow.",How to Treat Diabetes Related Hypoglycemia5," Diabetics use insulin to help decrease blood sugar levels.Injecting insulin will only decrease blood sugar levels more, increasing the severity of the hypoglycemic episode.
This is very dangerous.

, What you need are simple carbohydrates, as stated above.Complex carbohydrates are slow-acting and will not provide immediate glucose as it takes more time to be digested.
You need to make sure that blood sugar is raised quickly in order to avoid further complications.

,


If the person has fainted, they need immediate medical attention, and you should get them to the care of the closest medical provider.

"
"
Recognize the symptoms.,
Understand the risk factors.,
Prevent diabetes-related hypoglycemic episodes.",How to Treat Diabetes Related Hypoglycemia6," While most patients who have had diabetes for some time are able to tell when their blood sugar levels are low, it is still important to recognize the symptoms of diabetes-related hypoglycemia so that you can prevent severe episodes, including loss of consciousness and other fatal complications. Some common symptoms are indicated below:Dizziness: This occurs because there is reduced sugar level in the brain cells. The brain needs nutrients for proper functioning capability. When there is reduced blood sugar level, you will be feel dizzy.
Trembling: This is caused by reduced energy levels in the body due to reduced blood sugar. The sugar that is present in the blood is taken up by the cells used for the production of energy.
Hunger: This is also caused by reduced amounts of energy. When you go into a diabetes-related hypoglycemic state, all the food that was present in your body has been broken down into sugar. This leaves you with no food in the abdomen and high hunger levels.
Increased heart rate: This is caused by reduced nutrients in the cells, which causes your heart to work harder while trying to meet the demands of the body.
Confusion: This occurs due to reduced nutrients to the brain cells, which leads to impaired brain functionality.
Headache: Headache is also caused by impaired brain functionality.
Poor coordination: This is caused by reduced energy levels in the body.
Poor concentration: This is caused by impaired brain functionality.
Fainting: This is caused by impaired brain functionality and reduced energy levels in the body.
Coma: This occurs in severe cases when there is a prolonged period of low blood sugar.

, Diabetics who understand the risk factors for hypoglycemia can learn to prevent cases of hypoglycemia.


Hypoglycemia is common in diabetic patients who inject an excess dosage of insulin. Insulin lowers the blood sugar level but when high doses are used, the levels will spike, thus causing hypoglycemia.
Hypoglycemia is common in diabetic patients who miss meals. Diabetics are advised to eat all their meals to ensure that their sugar levels remain normal. The food eaten is broken down into sugar that is used by the body for the production of energy. When a meal is missed, the body will have insufficient levels of sugar.
Hypoglycemia is common in diabetic patients who take part in excessive exercise. Foods are broken down into sugar, which is then taken by the cells for the production of energy. During exercise, a lot of energy is consumed, which can leave you with decreased sugar levels.

, Knowing that diabetes-related hypoglycemia is life threatening, it is important to be knowledgeable on how to prevent these episodes. Here are some simple lifestyle practices to keep in mind:


Munch on complex carbohydrates for snacks. This will help you maintain and stabilize the blood sugar levels in your body.
Bring both simple and complex carbohydrate snacks with you at all times.
Eat at regular times throughout the day.
When physically active, it is important to replace the carbohydrates and glucose used up by your body.
Have an emergency kit with you containing glucagon at all times.

Provide emotional support.,
Make dietary changes together.,
Start an exercise plan together.,
Help your loved one manage stress.,
Recognize the symptoms of low blood sugar.,
Identify the symptoms of high blood sugar.,
Work with your loved one’s doctors.,
Learn to give insulin injections if necessary.,
Take care of yourself as a care-giver.",How to Take Care of a Diabetic Patient," If a loved one has just received a diagnosis of diabetes, they are probably feeling upset and overwhelmed. You can provide emotional support and help them learn to manage their diabetes by:Listening. Your loved one may be worried about how the diagnosis may change their life. If your loved one is ready to talk about concerns and fears, listen and when they are ready, help make a plan for how to deal with the issues. Provide reassurance that diabetes is fully manageable and will not prevent them from living a long and full life.
Educating yourself about the condition. This may involve reading books and pamphlets about the disorder. You can also find information online at the American Diabetes Association. Your doctor may even be able to suggest a diabetes education course for you and your loved one. The more educated you are, the better you will be able to anticipate what help might be needed.
Offering help when you see something that you can do. Even small things like providing a ride to a doctor’s appointment may mean a lot.;
, Your loved one may be told eat a healthier diet. You can both change your eating habits together. This will reduce the amount of unhealthy food you have in the house and lessen feelings of isolation. Eating healthier will also benefit you. Search online for diabetes-friendly recipes and cook them together.A diet that will help your loved one manage blood sugar levels will include lots of vegetables and fruits. These are low in fat and calories and high in fiber and vitamins. This means they are excellent for helping people to get the nutrients they need while losing weight. Offer your loved one vegetables as snacks between meals to manage hunger. A crunchy carrot or green pepper can be a delicious, refreshing snack.
Eat whole grains. Whole grain breads, pasta, and brown rice are excellent sources of complex carbohydrates. This means that they take longer to digest than simple carbohydrates such as refined sugar, cookies, cakes, white rice, and breads and pasta made from white flour. Simple carbohydrates are more likely to cause the blood sugar to spike and then crash.
Increase the amount of fish you eat. Fish are generally lower in fat than red meat and poultry. Healthy sources of fish include mackerel, salmon, sardines, tuna and bluefish. When you eat fatty meats, trim off the fat and remove the skin. The skin generally contains a layer of fat underneath it.
Eat moderate amounts of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats such as avocados, pecans, walnuts, almonds, olives, canola, olive and peanut oils. Avoid saturated fats like butter, lard, bacon and sausage. You should also avoid foods with trans fats. These are often found in commercially prepared baked goods, shortening, and margarines.

, Exercising is more fun if you have a partner to do it with and it is a great way to control blood sugar, lose weight, and reduce stress. Both you and your loved one should check with your doctors before starting any new exercise program to make sure that you are healthy enough for it. If your doctors approve, try to do:A half hour of aerobic exercise five days per week. Chose an activity the you and your loved one enjoy like going for walks, dancing, jogging, swimming, or biking.
Resistance training twice per week. These activities will increase your and your loved one’s strength and help control blood sugar levels. Possible activities include yoga and weightlifting.

, Stress can alter how the body responds to insulin. This means that it is important for your loved one to learn to manage stress. Excellent ways to do this include:Learning relaxation techniques such as yoga How to Do Yoga, visualizing calming images How to Visualize, tai chi How to Do Tai Chi, deep breathing How to Breathe Deeply, or meditation How to Meditate.
Exercising. Exercise releases endorphins which cause you to relax and improve your mood. This will benefit you as a care-giver as well.
Getting enough sleep. Most adults need at least eight hours of sleep per night. If you are caring for a diabetic child, children generally need several additional hours of sleep.

, Low blood sugar can occur if a diabetic eats too little or takes too much insulin. As a care-giver, it is important for you to recognize the symptoms so you can help your loved correct low blood sugar by eating a snack or drinking juice. Symptoms include:Dizziness
Sleepiness
Bad mood
Agitation
Shaking
Sweating
Headaches
Hunger
Confusion
Altered behavior
Seizures
Unconsciousness

, High blood sugar can occur when a diabetic eats more than usual, forgets to take insulin, or is sick. If you recognize the symptoms you can help your loved one make adjustments to insulin treatments as necessary. Symptoms include:Nausea
Exhaustion
Blurry vision
Dry mouth
Thirst
More frequent urination
A yeast infection

, Your loved one may need a team of different doctors to get control of the condition. This may include the physician, a nutritionist, and a counselor or support group to help the person cope with the diagnosis. You can advocate for your loved one by:Offering to accompany them to appointments
Listening to the doctor and taking notes so that you both will have a record of what the doctor said
Asking questions if anything is unclear. Sometimes patients are so overwhelmed that they forget to ask questions or are too nervous to do so. Try helping your loved one make a list of questions they'd like to ask prior to the appointment. This will help you have a focused, productive appointment and you won't forget to ask any of your questions.
Providing the doctor with additional information when necessary. Patients often forget to provide information when they are nervous. Your loved one may also not provide information about whether they have been able to completely follow a diet or exercise plan.
Making sure the doctor explains things at a level your loved one can understand. This is particularly important if the patient is a child or elderly. The better they understand the instructions and the reasons for them, the easier it will be to follow them.
Talk to your loved one about scheduling additional appointments that might be necessary to check for complications, such as a yearly physical exam, eye exams, and an appointment to get vaccines. Diabetes can lower your immune system so the doctor may recommend a flu shot, pneumonia vaccine, and a hepatitis B vaccine.

, If you are caring for a child or someone who is elderly, it may be necessary for you to give insulin injections and do finger-prick tests. You can learn to do through:Information and training provided by your loved one’s doctors
Diabetes courses. You can search for courses online at the American Diabetes Association, Diabetes UK, or other national diabetes organizations.

, Being a care-giver can be frustrating, exhausting, and stressful. It is important to remember to take care of yourself as well. This is critical both for your own health and well-being, and so that you can continue to be an effective care-giver. Ways to get support yourself include:Joining a care-givers’ support group. You can search online or ask your doctor for recommendations of groups near you.
Talking to friends and family
Seeing a counselor
Maintaining your hobbies so that you get a mental break from your care-giving responsibilities

Try a supplement.",How to Treat Diabetic Foot Problems," If you feel any changes in your feet like numbness, tingling, pain, or weakness, see your doctor immediately. Any of these symptoms could signal a problem with your feet that could lead to infection. It's important to get quick medical treatment since infection can spread throughout your body within a few hours. The doctor or podiatrist will examine your feet and may order a series of tests including:Blood tests, such as an HBA1C test and blood glucose level test
X-rays or other imaging tests
Angiogram (an x-ray of your heart)
Nerve and sensory testing
Muscle strength and tone;
, An infection in your foot can be serious and cause a lot of damage. You may develop gangrene and lose the foot if the infection is not treated promptly. Foot infections (even fungal infections like athlete's foot and fungal toenails) must be medically treated right away. Signs of foot infection include:Redness or red streaks
Swelling of the feet or legs
Pain
Fever
Chills
A warm area on your feet or legs
Pus
Foul odor

, If you've noticed pain, swelling, or one foot become larger than the other, you should be examined for charcot foot. Severe nerve damage can weaken the bones in your foot which can cause them to break or fracture. Your doctor will take x-rays to diagnose charcot foot.If you don't realize that you have a fracture and continue walking on the foot, you may develop deformities.

, If you've been putting too much pressure on your feet, you may develop open sores known as foot ulcers. You'll probably notice discharge on your socks and the bottom of your foot might have a sore that's red, swollen, or smelly.Although foot ulcers look painful, most people who develop them have nerve damage that keeps them from feeling the pain.
Invest in some good shoes and socks, and make sure your shoes fit well. This will help to prevent against blisters, which can turn into a sore that never heals, especially in diabetics.

, Once you've been diagnosed with an infection, your feet will be x-rayed to see if the infection has spread to the bones. The doctor will grow a culture of the infection to determine what caused it in order to create a treatment plan. You'll be given antibiotics or antifungals to treat your infection. If you have a moderate or severe infection which goes deep into the skin (possibly to the bone or blood), you'll need to be treated in the hospital and may need surgery.

You'll probably be examined by a team of infectious diseases specialists, surgeons, podiatrists and orthopedists.
Infection of the bone is called osteomyelitis and it can be detected by a bone scan. You can get a bone scan at the hospital.
If you have osteomyelitis you will be treated with antibiotics, but surgery may also be necessary. You will receive IV antibiotics for several weeks and then switch to an oral antibiotic., Your doctor will recommend that you completely immobilize your foot and keep all weight off of it. You'll probably need to get a cast, wear a brace, or use a wheelchair or crutches. The bones will need a chance to totally heal so you may need to stay off of the foot for several weeks or months. When you are able to carry some weight on your foot, you'll need to wear custom braces and shoe supports.Surgery is usually only done in severe cases if earlier treatments don't work.

, If you have dead skin tissue in your foot as well as an infection, your doctor may want to remove that while treating you with medication. This may mean that your doctor wants to surgically remove infected bone or drain infected pus. In this case, your doctor is probably suggesting surgery to save the foot from amputation.Surgery can improve blood flow that's been restricted. This can help medication reach the areas that need to be treated.
Surgical procedures can either remove dead and/or damaged tissue from the wound or drain the wound of pus and purulent material. This will allow your foot to heal better, and hopefully without complication.

, Foot ulcers can develop into serious health problems, so see your doctor or podiatrist right away. The doctor will cleanse the ulcer and remove any dead skin and tissue. You'll then need to take pressure off of the ulcer and keep the wound clean until it heals.

You may need to wear a brace, cast, or special shoes to keep the pressure off of the ulcers.
Continue to treat other glucose-related health problems while you're treating the ulcers.
When caring for your foot ulcers, make sure that you check and wash both of your feet every day with warm water. Avoid soaking your feet too long because waterlogged sores are harder to heal.

, Poor blood circulation in your feet can be painful. You may notice pain in your feet that increases when you walk, but gets better when you rest (a condition called intermittent claudication). To improve circulation, wear warm socks and exercise. Avoid warming your feet in hot water since you may not feel how hot the water actually is and could burn yourself.Poor circulation can make the skin on your legs hard and shiny. You might lose hair on your lower legs and feet too.
Home and lifestyle remedies for increase circulation and control claudication include the following include quitting smoking, controlling your cholesterol levels, protecting your feet, resting your feet below your heart, exercising, and avoiding certain medications such as sinus medicine that constricts the blood vessels., Work with your healthcare team (like your endocrinologist, physical therapist, and occupational therapist) to keep your blood sugar in your target range. Keeping your blood sugar levels steady will help to prevent any of the complications of diabetes.Another important thing you can do to prevent diabetic complications is quit smoking. Smoking reduces your circulation and slows your body's healing ability.
Diabetics should shoot for the lowest possible blood sugar level and HBA1c readings possible. Potential risks of tight control of blood glucose levels include hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), which is a dangerous adverse effect. If you find yourself hypoglycemic you can drink a half cup of orange juice, consume hard candies, or take three glucose tabs., Take your socks off and take the time to examine your feet each day. Look for any cuts, sores, changes in skin color, or anything different. If you can't see the bottom of your feet, ask someone to check them for you. If you find something (even a minor cut), make sure you contact your physician or podiatrist right away.Have your feet checked at least once a year either by your physician or a foot specialist (a podiatrist).

, Wash and dry your feet every day. Moisturize your feet, but avoid getting lotion in between your toes. Trim your nails straight across and file them with an emery board. Or, you can get your toenails professionally trimmed. You should also get any corns or calluses professionally removed as soon as you see them.Ask your podiatrist to recommend special shoes that may protect your feet and always wear clean dry socks that don't cut off circulation.

, Exercising or just moving around more can really improve your circulation. You'll want to work with your healthcare team to come up with activities you can do to get the blood flowing. It's important to be active, but you may need low-impact activities if you're trying to reduce pressure on your feet.If you get a foot injury, get your foot examined by your doctor as soon as possible.

, Take an alpha lipoic acid (ALA) which has been shown to prevent peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage). You'll probably want to take 300 mg three times a day or as often as your doctor recommends. Be sure to choose a high-quality supplement and continue to monitor your blood sugar since ALA can lower blood sugar levels. It can take 3 to 5 weeks before you notice an improvement in nerve sensation.Side effects of ALA are rare, but include: stomach upset, dizziness and rashes.

Prevent skin from getting dry.,
Change your bathing style.,
Care for your skin in the summer.,
Take care of your skin in the winter.,
Lower your stress.",How to Stop Itching from Diabetes1," Keep your skin moist and healthy by using moisturizers and skin creams. Avoid scented creams and lotions, BECAUSE you could have a reaction to them, causing more itching. Moisturize twice a day. Every time you shower, use one ounce or two tablespoons to moisturize your whole body, or use as needed.You should also avoid using scented soaps BECAUSE the chemicals in it can cause skin to get dry and irritated. Use mild, unscented soaps instead.;
, Too frequent bathing can cause itching to get worse. Limit baths to once every 2 days. Bathing frequency can vary depending on climate, weather and your activities. However, once in two days should suffice. Avoid using very hot water; it tends to make the skin more irritated. Use water at room temperature or lower. Hot water dilates vessels speeding up metabolism of insulin, which can trigger hypoglycemia.Another reason why diabetics should not use hot water is diabetics suffering from nerve damage lose sensitivity to pain and temperature and may unknowingly burn themselves with hot water.

, Summer is a time of sun and fun, but sun can also seriously irritate skin. To lessen itching in the summer, wear clothes made from light materials like cotton, chiffon or linen. Certain cloths like wool and silk can cause irritation and itching.:


Make sure to keep the skin dry from sweat as too much humidity can cause itching sometimes.
Drink plenty of water to keep skin hydrated. Drink 8 glasses (8-ounce glass) of water per day. However, if you engage in rigorous activity or live in an arid climate you may need to drink more water.

, Skin easily gets dry in winter, which is why it is very important for diabetics to keep skin well moisturized and hydrated. Moisturize your skin twice a day using unscented lotion. Switching on a humidifier when the heat is on also relieves and prevents itching from getting worse.

, Itching is exacerbated by feeling stress. This means that when you are in stressful situations, your itching increases. To combat feeling stressed, practice relaxation. These include:


Practicing meditation. Meditation is letting your mind become empty and releasing stress that you hold inside you. Meditate a few minutes each morning to stay relaxed throughout the day.
Using the trigger word method. Pick a phrase that is calming to you, like “It will be okay” or “all is well”. When you start to feel stressed, take several deep breaths and repeat your trigger phrase in your head until you feel calm.

"
"
Use a cold compress to soothe skin.,
Try an oatmeal mixture for relief.,
Use a baking soda mixture to calm the itching sensation.",How to Stop Itching from Diabetes2," Applying cold packs can work wonders when you want to relieve itchy skin. Temperature sensations travel along the same path to your brain as the itching sensation. Hold the cold compress on the affected area until you feel relief.You can also take cold showers to relieve itch. However, keep in mind that diabetics are discouraged from showering too frequently, particularly if you have poor control of your glucose levels. Therefore, it’s better to stick with cold compresses for the most part.

, Mix ¼ cup water with 1 cup of colloidal oatmeal and stir it into a thick paste. Apply this mixture to the affected area. Keep the mixture on that section of your body for 15 minutes. The oatmeal will soothe the itching and provide you with temporary relief.

, You can also apply a paste made by adding a half-cup of water to one cup of baking powder. Stir with a spoon until the paste is thoroughly mixed and smooth. Apply the mixture to the affected area and keep it there for 15 minutes, then wash it off."
"
Use an over the counter (OTC) cream.,
Apply a steroidal ointment to the affected area.,
Use antifungal creams to prevent yeast infections.,
Take an antihistamine pill.,
Talk to your doctor about other options.",How to Stop Itching from Diabetes3," Creams or ointments can help to relieve the itching sensation you are feeling. Keep in mind that a penny-sized blob is enough to cover an area twice the size of your palm. When looking for an OTC to treat an itch, look for a medicine containing one the following ingredients:


Camphor, Menthol, Phenol, Diphenhydramine, and Benzocaine.

, Some itching creams are available at drug stores that contain steroids and can help relieve an itch. Hydrocortisone cream is generally the best way to go and is available over the counter in most drug stores. You can also use beclomethasone cream, which acts in the same way as hydrocortisone.


Keep in mind that you should not use a steroid-containing cream or ointment over a long period of time without talking to your doctor.

, If you are diabetic, than you know that your immune system is lowered, which allows you to get infections more easily. One type of infection is a fungal infection that can grow on your skin and cause an itchy feeling. Look for antifungal creams that include:


Miconazole, ketoconazole, or benzoic acid.

, Histamine is the hormone that causes the itching sensation that you feel. When you take an antihistamine, this hormone is suppressed, which in turns soothes your skin. Common antihistamines include:


Chlorpheniramine, diphenhydramine (Benadryl). Keep in mind that these antihistamines will make you drowsy.

, If the above measures do not provide you with relief or you suspect a serious etiology associated with your itch, you should contact your doctor. He or she will then do further work to identify the reason behind your itch.

Make a personal checklist of supplies and equipment you need to bring.,
Keep all diabetes supplies with you, not in your luggage.,
Get a letter from your child's healthcare provider.,
Request an extra prescription for your child's medications and critical supplies.,
Teach your child to say to say “I have diabetes”.,
Consider obtaining travel insurance.",How to Travel with a Diabetic Kid1," Planning a trip can be hectic and you don’t want to forget anything that will ruin your travels.


Prepare extra supplies for unexpected problems like flight delays, unplanned stopovers, and automobile breakdowns.
This includes insulin and other medications, syringes, glucose testing supplies, and snacks or other treatments you can use when your child's blood sugar gets low.;
, This is particularly important when flying since changes of pressure and temperature in the airplane baggage department can damage or freeze the insulin.


You can prepare for warm conditions in the plane and hot weather at your destination by storing insulin (and other supplies) in a specially designed cool pack.
This will keep the insulin and any food supplies at a safe temperature for up to 12 hours., Before you travel, arrange for your child's healthcare provider to write a letter which briefly describes their diabetes treatment.


This letter should include information about your child's insulin type and syringe size, any additional other medications they need, and any allergies or other important medical conditions.
This letter may come in handy when going through airport security, or if you need to seek medical assistance for your child over the course of your trip.

, An extra prescription will come in handy if you happen to lose the bag containing your child's medications, or if you end up staying at your destination for longer than intended.If possible, check to see what equivalent insulin products are available in your destination country. Remember that the strength of the insulin may be different in another country. This will require you to use a different syringe.
If you expect to be significantly more or less active during the trip, make a plan with your medical provider about how to adjust your insulin dose and schedule.

, If your child is old enough, it's a good idea to teach them how to say ""I have diabetes"" in the language of your destination country. That way, if they get lost while abroad, your child can communicate their need to someone else.


Other useful phrases to learn include “I need juice or sugar, please”, and “I need a doctor”.
If your child is too young to learn how to say the phrase, write the phrase on piece of paper and instruct your child to keep it in their pocket at all times, so they can show it to someone if necessary.
If possible, your child should also wear some form of medical alert ID and carry their provider’s emergency contact information, in case you get separated.

, Having travel insurance for your child may come in very useful in the event that hospitalization or equipment replacement is required. Receiving medical treatment in a foreign country can be expensive, so it's best to be prepared.

Understand the regulations at airport security.,
Be aware that most US domestic flights no longer offer in-flight meals.,
Request an aisle seat for your child.,
Account for any change in time zones when planning meals and medications.,
Plan day trips in advance.,
Anticipate what types of foods will be available to you throughout the day.",How to Travel with a Diabetic Kid2," TSA guidelines specifically allow you to carry your child's diabetes supplies and medications through airport security checkpoints.However, passing through security will be more efficient if medications are labeled in their own containers and placed in a clear plastic bag. Declare the items and remove them from your carry-on for screening. Screening by X-ray does not harm insulin or other medications.
To ensure that your child's diabetes is handled discretely at the Security Checkpoint, consider printing out and bringing an optional TSA Disability Notification Card., If no meal is available, be sure to bring a healthy meal for your child that he/she can eat on board.


If meals are offered on your flight, advise the airline at least 24 hours in advance of the flight to check whether a diabetic meal can be arranged.
Be sure to carry a fast-acting source of glucose, as well as snacks like nutrition bars, so you can quickly boost your child's blood sugar if it should dip during travel.

, If you expect that your child will need to go to the restroom to check his/her blood sugar during the flight, you should ask for an aisle seat. This will allow them to quickly get to the restroom without disturbing other passengers.


On long flights, check your child's blood sugar every 2 hours.

, When traveling long distances eastward, your day will shorten. On the other hand, traveling westward will lengthen your day. This can create problems with your child's normal schedule for taking insulin and other medications.


To combat this, it may be useful to keep track of medications and meals by keeping your watch on your home time zone until you have settled at your destination.
If your child uses an insulin pump, you may need to adjust the clock on their pump to the usual mealtime when your child eats, and to their usual bedtime if he or she goes to sleep. Once you arrive at your destination, you can set it to the local time.
Your medical provider can give you more detailed advice about planning insulin doses when crossing time zones.

, Each day of your trip should be thoroughly planned out so you know exactly what you are doing each day and whether there are any measures you need to take to ensure your child has access to all tourist attractions and activities.


Prepare for visits to special events, secured sites, concerts, and amusement parks. Check about policies for visitors who are diabetic. Call ahead to inquire about security that prohibits backpacks, storage cases, or food and drink and be prepared with a letter from the medical provider that documents your child's diabetes.
Inquire at amusement parks to see if “special assistance passes” are offered for diabetics and their families to allow you to avoid long lines and wait times., Before you go anywhere, think about what type of food will be available throughout the day and consider whether adjustments to your child's usual diet will be necessary.


Excitement, heat, and being off-schedule can lead to low blood sugar so be prepared with plenty of water and snacks.
Make reservations for meals if eating out to avoid long wait times.

Keeping an eye on risk factors.",How to Test for Gestational Diabetes," In this test, you have to fast for six hours beforehand – in other words, don't eat breakfast before your appointment and just fast while you're asleep. That way, you can avoid being hungry.


Don't eat anything after around midnight if your test is early the next morning. This ensures that your sample will be true to your natural blood sugar levels and no food or drink will elicit abnormal results.;
, Make sure you get a good, balanced, healthy diet for the few days before the test to make sure your blood sugar levels are looking good. In other words, avoid excessive sugar and simple carbs. That means no cookies, cakes, chocolate, candy, or sweet breads.


Drink plenty of water, too. The more water you drink, the easier it will be for the technician to draw your blood. It will lead to fewer pricks and therefore less pain.

, The testing of gestational diabetes can be done using a screening test for glucose at your first prenatal visit and if you're between 24 and 28 weeks.It's the first of the two tests you may be required to take.


The glucose screening test is not a definitive test for gestational diabetes, rather it is a tool designed to determine whether or not you, the expectant mother, have abnormal blood sugar levels requiring several tests to confirm the diagnosis of diabetes. If the result is too high, the physician will request for further diagnostic work-up – the glucose tolerance test, which we'll discuss in the next section.
Wear a short-sleeved top, like a t-shirt or blouse. This makes it easier to have blood drawn by the laboratory technician.

, This test is done to measure the processing of sugar by your body. You will be given a solution of sugar where 50 grams of glucose is mixed with water and instructed to drink the solution in five minutes.


This glucose mixture usually comes in different flavors that include lime, orange or cola; you will be given your preferred flavor.

, A blood sample will be taken from your arm and measured for blood sugar levels. That's it! Then you can go home – you'll be told when to come back in for your results.


In case you vomit after taking the solution (not unheard of), you will be encouraged to go home and come back on another day for a repeat of the test. Most people usually feel sick after taking the solution and this is because of the sugar that is contained in the solution.
Rest for an hour so that the sugar can be allowed into your bloodstream. Read a book or magazine to pass the time. Then you can go about your day as normal.

, Usually the analysis of the blood takes approximately 2-3 days. Your doctor will likely only call you if the results are normal; if they are abnormal (which doesn't necessarily mean gestational diabetes), you'll likely be called in.


When the level of sugar is between 140-200 mg/dl, you will have to take a glucose tolerance test to pinpoint the issue., To avoid being hungry, just like in the screening test, schedule your appointment for the morning. This way, you can avoid actually fasting and get the fast over with in your sleep.


When you schedule your appointment, discuss what medication you are on. This can help your doctor know how to move forward; he or she may have specific instructions you need to follow to ensure the test works. This is especially important for those on hypertensive and antiretroviral drugs.

, You may take a late dinner the day before the test is done, but you should only drink water the day of the test. This is why scheduling the test early in the morning is best.


This is a necessary step to take – if you do eat the day of the test, you will have abnormal sugar levels that could lead your doctor to the wrong conclusions. If you accidentally eat, you'll have to reschedule your appointment.

, It's a good idea to carry a snack to eat for when the procedure is finished. Some people feel a little dizzy or fatigued after giving blood and having a snack handy will get your metabolism back in no time. Try not to bring something too sugary, as you've just ingested glucose. Bring some carrots, cheese, or plain granola to munch on.


You'll want something to do, like a book to read, too – you'll be at the doctor's office for at least three hours. To fight the boredom, make sure you come prepared.

, In this test, you'll have to give a blood sample once every hour for three hours. Your blood will be taken once initially upon ""fasting,"" and then you'll receive another glucose solution to take. Then, two more blood samples will be taken to see how your blood responds over time.


Sugar is absorbed by the body very fast. The test shows how the glucose metabolism takes place in the body and how quickly it responds.
The laboratory technician should alternate the arms to reduce pain and inflammation on one arm.

, When one of the results is abnormal, you'll be advised to see your doctor later in the pregnancy for the test to be repeated. In the case where two of the readings are abnormal, the diagnosis of gestational diabetes is done. You'll be given medicines to help control your blood sugar levels.


In the case where the fasting glucose level is 95mg/dl or above the reading is considered abnormal.
When the level of sugar is above 180mg/dl after 1 hour, the reading is considered abnormal.
When the blood sugar is above 155mg/ dl after 2 hours, the reading is abnormal.
When the blood sugar is above 140mg/dl after 3 hours, the reading is abnormal.

, This is very important especially in the last stages of the pregnancy. The doctor will monitor your blood sugar levels to ensure that they are within a normal range and may adjust the medicines you're taking depending on the results. The doctor will also monitor the progress of the baby to ensure that it is growing well.


The risks that are associated with gestational diabetes include giving birth to a very big baby. These babies are at risk of injuries during delivery and they may develop diabetes later as they grow up. Because of this, it's incredibly important to go for regular checkups.
Most mothers who are diagnosed with gestational diabetes do not present with any symptoms and that is why it is important to test. The early diagnosis of gestational diabetes will help in control of blood sugar throughout the pregnancy and therefore help to prevent complications of the disease.

, Your dietician (or doctor) will compute your daily caloric requirement based on your height, weight and level of activity. The diabetic diet should have balanced proportions of protein, fats and carbohydrates to ensure that your body gets the proper amount of vitamins, minerals and calories to sustain daily routine activities and keep your baby healthy.


The recommended dietary protein requirement is around 100 to 150 grams (4 to 5 oz) a day. Otherwise, don’t take more than 20 percent of calories from protein if you have kidney problem other than gestational diabetes. Choose lean meat, skinless chicken, fish and low-fat milk and dairy products.
To get sufficient amount of carbohydrates per day, include 5 to 6 servings of fruits or vegetables every day. Legumes, brown rice, oats and barley are good sources of carbohydrates.

, To keep your blood sugar levels normal, it’s important to eat complete meals. Do not skip meals and snack between (with healthy snacks) when possible. This will help keep your blood sugar in the right place and help you maintain a healthy weight.


Avoid foods very high in sugar like candies, cookies, cakes and soft drinks. These do the opposite to your blood sugar – it will spike and be difficult for your body to handle.

, Research has shown a very positive relationship between exercise and the body’s ability to process blood sugar. It’s recommended to engage in 30-minute cardio and aerobic exercises like walking, jogging, or swimming, every day.As obesity is a risk for those with diabetes, regular exercise will help keep you fit and at an ideal weight, too.

, In cases where diet and exercise is not enough, your physician will likely prescribe anti-diabetes medications. Possible medicines are metformin and glibenclamide tablets or insulin injections. Pregnant women reaching above their blood sugar goals on oral medicine should be given insulin shots.


Metformin is given in titrated (controlled) doses. First it is given at 500 mg ½ tablet orally once a day for 7 days. Then, 500mg 1 tablet orally once a day for another 7 days, and then a 500 mg tablet orally twice a day.
The initial dose of glibenclamide is 2.5 to 5.0 mg per day then eventually adjusted to 2.5 mg once a day to 7.5 mg twice a day.

Doctors will consider medicine titration more quickly if the patient does not experience gastrointestinal issues.



, Most physicians recommend taking self-tests at home by using a glucometer to keep track of blood sugar levels. In addition, regular blood tests may be required as part of the pre-natal schedule.


Your doctor will likely request for another blood sugar test 6 to 12 weeks after delivery to ensure that blood sugar levels have returned to normal.

, There are a variety of risk factors that can increase your chance of developing gestational diabetes. These include:


Obesity or body mass index (BMI) over 30
History of gestational diabetes in previous pregnancy
Genetic factors or a family history of the condition
Sugar in urine during early pregnancy
High blood pressure
Over 35 years old

Learn about the one complication of kidney failure that is associated with diabetes mellitus.,
Study the effects of diabetic complications on the blood vessels in the body of humans.",How to Study the Medical Complications of Diabetes Mellitus in Humans," This mechanism of glucose transport into the liver cells is an extremely vital physiological process that helps in performing the important metabolic reactions of glucose oxidation that are essential for the production of ATP molecules for the cells of the body. This transport process is disabled in the case of diabetes mellitus. This is presumed to occur due to the absence of the hormone insulin in the blood of affected patients.;
, There is strong association between the deficiency of insulin in the blood and the etiology of this medical disorder. This protein hormone is known experimentally to facilitate the entry of the polar glucose molecules into the liver cells by an active transport mechanism that involves this hormone. Deficiency of this hormone for various reasons such as genetic defects in its biochemical synthesis can lead to the development of hyperglycemia or excessive glucose level in the blood. This disorder of diabetes mellitus has two known clinical variations. One is due to the deficiency of this hormone in the blood and the other is due to insensitivity of its cellular receptors to its physiological function.

, Diabetes mellitus can be triggered due to genetic causes that are inherited or it can be caused due to an autoimmune disorder in the body. In the case of an autoimmune trigger of the disease such as occurs in autoimmune disorders of the thyroid gland. It is presumed that the auto-antibodies that are secreted by the inflamed thyroid gland attack the pancreatic tissue that is responsible for the production of the hormone insulin. This in turn causes defects in its biochemical synthesis within these islet cells of the pancreas. This endocrine disorder of the pancreas is not harmful by itself. The hyperglycemic conditions that is the main manifestation of this disorder does not cause clinical symptoms by itself. The clinical problems that are associated with this endocrine disease are its progressive nature. Also due to this progressive nature of the disease medical complications can arise. These medical complications are the main clinical concern in the patients who suffer from this disorder.

, Diabetes mellitus has many medical complications that have distinct clinical manifestations. One common complication of this disorder is the development of metabolic acidosis in the affected people. This metabolic acidosis is a direct result of the defective transport mechanism of glucose into the liver cells. The inability of the body to metabolize glucose in the liver cells leads to the use of alternative sources of bio-fuels for the production of ATP molecules. An immediate and convenient source of bio-fuel for the liver cells is the use of fatty acids of the body. Fatty acids are highly energetic organic hydrocarbons that contain many C-H bonds within its chemical structure. C-H bonds contain a large amount of latent heat within its chemical bonds. The release of this stored energy is achieved by the combustion process of this compound in the liver cells using special oxidative mechanism that is typical for these fatty acids. The ATP yield of fatty acids oxidation is very high in comparison with that of glucose oxidation. The glycolytic cycle in the liver cells is responsible for the oxidation of glucose and the production of energetic ATP molecules for the body.

, The glycolytic cycle is one possible metabolic pathway of several that is used to produce ATP molecules for the body. The alternative metabolism of fatty acids in the liver gives metabolic products that contain ketonic acids. These are organic acids that contain ketone group within the same molecule. These ketonic acids can accumulate in the blood of these patients to toxic level. Also they can appear in the urine of affected individuals. One sign for the presence of ketonic acids in the urine is its characteristic smell like acetone. This type of metabolic acidosis can be corrected by removing the changing the metabolism of the body from fatty acids to glucose molecules. This is usually achieved by enhancing the ability of glucose to enter the liver cells by the administration of extra amount of the hormone insulin into the blood.

, Another possible complication of this progressive disorder is the development of kidney failure. It is postulated the hyperglycemia in these patients can induce thickening of the basement membranes of the kidney small blood vessels. This in turn can alter the physiological function of the kidney cells by increasing the permeability of these blood vessels to the chemical compounds in the blood. This in turn can lead to the failure of the kidney. Kidney failure is one common complication of diabetes mellitus at an advanced stage of its development. This thickening of the basement membranes of blood vessels is common to all blood vessels in the body. As a result complications can occur such as atherosclerosis or blood vessel blockage. Also the nervous system of affected people can be damaged by the complication of blood vessels disorder.

, The defective blood vessels in this disorder can lead to impaired supply of nutrients and oxygen to the neurons of the nervous system which can cause its damage. This medical condition is called diabetic neuropathy. For the same reason of neuropathy and angiopathy, blindness can occur in certain patients of this disease due to the damage to the neurons of the retina of the eye.

Watch for symptoms of hypoglycemia.,
Diagnose low blood sugar.,
Eat more often.,
Eat meals that are high in carbohydrates and starches.,
Inject glucagon.,
Receive dextrose.",How to Stabilize Blood Sugar1," By knowing the symptoms of hypoglycemia, you can assess yourself or others. If you or someone else has symptoms of hypoglycemia, then the best thing to do is to eat a fast acting source of glucose, like orange juice. If the symptoms resolve, then hypoglycemia was most likely the cause. Symptoms of hypoglycemia may include:Nausea.
Sweating.
Irritability.
Confusion.
Dizziness.
Anxiety.
Headache.
Hunger.;
, You can determine if you have low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) by measuring the blood sugar level just before a meal when the blood sugar level is at its lowest. Hypoglycemia is generally defined as a blood sugar level that is less than 90 milligrams of sugar per deciliter of blood (mg/dL).You’ll need a blood sugar tester. You can purchase a digital one-touch tester at any major retailer or pharmacy for as little at $15.
Wipe your fingertip with alcohol and let it dry before you use a one-touch unit. Then, use the single use lancet the make a small prick in one of your fingers. The unit will automatically assess your blood sugar level and display the number.
The finger prick shouldn’t be painful. Make sure to wash your hands with antibacterial soap when you’re done to avoid infection.Check your blood sugar again after you’ve eaten to make sure it’s returned to a normal level.

, This will allow the blood sugar less time to drop between meals. The sizes of the meals should be reduced accordingly so that the total caloric intake doesn’t change.Smaller snacks like granola bars, sliced fruit, a hardboiled eggs, or a bag of baked chips are good options for people with chronically low blood sugar.
A good rule of thumb is to consume at least 15 grams of carbohydrates. If you want to consume exactly that amount, try 4 ounces of fruit juice, 1 teaspoon of sugar or jelly, and 7-8 Life Savers., If you do not have diabetes, then strategic mealtimes may help to maintain your blood sugar levels. Carbohydrates are complex sugars that increase the blood sugar level when they’re broken down. A regular intake of carbohydrates will help maintain the blood sugar level throughout the day.Carbohydrates can be found in white breads, pasta, potatoes, beans, fruits, nuts, yogurt, and cereal.
Hypoglycemics frequently carry candy or fruit juice with them to raise their blood sugar level quickly.
If you still feel light-headed and weak after eating carbohydrate or sugary foods, you may want to contact a doctor.
Ensure that your diet is varied with complex carbs (fruits and vegetables) and lean protein to help keep healthy blood sugar levels in check.

, If your blood sugar is extremely low, this can be dangerous for your health. A blood sugar emergency would be a blood sugar level below 75 mg/dL. Healthcare professionals may inject the hormone glucagon directly into the bloodstream in an emergency to raise the blood sugar level quickly.Many diabetics can be trained to self-inject glucagon in an emergency. You will need a prescription from your doctor.
Be aware that glucagon is not meant for healthy people. It is a drastic measure to control blood sugar that has dipped to a dangerous level.

, If your blood sugar is causing a seizure or diabetic shock, you will need someone else to administer dextrose. Emergency dextrose is administered with an intravenous drip. This should only be done by a medical professional."

Diagnose high blood sugar.,
Eat more fiber.,
Cut down your sugar intake.,
Reduce portion sizes.,
Exercise regularly.,
Don’t over extend yourself.,
Inject insulin.",How to Stabilize Blood Sugar2," To determine if you have high blood sugar, your doctor may order a fasting plasma glucose test, a test two hours after giving you 75 grams of oral glucose, or by checking your hemoglobin A1c. All of these tests can be performed in medical setting to establish if a person has diabetes. Hyperglycemia is generally defined as a blood sugar level that is greater than 180 mg/dL.You can purchase a digital one-touch tester at any major retailer or pharmacy for as little at $15. Make sure that you use sterile lancets (purchased in a pharmacy) for the device. You will also need single use alcohol pads to use prior to pricking yourself. Use a pad to wipe your fingertip and then let it dry before pricking yourself with the sterile lancet.
You should also check your blood sugar in the morning before you eat. This will give you a sense of how your body is processing sugar.

, A diet with at least 50 grams of fiber can help lower blood sugar levels. It will also boost your metabolism and cultivate probiotics in your stomach and intestines.You can get fiber from a wide variety of foods. Try whole-wheat pasta, bran, oats, citric fruits, berries, beans, nuts, or roughage vegetables like artichokes, spinach, or broccoli.
If consistent blood sugar elevations are suspected, see a healthcare provider. Uncontrolled diabetes can cause long term damage to target organs including the eyes, heart, kidneys, and peripheral vascular system.

, A reduction in dietary sugar has a direct effect on the blood sugar level. A physician may recommend that a severely hyperglycemic or diabetic patient eliminate sugar from his or her diet.Avoid candy, soda, baked treats, and added sugar.
Avoid foods with white carbohydrates which turn into sugar after they’re metabolized. This includes white breads, pasta, potatoes, and cereal.

, Most foods, especially processed foods, will have some amount of sugar in them. Unless you’re severely hyperglycemic, this should be fine in moderation but can be problematic if you take in a lot of sugar at once. Smaller meals can also help to keep the blood sugar in check.Always be sure to check the sugar content of any processed food you eat.

, Prolonged activities, such as biking or running, can effectively lower the blood sugar level as the sugar is consumed for fuel. Cardio exercises and weight training are highly effective at burning sugar.If you don’t have time for a full exercise at the gym, try going for a walk or even just standing up when you would normally sit.

, Refrain from aerobic exercise if your blood sugar level is above 240 mg/dl and your urine also contains ketones. This combination of conditions can cause the ketone levels in the blood to rise to dangerous levels during exercise.If your urine is excessively dark in color, this is potentially a sign of high ketone levels and you should go to see a doctor right away.

, If you are diagnosed with diabetes, then your healthcare provider should create a plan to help you keep your diabetes under control. This plan may include regular blood sugar tests, insulin injections, and lifestyle changes like diet and exercise. Diabetics with severe hyperglycemia may need an injection of insulin to quickly lower the blood sugar level in an emergency. You will need a prescription from your doctor.Always swab the injection site with rubbing alcohol first. Be sure to ask your doctor about proper injection procedures if you don’t know where or how to inject.

Consume a recommended number of calories per day.,
Track your carbohydrate intake.,
Eat moderate portions of starch.,
Eat moderate amounts of fruit.,
Balance your eating throughout the day.",How to Safely Gain Weight with Gestational Diabetes1," When pregnant, women who were of a normal pre-pregnancy weight should consume 30 Calories/kilogram/day, based on their current pregnant weight. Women who were obese prior to becoming pregnant can reduce this number by up to 33%. These women should consume about 25 Calories/kilogram/day based on their current pregnant weight.Remember – these are simply guidelines. A detailed discussion with your healthcare provider is important to arrive at a caloric recommendation that is right for you.


Purchase a food scale to measure your food. This will help you to know what one serving is. By reading food labels, you can estimate the calories and macronutrient content contained in each portion of food.
Monitor your caloric intake by keeping a food diary. A food diary can be kept by hand in a small notebook. Write down what you eat then look up the calories either on the internet or in a calorie reference guide. There are also smartphone apps available that make calorie tracking easy, such as www.myfitnesspal.com.
Combine the food diary with weighing yourself on a regular basis to determine if you are gaining or losing weight.
If you are not gaining enough weight, try increasing your daily calories by 200-500 calories per day. Continue to track your weight to see if this gets you back on the right track.;
, Carbohydrates are one of three macronutrients we must consume. The other two are protein and fat. There are three main kinds of carbohydrates – sugars, starches, and fiber. Sugars are the simplest type of carbohydrate. Sugars include fructose, glucose, and sucrose, and some other molecules. Starches are also known as complex carbohydrates, and are made up of many sugars linked together in a chain. Fiber is a type of carbohydrate that humans cannot break down. When a person eats sugars or starches, they eventually are broken down and turned into glucose. Sugars (glucose is a sugar) are converted to glucose more quickly than complex carbohydrates. Fiber is not converted to glucose, as it is indigestible.


There is no magic carbohydrate number that can be used for all pregnant women. Instead, consider discussing this matter with your healthcare provider. Track your carbohydrates along with your blood glucose. If your blood glucose is consistently high, reducing your intake of sugars and complex carbohydrates and increasing your fiber intake may help.
It is not necessary to limit fiber. Recommendations are to consume 20–30 grams (0.71–1.1 oz) of fiber per day.Monitor your carbohydrate intake by keeping a food diary. Smartphone apps can make tracking carbohydrates and sugars in particular an easy task.
Reduce the amount of sugar you consume.

, Even though you’ll likely be eating low-glycemic index starches, such as barley, oatmeal, and quinoa, you should still eat them in moderation. Starch is processed into glucose within our cells. A good rule of thumb is to consume about one cup of total starch per meal., Even though you will likely choose low-glycemic index fruits, you should only consume 1-3 servings of fruit per day. Consume just one serving of fruit at a time.Avoid high-glycemic index fruits like watermelon.
Avoid fruits canned in sugary syrup.
Avoid fruit juices with added sugar.
Pair fruit with other foods such as containing fats, such as nuts, peanut butter, or cheese to reduce the impact fruit has on blood sugar.

, Eating too much at once can spike blood sugar. It is best to eat 3 meals and 2-3 snacks throughout the day.Carry along quick snacks like nuts or cut vegetables for snacking on the go.
Eat a variety of high-nutrient foods that contain healthy fat and protein, such as avocados, coconut oil, lean meats, nuts, and seeds.

Start by thinking about what you need in a glucose meter – prioritize easy of use, price, memory capabilities, and whether there are extra functions.Look at some of the different products that are available and compare them to find the best one for you.Some special functions that machines may have include checking for ketones (for Type 1 diabetics), using alternate languages, “flagging” capabilities, and being able to upload data to a computer.
The doctor or specialist who takes care of your diabetes probably has a lot of experience in helping patients choose the right blood sugar monitor. Ask something like, “Do you have a brand of glucose meter that you recommend?”
Read user reviews and check ratings. Some meters are more reliable than others in terms of readings, integrity of data archived, and especially accuracy.Take the time to check into consumer ratings and comments, so you are sure to get a quality machine.;
, It’s easy to obtain a glucose meter kit – you can get one at your local pharmacy or on the internet. Most kits contain lancets (testing needles), a lancing device, testing strips, and a meter to read the results. Buy from recognizable sites like Amazon or directly from the company’s website, and only buy new products.


Before buying your glucometer, check what test strips will be easily accessible to you. Glucometers use specific test strips, and some are much more expensive or harder to get than others, so choose a machine for which the strips will be easy to get., Before you buy your glucose meter, check with your insurance to make sure they will cover the brand of machine and test strips you need.Your doctor can probably give you a prescription for your glucometer, which will help keep costs down. Try to purchase test strips, which can be expensive, at online retail websites. You can also try to save money by using a pharmaceutical assistance program.


When getting test strips online, check the expiration date on the strips and determine if you can reasonably use all those strips before that date.

, Carefully read and study the pamphlet that came with your meter. Different meters can vary in how they operate. Some now have advanced functions such as pattern recognition. Carefully read through the instructions and make sure you understand exactly how to use the device. If you have any questions, contact your doctor before using the machine.


It may be a good idea to bring your glucometer to your next doctor's appointment and ask them to show you how to use it.

, Most glucometers come with a means to test their accuracy. The kit may include a pre-treated test strip or a liquid for you to place on an unused test strip. You will then insert this strip into the machine and check the reading against the limits provided in the instruction manual.

, Do you need your reading to be a fasting blood sugar? If so, do not eat for 8 hours before you check your sugar. It’s best to take your reading first thing in the morning, and simply not eat after your dinner the night before. However, for those with Type 1 diabetes, fasting for more than 8 hours may cause hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), so it might be necessary to have a snack before bed. You might want to check your blood sugar immediately after a meal, or two-hours after you eat (a postprandial reading).Discuss your goals with your doctor. They should be able to explain what you want to accomplish with your blood sugar readings, like, “Some people need to check their sugar before and after each meal, but you can just check right before you eat.”

, Your glucose meter may automatically turn on, but glucometers can differ in when you insert the test strip.You may need to insert the test strip before you lance your finger or you may need to put blood on the strip and then insert it into the machine.


Be sure to insert the correct end of the strip into the machine.

, Pull off the top of the lancing device and put the lancet into the device. Push the lancet into the device until you hear a click, or can feel that it is pushed down all the way into place.


Most lancets will have a small cap over them, hiding the needle. Be sure to remove this before placing the lancing device cap back on. To remove it, simply twist it counter clockwise or clockwise and pull it off.
Place the cap back on while rotating the cap on the end of the lancing device.

, The glucometer will have a readout area that will alert you when it is ready. It may say ""Place sample on strip"" or it may use an icon, such as a drop of liquid, to show that you can insert your sample.


Many machines are automatically coded, especially newer models. Others require you to look at the screen to check that the number displayed is the same as the code on the packet of strips. Read your instructions carefully to know if you have to check this.

Consider if you’re unusually hungry or thirsty.,
Notice when you’re tired.,
Keep track of how much you urinate.,
Look for other effects of changing fluid levels.,
Keep track of slow-healing sores or cuts.,
Be aware of pain or numbness in your feet or legs.,
Note any yeast infections.",How to Spot the Symptoms of Diabetes1," Early warning signs of diabetes are being hungry or thirsty even though you’re eating and drinking plenty of food and liquids. In both types of diabetes, your body doesn’t get enough energy through glucose, or blood sugar. As a result, it makes you feel like you need to eat or drink more., You experience fatigue for the same reasons you feel hungry and thirsty when you’re diabetic: your body doesn’t process the sugar in your bloodstream. Since you’re not getting enough energy from the food and beverages you consume, you feel tired. Take note if you complain of fatigue even though you’re getting plenty of sleep and rest., When your body is operating normally, it reabsorbs glucose through your kidneys. If you’re diabetic, your blood sugar (the amount of glucose in your system) is elevated: you have too much unprocessed and unusable glucose. As a result, your system will try to flush itself by producing more urine. Since your body is flushing itself, it diminishes your fluids and makes you thirstier.Bedwetting in children who don’t normally wet the bed is a sign of type 1 diabetes, which used to be called juvenile diabetes., With your fluid levels constantly changing, effects are visible in various systems. Look for signs in your body’s systems that change as your fluid levels fluctuate:Your mouth will often be dry as your body flushes itself
Your skin might frequently be dry and itchy.
The lenses in your eyes might swell up or change shape. As a result, you might have blurry vision or an inability to focus.

, Diabetes can be a ""silent killer"" disease, since many people do not notice they have it until signs of long-term damage appear.One of these signs is a lessened ability to heal, since high blood sugar makes it more difficult for your blood to flow. Note any skin abrasions that take a long time to heal. You should be concerned if you’ve had a cut for more than a week to 10 days, especially on extremities like toes or feet., If you've had diabetes for some time (though you may not have realized it), nerve damage can lead to pain or numbness in the extremities. In diabetics, lack of blood flow damages the nervous system the same way it prevents cuts and sores from healing properly. In both cases, high blood sugar is preventing blood from moving around your body.

, Men and women can both be affected by yeast infections, and diabetics are particularly susceptible. The reason is because yeast feeds on glucose, and since diabetics have plenty of unused glucose, yeast thrives. Check for infections in any moist folds of skin, such as:In and around the groin and genitals.
Between fingers and toes.
Under breasts.
Type 2 diabetes usually goes unnoticed, so enough time passes that your body becomes saturated with glucose, allowing for secondary indicators like yeast infections.

Exercise moderately.,
Move more every day.,
Avoid activities that are potentially hazardous to pregnant women.",How to Safely Gain Weight with Gestational Diabetes2," Exercising not only reduces the amount of glucose in the bloodstream, but also changes your cells’ response to insulin. Cells become more sensitive to insulin, which means your body doesn’t have to make as much insulin to help cells take up glucose. When cells take up glucose from your blood, this lowers your blood glucose. Experts recommend 30 minutes of moderate exercise each day for pregnant women.Check with your healthcare provider about what kinds of exercise are appropriate for you.
If you haven’t exercised regularly in a long time, start slow. Start with 10 minutes of exercise a few days a week, then build up to the recommended 30 minutes per day.
Go for a swim. Swimming is a great exercise for pregnant women. Moving in water reduces stress on the joints and back.

, Exercise doesn't necessarily need to take place at the gym or the track. Simple things like parking farther away from the storefront, taking the stairs, or walking the dog more frequently can add to your fitness.

, Though many forms of exercise are just fine for pregnant women, you’ll want to avoid certain activities. Those exercises such as situps, crunches, and leg lifts force you to lie flat on your back. Avoid these types of exercises after the first trimester.You will also want to avoid or modify contact sports that could harm you and the baby, such as some martial arts, football, soccer, and basketball. Sports that pose a high risk of falling should also be avoided."

Monitor blood glucose (sugar) as recommended by your healthcare provider.,
Know the benefits of insulin therapy.,
Know when you should have insulin therapy.",How to Safely Gain Weight with Gestational Diabetes3," Daily blood sugar testing with a glucometer is advised to avoid episodes of hypoglycemia or low blood sugar. This will also help assess your ideal insulin requirement. Learning to use a glucometer is important. Select a brand that has easily obtainable glucose strips. In the beginning you may have to check your blood sugar levels three to four times a day or even at nighttime.

, Managing your insulin levels improves carbohydrate metabolism and reduces blood sugar levels. Insulin therapy is individualized according to weight, lifestyle, age, family support, and occupation. Follow your healthcare provider’s instructions when administering insulin injections.

, If medications are required, some physicians recommend starting with oral blood sugar control medications such as metformin or glyburide.If oral agents fail, the traditional treatment involves an intermediate insulin such as NPH in the morning and bedtime, and a short acting insulin with some or all meals. The dosing depends on weight, trimester of pregnancy, and how elevated the blood sugars are."

Know how much weight you should gain.,
Know what your blood glucose goals are.,
Talk to your doctor when you are planning to get pregnant.,
Know the symptoms of high blood sugar.,
Know the symptoms of low blood sugar.",How to Safely Gain Weight with Gestational Diabetes4," The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development provides overall and weekly weight gain guidelines for pregnant women that are based on height, pre-pregnancy weight, and the number of children you are carrying .


In general, if you are underweight, you can safely gain between 35-40 pounds
If you are of normal weight, you can safely gain between 30-35 pounds
If you are overweight, you can safely gain between 22-27 pounds
If you are obese, you can safely gain between 15-20 pounds
Women who are carrying more than 1 baby can safely gain 35-45 pounds

, The American Diabetes Association recommends the following guidelines for blood glucose levels in women with GDM.Keep in mind that every woman is different, and you should work with your healthcare provider to set goals appropriate for you.


Before a meal, blood glucose should be 95 milligrams/deciliter (mg/dL) or less
One hour after a meal, blood glucose should be 140 mg/dL or less
Two hours after a meal, blood glucose should be 120 mg/dL or less

, Women who are planning to get pregnant should have a wellness exam that includes discussion of risk of gestational diabetes. Preventive measures to reduce the risk of getting GDM include eating healthy, staying active, and maintaining a healthy weight prior to pregnancy.Your healthcare provider can help you devise a plan to be as healthy as possible when you become pregnant.

, Though GDM does not cause symptoms in most women, high blood sugar can cause symptoms. If your blood glucose is 130 mg/dL or higher, you may experience the following: Increased thirst
Headaches
Blurred vision
Fatigue
Frequent urination
If you experience these symptoms or your blood glucose tests high, contact your healthcare provider.

, If you are a gestational diabetic on insulin and you experience these symptoms, check your blood sugar. If your blood sugar is low, eat a piece of hard candy or have some fruit juice. Check your blood sugar again after 15 minutes.Sweating
Feeling weak
Dizziness

Clean your hands and sampling area.,
Prick the side of your finger.Push the button on the top of the lancing device and then position it over the side of your fingertip, up by the edge of your fingernail.,
Apply the blood to the end of the test strip.,
Wait for your results.,
Read the results.",How to Test Your Blood Sugar2," Wash your hands with warm soap and water. Rinse thoroughly to remove any soap residue and turn off the tap with your arm or elbow. Dry them thoroughly with a paper towel. Never use hand wipes or hand sanitizer as these can affect the result. Clean the finger you’re going to prick with an alcohol swab, or with rubbing alcohol on a cotton ball.Alcohol evaporates rapidly so there's no need to dry the area; that will just recontaminate it. Let the alcohol air dry.

, Make sure the cap is on the lancing device. Press the button on the side of the lancing device to prick your finger. This process should not be very painful — you might not even feel it. If the blood doesn't come out on its own, try squeezing or massaging the finger on either side until you squeeze out a drop. Let the blood form a small bead on your finger.


Always switch fingers during the day and switch hands every day to prevent scar tissue buildup on your fingertips.
If you find it hard to get a drop of blood from your finger, let your hand dangle at your side for several minutes before you prick your finger to increase blood flow.

, Hold the bead of blood to touch the tip of the strip at the right place, which should be indicated on the strip.Some newer strips offer a ""wicking"" action that will draw the blood up into the test strip. Other meters and strips will require you to drop your blood onto the strip. The screen will indicate when there is enough blood on the strip to run the test.

, The glucometer will start to count down in seconds until your results are ready to read. Newer glucometers usually take five seconds, and older versions can take 10 to 30 seconds.The meter may beep or indicate on the screen when it has a reading ready.

, The results will appear on the screen. Your results will vary depending on what time of day it is, how recently you ate, and what you ate.Your results are specific to you — a good reading for one person may not be a good reading for someone else. Make sure you and your doctor have discussed what is a healthy reading for you.

"
"
Dispose of your lancet and test strip carefully.,
Record your blood glucose result in your glucose diary.,
Bring your record to your doctor visits.",How to Test Your Blood Sugar3," Lancing needles should be disposed of in a sharps container, and test strips should be thrown away in a biohazard container. Using a new lancet each time reduces the pain involved in pricking your finger.


Always use a new lancet for every test. Never reuse them.

, Keeping a diary can help you to spot patterns, and discuss your results with your healthcare team.Make sure you note the day, time and whether your reading was fasting, post-prandial (2 hours after eating), or otherwise how recently you ate.


Some glucometers store the readings for you in their on-board memory, but it may still be helpful to write your records down. Go the extra step of recording what you ate that day, and what dosage of medication you take, if applicable.

, Your glucometer may store your results so that your doctor can see the results of all your previous tests. If it does not have this function, make sure you bring a log of all your readings. Bring your glucometer as well so your doctor can make sure it's calibrated and working correctly."
"
Know whether your test is “fasting” or not.,
Expect to have a blood sample taken.,
Discuss the results with your doctor.",How to Test Your Blood Sugar4," A “fasting” blood test means one that is done after 8 hours or more of not eating.If you are getting your blood sugar tested at your doctor’s office, find out whether you need to fast the night before or not.


If you are supposed to fast for your test, do not eat the night before or the morning of your appointment. Drinking water is okay. Most fasting tests are scheduled for first thing in the morning so you don’t have to go hungry all day long.

, If you get your blood sugar tested at your doctor’s office, they will take a blood sample from a vein.Your healthcare provider will clean the area with alcohol, usually the inside of your elbow, and tie a tight band called a tourniquet around the top of your arm. They will use a syringe (medical needle) to take a blood sample, which may feel moderately uncomfortable like a bee sting. Once the sample is taken, the tourniquet will be removed, and a band aid will be put on the area.


You might feel some mild throbbing afterwards, or get a small bruise.Usually the procedure is not very painful, and it’s over in about a minute.
If you tend to feel nervous or get lightheaded around needles, bring a small snack with you for after the sample is taken. If you get nauseated or pass out after having blood taken, it’s just your body’s response to feeling scared. A small sugary snack can help you feel better.

, You will either receive a call or have a follow-up appointment to discuss the results of your tests. Ask the doctor or nurse any questions you may have, such as ""What do these results mean?""; or ""Is this a good result?""; or ""Is my fasting blood sugar at a healthy level?""; or ""What should I do next?"".


Normal results for a fasting glucose test is under 100 mg/dL. Before meals, your blood sugar should be in the range of 70 to 99 mg/dL.Results of non-fasting tests will vary depending on when you last ate, and what you ate. “Postprandial” readings are taken two hours after you last ate, and should be under 140 mg/dl."

Note any sudden onset of any symptoms.,
Notice any acute weight loss.,
Be aware of life-threatening symptoms.",How to Spot the Symptoms of Diabetes2," In type 1, the body's immune system destroys the cells that produce insulin. This usually causes rapid and severe symptoms, appearing within days or weeks.Type 1 is rarer than type 2, and only accounts for 10% of all diabetes cases.Type 1 diabetes usually occurs in children or teens, but can occur in adults as well. The cause is unknown, but it is more likely to occur after a viral infection (such as the flu or mumps), or in people with a family history of autoimmune diseases.In contrast, type 2 diabetes progresses much more slowly, sometimes over the course of years.

, Severe and sudden weight loss are symptoms more often associated with type 1 diabetes. Without insulin, your body cannot process the glucose in your bloodstream for energy. When the glucose reaches high levels (hyperglycemia), your body can start to break down fat and muscle tissue for energy instead. The result is rapid weight loss, accompanied by extreme fatigue. This condition is known as diabetic ketoacidosis., When type 1 diabetes isn't treated quickly, it can be acute and deadly. Contact a doctor if you experience signs of hyperglycemia (high blood glucose), especially if you show other symptoms of possible diabetes or have a family history of diabetes:Early signs of hyperglycemia (schedule a doctor's visit soon): increased urination, thirst, blurred vision, fatigue, or headache
Later signs (seek immediate attention): trouble breathing, vomiting, weakness, confusion, abdominal pain, fruity-smelling breath.
Once you are diagnosed and receiving treatment, your doctor can explain how to treat hyperglycemia with insulin, and how to avoid severe hypoglycemia (low blood sugar caused by overcorrecting).

Seek urgent medical attention if you suspect type 1 diabetes.,
See a doctor immediately if you show signs of ketoacidosis.,
Make an appointment with your doctor for an accurate diagnosis.,
Get screened for diabetes.,
Prevent diabetes.,
Be aware of gestational diabetes if you're pregnant or plan to become pregnant.",How to Spot the Symptoms of Diabetes3," You should seek immediate medical attention if you experience any symptoms that are severe and arise suddenly. Get evaluated immediately if you or your child suddenly experiences extreme thirst or dehydration, nausea and vomiting, extreme weakness, and unconsciousness.Remember that the severe and acute symptoms associated with type 1 diabetes can be related to any number of significant medical issues, like the flu. Thus, getting a correct diagnosis from a medical professional is essential.Although type 1 is more likely to cause immediate danger, both types of diabetes can lead to toxicity and result in nerve damage, amputation, respiratory damage, and have long lasting effects on the muscular system and vision.Early diagnosis and treatment or important for both types.

, If you suddenly show diabetic symptoms like extreme thirst, weight loss, fatigue, blurry vision, or frequently passing urine, you might be suffering from diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). DKA is when your body breaks down fat and muscle tissue for energy, and produces ketones, which are poisonous chemicals, as a byproduct. Type 1 diabetics are often undiagnosed until they require hospitalization for DKA.DKA is a life-threatening and severe condition that requires immediate medical attention.
Other people will often be able to smell a distinct pear-like scent on the breath of those suffering from DKA. They’re actually smelling ketones saturating your body.

, The only way to ensure a proper diagnosis is to see your primary care physician or a general practitioner at a clinic. These medical professionals are authorized to order a series of tests that will verify whether or not you are diabetic. They will also determine the status of the disease and extent of damage to your body, and help the doctor to determine the appropriate treatment plan for you. To make the most of your visit, ask questions such as:What treatments are available, and what’s best for me (or my child)?
Do I need a referral to an endocrinologist, dietitian, or other specialist?
What are my specific dietary, nutritional, and exercise needs?
How to I monitor the presence of ketones in my bloodstream?
How often should I visit the doctor and other care specialists?

, Type 1 diabetes is typically diagnosed in childhood, and usually is associated with serious disease, infection, or damage to the pancreas. On the other hand, testing for type 2 diabetes should be routine for people over the age of 45. If you have other health or lifestyle factors that put you at greater risk for type 2 diabetes, you should be tested annually as well. These risks include:Obesity or being overweight
Family history of diabetes
Sedentary lifestyle (exercising less than 3 time a week)
High blood pressure, or a mark of over 140/90
Low HDL levels (“good” cholesterol) and high levels of triglycerides
Smoking

, You can prevent or delay the onset of diabetes with a number of lifestyle choices. It’s especially important to take on these life changes if you can check off any of the risk factors, or if you’ve screen positive for prediabetes in the past. Proactive life changes include:Exercising 30 or more minutes most days
Managing your blood pressure
Eating a well-balanced diet
Keeping your weight within or near your recommended range

, Like types 1 and 2 diabetes, gestational diabetes affects how the body processes glucose. However, it only occurs in pregnant women. It causes high blood sugar that can threaten your pregnancy and your baby’s health.Gestational diabetes doesn’t cause noticeable signs or symptoms, so it’s difficult to diagnose on your own.If you're trying to become pregnant, consult your doctor for blood screenings to determine your risk of developing gestational diabetes.
Once you become pregnant, monitoring its signs and symptoms, like your blood sugar levels, becomes a routine part of prenatal care.
It’s not clear why some women develop gestational diabetes, but risk factors more commonly associated with the condition include: being over age 25 at time of pregnancy, family or personal history of type 2 diabetes, and being significantly overweight."
"
Eat three small meals a day with snacks in between.,
Do not skip a meal.,
Try to stick to the same meal schedule each day.,
Check your blood sugar levels before and after you eat.,
Do not eat for at least two hours before you go to bed.,
Avoid eating sugary foods on their own.,
Eat balanced meals that will keep your sugar level in a healthy range.",How to Reverse Type 2 Diabetes," When you break your food consumption up into small portions throughout the day, it becomes easier to control your blood sugar levels.


Eating a large meal can slow down your metabolism. Your metabolism helps to break down what you have eaten; when your metabolism is slow, your body takes longer to digest sugars and fats, which can increase your blood sugar levels. Eating throughout the day will keep your metabolism running smoothly.;
, If you skip a meal, you run the risk of having your blood sugar levels dropping to very low levels (which is referred to as hypoglycemia). In particular, it is very important that you always eat breakfast to keep your blood sugar levels regular and to get your metabolism going in the morning.


This is very important if you taking medications that lower your blood sugar levels, as most people with diabetes do. In order to keep your body functioning properly, you must eat meals throughout the day while also taking your medications.

, To help your body regulate blood sugar and keep your metabolism working swiftly, you should try to stick to a meal plan where you eat your meals and snacks at roughly the same time each day.


Similarly, you should also try to take the medications you are taking to control your diabetes at around the same time each day. Most diabetes medication is supposed to be taken with meals, so when you eat at the same time each day, you can also take your medication.

, In order to check how your body is reacting to specific foods that you eat, doctors generally recommend that you check your blood sugar levels before and after you eat. Normal blood sugar levels fall between 4.6 and 6.1 mmol.


If you notice that a certain food has caused your blood sugar levels to go above the normal range, you may want to consider limiting how much you eat that specific food.

, When you lie down in bed at night, your body’s ability to process the food you have eaten also slows down. When you eat right before you go to bed, fat can accumulate in your body instead of getting burned off by your metabolism. Wait two hours after eating before you lie down for the night.


You can also get heartburn when you lie down right after a meal.

, Just because you have diabetes does not necessarily mean that you need to cut sweets out of your diet entirely. You should, however, only eat sweets with other food. When you eat sweets by themselves, they can cause your blood sugar levels to spike.


When you eat sweets with healthy foods, your blood sugar levels will rise gradually.

, It is important to get all of the nutrients you need and the best way to do this is to eat balanced meals that contain things like:


Good unsaturated fats
Lean protein
Carbohydrates
Fiber
Nonfat products
Less sugar

"
"
Eat every 3 to 5 hours.,
Include a nutritious, high fiber carbohydrate at each meal.,
Include healthy fats and protein at each meal.,
Limit alcohol.,
Plan ahead.",How to Stabilize Your Blood Sugar Naturally1," If you're trying to better stabilize and control your blood sugar, it's important to consider the consistency and timing of your meals. If you're skipping meals or waiting too long in between meals, you can experience fluctuations in your blood sugar.


When you eat foods your body digests them and then absorbs the nutrients. Through this process, your body's blood sugar will rise. When you skip a meal, your body won't get the needed nutrients and your blood sugar will dip to the low end.Always eat three meals daily. In addition, plan to have a snack if you know there will be more than five hours between meals. This will help to keep you satisfied until your next meal.Also be consistent with portion sizes. If you ate a really big meal and feel like you should ""hold back"" at your next meal, you really can't (especially if you're taking medications for diabetes). If you don't eat enough - regardless of what you ate earlier - you can still experience a low blood sugar.;
, Carbohydrates are the nutrient that makes blood sugar rise. Including a nutritious and healthy carbohydrate source at your meals can help you manage your blood sugar throughout the day.


Carbohydrates are found in a wide variety of foods including: grains, fruits, starchy vegetables and dairy foods.
In addition, carbohydrates are found in sweet treats and sweetened beverages in the form of refined sugar. However, it's better to get most of your carbohydrates from foods like whole grains or fruits as these contain fiber, vitamins and minerals in addition to not spiking your blood sugar very high.Include a serving of high fiber carbohydrates at each meal. This will cause your blood sugar to rise slowly, instead of spiking, and can keep it stable longer.Choose: 1/2 cup of fruit, 1 cup of starchy vegetables, 1/2 cup or 1 oz of 100% whole grains or 1 cup of low-fat dairy.Skipping these carbs at a meal doesn't provide your body with the necessary carbohydrates to keep your blood sugar stable. You're at risk for hitting a low blood sugar if you skip all of these foods.

, In addition to making sure that you include a nutritious carbohydrate at each meal, it's also wise to include some healthy fats and protein. Both of these nutrients also help stabilize your blood sugar.


Healthy sources of fat when combined with a nutritious carbohydrate help slow the rise of the carbohydrate in your blood stream. This decreases the risk of spiking your blood sugar really high.Include a serving of healthy fats at each meal. Try: 1 oz of nuts, 1 tablespoon of olive oil, 1/2 cup of avocado, 3-4 oz of fatty fish like salmon or 1 tablespoon of seeds.
Like healthy fats, protein also has a similar effect on your blood sugar - helping to slow the release of carbohydrates into your blood stream. Stick to 3-4 oz of lean protein sources like: poultry, eggs, lean beef, seafood, tofu or pork.

, If you have diabetes or have difficulty stabilizing blood sugars, it may be wise to limit or give up alcohol. Drinks like wine, beer or liquor can make keeping blood sugars stable more difficult.


Alcohol interferes with 3 of your body's processes involved in maintaining and regulating healthy blood sugar numbers.In addition, excessive consumption overtime can reduce your insulin's effectiveness.It's especially important to never drink on an empty stomach. It can cause a very delayed low blood sugar - even up to 24 hours later.
Also, be careful if drinking larger amounts of alcohol (which is never recommended). Many symptoms of alcohol intoxication are identical to extremely low blood sugars. This can make it difficult for others to assist you if you were to pass out.If you are planning to have a drink, women should drink no more than 1 cocktail and men shouldn't drink more than 2., When you're working on stabilizing your blood sugars, it's important to make sure to know your body and plan ahead. Many low blood sugars or overly high blood sugars happen when you're not prepared.


Think about your typical day and how often you need to eat. Make sure you pack enough meals and snacks to keep your blood sugar stable throughout the day.
In addition, always have an emergency snack on hand. You never know when you might be delayed in eating a meal. Skipping is not advisable as your blood sugar can drop dangerously low.
Keep a healthy snack like a granola bar, a pack of peanut butter crackers or a bag of whole wheat pita chips on hand in case you need something in between meals.

Talk to your doctor before adding fenugreek to your diet.,
Consider the dose range for fenugreek.,
Choose a high-quality fenugreek supplement.,
Add fenugreek to food.,
Drink fenugreek with hot water.",How to Use Fenugreek for Diabetes1," Fenugreek interacts with a variety of medications prescribed for diabetes as well as some blood thinners.For this reason, it is essential that you check with your doctor before adding fenugreek to your regimen. It may interfere with the medications that you are taking to help treat diabetes as well as other conditions.


Always check with your doctor first before discontinuing or adding any medication or supplement.;
, The recommended dosage for fenugreek is between 2.5–15 grams (0.09–0.5 oz) daily, so it is important to talk to your doctor about your intentions and ask for a recommendation based on your weight and other factors. You may also want to consult an experienced herbalist or naturopath.The most common dose used in studies was 12.5 grams (0.4 oz) of powdered fenugreek taken twice daily. However, some studies have shown benefit from taking only 2.5 grams (0.09 oz) twice daily., Some people do not like the taste of fenugreek seeds, so capsules are often recommended.If you choose to take fenugreek in supplement form, make sure that the product you choose is of high quality. The packaging should provide: Realistic information about the effects of taking the supplement
Information such as dosage recommendations, side effects, and ingredients
A label that is easy to read and understand
Company information such as a phone number, mailing address, or website.

, Some people do like the taste of fenugreek and may opt to add the seeds to food. You can seek out recipes that include fenugreek or simply sprinkle the seeds on your food as a garnish. Keep in mind that you should still follow your doctor’s recommendations for healthy eating. When adding fenugreek to food, 15 grams (0.53 oz) was a common dosage in some studies., Making a fenugreek tea seems to produce the best results according to some studies. One study showed no significant results for patients who took fenugreek with yogurt, while those who took fenugreek with hot water experienced significant improvement. Participants in this study consumed a total of 10 grams (0.35 oz) of fenugreek per day.Crush or pulverize 2.5 grams (0.09 oz) of fenugreek seeds using a mortar and pestle or food processor. Then, add the seeds to a mug and pour eight ounces of boiling water over them. Stir well with a spoon. Then wait for the mixture to cool to drinking temperature and enjoy.

Talk to your doctor.,
Measure and track blood sugar regularly.,
Exercise within moderation.,
Maintain a healthy weight.,
Manage stress.",How to Stabilize Your Blood Sugar Naturally2," If you're having difficulty stabilizing your blood sugars or are making changes to your diet or lifestyle to help improve your blood sugars, it's always important to talk to your doctor first.


If you're having difficulty keeping blood sugars stable, you should contact your doctor immediately. They may need to change medications to help you control your blood sugar.
If you're interested in better managing your diabetes or blood sugar, talk to your doctor. Ask them if there is anything specific he or she thinks you should do.
Also talk to him or her about your ideas regarding diet and lifestyle and if these changes will be safe and appropriate for you.

, Another crucial part to being able to stabilize your blood sugars more effectively is by measuring and tracking your blood sugars regularly.Even if you don't have diabetes, but still have difficulty stabilizing your blood sugar, make sure to test yourself regularly. Follow your doctor's advice regarding how often and when to test your sugar.
It's also a good idea to start a blood sugar journal or log. Write down the dates, times and your blood sugar readings. This will allow you to see any trends.
If you notice that you're having highs or lows at specific times of the day or types of meals, you can start to work on making alternate choices to better stabilize your sugar.

, Regular and consistent exercise is important to overall health. In addition, regular exercise can also help you manage your blood sugar.


Studies have shown that regular exercise during the week - including both aerobic and strength training - helped stabilize and manage blood sugars in those with diabetes.Include at least 150 minutes of aerobic activity each week in addition to 1-2 days of strength training.Try yoga. Studies have shown that yoga in particular can help manage diabetes and blood sugar in addition to lowering blood pressure as well., Maintaining a healthy weight improves your ability to stabilize blood sugars. Determine whether or not you need to lose weight to help you stabilize your blood sugars.


If you're overweight, losing weight will help your body stabilize blood sugar more effectively. Sometimes, excess fat causes insulin resistance and an inability to use insulin correctly.Determine what your BMI is using an online calculator. This will help you determine whether or not you're overweight and need to lose weight.
If you're BMI is between 20.0 to 24.9 you're at a healthy weight for your height. If you're BMI is 25.0 to 29.9 you're considered overweight. If your BMI is over 30.0 you're considered obese., If you're chronically stressed, you may find it more difficult to stabilize your blood sugar. Work on managing stress in your life so your blood sugars remain normal.


When you're stressed - either by illness or lifestyle - your body produces hormones that cause your blood sugar to rise.If you're chronically stressed, consider finding ways to relax and calm yourself. You can try: talking to friends and family, going for a walk, doing a relaxing meditation or listening to music.
If you're having difficulty managing your stress, consider talking to a behavioral specialist or therapist. They'll be able to give you more techniques and advice regarding stress management.

Take medications as prescribed.,
Drink water.,
Work out to lower blood sugars.,
Have something sweet to drink.",How to Stabilize Your Blood Sugar Naturally3," Natural methods can be very effective, but if you have diabetes and require medications, it's important to take your medications as prescribed.


Most diabetics are prescribed either oral medications, injectable medications or injectable insulin to help them manage their blood sugars. These are usually to help keep your blood sugar lower instead of too high.
In addition, you may also be prescribed emergency medications that help increase your blood sugar if it gets too low.
Make sure you review your medications, dosages and how to use them thoroughly with your doctor. You need to make sure you understand exactly how to use them. Not taking the right dosage, the right medications or not taking them at the right time can cause significant fluctuations in your blood sugar.

, Another trick to help lower a high blood sugar is by drinking water. This doesn't have a drastic effect on your blood sugar, but is advisable if you notice your sugars are running high.


When your blood sugars are high, your body will naturally try to reduce your blood sugar by excreting excess glucose into your urine. As a result, your body will excrete more fluid causing your body to get dehydratedIncrease your water consumption to help replace the fluids that your body excretes. This extra water consumption can help your body flush out the extra blood sugar.Only drink sugar-free, caffeine free liquids like water, flavored water, sparkling water or decaf coffee and tea.

, Regular exercise helps you stabilize your blood sugars and improve the management of your diabetes. But it can also help lower a blood sugar in the short term as well.


Before insulin was regularly used to treat diabetics, it was advised for those experiencing a high blood sugar to exercise.When you exercise, your body uses blood sugar to fuel your muscles and organs during activity. Exercising for even 10 minutes can help lower blood sugar immediately.If you test your urine for ketones and notice there are ketones in your urine, do not participate in strenuous exercise as this can worsen your condition., On the other hand, if you're experiencing a low blood sugar and need to stabilize yourself, have something sweet to drink to slowly bring your sugar back up to normal.


Try drinking a glass of water with a tablespoon of honey mixed into it or cup of 100% fruit juice.
You can also suck on hard candies or glucose tablets or eat a few crackers to help raise your blood sugar.
After you drink some juice or have a few crackers and are feeling better, make sure you eat a snack or meal that contains protein, healthy fats and a nutritious carbohydrate. This will help stabilize your blood sugars for several hours.

Avoid problem areas.,
Get clear instructions from your doctor.,
Clean the injection site with alcohol.,
Remove the pen cover or pen cap.,
Remove the paper tab from the plastic container holding the pen needle.,
Clean the pen with alcohol.,
Prepare the needle.,
Prime the pen to remove air bubbles.,
Turn the dosage selector dial to the appropriate units.,
Calm yourself down if you’re nervous.,
Prepare to inject yourself.,
Inject the insulin.,
Remove the used needle.,
Store your pen appropriately.,
Throw away expired insulin.",How to Use an Insulin Pen," The abdomen is the most commonly used area for insulin injections. You can also use the side and front of your thighs, the backs of your upper arms, the cheeks of your buttock, or – if someone is doing the injection for you – your lower back right above your waist.You will rotate through different areas for injecting, so familiarize yourself with your options.;
, Injecting into the same area over and over can cause lumps or fatty buildup in the area, which can interfere with your medication. You can avoid this by rotating your injection sites. Pick an appropriate body region and use that area for one to two weeks, but move around within that area with each injection. Inject at least 2 inches away from your last injection site.It may help to keep a chart of where you inject yourself so that you can remember. For instance, you can note that this week you injected into different areas of your right thigh, so that next week you can move to your left thigh or abdomen.
Rotate in a clockwise or counterclockwise way to help keep track of your injection sites.

, Do not inject yourself on an area that is already bruised, swollen, sore, or into an open wound. Inject at least 3 to 4 inches away from your belly button, and at least 2 inches away from any scars.Also, avoid injecting into muscles that you will be using because this will speed up absorption of the insulin. For example, don’t inject insulin into your upper arm before playing tennis.

, Before you first use your insulin pen, ask your doctor any questions you have and be sure to get clear instructions from them. Be sure you know what dose of insulin to use at what time of day, how often to check your sugars, and where you should inject yourself.


Ask about anything you don’t understand or need clarification on, such as, “Am I supposed to check my sugar before I eat, or after I eat?” or, “Can you show me again which part of my tummy to inject?”

, Use an alcohol swab or a cotton ball covered in rubbing alcohol to clean the area you are going to inject. Let the alcohol air dry.Wash your hands before using your pen, as well.

, Intermediate-acting insulin usually appears to have a milky consistency. If this is the case, roll the pen between your hands to mix the insulin until it appears even throughout (usually about 15 seconds)., Needles for insulin pens come in different sizes, and should be chosen based on your body type.Your doctor will tell you which needle size to use. Be sure you check to make sure you get the right size.

, Clean the area where the needle twists onto the pen with an alcohol swab or alcohol on a cotton ball., Screw the needle tightly onto the insulin pen by rotating it clockwise. Pull off the big outer needle cap, but do not throw it away. Pull off the inner needle cap and dispose of it. Be careful not to bend or damage the needle before use.

, Turn the dosing knob to select a dose of 2 units. With the needle pointed up, push the dosing knob all the way in. Watch for a drop of insulin to appear at the tip of the needle. If no insulin appears, repeat the process.Make sure the dose is set back at 0 when this is complete.
If you attempt this several times and still do not see insulin appear at the needle tip, check the pen for bubbles. Try changing the needle and attempting this again.

, There is no specific “right” number of units that applies to every person. You and your doctor should discuss your diabetes and blood sugar and determine the right number of units of insulin for you. It’s possible that you will use different amounts at different times of the day, so be sure to always set the dosage to the correct units.


Always double check the dose window to assure you are getting the proper dose before injecting.

, Even if you’ve done this 100 times, you might still get nervous about using a needle. Calm your nerves by listening to some nice music, doing deep breathing exercises, meditating, lighting aromatherapy candles, or giving yourself some positive affirmations like, “I’m in charge of my health and I take great care of myself!”

, Hold the pen in your dominant hand with your fingers curled around the pen, the needle pointing down, and your thumb hovering over the dosing button. With your other hand, pinch about 1 ½ inches of the area of skin you are going to inject so it is gently pulled up higher than the skin around it. Do not squeeze your skin hard, which can interfere with the injection.

, Insert the needle into the pinched skin at a 90° angle to your body. Do not jab yourself hard, but insert the needle quickly and make sure the needle is all the way into your skin.Let go of the skin you are pinching with the needle still in place. Press the dosing knob all the way down, until the 0 lines up with the dose arrow. Hold the needle in place for 10 seconds.Keep the dose button pushed down until you remove the needle.
Remove the needle quickly, pulling straight out of the skin.
Don’t massage the place you just injected yourself. If there is tenderness or a bit of blood, dab it gently with a tissue.

, Put the large needle cap carefully on the needle. Twist the covered needle to unscrew it. Throw the used needle away in a sharps container.


If you don’t have a sharps container, use an alternate hard container for old needles such as an empty aspirin bottle or laundry detergent bottle.

, Store opened insulin pens at a controlled room temperature. Store unopened insulin pens in a refrigerator. Be sure to keep your pen in a safe place that children and pets cannot access. It is good practice to keep your pen in the same place every day so you always know where to find it.


Do not expose insulin to very hot or cold weather conditions or direct sunlight. If your insulin pen is exposed to these conditions, then discard it., Different types of insulin last for different lengths of time being stored at room temperature. Check expiration dates on your insulin, and get a new pen if yours has been in storage longer than the suggested length of time.


The number of days you can use your pen depends on each manufacturer. Pens last 7 to 28 days if stored at a controlled room temperature. Consult with your doctor or pharmacist about the specifics on your pen. Always follow instructions on the packaging.The expiration date printed on the pen package does not apply once it's no longer stored in the refrigerator. After that, it must be disposed of after 28 days.

Use cinnamon to replace sugar.,
Add cinnamon to your breakfast.,
Use cinnamon in meat sauces.,
Replace sugar in vegetable dishes.,
Use cinnamon in baking.,
Add cinnamon to sweet and savory canning recipes.,
Use cinnamon in drinks.",How to Use Cinnamon to Help With Diabetes1," Because cinnamon is so flavorful, it can often replace small amounts of sugar in stove-top recipes, sauces, meat, and vegetable dishes. Replacing a sweetener with this spice can help reduce the amount of sugar you consume and improve your blood glucose levels.


Cinnamon is considered safe when used in the amounts normally found as foods-- this works out to roughly ½ to 1 teaspoon or about 1000 mg per day.;
, For instance, stir cinnamon and a small amount of agave nectar into oatmeal in the morning, adding berries and nuts to make it an even more nutritious breakfast. Or top off buttered whole grain toast with a dash of cinnamon and a sprinkle of a crystallized sweetener like Stevia or Splenda.


Cinnamon also goes well with peanut butter or sugar-free jam on toast.

, Cinnamon pairs well with poultry, pork, and beef spice rubs as well as Asian-themed dishes, marinades, and salad dressings. Mixing to taste, replace some of the sugar or brown sugar with cinnamon for homemade barbecue sauces, pulled pork marinade, berry compotes, and even marinara sauces.

, Use cinnamon in place of brown sugar or regular sugar in candied vegetable dishes, such as candied yams, baby carrots, or sweet stir fry. Cinnamon lends a complex, sweet flavor without the spike in glucose.

, Baking is perhaps the easiest way to incorporate more cinnamon into your diet. If you enjoy homemade breads, muffins, breakfast bars, cookies, or pies, cinnamon can be easily added to virtually any recipe you love.


Stir cinnamon into baked good recipes. Extra cinnamon mixes best with dry flour, and you should mix thoroughly to prevent clumping. If a recipe already calls for some cinnamon, try doubling the amount or reducing the amount of a spice like nutmeg to replace it with cinnamon.
Use cinnamon to dust baked goods. If cinnamon has already been incorporated into a baked good recipe, try using a baker’s brush or sifter to lightly dust the top of the muffin, cake, or bread with cinnamon while it is still warm from the oven.

, Canning fruits and vegetables offers an easy way to sneak cinnamon into snacks and sides that otherwise would be free of cinnamon. When used appropriately, cinnamon can make an excellent addition to sweet and savory canning recipes.


Use cinnamon heavily in recipes like apple or pumpkin butter, canned apples, and applesauce.
Add a 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon to each large Mason jar of other fruits, like canned peaches or strawberries.
If you are canning or pickling savory foods, consider adding cinnamon with cucumbers, green beans, onions, beets, and even bell peppers.

, Try adding a little cinnamon to your coffee grounds in the morning to get a cinnamon-flavored cup of caffeine, or mix it into smoothies, diet shakes, and dairy-based blended drinks to get an extra dose of cinnamon in your day.

Keep in mind that only a few studies have looked at fenugreek’s effects.,
Be aware that you may have some side effects.,
Know when to avoid using fenugreek.",How to Use Fenugreek for Diabetes2," Although fenugreek seems to be an effective way to reduce blood sugar levels after a meal, only a handful of studies have found this to be true so far. Therefore, it is still important to work with your physician to treat your diabetes.Fenugreek alone will not treat diabetes. Diabetics must follow a careful diet, monitor blood sugar levels closely, and do other things such as get regular exercise. Taking fenugreek does not mean you can stop doing any of these things.
Make sure that you still take your regular diabetes medications as prescribed by your doctor.

, Fenugreek is considered as “likely safe” for adults when you use it in amounts that are common for food. But it is considered ""possibly safe"" when taken as a supplement. During this time, you may experience some gastrointestinal side effects such as diarrhea, gas, and upset stomach. You may also experience some respiratory side effects such as congestion, wheezing, and coughing.Do not take fenugreek for more than six months.

, Fenugreek is not considered to be safe for pregnant women and children. Do not take fenugreek if you are pregnant, nursing, or planning to become pregnant. Do not give fenugreek to children either, as some children have passed out from taking fenugreek."

Consider taking a cinnamon supplement.,
Talk to your health professional about adding a cinnamon supplement.,
Consider a supplement of 500mg of cinnamon per day.",How to Use Cinnamon to Help With Diabetes2," If you don't want to add cinnamon to your meals, you can still add it to your diet by taking a supplement. Many health supplement and natural food stores sell cinnamon supplements at affordable prices.

, While a low-dose cinnamon supplement is unlikely to harm you, your medical advisor may be aware of potential interaction effects with your medications that would make it risky to take cinnamon regularly. It can interact with your diabetes medications, as both the cinnamon and the hypoglycemics work to lower your blood sugar and it is important to be certain that your blood glucose levels drop too low.


Keep track of how much cinnamon you are taking and keep track of your blood sugar levels using a home glucose monitor-- you will soon be able to determine how much cinnamon you need to help control your blood sugar.

, 500 mg of cinnamon taken twice a day has been shown to improve A1c levels (and the levels of blood fats). A1c is used to determine average glucose levels for the previous 3 months, thus lowered A1c levels reflect improved diabetic control."

Learn about diabetes.,
Investigate how insulin affects blood sugar.,
Understand how Type 2 diabetes functions and its traditional treatment.,
Find out why cinnamon can help control Type 2 diabetes.",How to Use Cinnamon to Help With Diabetes3," Diabetes is a group of chronic hormonal disorders that results in too much sugar (glucose) in the blood. There are a number of forms of diabetes. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disorder, usually appearing when a person is quite young. Type 2 diabetes is an acquired disorder that used to be considered an adult condition that is unfortunately appearing more and more often in children. Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes. A third form of diabetes is called gestational diabetes and occurs in the second half of pregnancy and is relatively common, occurring in less than 10% of pregnant women.


Some physicians include pre-diabetes as an early form of diabetes. Individuals with prediabetes have higher than normal levels of blood glucose, but not high enough to be diagnosed as diabetics. Individuals with pre-diabetes (also known as insulin resistance) have a very high risk of developing type 2 diabetes.

, Insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas, is the main chemical messenger that “tells” the cells that it is time to take up glucose. Insulin is involved in messaging the liver to take up glucose and transform it into the storage form of glucose known as glycogen. Insulin is also involved in a wide range of other functions like protein and fat metabolism.


All diabetics can also be said to have insulin resistance. The reason they have high blood glucose is that the cells in their body do not take up glucose. The reason for this is that the cells in their body do not respond normally to insulin.
If the cells become insulin resistant, they “ignore” or can’t respond to the signal from insulin.This can increase the levels of glucose in the blood. When this happens the pancreas responds by producing even more insulin in an attempt to “force” the glucose into the cells. The problem is that since the insulin has no effect on the insulin-resistant cells, the blood glucose levels can keep rising. The body’s response is to convert the high levels of glucose in the blood into fat, and that can set up a scenario of chronic inflammation and other disorders like full blown Type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome and heart disease.

, The most common symptoms of Type 2 diabetes include: increased thirst along with more frequent urination, increased appetite, weight gain or unexpected weight loss, blurry or changed vision, fatigue, and increased number of infections.Type 2 diabetes is diagnosed by your symptoms and a number of specific blood tests that measure how well your body handles sugars.


Most cases of diabetes can be controlled with a combination of medications (hypoglycemics -- medicines that lower blood sugars), diet, and exercise. Insulin may be ordered for some patients, especially those with Type 1 diabetes.

, Current research indicates that one of the components of cinnamon, methylhydroxychalcone polymer or MHCP, can improve how cells respond to insulin. MHCP seems to mimic some of insulin’s activity. It also appears to work side by side with insulin, by improving the effectiveness of insulin. MHCP also has antioxidant effects, though it is not clear that these have anything to do with the ability of cinnamon to control blood glucose."

Obtain a glucometer and test strips.,
Read the materials and directions that come with your meter.,
Test the glucometer before using it.",How to Use a Glucometer1," You can go to any drugstore and buy a blood sugar testing kit. Most kits contain lancets (testing needles), a lancing device, testing strips, and a meter to read the results.


Many insurance companies will pay for your meter and test strips if you obtain a prescription from your doctor.;
, Familiarize yourself with all the functions of your blood glucose meter, how much blood is required for testing, where you insert your test strip, and where the readout will be. Look at the pictures and read the instructions thoroughly, and if you have any questions or concerns then contact your doctor before trying to use the machine.

, Most glucometers include a way to test to make sure they are reading correctly. This could be in the form of a premade test strip or a liquid you place on a test strip. These are inserted into the machine and the reading should be within acceptable limits, which the instruction manual will provide.

4 Starbursts
15 Skittles
12 gummy bears
15 grapes
½ a banana
1 small apple or orange;
, Use your normal method of checking your sugar to see if your levels have returned to normal. Your blood sugar should be above 100 mg/dl. If it isn’t, repeat the process., If you sugar was still under 70 mg/dl (4.0 mmol/l), eat another serving of 15-20 grams of simple sugar. Wait another 15 minutes, then check your blood sugar.Most people will have stabilized after one or two sugar cycles; however, continue the process until your blood sugar is above 70 mg/dl (4.0 mmol/l).

, When your sugar is stable, you need to eat a snack if your meal is more than one hour away. If you were planning to eat within an hour, just wait until your next meal. Otherwise, have a small, healthy snack that contains complex carbs as well as protein and fat to stabilize your blood sugar.While your snack should not be a simple sugar, it should contain complex carbohydrates.For example, eat a sandwich with meat, lettuce, and tomato as a meal.
For a snack, you could try a low carb protein bar.

, If you are experiencing low blood sugar often, talk to your doctor to see if you need any adjustments to your diet or medications. While low blood sugar is a normal occurrence in diabetics, it should not happen more than 3 times a week."

The shakes
Dizziness
Weakness
The sweats
Headache
Nervousness
Moodiness (a key sign; may be irritability, confusion, anger, aggression, etc.)
Increased heart rate
Hunger
Pale skin
Disoriented behavior.;
, Be aware that sometimes people mistake a diabetic person as someone who has drunk too much alcohol (aggression, slurring, sweating, odor, etc.). It may help to look for a medic bracelet but, provided you are safe, try to attend to helping the person regardless of the cause of the behavior.


If the person is very aggressive, get help. It can be difficult sometimes to argue with a very determined and rather strong person about the need to ingest glucose quickly, so more help is always safer.

, Bring the blood sugar level back up to normal. If the person is conscious:


Give the sugary food such as honey, sugar, hard glucose candies (like barley sugar, boiled sweets) or a sugary drink (fruit juice, soda or milk).
If you have access to glucose tablets, give the person 3 glucose tablets, or follow the package instructions.

, Within 5 minutes, the symptoms of low blood sugar should be improving. During this time, ask the person to rest. Reassure the person as much as possible.


If the symptoms abate, ask the person to keep resting for a while. This has been an emergency situation and the person needs to take it easy. Follow up with a sandwich and a banana/cookies, or similar food that takes a longer time to digest. This will stop the energy crash that can occur after eating lots of sugar.

, If you are concerned about how the person got to this state, you may need to follow up by taking the person to see a doctor for further examination and advice. Indeed, it is strongly recommended that the person see a doctor anyway, as he or she has experienced a medical emergency.

, If the person's blood sugar level does not improve within 10-15 minutes after giving glucose, if the person becomes unconscious or starts having a seizure, call an ambulance.


Over the phone, describe clearly what is happening.
Explain what you have already given the person and how the person has reacted.
Monitor the person's airway, breathing and circulation. If conscious, reassure the person.
If the blood sugar level is still low, have the person consume some more glucose/sugary product.
If possible, keep the person sitting or lying down to rest.
Stay with and monitor the airway, breathing and circulation until emergency services arrive.

, Liquid could cause the person to choke. Instead, monitor the person's airway, breathing and circulation. Place the person in the stable side position (recovery position) and keep monitoring the person until the ambulance arrives.


Reassure even if you think the person cannot hear or understand you. At some level, just knowing someone is there taking care of you can be of great help.

, Insulin shock happens when blood sugar levels plummet. In most instances, this can be avoided. The following advice will help reduce the potential for experiencing insulin shock:


Do not skip meals.
Eat small meals throughout the day. Meals should be routinely timed and spaced at regular intervals.
Avoid taking too much medicine or insulin.
Keep from excessive bouts of exercise.
Refrain from alcohol.


The causes that cannot be helped are reactions to new medications, aging and illness. The unfortunate fact is that sometimes it can happen for no reason at all. In this case, simply be prepared as best you can by always having a source of glucose with you and letting others know where they can find it in a hurry, if needed.

While the GoodNites (Huggies GoodNites) branded diapers have bedwetting pants that range in sizes between people who weigh 38 to 125 lb (20 to 60 kg), these bedwetting diapers are by far the bedwetting diapers with the largest weight range and therefore the best possible diapers for most bedwetting cases. Most other bedwetting diapers (such as the Pampers UnderJams and the many store brand diapers) tend to only include sizes up to a smaller weight (focusing on the two to three year old crowd) who weigh anywhere from 38 to 85 lb (20 to 40 kg)) limit than most of the sizes that GoodNites are designed to be utilized in.;
, Although it's best if you open the package up with a pair of scissors, it is possible to rip into the package without a pair of scissors. Find the two little holes up the top of the package on opposite sides of the perforation and pull each side out, or if you want, tear open the bottom for a better way to grab ahold of only one diaper at a time.


If you accidentally tear into a diaper with your fingernails as you pull open the sides on top, you might have ripped too far into the diaper pant and it may need to get thrown out instead of being used later that night, so have your parents help you check to ensure you haven't accidentally ripped too far into it. (It'll be okay to trial run for size, but not okay for use during that night.)

, However, if the fit doesn't fit well enough on you, don't even try to test for absorption and leak rates - as you could, without using them, try to bring them back to the store for a refund in a short time following (in most stores) the trial run.

, There are some ground rules you'll need to hear in preparation for changing into this diaper every night (especially at first), but these rules aren't too complex to not understand them well enough at first. These may include preparing an extra few minutes (estimate about 15 minutes extra) before bed every night to change yourself out of your day-clothes and into your nightclothes and fresh, clean, new diaper, as well as having you help with diaper changes during the night should you need them (should a bedwetting accident occur). However, take the easy way out and have your parents help you during the night, so you become less startled. Either way, let your body relax to the fullest extent possible to ensure that you can't be overworked and stressed out, as stress can sometimes signal a possibility of a nighttime bedwetting accident..

, Double-check to ensure your bladder is empty and the potential for a bedwetting accident is low. Even though the diaper can help protect the bed-wash on-top of the fitted sheet from getting wet, if there's no urine in the person's body that is ready to come out that night, there should be no reason that the diaper would even need to hold any urine during the night until the next morning when you awaken.

, Recognize where new diapers are before you crawl into bed and have yourself become changed into your bedwetting diaper for the night within the estimated time frame permitted by your parents before bed. If you can't change your own diaper yourself or aren't mobile enough to climb out of bed on your own, cry and wail to alert your parents to have them help you change it (much like you did when you were a baby in diapers alone), but prepare yourself for your parents' cuddling embrace if you choose not to get up from bed or can't get up from bed without help.


Most children can and will be carried by their parents if they are of a length and weight that is permissible by parents to hold and carry without bumping into too much stuff along the walking route.

, Keep your mind only on falling asleep, which could take a little while to get comfortable with wearing one again. You'll probably twist and turn several hundred times for the first few nights and it could take awhile to try and get your mind off the diaper and back into pure-sleeping with a diaper on - you will come to the conclusion that it can help with prevention of wet beds during the night, eventually.

, Awakening yourself might not be easy to do for the case of a chronic bedwetter, but after a routine is set of waking up by your parents, this trick can be done after awhile.

, Identify diapers that were involved in a bedwetting accident that night as part of your routine if you shall awaken. If you can tell by the sagging feeling of the diaper when you walk to the bathroom (or your parents help walk you to it), it can help you mind learn that uncomfortable feeling means something your mind doesn't want to happen and you need to fight around and try and prevent it if possible before it happens.)


If you are awake enough to try and look on your diaper (if the following is present), try and look for a differently colored strip. This differently colored stripe indicates where wetness has happened in the diaper. And while some genders are easier to read than others due to the genital positions, this is an estimate of whether or not it was used during an accident.

, Getting any wet wash off the wearer will help the wearer feel more comfortable for the remainder of the night. Place this diaper to the side of the bed or in a nearby trashcan until it can be more properly wrapped and thrown away elsewhere the next morning.

, Don't drink any liquid, and try to make things serene again in the room before trying to get back to sleep. Play soft and subtle music/tones and create an ""airy"" atmosphere for the wearer to get back into their normal sleep pattern.

, Place any unused or gently used (sweat-only) diapers to the side so they can be used the following night. Place each unused diaper

, They weren't your fault; you did nothing wrong for having these accidents in them. Look towards the future of having an accident-free world; you will eventually have a time when you won't have accidents in your bed. Try your hardest to make it to the bathroom before the accident, but in the mere case that you wet one, realize it's your body's natural reaction and your body is strange and can't process correctly when your body's full of urine/can't process urine the proper way to help you get to the bathroom when needed during the night.

,,, Whether the doctor is a pediatrician or a general physician in a group or not, take the opportunity to willingly talk to this doctor to discuss treatment options that you can follow that can work alongside the diaper routine you began in the nights leading up to the day you go in for the appointment. Your parents should be willing to take you to a doctor to try and discuss a course of prevention that you can follow that can work alongside the diaper routine these nights. Although it may be your first time that you've bedwet, they've heard from others how others start and what methods can and will work to make you diaper-free once more.

, Retire all the disposable bedwetting diapers from your ensemble of nighttime clothes once you've found you've outgrown them or your accidents have stopped occurring.

, If you or your children are super-young or are resistant to giving up their diapers in fear that their accidents may renew themselves over again, the parents can help them compile a chart to help them understand their accidents better and help them manage just how diaper-changes and when the time should come to stop the diaper-use stage. Children who are similar to you can outgrow bedwetting altogether within a few months and might not even need their diapers anymore.


Estimate how much liquid the diapers seem to absorb through each day of each week of each month; if the diaper is soggy-wet one month and barely sweaty-wet a few months later, the child might be coming close to outgrowing their bedwetting or have fully outgrown their bedwetting and may need to have the diapers confiscated for lack of use. If the child's wetting is not getting any better after a period of a month or so, take them to their pediatrician or doctor who should be able to treat them as they will have other treatment options (such as medicine and psychological therapy) that can help prevent their bedwetting from occurring in the future.
If you or your parents own an iPhone, there are several baby-like charting apps that can help organize how and when your diapers were changed during the night and can even help you track your progress. There might be some apps on Android that are similar but you'll have to find one yourself.
If you don't own a smartphone, track these on a calendar or write each change down on its own separate line of a lined piece of paper and watch these with a keen eye.

, Have them help you understand and be willing to talk to them about any other stressful problems you might be having.

Locate a CDE near you.,
Contact your insurance company.,
Think of some questions before meeting your CDE.,
Meet your educator.",How to Work with a Certified Diabetes Educator1," Before working with a CDE, you’ll need to locate one. Usually, your doctor will refer you to a CDE who can help you. But if not, you can always ask your doctor for a referral, or contact the agency or organization that regulates diabetes educator certification in your country.In the U.S., certification is overseen by the National Certification Board for Diabetes Educators.
The American Association of Diabetes Educators offers an online map of all Cd Es  in the U.S. at https://www.diabeteseducator.org/patient-resources/find-a-diabetes-educator.
In the Philippines, certification is governed by the Philippine Association of Diabetes Educators (PADE) and the Association of Diabetes Nurse Educators of the Philippines (ADNEP)
In Canada, you could contact the Canadian Diabetes Educator Certification Board (CDECB).
If you need help finding the diabetes organization in your country, try an online search. Type a word string like “diabetes educator ” into your favorite search engine. Explore several results to find an educator near you.;
, Most insurance programs in the U.S. offer 10 hours of diabetes education in your first year following diagnosis, and may offer coverage after that. If you have universal healthcare coverage, you will probably be eligible to work with your CDE consistently over a longer period. In either case, contact your insurance provider or healthcare program to learn more about what sorts of CDE meetings you can attend based on your coverage and needs., You probably have many questions about your diabetes that your doctor suggested you ask your CDE. Make a list of these questions so that when you meet your CDE, you’ll be able to get some in-depth answers. Common questions you might have include:What’s the best way to treat my diabetes?
How much will my treatment cost?
How can I get my prescription needs met?
When should I make a follow-up visit?

, When you locate and contact your CDE, set up an appointment. Say to the CDE, “I would like to schedule an appointment to meet.” Make a note of the appointment date and time in your daily planner or digital scheduling app and ensure it does not conflict with anything else you had planned. Then, attend the appointment.Arrive at least 10 minutes early so that you will not be late.
You might have to meet your educator as part of a larger group of other diabetes patients, or you might be able to meet your CDE individually.
Bring your list of questions to the appointment and ask your doctor about anything that they don’t answer directly.
You will likely meet with your CDE more than once.

Clean your hands and sampling area.,
Assemble the device.,
Wait for the glucometer to prompt you for a sample.,
Test your blood sample.,
Wait for your results.,
Read the results.",How to Use a Glucometer2," Use hot water and soap to wash your hands. Clean the finger you’re going to prick with an alcohol swab, or with rubbing alcohol on a cotton ball.Alcohol evaporates rapidly so there's no need to dry the area; that will just recontaminate it. Let the alcohol air dry.


Most glucometers instruct you to prick your finger for a sample, but some of the newer blood glucose meters let you use an area on your arm. Determine which of these areas is acceptable for your meter. In general, a finger prick is the most accurate. Alternative sites are okay to use when blood glucose is stable, but not when potentially changing rapidly, such as after eating or exercising, or when hypoglycemic or ill., Insert a test strip into the glucometer, ensuring your insert the proper end inward. Insert a lancet into the lancing device you use to prick your finger.


Glucometers may differ in when you insert the test strip. Usually it is inserted in order to turn the machine on, but sometimes you have to put the blood on the strip and then insert it into the machine. Make sure you know which way your glucometer works before you prick your finger.

, A readout on the glucometer will tell you to put the drop of blood on the strip. The readout may actually say ""place sample on strip,"" or it may give you a symbol, such as an icon that looks like a droplet of liquid.

, Prick your finger with the lancing device. This usually causes no, or very minimal, discomfort. You may need to squeeze or massage the finger you pricked on either side to squeeze out a drop of blood. Let the blood form a small bead on your finger. Hold the bead of blood to touch the tip of the strip at the right place, which should be indicated on the strip.Some people find it more comfortable to prick the side of the finger close to the fingernail, rather than the pad of the finger – there are fewer nerve endings on the side, making it a less sensitive area.If you find it difficult or painful to prick your finger, it may help to rinse your hand in warm water for a minute or two and then allow your hand to dangle at your side for another minute. This gets blood flowing to your fingers. Do this before you wash your hands with soapy water and use alcohol to clean the finger you’re going to prick.
The newer strips offer a ""wicking"" action that will draw the blood up into the test strip. Older meters and strips require you to actually drop blood onto the strip.

, The glucometer will start to count down in seconds until your results are ready to read. Newer glucometers only take about 5 seconds, whereas older versions may take10 to 30 seconds.The meter will sound a tone, or beep, when it has a reading for you.

, The results will show up on the digital screen of your glucometer. Results will vary depending on what time of day it is, how recently you ate, and what you ate. There is no single good result for every person. You should discuss your diabetes with your healthcare provider and set goals for your blood sugar.

Create a system to help you remember to do your readings.,
Keep a record of your results.,
Bring your record to your doctor visits.",How to Use a Glucometer3," You and your doctor will make a plan for how often and at what times you should use your glucometer to check your blood sugar. Sometimes this should be done three times every day. It might be hard to remember this, especially at first, but creating a system to help you remember can get you into the habit.


Make a log that you have to check off for morning, afternoon, and evening. Put it on your refrigerator or bathroom mirror – somewhere that you look often throughout the day. Check off the boxes as you go.
Be creative. Try keeping three small stones in your right pocket. As you do a reading, move a stone to your left pocket. By the end of the day you should have all stones in your left pocket. This can be a tangible reminder to do your readings. Come up with something that works for you!

, Some diabetic glucose meters will store the readings for you in their on-board memory. With others, you will have to write your results down.Make sure you note the day, time and type of reading. For instance, was the reading taken first thing in the morning? This is known as a fasting reading. Was it taken 2 hours after a meal? This is known as a 2-hour postprandial reading.

, Bring your glucometer with you every time you see the doctor who takes care of your diabetes. If it stores your results, they can access them directly. If your machine does not store your results, be sure to bring your written record with you. Bring your glucometer, as well, so your doctor can check to ensure it is working properly at every visit.

See if the person is responsive.,
Call emergency services if there is no glucagon kit.,
Get their glucagon kit.,
Inject the glucagon into their buttock, arm, or thigh muscle.,
Help the person as they wake up.,
Feed the person 15-20 grams of simple carbohydrates.,
Remind the person to contact their doctor.",How to Treat Low Blood Sugar2," If the person is responsive, then you can give them 15-20 grams of simple sugars. If they have passed out due to low sugar, then you cannot give them sugar via food and drink. If they have a glucagon kit, you can administer it.

Do not try to give someone food and drink if they are unconscious. This could cause them to choke to death.
Never inject insulin when a person has low blood sugar. That will make the situation worse., If you can't locate the glucagon kit or can't figure out how to use it, call emergency services immediately. If they do have a glucagon kit, administer it and care for the person before calling for medical services., Glucagon kits are only available by prescription, so you’ll only be able to use it if the person has one. The glucagon will stimulate the person’s liver to release stored glucose, which will help raise their blood sugar.Their glucagon kit might be in their bag, purse, or pockets. Make sure to search thoroughly but quickly. It might also be worn on their body in a pack.

, Follow the instructions that are included with the kit to make sure that you inject it correctly. The muscles of the buttock, arm, and thigh are the best locations for the injection.Choose the easiest to reach injection spot, unless otherwise directed by the instructions.

, Keep the person stable, and don’t let them injure themselves as they wake up.

Turn them on their side so that if they vomit, it doesn't stay in them. Provide them with a bucket or trash., This is so that their liver does not suck the glucose back in, dropping the levels down again. Good options include 4 oz of regular juice or soda, half a banana, or a packet of sugar., When a person receives glucagon, their healthcare provider needs to know. They may also need a prescription for a new glucagon kit in case they pass out again in the future."

Talk to your doctor.,
Stick to your meal plan.,
Take your medications as instructed.,
Eat several small meals throughout the day.,
Check your blood sugar throughout the day.",How to Treat Low Blood Sugar3," Your doctor can help you develop a plan to manage your blood sugar. What you’re eating, the medicines you take, and any exercise that you do can all affect your blood sugar. Your doctor will be able to help you plan how to avoid drops in your sugar.Ask about new exercise routines.
Check with your doctor before changing your diet.
Ask about any vitamins or supplements you want to take before you try them.

, The meal plan provided by your doctor or dietitian is your best option for maintaining your blood sugar. Don’t add new foods or change what they’ve given you. If you want to sometimes deviate from the plan, talk to your doctor or dietitian in advance about how to do it safely., If you’re on medication for diabetes, make sure you take it in the correct amounts and at the times directed. These medications will help keep your blood sugar from getting too high, but if you use them incorrectly they could cause your sugar to drop too low., Eating several small meals throughout the day rather than three big meals can help you keep your blood sugar steady. Choose balanced meals that are on your meal plan.

Eating several small meals is especially helpful for people who have reactive hypoglycemia, which occurs when your blood sugar drops because your body releases too much insulin after meals.Healthy meals are low carb, with higher levels of protein and fats. For example, eat a salad with grilled chicken or a half sandwich with a cup of soup.

, Stay on top of your numbers so that you know where you stand. This will allow you to eat a snack before your sugar gets low, or take insulin if your sugar is unexpectedly high.Carry your testing kit everywhere.
Test before and after your planned meals.
Make sure your meter and meter supplies are accurate, have not expired, and are still of good use.

Go about your day as normal.",How to Wear Pull Up Pants," Not all pull-up diapers are sized equally. Although most older children won't fit into those meant for toddlers, those that do, tend to wear them. For those that can't fit into those toddler-styled ones, most bedwetting diapers are of a pull-up style, yet offer the protection most older children need. And if you still can't fit into a bedwetting diaper, most disposable adult diapers offer the ability to pull the garment up and down as the ""change"" seems fit.;
, Never purchase cheap pull-up pants. Do your research. Call the company. Remember that pull-up pants are measured by the hip or waist, whichever is larger.

, Although most pull-up pants aren't as hard to change as those of diapers, some people will need to downplay these facts, and provide a worry-free environment where ""not a care in the world"" can bother them.

, Each type of pull-up pant comes with its own process. If you can possibly fit into those meant for toddlers, there's an article for that style. If not, you also have those meant for bedwetters and adults.

, Most people will tend to shy away from using them at school, but to get the same effect or to use the pull-up pants up at an increased rate, continue using them at school.

, It'll take a slight learning curve to wear one again.

, Use the easy-open side to wrap the pant up and throw it into the trash collection container.

, Allow the pull-up to be used occasionally. That's what one is to be used for, so go ahead and use it as it was designed for.

Learn more about diabetes.,
Talk to your CDE about taking medication.,
Inquire about insulin therapy.,
Ask your CDE how to monitor your blood sugar.,
Ask your CDE for apps to help you cope with diabetes.",How to Work with a Certified Diabetes Educator2," Your doctors and nurses will probably have already explained to you that you have diabetes, and you probably have a good idea about what it is. But your CDE will walk you through in more detail about exactly what diabetes means for you, and what sorts of adjustments you’ll need to make in order to live a full life while treating your diabetes.Your CDE will probably provide or direct you to reliable sources where you can learn more about your condition.
You may receive pamphlets, books, or fliers pertaining to diabetes management.
They might also recommend certain websites where you can read about diabetes and locate additional resources.If you read something you’re confused about, always make a note of it and follow up with your CDE.

, Some people with diabetes need to take medication in addition to eating right and getting more exercise. Your doctor may have recommended one or more diabetes drugs. You can learn more about these drugs, including their side effects, from your CDE. Talk to your CDE about your medications and ask them questions relating to your particular medication. Medications you might be taking include:Metformin, a medication that improves the sensitivity of the body to insulin reception
Sulfonylureas, a medication that helps the body create more insulin
Meglitinides, a medication similar to sulfonylureas, but is faster-acting

, In addition to medication, your doctor might have recommended insulin therapy, a treatment in which you take injections to stabilize your insulin levels. You might need to take insulin several times each day, or just once daily. There are many types of insulin, including insulin detemir, insulin, aspart, and insulin lispro. Your CDE can help you learn more about the differences between the many varieties of insulin, and help you understand why insulin treatments are different for different people.If your physician has prescribed insulin for you, you could ask your CDE for more information about how to administer it properly.

, As a diabetic, if your blood sugar levels are outside certain parameters, you could go into shock. Your CDE will help you develop a care plan that involves checking your blood sugar levels. Ask your CDE how often you should check your blood sugar levels. Assuming your doctor hasn’t already demonstrated how you can check your blood sugar levels, ask your CDE to show you how your particular blood sugar monitoring device works.When you obtain your blood sugar monitoring device, you should ask for a full run-down on its use and operation.
Carefully read all user manuals and directions associated with your diabetes management tools and devices.

, Your CDE might also connect you with apps to help you and your family members track your blood sugar levels over time, or check the sugar content of certain foods. Encourage your CDE to walk you through the use and operation of these apps so you can better manage your condition. "

Ask for information about exercise.,
Identify meal plans that work for you.,
Talk with your CDE about other risk factors.,
Get ongoing support.",How to Work with a Certified Diabetes Educator3," Because diabetes is closely linked with heart disease, it is important to proactively protect yourself against developing heart disease. One of the great benefits of working with your CDE is the chance to craft a personalized workout regimen that keeps your heart healthy and your body fit. Your CDE may recommend:Aim for at least 2.5 hours of moderate or vigorous exercise per week. Spread your exercise out over the course of at least three days during the week.
For instance, you could walk, run, ride your bike, or engage in some combination thereof for thirty minutes per day over the course of five days.
Your CDE will also recommend that you incorporate resistance training – lifting weights or working out on the benchpress, for instance – at least twice each week.
Ask your CDE, “What sorts of exercise can I do to stay healthy with diabetes?”

, Working with your CDE gives you the opportunity to develop dietary changes you can make to stay healthy with diabetes. Let your CDE know your dietary preferences and budget so they can recommend recipes or meal options to help you stay healthy. Your CDE might, for instance, recommend:Fruits like oranges, blueberries, grapefruits, and strawberries.
Non-starchy veggies like beans, spinach, collards, tomatoes, and broccoli.
Lean protein sources like nuts, beans, and seeds.
Avoiding sugary drinks like cola, sweet juices, and teas with added sugar., Ask your CDE what other practical interventions you can make to manage your diabetes. For instance, your CDE will probably advise you to quit smoking and drinking alcohol, since both can increase your risk for heart disease.

Understand that diabetes is a condition in which the body cannot control the level of glucose (sugar) in its blood because of one of the following (or both, in Type 1):


The pancreas (is damaged) produces insufficient insulin (little or none in Type 1).,
Realize the fact that type 1 and type 2 diabetes are two totally different types of diabetes.,
Understand that people diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes eventually do not produce any insulin.,
Understand that Type 2 Diabetes is the more common form of diabetes.,
Know that Type 2 is likely to be a more serious condition than Type 1 diabetes.,
Diabetes is a deadly, serious matter -- did you know?",How to Understand the Difference Between Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes,"






The body cells resist the action of insulin especially in Type 2, when the pancreas overproduces insulin. Insulin resistance, when the your cells do not use insulin the right way, and then more insulin may be needed for getting enough food into your cells.





;
, Diabetes, unlike the common myth, does not begin with Type 1 and then progress to Type 2.

, They need to be treated with insulin given by insulin syringes and injection or via insulin pumps for diabetics (insulin via a tablet would not be effective as it would be destroyed in the digestion process).

, Obesity is the primary reason for Type 2 diabetes. People diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes do not produce sufficient quantities of insulin for the increased numbers of active fat cells that need it. Initially your pancreas responds to the demand (created by obesity), by producing more insulin. However, it is overworked and cannot do so indefinitely. Corrective action includes reducing body fat by choosing lower caloric diet and being more active, with an exercise plan (your new, healthier lifestyle). If corrective action is taken soon enough, then people suffering from Type 2 diabetes need not take any medication such as diabetes glucose tablets or diabetes supplements and can begin to lead a healthy normal life. Failure to take corrective action will create a need for insulin injections to supplement the inadequate quantity of insulin units produced by your pancreas.

, Myth: Type 1 diabetes is serious, Truth: Yes and No. Type 2 is likely to be more harmful because people often have it for years before realizing any problem -- and so, not being diagnosed and not changing eating habits. Having it for years can lead to long term damage to your vital organs and systems (pancreas, heart, kidneys, digestion, immune system, nerves, eyes) and toes, feet and legs.

, Diabetes is a silent killer. Plus, Type 1 diabetes occurs in kids and young adults. Plus, there is no cure for Type 1 diabetes. Compared to Type 2 diabetes -- at least with type 2 diabetes you have a chance to reverse it by dieting and losing weight.
