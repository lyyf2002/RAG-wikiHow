Identify the problem.,
Have a look from their perspective.,
Leave your friend alone.,
Consider your options.,
Choose an option and do it.,
Wait and see.,
Accept the outcome.,
Never leave the situation until it is beyond repair, if you don't sort it out sooner rather than later, your friend simply won't care and will have moved on.

,
Don't try to make them jealous, because they may either not care and you will be embarrassed or, they may care and dislike you more.

,
Don't do anything mean to 'get them back' or 'karma' if you are the victim, then let karma get them back another way, because if you do it, karma will get you back also.

,
Don't do something you will regret.

",How to Solve a Fight with Your Best Friend," Sometimes it's obvious, but sometimes it's pretty hard to determine. Also, make sure there actually is a problem, and your friend isn't just having a bad day or they are having a tough time outside of the friendship.;
, Talk to them about what they think you did wrong and it might turn out to be a big misunderstanding., Instead of bombarding them with questions and demands, let them cool down and think about the situation. Do this until however long it takes for your friend to stop glaring at you in the halls, insulting you, spreading rumors, crying, etc.

, There's the classic ""talk to your friend and ask them what's wrong"", the ""ask a friend to ask your friend what's wrong"", or even the ""leave him/her alone until everyone forgets about it"". Of course every situation is different, but talking to your friend directly is almost always the best option, even though it may be scary.

, It's better to remain modest instead of staying on your pedestal and playing innocent. Admitting all your faults will make that person feel better, and encourage them to do the same.

, Let your friend think about it.

, If your friend wants to cut the friendship for good, well, there's nothing to do about it. Don't get nasty or malicious; put all your effort into making a new best friend and remaining mature and nice by still saying hi to your friend in the halls, etc. Odds are, after you show him/her how nice you really are, they'll want to be friends again.

Decide which method you will employ.,
Choose a live trap.,
Locate a burrow entrance.,
Locate the best spot to place the trap.,
Set the trap.,
Provide a funneling path that forces the animal to move toward the trap.,
Bait the trap.,
Relax and let your expertly set trap perform its magic.

",How to Trap an Armadillo," There are really only two methods of live capture, and unless you want to stay up very late or get up very early to try to capture the varmint with a net, you'll probably choose method 2. Method 2 involves letting a live trap do the dirty work for you.;
, Now that you have decided on the easiest (but very possibly not permanent) method of capture you'll need a trap. You could buy one or make your own. Choices for factory produced traps include Havahart and Advantek.

, Find an entrance that looks like it has been used recently.

, Look for signs that reveal the normal path that the armadillo uses for egress and ingress into that particular burrow entrance.

, Place the trap 6–8 feet (1.8–2.4 m) from the opening parallel with the path you identified in the last step.

, Using scrap plywood, 2x4's, garden fencing or whatever else you may have on hand, create a funnel. Starting with the widest point of the funnel at the opening of the burrow making an unbroken funnel culminating at the opening of the trap being the same width as the trap opening.

, Earthworms are best as other types of bait may attract other unwanted animals like raccoons, and cats. Place some earthworms in some hosiery, making a small sack of bait. The hosiery will hold the bait and allow the smell to permeate the air in hopes of attracting our pesky garden wrecker. Actually the bait may be a more of symbolic gesture as an armadillo's sight is not very good and your funnel will lead him right to the trap.

Notice moodiness and anxiety.,
Pay attention to grumpiness and irritability.,
Acknowledge abrupt, uncharacteristic neediness.",How to Know if Your Kids Are Overscheduled1," All activities come with internal and external expectations.The more activities your child is involved in, the more pressure they will feel trying to meet these expectations.This may cause depression, anxiety, consistent bad moods or quietness, and avoidance of friends and family.Correct this by speaking with your child. Ask them what activities they would like to drop from their schedule.
You might say something like, “I think we’ve been a little too busy lately. I know you like doing activities, but are there any you’re OK with stopping? It’s alright to cut back sometimes.”;
, You may have noticed that your kids have been looking and acting drained. They may complain of headaches and physical achiness. Disturbed or poor sleep are also common. These are emotional hints your child needs a break.Ask your child, “Why do you think you are frustrated/tired/etc.?” If they can’t think of a reason that makes sense, they may be overscheduled., With younger children especially, you’ll be in the driver’s seat when choosing activities, practice times, and so on. This might cause your child to lose their sense of self-purpose and become overly reliant on you. If your child seeks your direction for every little thing, cutting back may help.


If you child has free time, do you notice they lack imagination? Do your kids have difficulty setting their own schedule when left to their own devices? If you answered yes, your child is probably overscheduled."

Look for signs of digging up.,
Check the bark of fallen trees in the area.,
Look for scratchings on the ground.",How to Track Echidnas2," Wherever you find ant or termite nests, if there are signs of digging around or in the nests, then you have probably located an area where echidnas are.

, Echidnas tend to tear off the bark in long strips, usually from logs.

, Echidnas that are using the are for finding ants or termites may dig in places other than ant or termite nests. However, they don't only eat ants and termites. They're quite happy to eat other creatures such as earthworms, beetles and moth larvae, so scrounging with their sharp claws may occur anywhere.

"
"
Be aware that native wildlife is protected in Australia.,
Watch for the reaction of an aware echidna.",How to Track Echidnas3," Take pictures and observe from afar. Do not try to interfere with the echidna in any way.


Keep quiet and try not to move too much for fear of alerting the echidna to your presence. Echidnas have been known to lie on ant mounds with their tongues out for hours, trapping ants that walk on the tongue.
If you're lucky, you might see the echidna seeking out ants or termites, trying to scratch itself, eating or going about its daily doings. If the echidna is bitten by an ant, it will roll over and scratch to try to remove ants.

, The moment an echidna becomes aware of you, or is disturbed by you, it will resort to digging downwards vertically. It will stop when it's half-buried, as it is near impossible to dislodge an echidna so buried (and don't even try)."
"
Recognize when your kids don’t have “loafing” time.,
Gauge potential overscheduling by school performance.,
Notice when once fun activities no longer are.,
Assess the time your kids spend with friends.",How to Know if Your Kids Are Overscheduled2," Loafing time can be defined as time spent in quiet relaxation or pursuing simple, fun, unplanned free-time activities. If, thinking back on the past few weeks, you recall little to no such opportunities, your child is likely overscheduled.Encourage your kids to indulge in spontaneous fun activities, like observing the natural world, blowing bubbles, playing hopscotch, playing kick the can, and more.
To encourage your kids, you might lead by example and teach them your own favorite childhood games. Participating in these activities, even for a short while, can be valuable bonding time.Schedule a loafing day for you child. Say something like, “Today we don’t have any activities planned. What would you like to do for fun?”

, Lower than usual grades can be a signal of overscheduling. Are activities taking time away from homework or studying? Do your kids lack the energy to participate in class? If so, your kids may be suffering from an overpacked schedule.If you find yourself or your child making time at the beginning or end of the day by waking up early or staying up late for homework, cut back on extracurriculars., Have your kids recently started to hate activities that they once enjoyed? You may have noticed they often throw tantrums or mysteriously “misplace” equipment when you’re headed to practice.They may not sing along to their favorite songs or refuse favorite treats, like ice cream. These are indicators of overscheduling.


It can be difficult to determine whether your kids are simply growing out of an activity or overscheduled. When “No” becomes your kids’ standard response, consider cutting back., If your kids are too busy to spend time with their best friends, their schedule is likely overfilled. Before taking action in this regard, check with your kids to make sure there hasn’t been a fight or that they and their friends haven’t simply grown apart.You might investigate this by asking, “I haven’t seen your friend Jane around lately. Is everything OK between you two?” If nothing seems to be wrong, this could be an indication of overscheduling.

"
"
Evaluate your own energy levels.,
Note excessive time spent in the car.,
Track scheduling conflicts.,
Observe family mealtimes.",How to Know if Your Kids Are Overscheduled3," If you as a parent feel stressed by your child’s schedule, it’s probable your child is as well. Take stock of your personal feelings about your child and their schedule. Are you tired of shuttling your kids around? Are you apprehensive about the next upcoming activity? If so, reevaluate your kids’ schedule.Even removing a single planned activity from each week can have a significant improvement on you and your children’s mental health. Continue removing activities until you find a healthy balance., Traveling from activity to activity takes time. Spending too much time in transit transporting your children to and from activities is generally a clue overscheduling is occurring. Be on the lookout for:


Increased gas expenses.
High mileage.
Frequent replacement and maintenance of things affected by mileage, like oil/oil filters, tires, and more., Trying to do too many activities can lead to scheduling conflicts. These can contribute to stress and negative self-image. Scheduling conflicts can also lead to you or your children feeling guilty over not being able to fulfill planned activities.Write down each scheduling conflict as it occurs or keep a log in your phone. If scheduling conflicts happen more than a few times a week, it’s time to reassess your child’s schedule.

, Do you have time to sit down with your family and share your day over a meal? If not, you could be accidentally sending a signal that keeping busy is more important than family and interpersonal time. When mealtimes are skipped for sports practice, dance rehearsals, and so on, consider removing some activities from your kids’ schedules.Meals on the go, especially those in the car, can set an unhealthy precedent. There’s nothing wrong with doing this occasionally, but doing it too frequently can indicate a need for fewer activities."

,
Get people to make sure they will help you tidy up and go halves on buying things for the club.

",How to Start a Best Friends Club," A list of the following things to put in it are:


Your club name, of course! Think of a fun name for your club. You probably want to think of something that is fun, creative, and personal. You could come up with a name using the first letter of each member's name, or you could each come up with a word and put the words together to form a name.
The friends you would like to have in your club - not ones that can join for sure, just ones that you wouldn't mind joining your club.
General information about your club, including things such as meeting times, plans, and policies.;
,, Also ask them if they will be able to attend meetings and parties.

, Don't make too many rules, so that your friends do not come to think of it like school!

, This can be a tree house, clubhouse or even your bedroom!

, This is the fun, crafty bit! Make/design/paint some posters for your bedroom door. Or if you want new members, and if you`re allowed, give out some fliers in school or advertise your club by stapling the posters to trees or bulletin boards around your community. You can also make a box that you can place the rules, agreements, photos so absolutely anything and you can alternate it between the leader and her assistant if you have an assistant leader.

, These can include a photo of themselves, full name and other simple things. ID cards are used to enter somewhere, for instance, of you want to enter a hideout, you would need an id to let the owner know it's you not someone in disguise. It is bad if you lose an id because you will not be able to enter the club. If you don't want to make ID cards you can make a piece of paper and when one member (or more) does something wrong put an x and kick him/her out of the club without any fighting.


,, You don't want to tell them secrets and let them give them away to everyone.

Consider what makes you feel controlled in your friendship.,
Tell your best friend what she or he is doing that bothers you.,
Ask your friend to tone it down.,
After a discussion, if things worked out favorably, be gentle in pointing out the bad habit.,
Consider what to do if your friend refuses to acknowledge his or her controlling behavior.,
Practice your independence.,
Refuse to react.,
Tell someone.,
If your friend doesn't listen, and refuses to stop the controlling behavior, consider ending the friendship.",How to Stop Your Best Friend from Controlling Your Life," A best friendship isn't to be set aside lightly, so you do need to be sure that there is a real issue at hand. Signs of being controlled include:


Your best friend talks over you, both in private and in public.






Your best friend never does things your way or agrees to doing the things you like doing. He or she has no idea of what compromise consists of.
You might occasionally feel suffocated, as your best friend tells you what you will do, what to wear, who to see and not see, where to go, etc. If you do anything differently, she or he gets angry or puts on a sulk.
Your friend expects a great deal from you but fails to do much or even anything for you.
Your friend fails to stick up for you when it matters but is more than ready to criticize you in front of others.;
, If your friendship is a good one, a talk should be something it can withstand. Tell your friend that there are certain things that he or she does that bother you and cause you to feel taken advantage of. It is important to demonstrate with factual examples, so that your friend can see you've taken note of actual occurrences and you're not just making it up.

, Suggest that you'll tell your friend when she or he is falling into the tendency to be over-controlling, as a cue to stop it straight away. If your friend values you and the friendship, this should be a realistic thing to ask of your friend.


Tell your friend that this is not the way friends treat each other and describe to her or him what you need to change.






Show your friend that you are upset. In the right context, don't be afraid to raise your voice a little bit.






If you do want to continue being her or his friend, tell your friend gently enough to help her or him understand and not be too mad or feel threatened.







, When she or he begins trying to control you, just discreetly say, as if you didn't want to embarrass her or him, to stop telling you what to do.


Show or explain to your friend what she or he doing and tell her or him how to fix it. For example, when your friend tells you to come with her or him to the park next Tuesday, explain that you don't want to be controlled. To fix it, expect your friend to ask you whether or not you want to go somewhere or do something rather than simply telling you.







, In this case, you have the option of simply pulling away more but staying friends, right through to walking away from the friendship. See if you can try the softer options first, before ending a best friendship.

, Become better at doing things on your own and taking responsibility to show your friend that you've changed and have taken control of your own life. Don't be available all of the time; go out with other friends or do other things without your friend


Stop your friend from doing it by doing it yourself. If your friend feels a need to step in for you to fix things, start fixing those things for yourself before your friend even notices.

, For example, when your friend begins to boss you around, don't do what she or he says. Just ignore what your friend tells you and she or he will get the indication to stop doing it.

, It is not fair that you must be the puppet of a friend and if you find it too hard to stop the behavior alone, consider telling someone who can help. Tell someone close to you what's been happening, and ask for their advice on how to handle it.

, Or, at least stop being this person's best friend. It's hard to be in a situation like that, but go with your gut feeling and realize that you have the power to stand up for yourself.


Avoid communicating. If you have a best friend who is a friend of the controller, or you and the controller are friends for long, then take a break. Go to relatives' house for holiday stays; forget the controller's existence by distracting yourself. If she frequently calls/texts you, switch off your phone or change your SIM.

Before you say anything to your friend, watch her closely.,
When you three are together, watch your friend for any signs of flirting or wanting to flirt.,
Listen to your boyfriend and be alerted if he says anything about how weird your friend is acting around him.,
Be alerted when she asks a lot about your boyfriend.",How to Tell if Your Best Friend Likes Your Boyfriend," More than often will her actions, poses, and facial expressions reveal her hidden secret. Ask yourself the following questions:


Does she hang out with your boyfriend more than you?
Does she seem to hover/linger around him and strike up more conversations with him than you?
Are her eyes dilated when they're focused on him?
Does she appear nervous and a little giggly around him?
Has she said anything that may hint that she likes him? (Ex: ""Your boyfriend is really cute!"");
, See if she laughs at almost every joke he cracks, giggles and blushes a lot, and/or bats her eyelashes.


Watch her if she makes any physical contact with him. Is it flirty or just a simple, innocent gesture of friendship?

, Take note of any strange, suspicious behaviors he mentions.

, She could be just a caring friend who wants to know more, or a secret admirer that wants to be liked back.


Does she ask a lot about his attitude? Family? What makes him happy, angry...etc. She could be studying him to maybe steal your boyfriend from you.

Consider your insecurities.,
Build your self-esteem.,
Find happiness in yourself.,
Reclaim your power over your emotions.,
Ask yourself what is causing you to feel jealous.It’s important to identify the root of your jealousy.,
Disconnect your emotions from the situation that triggered them and then analyze them.Ask yourself if what you're jealous of will matter a year from now.,
Stop comparing yourself to others.,
Own your jealousy.Once you’ve recognized the root of your jealousy and you’ve come up with a solution, talk to your best friend.,
Practice open communication.Sometimes just talking to your best friend can solve the issue.,
Return to the reason you are friends.",How to Overcome Jealousy of Your Best Friend," Often, when you figure out what your insecurities or challenges are, you will be able to build them into strengths, which will prohibit feelings of jealousy. While it isn’t an easy task to examine yourself for your flaws, it must be done.


Remind yourself that you are more than just your insecurities.
Try to keep a positive mindset while identifying areas in which you are insecure. Remind yourself of things you do feel confident in or like about yourself.
Remember that you can change any insecurity into a strength with time and effort. For example, perhaps you are lonely and want to make more friends, but you are not outgoing. Practice being outgoing and friendly toward strangers and eventually you will have turned your shyness into friendliness and you’ll have made new friends.;
, Self-esteem is how you feel about yourself as a person.There are many ways to work on your self-esteem including, but not limited to:


Recognizing your strengths. Are you good at school? Do you excel at sports? Are you a fair listener or a trusted secret keeper for your friends?
Actively engaging in activities you are good at can remind you of your strengths and build self-esteem.
Keeping a list of every compliment you received over the course of a week. Read over these compliments when you are feeling insecure.
Working on your challenges. Perhaps you are terrible at bowling and your best friend is a good bowler. You can improve your bowling through practice.

, It's easier to become jealous of people around you if you aren't happy with yourself. Feelings of inadequacy increase the likelihood that you will experience jealousy.You can find happiness in yourself by doing following:


Focusing on internal strengths. When you focus on external factors, such as popularity or earning potential, those things could shift and your self-esteem could crumble.When you focus on internal factors, your self-esteem is built on a much more stable foundation and you will be happier with yourself.
Practicing daily intentions.Remind yourself that you are capable of giving and receiving love, attention, and respect, and that you are deserving of these things. Post them somewhere visible, such as on your mirror or computer monitor. Consider saying them out loud each day. Visual prompts can be very helpful for affirmations.

, Do not let your emotions hold control over you as this will create a reactive state of emoting.

Instead, you want to acknowledge that every emotion you feel is a choice. You have chosen to allow yourself to feel what you are feeling and you are in control of your emotions. When you begin to feel jealous or angry, remind yourself that you are being reactive and choose to stop feeling that way.

Ask yourself what you are feeling and if you want to feel this way.
If you do not want to feel this way, take some deep breaths and focus on the emotion you want to feel instead.
Make the choice to feel the way that you want to feel.
For example, if you want to feel happiness, focus on being happy, identify what makes you happy, and maintain a positive mental attitude.

, While you may initially believe that you are jealous of something superficial, once you begin to look at your feelings of jealousy more deeply, you will realize that there is likely one specific root of your jealousy, which you can then change. Ask yourself:


Are you jealous of your best friend because you think she is prettier than you? What makes her prettier than you? Is it her haircut, her clothing, or her makeup? Is it the way she carries herself or her self-confidence?
If you are jealous of your best friend’s haircut, you can go to the salon to have your hair done in a similar style. If you are jealous of her clothing or makeup, you can go shopping for new clothing or makeup for yourself. If you are jealous of the way she carries herself, you can work on your posture, poise, and self-confidence, and pretty soon you will be carrying yourself in a new way.
Once you have figured out what specifically you are jealous of, you can begin to work on yourself to overcome that jealousy.

, Often you are jealous of something fleeting and trivial. Once you’ve analyzed your feelings free from the situation, you may come to realize that you are feeling jealous for irrational or unreasonable reasons. If this is the case, remind yourself that you are being irrational and check your jealousy.


For example, a rational person who is in control of their emotions would not feel jealous of their best friend when a third party compliments their best friend’s shoes. If you find yourself being jealous of your best friend in this moment, remind yourself that your friend did not ask for the compliment; that your best friend’s shoes are awesome; and that you’ve got some great shoes on too, even if they have not yet been noticed. There’s no need to be jealous for such a trivial reason.

, When you live your life constantly comparing yourself to others, you will create insecurities and recognize disparities that will breed jealousy. Instead, try to compare yourself only to yourself.Try this:


Possibly take a break from social media until your self-esteem is better. Social media gives you the impression that everyone else's life is perfect and full of abundance.
Remember what you were doing and what you had a year ago and compare yourself to that person. This will highlight your personal successes and gains, which will help build your self-esteem and diminish your tendencies to feel jealousy.
Make a list of the things that you were doing, the goals you had, and the successes in your life a year ago. Next, make a list of the things you’re currently doing, the goals you currently have, and the successes in your life now. You might also note the goals you achieved in specific terms.

,


For example, you might tell your best friend that you are jealous of her because she has the haircut that you want and ask her if she would be okay with you getting the same haircut. You might even ask her if she could recommend her salon to you. Turn this into a bonding moment that could strengthen your friendship.
Acknowledge that your feelings are your own and that you are in control of them.
Instead of saying, “Your hair makes me so jealous!” try, “I feel jealous of your hair. You’ve got a great cut.” In this way, you’re using “I” statements, rather than “you” statements to talk about your jealousy.
Also own where your jealousy could be coming from, such as a history of being bullied, an abusive relationship, etc.

, Be honest about the way that you feel and be sure that you don’t project your feelings onto them.


Use “I statements: “I feel this way about…”
Make sure that your communication is two way, meaning that you listen closely to your best friend’s response to your declarations of jealousy.
Try to work to overcome your jealousy by talking about it.
Encourage your friend to share her feelings with you, too.

, If you are still unable to abate your jealousy even after working on yourself, identifying the root of your jealousy, and talking to your friend about it, then it is time to remind yourself of the importance of your friendship. Often, that will be enough to ease your feelings of jealousy.


What makes you best friends in the first place?
Think about your favorite memories together.
Understand that your jealousy could destroy your friendship if you don’t put it in check.
Ask yourself which is more important to you: your friendship or your jealousy.
Make sure that you are not feeling jealous because your friend is hypercritical or hard on you and makes you feel inferior to them. If this is the case, then this may not be a good friendship.

"
"
Ask yourself how long have you been with this friend?,
How much do you tell your friend about your life?,
Do they make you feel uncomfortable in anyway?,
Have you ever fought with this friend?",How to Make Sure Your Best Friend Is Someone You Can Trust," Did you just meet them? Are they a childhood friend? A good trusting friend should be someone you knew throughout your whole life.;
, (problems,hobbies,etc.) If your friend is a trusting person. Telling them whatever is on your mind shouldn't be a problem.

, If you notice this friend is hanging out with the wrong group of people or do things that give them a bad image. I suggest staying away from that friend since they could influence you in the wrong ways.

, Think about any disputes you had with this friend. Are you the one who apologizes first? Is it them? Are they friends worth keeping even when you fight?

Have a movie night.,
Write out your bucket list.,
Decorate accessories or clothing.,
Be a tourist in your own town.,
Go see a movie.,
Compile a new outfit with only $20.",How to Never Run out of Fun Things To Do With Your Teenage Girl Friends1," One of the simplest ways to have fun at home is an old fashioned movie night. Invite friends over for a movie marathon at your place.


Pick a genre of movie. You can watch movies that you loved as a kid growing up, watch classic films, or pick movies that are recently popular. Get a few DVDs or online downloads ready before the big night.Snacks can be a fun addition to movie night. Make some popcorn or buy some chips from the store. Make sure you have enough seating as well. You may have to bring in some chairs from the dining room or kitchen.;
, A bucket list is a list of things you want to do before you die. These can include big dreams, such as kayaking through the Amazon or writing a bestselling novel, and smaller desires, like watching the sunset with your future boyfriend. You and your friends might have fun writing bucket lists together and then comparing and contrasting. For added fun, see if there are any items on your bucket list you could easily do at home. Then, do those activities and cross them off your list., Decorating can be a great way to have fun at home. Consider using some craft supplies to decorate clothing, accessories, and more.


Decorate purses with sequins, glitter, and other craft supplies. Ask your mom or older sister if she has any purses she's no longer attached to and then decorate these bags. Your friends will have fun and be able to leave your house with a fun new accessory.
Get white t-shirts and write on them with black markers. You can have all your friends leave a personalized signature or drawing. That way, you'll all have a cute new shirt commemorating your friendship.

, If you're unsure what to do when going out for the weekend, consider yourself a tourist. Where do people from out of town usually congregate? What museums are popular? What sights are there to see? Is there a local zoo or other tourist attraction? Being a tourist in your own town is a fun way to pass the time., Just as staying in to watch movies can be fun, going out for a movie night can also be entertaining. Going to a theater allows you to see the latest releases and watch movies on a big screen. If you're unsure of what to do on a particular night, consider seeing a film.

, It can be fun to try and build an outfit on a budget. You'll also end up saving money if you or your friends are short on cash. Go to a local shopping mall with the goal of building an entire new outfit with only $20. This can be challenging but also entertaining. Look for sale and discount items or shop at store with generally lower prices.

Redesign your room.,
Stay up-to-date on fun activities and events.,
Joke around.,
Introduce your friends to new things.,
Allow things to occur spontaneously.",How to Never Run out of Fun Things To Do With Your Teenage Girl Friends2," If you want to have fun with your friends, create an atmosphere in your room that encourages relaxation and fun. Redesign your room to make hanging out, chatting, and listening to music easier.


Your teenage friends probably love music. Make sure you have a device in your room that you can use to play music. A small stereo might be nice or maybe just a set of speakers for your iPhone or iPod.
Have a lot of seating space. You can buy cheap fold-out or bean bag chairs at a local department store. See if your parents have an old couch they're no longer using that you can put in your room. As your friends may get messy on occasion, make sure you choose furniture that can be easily cleaned.Sometimes, just having a nice looking room can be fun. Look into fun wall art, posters, and other decorations. Make a trip to a local art or thrift store to look for fun items to decorate your room., If you want to be a fun friend, you'll need to stay up-to-date on what's going on. People who are fun to be around are constantly full of ideas for plans and activities.


Pay attention to entertainment options there are in your town or city. What movies are coming to theater this weekend? What live concerts are showing? Is there a sale at the mall? Is there a high school football game everyone will go to on Saturday?
Always be on the lookout for fun activities you and your friends will enjoy. Be the first one to send out an e-mail or Facebook message suggesting you get a group together to see a movie or go to a concert.

, People love to be around people who laugh. If you want to be a fun friend, always be ready to crack a joke. Making your friends laugh can be a great way to have fun. You can have a ton of fun just hanging out at your house if you're able to make people laugh.


Some people have a natural tendency to joke. If this is the case with you, try to bring that tendency out when you're around people. If you tend to be more reserved, try to push yourself out of your shell a little. If you think of something funny, don't hesitate to say it. If you have a funny story, share it.Be goofy. Many people are afraid of letting their childish side show. Be open to occasionally being immature. While you shouldn't be cracking crude jokes during a dramatic film, when the moment feels appropriate don't be shy about letting your silly side out. Laugh at dumb jokes and ridiculous antics. Watch silly YouTube videos. Read funny Twitter accounts. Always be on the lookout for lighthearted fun., Another way to be consistently fun is to introduce people to unfamiliar things. People are naturally drawn in by those able to show them new experiences.


If a new restaurant opens up in town, make plans to try it. Watch new TV shows and movies as they come out and, if they're good, invite your friends over for a viewing party. Be on the lookout for new stores. Take a drive to a part of town you and your friends don't normally go to and spend the day exploring.Share your tastes. Many people are shy about sharing their tastes in music, books, fashion, and more. Be open to introducing your friends to your passions. Don't be pushy about it. Just try to slowly introduce your friends to new things. For example, play a CD of a band you like in the background while you guys are hanging out.

, You may think you have to structure everything in order to always have fun things to do. However, sometimes the most fun activities occur spontaneously. Allow for last minute get togethers and deviations from the plan. If your movie night is interrupted because your friends want to talk and giggle, that's okay. Let the fun happen on its own."

Do not filter what you say.,
Ask for additional information.,
Tell stories.",How to Never Run out of Fun Things To Do With Your Teenage Girl Friends3," Sometimes, just talking can be fun. However, you have to work on your communication skills to assure you and your friends always have fun while chatting. A great way to ensure a fun, engaging conversation is to say what's on your mind without a filter.


People often stumble through conversations worrying about what to say next. You might find yourself thinking, ""Would I sound smart if I said this? Would I sound cool?"" Trying to edit what you say can make you come off as dull. Try to avoid filtering your thoughts when talking.Try to not think too much before responding in a conversation. Say what's on your mind, as long as it's not mean spirited, and people are more likely to respond favorably. People in general have more fun in a conversation when they don't feel they have to filter themselves. Your friends will find your uninhibited nature fun and feel more free to speak their own minds as well., While you want to speak your mind in conversation, that does not mean you should dominate the conversation. People have fun if others seem interested in what they have to say. Make sure to always listen closely to your friends and ask for additional information.


People enjoy being around those who are interested in their stories. If your friend tells you something, respond with something like ""Oh, cool!"" or ""Tell me more."" This will encourage your friend to keep talking and flatter her. Asking questions is a great way to keep conversation flowing., Amusing anecdotes are a great addition to any conversation. People will have fun being around you if you know how to tell a great story.


When it's relevant to the conversation, jump in with a story. For example, say you have a hilarious story about a prank you and your brother played on your mom during your vacation to Mount Rushmore. If your friends are talking about April Fool's Day, this could be a great opportunity to tell your story.You don't have to limit storytelling to what has happened to you personally. You can pick up stories anywhere. Did you hear something interesting on the news recently? Read something fascinating in a magazine article? Do you know an interesting anecdote about a famous actor or comedian's past? These can all be fun stories you can add to any conversation.If you're unsure how to tell a good story, try listening to radio programs like The Moth or This American Life. These programs rely heavily on storytelling and you can learn how to tell a good story through listening to them.

Make sure you and your friend share the same ideas about when a relationship is exclusive.,
If your friend knows this behaviour upsets you, why does she do it?,
How many crushes do you have and how often do you have new ones?,
Does she have a crush too?,
A leopard doesn't change it's spots.,Make sure you remain calm whenever your crush comes by.,Make sure your friend is trustworthy and really cares about your emotions.,Make sure your friend isn't putting you down to impress or show off in front of your crush.,Make sure your friend doesn't try to seem so big in front of you two (out loud laughing),Make sure your friend doesn't try to get 1 on 1 time with your crush.",How to Know if Your Best Friend Is Your Worst Enemy (Boyfriend Wise)," She might think he's available even if she knows you're crazy about him. Have a talk about this and work out where you will both draw the line. If you really like a guy she should know that he's off limits for her, whether or not it's not particularly credible that you'll get him.
, Does she feel insecure about her chances with boys? Does she want to show she's as good as you? Does she lack confidence? Talk to her, even if you don't ask her directly. Work on making her feel like she has her own options and opportunities but different ones to yours which are equally special in their own right. Introduce her to boys that she might not know that you think she might like and praise her, especially the parts of her that make you different., It's not really fair to compare saying that you fancy three different lads every week in comparison to admitting to obsessing over the same guy for months if you expect her to keep her hands off. There is a difference between liking the look of, fancying and being completely crushed out on someone. Work out a system so that when you say 'out of bounds' she knows he really is 'out of bounds'., You're friends and you probably have a lot in common, particularly in your taste in what you like in a person. After all, you probably have similar friends for that reason. It makes sense that you like similar things in boys too. Make a pact that you'll both support the other when she has a major crush so that any potential relationship with the boy is out of bounds for the other. Set reasonable time limits and quantities - you can't have everyone! People usually accept the first person to call has the first chance but consider who has the most realistic chance (if she's already his bestie and you've only saw him in a photo, you're being a bit unreasonable to insist your crush on him should come first) and who has the most interest (a major, year long, all out crush is different to just liking the look of him). Be prepared to compromise from time to time., If she has cheated with other guys in relationships before, she's more likely to be tempted this time. If she has cheated with partners of other friends, be warned. Your case could very possibly end up there too. You need to decide what is more important to you - your friend, loyalty or the relationship. If you really can't lose either of them have a serious talk with her about how important and special this relationship is and how he is out of bounds, period, or that's the end of any friendship. This may, however, do more harm than good by making her feel you don't trust her but you are making the situation very clear.,,,,,"

See if they are in the mood to play or take a walk. Make sure that your friend is with you, since your friend knows the pet best.Don’t force their pet to play with you. If their pet is sleeping, leave them be. They may wake up later and be in the mood to play!

Give one another space.,
Don't crowd out the friendship.,
Respect your friend's family members.,
Enjoy each other's company.",How to Keep Friends Forever," Stay in communication via the phone, texts, emails, online chats and, of course, face to face. Find as many chances as you can to remain in touch during the weeks and months of your busy life. Don't let it go too long between staying in touch.


Don't be self-absorbed when chatting. Listen to what your friend has to say and learn about what is happening in their lives. In a genuine friendship, they'll want to hear your side of things in good time too. Don't go on about you all time. Listen to your friend more than you talk about yourself.





;
, Meet up often, if it's possible. Even if you live apart from each other, make it a rule to catch up now and then. Visit one another, have lunch together, go to the movies or spend a vacation somewhere together.


Write letters when apart, or send emails. Update each other regularly.

, Have their back when the chips are down and be supportive. Trust them and believe their side of the story until proven otherwise. By having faith in your friend, you show them that you're in the friendship for the long run, not just to please yourself in the short term.


Help your friend when she or he needs help.

, This includes birthdays, anniversaries, the birthdays of one another's children, the precious times you've had together in the past. It's the thought that counts, you don't need to send large gifts or make a show of remembrance. Simply call up, send a card or catch up to remember something important together.

, This includes romantic interests, child raising preferences and career choices. They may not be your personal preferences but then again, you're not your friend, you are a friend of your friend. Respect them, offer your considered guidance but don't badger or irritate them with your ideas of what would have been better for them to do. They don't want to hear that and they won't want to keep seeing you if being scolded is all they get out of the relationship.

, Shared interests often rest at the heart of friendship, so make the most of this and go and do the things you both enjoy. Make a space in your diary to participate in the activity or event together on a regular-ish basis. You'll have fun and it'll keep both of you enjoying each other's company.

, Smothering is as deadly to a relationship as constantly distancing yourself. Aim to get the balance right and know when it's time to let your friend be with other people or to have time to themselves.

, Sometimes it is easy to get a notion that ""the more the merrier"". Too many friends is a crowd and closeness is the victim of too many people trying to get along. Stick to quality over quantity and don't force your friend to like the same people you do if that just doesn't work out for them. And most of all, don't leave your friend for more friends. Good friends are hard to find: they are rare and therefore precious.

, Even if they get on your nerves, be polite around them, that's all that is asked of you. Refrain from gossiping or dragging down his or her family members. That's a complete no-no.


Lend a sympathetic ear if needed; sometimes your friend will want to vent. However, don't agree with your friend's summation of their relatives, just agree with your friend's feelings and be supportive. Your friend doesn't want to hear you criticizing the family as well.

, Realize that you'll both change as the years go by but if you can stay focused on what the friendship means to both of you, and you can both respect the changes, then you can remain good friends and enjoy being together still. Things will change over time, but it is in accepting that that you can constantly renew the basis of your friendship and continue to grow together.

Think about why your friend is mad at you.,
Apologize.,
If the thing you did was pretty big, consider going an extra mile to apologize.,
Give them some space.,
Never be mean to your friend.,
Never tolerate friends being nasty to you for a long period of time.,
Don't be angry if they go to a teacher.,
Decide whether it is time to break the friendship.,
Finally, don't let this put you down.",How to Deal with Good Friends Getting Mad at You," What did you do that triggered the fight? What made your friend feel so upset? If you were in your friend's shoes, how would you have reacted?


Consider telling one of your parents about what happened, and asking them for an opinion.
If you're not sure why your friend is so upset, ask them. Ask in person, or send a note along the lines of ""I'm really sorry that I made you upset. I'm not sure exactly what I did that hurt you, but I feel bad about it and I want to make it up to you. Please let me know what I did wrong."";
, Instead of feeling guilty and having it fermenting inside of you it's best to come clean, accept that you did wrong, and apologize. Say to your friend that you want to talk to them and do it in private. Say, ""I'm sorry that I (what you did wrong). I did it because (I didn't know it would hurt you/I was tired and not thinking/I was being a jerk/etc.) I am deeply sorry and I hope that you will forgive me.""


If your friend forgives you, then the two of you can move on.
If not, then don't panic or get angry. The fight is putting stress on your friend too, and they need time to deal with their feelings before they can move on.

, Try baking cookies, giving them a cake with ""I'm sorry"" written on it, buying them a CD or small thing they'd like, writing a letter, or using another creative technique.

, The last thing that your friend wants is to have you pressuring them to forgive you, or you following them around saying sorry. Just give them some space. Wait a little, and then walk up to them and say ""hi"" or ask if the two of you can talk.


Don't wait for days or weeks for your friend to make the first move. If your friend is shy, or feels guilty about what happened, they may be afraid to make the first move. This could prolong the waiting time and you could start to drift apart.
Offer communication, but don't pressure them. When you enter the same room, look at them and smile or say hi, to let them know that you see them and are open to talking to them. If they are ready to talk to you, they'll take the bait.
If your friend keeps ignoring your communication offers for weeks or months, that means your they have probably decided to move on. If this happens, it's best to get on with your life and make some new friends.

, If you have done something wrong, you should be mature about it. When your friend confronts you, they have every right to do so. Instead of arguing, admit to them that you made a big mistake, it was your fault, and you're sorry. This will show that you're a mature and conscientious person who cares about them.


If it was partially your friend's fault, hearing your apology will encourage them to think about what happened, and they might apologize too.

, If you are being kind to them, but they keep being upset with you, this might be more than a spat between friends. Tell a parent, teacher, or counselor if...


It seems almost impossible to please your friend—it's like they get mad at you no matter what
You're constantly apologizing
You often feel sad, angry at yourself, insecure, anxious, or weepy after hanging out with them
Your friend gets mad at you for expressing your opinions or trying to have some input on decisions. (Note: this doesn't include opinions that disrespect others' existence, such as racist or ableist remarks)
You often feel nervous before hanging out with them
You're particularly at risk for abuse: you've been abused in the past, you're autistic or intellectually/developmentally disabled.
Your friend has threatened or physically hurt you
This is bullying and should not be tolerated.

, The teacher may be able to help sort out the argument, or find a mediator who can. Remember that this wasn't easy for your friend, and that you value your friendship. Not being angry with them is a very strong and mature thing to do and if you manage it, you should be proud of yourself.


If what you did was so bad that you'll be punished, then do your best to accept it with grace. These are the consequences of your behavior, and you can choose to learn from it.
If you need to, give yourself some space from them until you're sure that you can stop being mad at them.

, If you feel that your friendship cannot be mended, then maybe it's time to leave your friend behind. If you feel that your friendship is worth saving, and can be saved, then persevere. Either you or your friend have to make this decision, and if you feel that it's time, then it's best to sit down and talk about it then to let your friendship drift away or to have more arguments. Have a final talk and then draw a line under it.


Don't just not talk to each other ever again, just become acquaintances and go your separate ways. Maybe your friendship can be rekindled in the future.

, You have done something wrong but it's not the end of the world. As long as you accept it, apologize sincerely, and treat your friend well, your friend should forgive you. In time, things will be okay again.

Decide just how emotionally irritating this person is, and if you're truly willing to accept them as they are.,
If you've decided this relationship can continue, give yourself breathing room.,
Focus on the good stuff.,
Communicate!,
Be mindful of balance.,
Put yourself in their shoes.,
Be a friend to yourself.,
Opt for littler ways to be a friend.",How to Deal With Friends Who Are Emotionally Irritating," If you're ticked off because they don't clean up after themselves or still haven't paid you back for last weekend's dinner-out, you can probably handle that. If they are truly wearing you down and you feel your friendship is entirely one-sided, ask yourself if maintaining a relationship is worth it. Being a loyal friend is invaluable, but you must not put yourself in any position that compromises your emotional health and stability. One-sided relationships always, always crash and burn. Take an honest look at how this person makes you feel, and if you realize they're not good for you, it's always best to cut it off as early as possible.;
, There's nothing worse than spending incessant time with a friend or family member that makes you want to rip your hair out. Tell your aggravating friend that you value your alone time. If they care about you they'll respect that.

, If you have a friend who ALWAYS talks about herself, her plans for the future, her fiancé, her childhood, what she ate for lunch... She often repeats the same stories over, and over, and over, and over. Try to think of the all the times she's surprised you with Starbucks or called you to wish you a good morning when she knew you were having a rough time and you know she's your best friend for a very good reason.

, What a brilliant idea! Say, ""Hey, it would really help if you'd drive this time. I tend to spend a lot of money on gas when we're together."" Chances are, they don't realize what their irritating quirks are, or they do recognize them and just don't know how to fix them. This may even open a conversation about what annoys them about you. Give them a gentle heads up and watch how swiftly their behavior improves. However, if it doesn't improve, talk to them once more. If your situation stays just as unbearable, time to hit the road. You can do better.

, If your friend didn't acknowledge your birthday for the past three years, don't go all out on theirs with a huge surprise party, fancy dinner, and expensive present. You'll just be more disappointed when the next year rolls around and they give you a pair of socks. Basically, don't go out of your way if you know they'd never go out of theirs.

, What is the underlying reason for their irksome habits? You don't necessarily need to bust out your old college psychology text book--though you could come up with some interesting theories--but just think about their life. Let's say the aforementioned friend has a very overbearing mother. A Stage Mom to the max, if you will. Perhaps your friend's mother is constantly poking and prodding her about her weight, her hair, and if she's being social enough. Maybe she talks about herself so much because it's nice to have someone finally listen to her and how she feels. Understanding your friend's situation can make it easier for you to cope with her resulting behavior.

, So cheesy but so helpful. Don't let yourself get walked all over! Learn how to say no. It's such an empowering feeling. Remember, no one has control over your actions but you. Know your limit. Give yourself time and space. Stand up for yourself when necessary.

, Send a ""thinking of you and hoping you're having a good day!"" text rather than buying dinner every night. Your needy friend will feel affection from you and may lighten up on pressuring you to buy dinner or take them to a movie.

Being someone’s friend means accepting every facet of his or her personality. Accept that your friend needs to be the center of attention, but also that they have other wonderful qualities.Focus on your friend’s positive qualities as much as you can, even in situations where the person needs to be in the spotlight. Consider that your friend may feel threatened by an accomplishment of yours, and so acts out as a confidence booster.
Remember that as long as your friend’s need for attention isn’t harming you or another person, you can accept his or her need to be the center of attention.Avoid trying to change your friend. If you feel the need to change someone, then it might be best to not engage in the friendship.;
, If your friend constantly needs to be the center of attention, there may be some underlying issues about which you don’t know.Avoid making the person feel uncomfortable by shouting or talk down to your friend. If you point out that they never shut up or try to compete for attention, they may feel that you're cramping their style.


Manage your expectations about your friend. If you don’t think they can stop taking the spotlight, keep this in mind whenever you are with the person. Not expecting the person to completely change may help you enjoy the friendship more., No matter how long you’ve been friends, there was something that sparked your friendship. If you are having a hard time with your friend’s need for attention, think about what bonds you share to remind yourself why you’re friends.


Remind yourself of what you have in common. Do your both love exotic cuisines or going for bike rides? Draw on these interests as well as your friend’s other qualities to shift focus away from their need for attention.

, In many cases, the need to be the center of attention is related to a deeper weakness. Consider what causes your friend’s need to be in the spotlight. This may help you be more empathetic with their behavior and even cue you into helping them get over their weaknesses.See if you notice specific situations in which your friend needs to be the center of attention. For example, it could be when your friend is around a co-ed crowd or with people who are more successful.
Talk to your friend honestly—and gently—about any patterns you see. You may find out that your friend just needed someone to talk to and some tips on how to navigate difficult situations.

, If your friend has certain weaknesses, remind them about other unique characteristics they person possess. This may help them relax and not need to be the center of attention. In fact, this step may make your friendship stronger.Say things to bolster your friend in situations that may cause anxiety. For example, you could say, “I know it’s hard to be around all of these professors, but remember that you have a lot of awesome skills that these people will never be able to do.” You can also highlight your friend’s individuality in group situations. For example, say “You know, Chris left his PhD program to start a successful bakery. He’s won several prestigious awards for his breads.”

, Honestly is the foundation of any strong friendship. If your friend’s behavior is harming your friendship or other people, tell your friend that their behavior is offensive. This may get them to realize that they are alienating friends and others.Tell your friend you value them and that it’s important for you to be honest. You can say, “I really cherish our friendship, but I need to be honest with you about your need to always be in the spotlight.”

, Broach your friend’s behavior in a non-confrontational manner. This can help maintain the friendship and may also keep your friend from feeling badly about themselves. Remember that they may not be purposely stealing the spotlight.


Emphasizing community and using disappointment is a good tactic to get your friend to realize their shortcoming. It’s also far more effective than anger or negativity.Say, “Sometimes you have this need to be in the spotlight and it comes to the detriment of everyone else in the room. Everyone recognizes your awesome accomplishments, but you should realize that we all have our successes, too. We’d like to be able to share those with you and others in the group.”

, Your friend may completely take over situations with their need to be in the spotlight. If this happens, explain to your friend that their behavior crossed the boundaries of acceptability.

Avoid embarrassing your friend if possible. Gently explain why their behavior is unacceptable in private. For example, say, “Alex, the way you overtook that conversation was too much. Jack was telling us about his promotion and you took over about your own work successes. You should be more sensitive and think about how your behavior affects the rest of us.”

, If your friend’s behavior is making others uncomfortable, consider distracting everyone by making a sarcastic remark. This can help break the tension and put everyone at ease while giving your friend a hint that their behavior has gone too far.


Say, “well, now that we all know Max is a superstar, let’s move on to what we’re going to eat.” This can smooth over problems and cue your friend about his or her inappropriate behavior.

, Even if you don’t agree with your friend’s behavior, try and give the person unconditional support. You may be unaware of underlying issues or something else that sparked your friend’s need for attention.


Offer support in a group by saying “I understand why Jack’s promotion made Max feel insecure, and maybe we should try and be more inclusive in celebrating everyone.”
Support your friend individually by saying, “I understand why Jack’s promotion made you insecure, but we should have been able to celebrate him without you taking over the conversation.”

, Your feelings about your friend’s need to be the center of attention may stem from your own insecurities or how the person makes you feel. Considering why your friend’s behavior bothers you might help you disengage from your feelings and get through being with the person.


Ask yourself honest questions about your feelings. For example, you might not like the way your friend behaves because it makes you feel like a lesser person. Your friend’s behavior might also embarrass you in social settings.

, If your friend’s need to be the center of attention is too much, it may be best to either limit the time you spend together or avoid the person altogether. This may help relieve any stress you feel about the friendship and help you enjoy time with the person.Consider limiting personal contact and any social media you follow. For example, you might find that not having to see constant self-aggrandizing Facebook posts helps you tolerate your friend in person.
Remember to keep your relationship civil and polite. This person is your friend and you may not want to hurt the person. You can say, “I’m sorry, I’m just really busy with work and don’t have a lot of time right now.”

, If your friend continues to need to be the center of attention despite your best efforts, consider whether this friendship is worth it. Living in the shadow of someone else, especially if you're expected to back them up without your feelings being reciprocated, can take its toll on your confidence and enjoyment. Friendships take work but they're not supposed to have constant drama or be a constant effort. You may find that life is more enjoyable without this person in your life.Be as kind and honest as possible when ending the friendship. For example, saying, “I’ve noticed a change in our friendship in the last few months. I think it’s sad that it’s come to an end, but I wish you nothing but the best in the future.” That will always be better than, “your need to hog the spotlight annoys me and I don’t want to be friends anymore.”Meet the person if you are in the same city and explain your feelings. If you are in different cities, send the person a kind, handwritten note. This can help you feel confident that you’ve considered your decision and shows the other person that you have enough respect to take that time and write to them.
Keep your reasons focused on yourself and not on the other person. Say, “It’s hard for me to witness what you’re going through. I need to end our friendship and think that it’s the best decision for both of us.” This signals the person that the problem is with you and not them."

Managing what you say and do in a tense moment can help minimize the chances of a full-blown argument erupting.Recognize your anger. It's important to acknowledge how you're feeling if you hope to move away from those feelings.When you speak or act out of anger, you're likely to say or do something equally hurtful to your friend. Being aware of your thoughts and feelings can help you avoid a heated exchange.;
, If you are able to leave the situation, even temporarily, it may be best to do so. Going for a walk can help clear your head and give you time to calm down. It can also give your friend time to calm down and think about how he may have hurt you.Speaking/acting out of anger can also lead to damaging arguments. Remember that you cannot take back what you say in a moment of anger, but you can choose whether or not to speak in the moment.
Let your friend know that you're going for a walk to calm down, but will return. Otherwise your friend may think you're simply leaving abruptly and grow concerned.
Only walk if it is safe to do so. Don't try walking near a highway, for example, or any place that does not have a sidewalk or car-free path.

, Whether you're able to go for a walk or simply need to leave the room for a few minutes, you should use that time to focus on calming strategies. Resist the temptation to ruminate on how your friend hurt you, and instead focus on getting calm as soon as possible.



Use deep breathing. Take deep breaths through your diaphragm (under your rib cage) instead of shallow breathing through your chest to establish a slower, more calming breathing pattern.Think about something calming or enjoyable to take your focus away from the feelings of frustration.
Repeat calming phrases to yourself, like ""Breathing in will calm me down"" or ""This will not matter in six months,"" to help you move away from feelings of anger and resentment., Once you're calm and can speak without anger, you'll need to sit down with your friend to discuss what happened. Remember that you should not be hostile or confrontational. Simply sit down alone together and speak directly about what happened.Make sure you are completely calm when you sit down with your friend to discuss the incident.
Tell your friend that what he said was hurtful.
Don't use declarative, absolute statements. Instead use ""I"" statements, such as ""I felt really insulted when you said that about me"" or ""I felt like you were being very disrespectful by saying that.""

, It's possible that you may not have noticed your friend engaging in his hurtful/damaging behavior in the past. It's also very likely that your friend has never noticed it, or is not aware of it. There are many forms of hurtful behavior, but six main categories cover some of the most common types that you should recognize and be aware of:


character assassinations - generalizations used to depict or define someone as always being bad/undesirable
threats of abandonment - using hurtful, threatening statements to imply disinterest or abandonment in order to make someone else feel worthless
invalidations - generalizations used to invalidate someone else's thoughts, feelings, or beliefs
threats of exile - telling someone else directly that you do not want them in your life (similar to threats of abandonment, but even more damaging/insulting)
hostile challenges - questioning someone else's ability to think, feel, or behave in a given way (including excessive and frequent sarcasm)
preaching - attempting to use an absolute, unquestionable source/hierarchy to prove a point and put someone else down, Whether your friend repeatedly hurts you with actions or with mean, hateful words, the result is the same: embarrassment, resentment, and alienation. If you recognize any of the patterns of hurtful behavior in your friend, let him know the first time it happens (or the first time you recognize it as such) that what he did is not okay.


Assess your surroundings. If there's a chance your friend might resort to physical acts of violence, or if others may join him against you, do not confront him then and there.Recognize that repeated incidents of hurtful behavior scar your relationship, and the more often it happens the worse you'll feel towards the other person.Ask your friend how he would feel if someone he values (for example, his parents, his spiritual leader, etc.) were to see him engaging in his current behavior. Would he be embarrassed?
Point out other times that your friend has engaged in this hurtful behavior, preferably once he's calmed down. Let him know that you see it as a pattern of bad behavior, and that he needs to change if he wants to remain friends.
If it happens again, remind your friend that you've talked to him about his behavior. Let him know that you won't passively condone his behavior, and tell him that as his friend you need him to address these issues.

, Dialogue is important in conflict resolution. You can't just talk at your friend about how rude he was, just as you wouldn't want him to continue talking at you without any chance to respond.


Give your friend a chance to explain himself, and be open to what he has to say.
Your friend may have spoken from a place of pain, and probably didn't mean what he said. Or it's possible that it was a complete misunderstanding, and that your friend didn't intend his words to be taken that way to begin with.
Let your friend process what you've said, give his own response, and trust that he will change his behavior going forward., As you address your friend's behavior, it's important to remain compassionate as best you can. After all, the person is still your friend, and you most likely have a long history together.Give your friend the benefit of the doubt, and try not to hold any anger towards him.
Don't ignore hurtful comments/actions, but address them calmly and compassionately.
Remember that many people who hurt others do so because they themselves are hurting or frightened. When you keep that in perspective, it's easier to feel bad for someone who's hurt you.

, If someone has hurt you, you may be thinking about cutting that person out of your life altogether. But experts warn that that may be an extreme reaction to an incident of hurt feelings.Only you can decide whether you'll be able to move past the hurt, but most people find that with a little time and patience all can be forgiven.


Unless your friend did something devastating or life-shattering (like an act of physical violence or real emotional abuse), you may want to consider reconciling with your friend.
Recognize symptoms of emotional abuse: if your friend swears/yells at you, bullies you, degrades you, threatens you, or controls you, he is engaging in emotional abuse. You should not stand to be emotionally abused by anyone, especially not a friend or partner.If your friend engages in or threatens you with acts of violence, stay away from him, as he may be dangerous.
If you truly believe that your friend will not be able to correct his behavior, and that he will continue to hurt you without regard for your feelings, you may need to think about ending the friendship.
Give this decision time. Just as you avoided speaking in the heat of the moment, you should give yourself a few days before saying anything if you're thinking about ending the friendship.
Avoiding your friend for a few days may be enough for you to realize that you value his friendship and want to make amends. Give it time, and talk over your plan with a trusted friend or relative before talking to the friend who hurt you.

, After you've had some time to cool down and you've talked to your friend about the way he hurt you, you may want to reflect on everything that's happened. That doesn't mean fixating on your hurt feelings or endlessly replaying the situation in your head. Instead, you should reflect for a moment on everything that's happened between you and your friend to try and understand the situation better.Think about the objective facts of the situation. Don't take your feelings into account, just think about what was actually said or done, and what your friend's intentions might have been.
Reflect on how you reacted. Did you handle it well? Did you manage your feelings as well as you could have and avoid escalating the conflict?
Think about any ways the conflict may have affected your life. This can include your sense of self esteem and wellbeing.

, The first step in letting go of painful feelings is making a conscious decision. You can either hold on to feelings of anger and pain, or you can choose to let it go and move on with your life. That doesn't mean ignoring your pain - it simply means acknowledging that you were hurt and choosing not to live in the past.When you make the decision to stop reliving the past and rehashing the details of your pain, you can begin to heal from the hurtful experience.
Making a conscious decision to let go of hurt feelings can give you a feeling of control. It can help you recognize that you have a choice over what controls your life.

, This can be incredibly difficult to do, as your hurt feelings will linger even after you've let go of anger or resentment. If your friend hurt you, it may seem reasonable to see yourself as a victim. But that type of mentality only maintains the power that your friend and/or the situation hold over your life.Seeing yourself as a victim can maintain your status as a victim. Your friend (or former friend, as the case may be) will remain a dominating presence in your mind and in your life.
Once you stop defining your life by how you were hurt, you'll begin to feel better about your situation and your life in general. This can take time, of course, but it's well worth it.

, Forgiveness may not come easy, especially if you were hurt in a significant way. But it's an important part of moving on from painful experiences, and it will ultimately give you greater mental health and happiness.Forgiveness doesn't mean you have to forget. It does, however, mean that you need to stop holding on to feelings of anger and resentment.
Forgiveness is the next logical step after choosing to let go of your hurt and your sense of victimhood. Without forgiveness, you may never fully let go of the pain.
Forgiving your friend also requires you to forgive yourself. If you had any part in the incident, or if you ended up saying something out of anger, you need to let that go as well.
Once you've forgiven everyone involved, you'll be free to truly move on. Whether you continue the friendship or not, with time you will move past the painful experience completely.

Let them know if you feel uncomfortable.,

Go somewhere else.",How to Deal With Being a Third Wheel1," Although being a third wheel is probably not your idea of a good time, and possibly a little demoralizing, with the right mental framework you can make it a positive experience. One easy way to do that is to act like you are having a good time and not be a downer. Be chatty and engaging. Try buying a round of drinks. If you act like you are having fun, you might find that you are actually having a good time., Instead of focusing on the fact that you are a third wheel, try focusing on your friend’s relationship. Think of your role as providing moral support for your friend and their love life. If you understand your role as being supportive in nature, being a third wheel might become less of a chore., The easiest way to make being a third wheel not fun is to make it awkward. Try not to constantly refer yourself as a “third wheel” and lament your singleness. Be sure to avoid wallowing in your self-pity and making things uncomfortable for the couple you are with.If you can do it, limit how often you talk about being single. Instead, try to discuss things that you all have in common.

, Although it is typically considered rude to be on your phone when spending time with others, it might be a lifesaver in a third wheel situation. You can use your phone to invite another friend to where you are. It can also serve as a nice distraction from the couple. Try not to be rude but, if your couple friends are ignoring you, your phone might save the day.A phone can give you some distance from the romantic couple, even if it isn’t physical distance.

, The worst case scenario for being a third wheel is that the people you are with start getting hot and heavy with each other. If you are out with a couple and they start making out or doing things that make you uncomfortable, you should definitely let them know about it. Ask them to stop and, if they do not, get out of there. That is really inappropriate and you might want to reconsider hanging out with them in the future.

If you still feel uncomfortable or if your friends seem to want privacy, perhaps it is best to leave. If you can't, just get on your phone and text a friend or play a game. Being on your phone will make you feel more occupied and comfortable. However, don't pull out your phone unless if you've absolutely given up on the situation; it can be seen as an uninviting gesture.







, If you find yourself invited to something where you know that you will be a third wheel, try to bring along someone else. Find someone, be it a friend or relative, who you can bring along to chat with. This way, no third wheel dynamics develop and you do not feel like the outsider.


Be sure to make plans ahead of time. If you invited someone at the last second, they will likely say no.

, If you find yourself in a third wheel situation and it is miserable, just get out of there. Say that you are not feeling very well or that you have some other obligation. You could also just be honest and say that you are not having much fun. Regardless, bail on being a third wheel and go somewhere else.Find out where your single friends are and go hang out with them.

Set boundaries for yourself.,
Pretend it doesn’t bother you.,
Try to be polite.,
Keep it short.,
Leave no room for misinterpretation.",How to Deal With an Ex Best Friend," When your friendship ends, it is important that you accept that and resolve your feelings. You can write a letter to your friend expressing all of your feelings (you don’t have to send it to them), or you can create a ritual to symbolize the end of the friendship. To be happy, you will need to acknowledge the your feelings, process them, and move on to the next stage of your life.In your letter, you might write about how the friendship started off great, but then went downhill. Include the details of what ended the friendship, how it made you feel, and be sure to clearly state that it is over.
For a ritual to symbolize the end of your friendship, you might consider taking an item that your friend gave you and burying it, burning it, or simply throwing it away. Make sure that whatever you do resonates with you as closing the door to this friendship.;
, Start with small changes like eating well. Try to avoid venting your anger too much or too often. Do things that you enjoy doing, and allow yourself to do thoughtful things for someone else. This can be daunting, but you have to push through because happiness is largely in your control.Go watch movies that you like, eat at your favorite restaurants, and try new things to see what makes you happiest.

, There are many reasons that you might end your friendship, but it is possible that your ex best friend will want to rekindle it later on. If you are caught off guard, you might regret the decision you make. Think about what you will say to your ex best friend if they ever mention being friends again.You might even practice saying something like “I am flattered that you want to be my friend again, but I think it’s best we don’t go there,” in front of the mirror.

, You will probably be hurt by what your friend says about you, even if they stick to the truth. The key to dealing with this kind of drama, though, is to ignore it. If you decide to “set the record straight” you will be playing into a vicious friend feud that can go on for a long time. Not only does this jeopardize your other friendships, but it also keeps you from moving on.For example, if your former friend is spreading rumors about you at school, you should ignore the rumors rather than spread bad things about your friend in retaliation.

, Nobody wants to pick sides. It isn’t fair to ask your mutual friends to do so. Avoid gossiping about your ex best friend, especially with mutual friends. You should also refrain from sending any messages back and forth between mutual friends.Never say things to your friends like “Next time you see them, tell them I said that they are a liar!”

, Avoid talking to your former friend. Distance yourself from the things that you used to do together, and change any routines that heavily involved your former friend. There will be instances where you and your former friend have to co-exist, but limit contact with them as much as possible.

, Most nasty comments or rude gestures are done to get a reaction out of you. If you don’t give them a reaction, your ex friend will leave you alone much faster. Stay positive by realizing that what your ex best friend says about you doesn’t actually define you. You should also allow yourself to feel good for ignoring the immaturity and letting the situation go.If your ex best friend leaves a nasty note on your car, don’t retaliate. Just throw the note away and go on about your day. Try not to be upset.

, You are likely to run into your ex best friend again sometime. When this happens, you need to be calm and collected. If you can avoid talking altogether, that’s great. If not, say hello, and be polite.If you see your old friend at a party and they ask how you have been, you can respond with something like “I’ve been doing well. I hope you are well, too.”
If you run into your former friend at a school event, just acknowledge them and keep going on your way.

, Being polite does not mean that you have to entertain your ex best friend for a long period of time. Answer any questions briefly, if you are comfortable answering them at all. Avoid asking questions; they only invite more conversation.If your ex best friend sees you at the grocery store and starts asking how your mom is doing, you can reply politely, but do not ask about her family. If you want to wish them well, say something like “My mother is doing well. I hope your parents are well, also. Tell them I said “Hello,” please.”

, If you have no interest in rekindling your friendship, do not be too accommodating. Be polite in the moment, and leave that moment with closure. If you make it appear as though you miss your ex best friend that opens to the door to starting the friendship and/or fight back up.There is no need to say things like “It’s great to see you,” or “See you again soon.” Entertain the polite conversation for a short time, and say something like “I’m glad you are doing well, but if you’ll excuse me I need to go talk to my date (or any other person you can think of). Goodbye.”

Arrange times to hang out with your friend.,
Get to know your friend’s partner.,
Be more independent.,
Give the couple space.,
Be supportive.,
Find your own partner.",How to Deal With Being a Third Wheel2," If your best friend is in a romantic relationship, it may be hard to see them as much as you would like. Plus, when you do see them, they will likely be with their partner. If you feel like you could use a little one-on-one time, talk to your friend and set up a time to hang out, just the two of you.Try setting up a coffee or lunch date in advance, this will make it easier for both of you to commit to it.

, If you find that you are spending a lot of time with a couple, get to know your friend’s partner. You may find that you really enjoy their company as well. At the least, getting to know your friend’s partner will help you feel more comfortable around them and make spending time with them a little more enjoyable.If appropriate, try hanging out with just your friend’s partner. You might develop a friendship on your own.

, Your friend’s relationship might be a great time to do your own thing. Instead of doing things with your friend and their partner, do stuff on your own. Indulge some of your hobbies or try out new things.Take some classes on your own, like cooking or karate.

, The easiest way to handle being a third wheel is to spend less time with the couple. You do not need to do everything with your friend and their partner, and they would probably appreciate a little more space.Try to call or text them less, and be less insistent about hanging out. Put the ball in your friend’s court and let them initiate friend time.This is particularly important early on when your friend is figuring out the new dynamics of their relationship. Give them some space and let them get their bearings.

, Let your friend know that you are there for them and that you have their best interests at heart. This will help strengthen your friendship and make things less awkward when you hang out with the couple. Jealousy may rear its ugly head but, if you are a good friend, you will tamp it down.However, this does not mean that you should turn a blind eye to bad behavior. If your friend’s partner is bad news, let them know about it.

, One easy way to deal with being a third wheel is to quit being one. Look at your friend’s relationship as an opportunity to find romance. Try dating around a little and see what happens. You might go from being a third wheel to going on double dates.If you are not looking for a romantic relationship, try developing some of your other friendships or get to know some acquaintances.
Your friend’s partner might even be able to set you up with someone.

Talk to your friends.,
Work on your friendships.,
Branch out.,
Work on you.,
Schedule some group activities.,
Expand your group.",How to Deal With Being a Third Wheel3," If you are a part of a friendship trifecta and feel that the other two members are spending too much time together, talk to them about how you feel. They may not realize that they are excluding you and hurting your feelings. Talking to them about how you feel might put an end to the exclusion.Although it might seem tempting, try not to cause a fight between your friends. It will probably lead to you being further excluded.
In a calm and reasonable manner, say things like “I feel like you leave me out of jokes” or “it makes me sad that you do things without me.”

, Your friends might be growing closer, and excluding you, because you are not pulling your weight in the relationship. There is a tendency for pairing in three-person relationships.To avoid this, it is important that you make yourself available. Be sure to be supportive of your friends and an equally involved member of the friendship.Avoid skipping group activities.
If your friends are going through a difficult time, be supportive. If you bail on them, they will likely bail on you in the future.

, If your friends are pairing off, it might be a sign that you need to branch out and look for other people to hang out with. It is natural for pairing to develop in a group of three, where two people grow close and limit their time with the third person. If you feel left out, look for someone else in your school or at work who you can hang out with.Join a club or group that caters to your hobbies. You will likely meet someone there who you can be friends with.
If your friends are intentionally excluding you, you should be looking for new friends anyway.

, Think of your friends’ pairing as an opportunity to work on you. Spend some time enjoying your hobbies or picking up new ones. Although it may not make you feel better about being a third wheel in the friendship, it will at least take your mind off of it.


Concentrate on your work or school. If your friends are good ones, they will not abandon you.

, Organize some three person activities that will require your involvement and interaction with both friends. Play some three-on-three basketball or a board game.Try having a party and inviting a bunch of people you know. Doing things that involve more than three people will change your group’s dynamics.

, Who says that you should only have two friends? Bring some new people into the mix and broaden your friend group. With a larger group, you will have other people to hang out with. This will change the dynamics and make it easier for your friends to maintain their relationship with each other and you.Invite other people you know from work or school to social gatherings or parties.

Let your friend talk.,
Talk about the silent treatment.,
Reassure your friend.,
Include the person.,
Let the person know it's nothing he or she did.,

End the relationship.",How to Deal With a Jealous Friend Who Gives You the Silent Treatment," One way to deal with the silent treatment is to simply address it directly. Ask your friend what's going on, and see if you can get an answer. Sometimes, just bringing up the fact that there's a problem will open up the gate between you two.You could call him up and ask, ""Hey, I've noticed you haven't been returning my emails or texts. Is there something bothering you?""
Of course, this tactic may not work if your friend is screening your calls. It may work better to show up in person.;
, Don't respond with anger or laugh at the person who is giving you the silent treatment. Getting angry or upset will give the person more power, while laughing at the person is likely to enrage the person.Tell your friend directly that you would prefer she talk to you about what is bothering her.


For example, you can say something like, “I understand from your silence that you are upset or angry with me and I want to figure this out. Please let me know when you are ready to talk about it because I care about you and I want to make things right again. I will not bother you again by attempting to contact you when you do not want to talk, but I am ready to fix this when you are.”
The silent treatment is a form of control, and often, someone who uses it will feed on you looking hurt or down, or you trying to contact them repeatedly. If you don't let the silent treatment bother you, then your friend can't feed on those negative feelings.
You may also need to give it time before the person starts speaking to you again, and you can use this technique in the meantime.

, If the argument was at least in part your fault, it never hurts to apologize. However, try telling the other person you are sorry, while also explaining that you would like to talk more about what happened so that you understand her side. You want to make it clear that you will not put up with the silent treatment, but that you are willing to listen to her side and try to sort out what happened.

Apologizing can make the person realize they're being silly, plus it can get the conversation rolling to help fix the situation. If you can't get the person to pick up a phone call, consider sending them an email or even a regular letter to say you'll apologize if you can have a conversation.
Try saying something like, ""I am sorry for what happened, and I would like to talk more about it so I can understand your side better. However, if you keep giving me the silent treatment, then that will not be possible. I am willing to listen whenever you are ready to talk.""

, Hopefully, if nothing else works, your friend will start talking to you again given time. When he or she does and once things have cooled down, make sure you address the issue of the silent treatment, and how you don't appreciate being treated that way., One way to help establish why it's a problem for you is to state how it makes you feel. That is, tell your friend that you don't like the silent treatment by talking about your feelings and your relationship together. If you can help the person to understand how upset it makes you, they may have a desire to stop acting that way.For example, you could say, ""I feel really upset when you ignore my phone calls and emails, especially when we're angry at each other. I end up feeling like you don't care about me or our friendship because you're not willing to talk about our problems.""

, This conversation shouldn't be one-sided. You need to give your friend a chance to respond and discuss what he or she is feeling. If your friend has been feeling jealous, he or she may need a chance to talk about it. Your friend may also not even realize that he or she has been giving you the silent treatment.To give the person a chance to speak, use a question to get the person talking, such as ""Now that I've had my say, I'd like to hear from you. What are you thinking and feeling?""

, If you want, you can also discuss why you think the silent treatment is a poor form of communication. In fact, many psychologists consider it tantamount to emotional abuse. It stops communication, which harms the relationship. Getting things out in the open is much better for moving the relationship forward.For example, you could say, ""One reason I'm not a fan of the silent treatment is because we can't solve our problems together. The only way we can move forward is if we talk about it and fix what's come between us.""

, Often, jealousy will appear when you have a new relationship, whether it be a new boyfriend or girlfriend or just a new friend. You get so involved in a new relationship, that suddenly you don't have as much time for your friend, and so your friend gets jealous.It's valid for your friend to feel jealous if you're totally throwing yourself into a new relationship to the exclusion of old ones.
Try making more time for your friend, and let him or her know that you still value him or her as a friend, even if you don't have quite as much time together.

, If you do have a new relationship, make sure to invite your friend along sometimes. Of course, you don't always want another person along if you're dating someone, but creating a group environment sometimes, one where you can invite your friend along, will make your friend feel included., That is, you being in a new relationship has nothing to do with not liking the old friend, whether your new relationship is a friendship or dating situation. Tell the person you're not trying to replace your friend. Rather, you just like spending time with all different types of people.For example, you could say, ""I know you've been upset because I've been spending time with Rob. However, I want you to know that I'm not trying to replace you. I just enjoy spending time with all types of people.""

, That is, your friend may not be jealous of your relationship as much as they are jealous of your talent and accomplishments. Telling your friend what you admire about him or her can help alleviate some of that jealousy because your friend may not realize that the things he or she has accomplished have value to others.You don't have to sit down and have a serious talk about your friend's accomplishments.
Rather, just try to work it into your everyday conversations when you are talking again. For example, you could say, ""You know, I've always admired your writing ability. You're truly a spectacular writer.""

, If your friend is jealous of your accomplishments, not making as big a deal out of them can help. That is, you don't have to be silent about your big moments. However, you don't have to rub them in your friend's face, either, especially if the person is having a hard time, career-wise or in school. For instance, if you did really well recently at school or work, you may not want to bring it up unless the person asks., If the person gets upset when you share good news about what's going on in your life, that person isn't being a very good friend, and it's appropriate for you to bring it up. Focus on what you're feeling to guide the conversation, instead of blaming your friend.For example, you could say, ""You know, I worked really hard to do well on that project, and it hurts when you're not happy for me. I'm happy for you when you accomplish something good.""

, A final option is ending the relationship. If the person is constantly jealous of your other relationships or of what you've accomplished, he or she is not being a very good friend. You don't have to continue having that kind of negativity in your life.You can break up with the person formally, much like you'd do with a boyfriend or girlfriend: ""I think we need to spend less time together. I just don't think we're in the same place anymore.""
Another option is to just spend less time with the person, so you aren't as controlled by their jealousy.

Sharing your problems can make both of you feel better. Together, you might be able to determine the best course of action.
You don’t want to be accused of gossiping or talking behind your friend’s back, so seek the advice of just one mutual friend.;
, The direct approach is often the best one. If someone who was once a close friend has suddenly become distant, ask them if something is wrong.


If you feel that your relationship with someone has changed, chances are they have noticed a difference too, and will be willing to talk to you.
Try not to be accusatory or confrontational, just ask if they feel that something is wrong between you.You might say something like, ""Hey, it's been a while since we've talked. How are things? Is everything ok?""

, If a friend’s attitude toward you has changed radically, it might be a sign of a deeper problem like depression or bipolar disorder.If you really think that your friend might have a medical disorder, encourage them to seek professional advice., You don’t need to be pushy or insistent, simply let them know that you are concerned and would like to talk with them.

, This can set a positive tone for the conversation and soften your criticism of them.


If the issue is that you no longer see your friend, you might say, “I really liked when we used to spend time together, but lately it seems like you’ve been avoiding me.”
If you are still spending time together but their behavior has become hurtful, you might say something like, “You have a great sense of humor, but when you make fun of me it hurts my feelings.”

, Their reaction—even if it involves criticism of you—can be key to repairing your friendship., Taking responsibility can show someone that you care about how they feel., For example, if you and your friend first bonded by going to the movies, suggest an upcoming film to see together.

, If your friend’s interests have changed, try something new that they like to do. Ask them for ideas of fun activities. Keep an open mind. You might enjoy it!

, If your friend is hanging out with a new group of people, try to get along with them and become part of the new group.

, If you think you are both going to an upcoming party or other event, suggest that you will see them there, even if you’re not going together., This is a big step, but if someone is affecting your life negatively, limiting the time you spend together might be the best thing for both of you.If talking to your friend doesn’t work or they don’t want to see you, not being around them will be a natural result.
If you decide that you don’t want to spend time with a former friend, you may have to turn down their invitations and explain why you are doing so.

, If you have mutual friends, you will likely see this person again.


If you see a former friend in public, be polite but don’t pursue a one-on-one relationship with them if you don’t think it is a good idea., Moving on from a friendship can be difficult, so it is important to cultivate other, more positive relationships.


Spend time with your current friends who share your interests. Try doing activities that you enjoy with a new group of people.
Find ways to meet new people. You might take a class in a subject that interests you, take up a new hobby or sport, or spend time with friends of friends who share your interests., If you have lost a friendship that was very dear to you, it can be hard moving on. While you can grieve at first, try not to obsess or worry about the lost friendship. Understand that it is natural for friends to grow apart. You are still worthy of having friends."

Talk to your friend.,
Live in the present.,
Discuss how you feel.,
Empathize with your friend.,
Engage in positive reframing.,
Don't gossip.",How to Cope With a Friend That Is Also Friends with Someone That You Hate1," It is always difficult to talk about a tough topic, but being honest and having a conversation with your friend about the person you dislike will be better for your friendship. It will help them understand where you are coming from, and they might be more considerate when you are around that person.


Make the conversation as nice and gentle as possible. “I know this is probably uncomfortable for you, I feel uneasy about it, too. I just want to be open and honest with you.”Tell your friend how you feel about other person in the nicest way possible. “I'm not Sarah's biggest fan, we've never really gotten along well.”
Try to explain to your friend why you and that person don't get along. If there was an event that occurred, let your friend in on it. “I guess it comes from that whole situation between Sarah, Emily, and I, last summer...”;
, Try instead refocusing your thinking to the present time you are spending with your friend. Utilizing mindfulness techniques will help you to train your brain to stay in the moment and to refocus when your thoughts drift to the other person.Come Back: When you catch yourself thinking about the other person that you dislike, or feeling anxious or jealous, think or say to yourself “Come back,” take a deep breath, and focus on what is happening right now.
Attentive Listening: Look into your friends eyes and really listen to what they are saying. Notice the tone of their voice, the way they laugh, or how their face changes as they talk. This will help you feel more connected to your friend and focus on the moment.Speaking Mindfully: Fully consider the impact your words can have on the other person. Think about how you would feel if what you are saying were said to you. Ask yourself if you are being truly honest in your communication., Try to let your friend know how you feel about your friendship and any feelings you may be having about the other person's impact on your friendship. The more honest you are with them, the more honest they can be with you. It's also important for you to communicate how you feel.You might try something like the following:


”I don't want to make a big deal out of this, but our friendship is important to me.”
”I'm worried that my feelings about Sarah are going to affect our friendship.”
”I'm not trying to tell you who to be friends with, I just don't want this to come between us.”

, Empathy is trying to understand and feel someone else's experience from their point of view.Use empathy to recognize that it is probably very difficult for your friend. They are stuck in between two friends who don't get along, but ideally would like to stay friends with both.


Practice empathy by making empathic responses that are validating, sympathetic, caring, and supportive. “I am so sorry, it has to be frustrating to be stuck in the middle. How can I help?”Avoid non-empathic responses that are impatient, invalidating, self-centered, uncaring, un-supportive, or demanding. “Don't freak out, you shouldn't feel that way. Here's what I want you to do.”, Positive reframing is a technique where you notice negative events or maladaptive thoughts and make an effort to change them much like putting a picture in a new frame. Positive reframing will not change the situation, but it can change how you react to it and how you feel about it.Use this as a chance to learn by asking, “What can I learn from this that will help me grow?”
Challenge the assumptions or beliefs behind some thoughts you might be having such as, “They are hanging out because my friend likes her more than me.”
Use different wording, change “I really hate her” to “I'm not a fan of that girl” or “Maybe she is really struggling right now.”, If at all possible, avoid talking about the person you hate behind their back or gossiping about them.It's immature, mean, and will make you look like the bad guy.Gossip can be harmful to you, your friend, or the group as a whole.Gossip can be a form of exclusion or bullying.
It can destroy your friends trust in you.
It can prompt others to gossip about you.

Give yourselves a cooling-off period.,
Try talking after a few days have elapsed.,
Be patient.,
Accept your friend’s decision if they want to end the friendship.",How to Cope With a Fight with a Friend1," If you had a big blow-up, it is probably best that you take a break from each other for a few days to calm down and reduce your anger levels. This will also give you both a chance to reflect on the situation, your motives, and your emotions. You’ll be able to talk to each other much better when you are both less upset.If you hang out in the same circle of friends, continue spending time with them, but only when your friend will not be there. Even if you have calmed down, there will still be some tension between the two of you until the matter is resolved, which may make your other friends uncomfortable.
Don’t text or communicate through social media. If it is upsetting to you, consider hiding your friend’s posts from your feeds until the two of you have cleared the air.;
, Once you feel calmer, take the initiative to approach your friend and try to talk. Understand that your friend might not be ready to talk yet, and respect that they may need some extra time.


You could say, “Hey, I was wondering if we could talk about the other day. I was pretty mad but have calmed down now. Are you ready to talk?”
If your friend says no, say you understand. Give them a few more days and then try again.

, Understand it may take a while for your friend to come around, particularly if the fight was your fault. Each time you check in with your friend, you could start the process of apologizing to them.


You could say, “I know you’re not ready to talk to me yet, but I do want you to know that I’m really sorry I said those things that caused our fight. I hope you can forgive me. Please let me know when you’re ready to talk.”

, You may talk to your friend directly about their desire to end the friendship, you may find out through another friend that your friend wants to end your relationship, or your friend may just continue to avoid you. You could try to talk to the friend about it, but if they refuse, you may need to let it go.Losing a friend can be painful. It’s okay to be sad and grieve the loss of your friendship. Spend time with your other friends, and talk to someone you trust about how you are feeling. You could also take up a new activity with new opportunities to meet people, to help yourself stay busy.
Remain polite to your friend and say hello to them when you see them. Respect your friend’s need for distance, and don’t try to force your way back into your friend’s life.
The close nature of your relationship may change, but you may find that in time you can talk to one another again. You may even be able to rekindle your friendship at some point down the road. Friendships grow and change with age and life, just like people do."

Reflect on your recent mood and feelings.,

Remember that you can't control the behavior of others.,
Arrange to meet with your friends.It's important to plan your confrontation ahead of time.,
Ask questions and listen.,
Explain the situation from your point of view.,
Apologize if you're in the wrong.,

Continue with the friendship or move on.",How to Confront Friends Who Are Ignoring You," Figure out what's going on inside of you and how you are feeling.It's important that you determine whether your friends are in fact ignoring you or whether you are thinking that they're ignoring you. It's possible that the situation may have more to do with you and how you've been feeling in recent days than with your friends.









Consider whether you've experienced any significant changes in your life or stressful events, such as moving, starting a new school, breaking up with someone, or coping with an illness in your family, among other possible events. Stress in one area of your life can have an impact on other areas. For example, if you've recently changed schools, maybe you feel isolated from your friends because you don't know anyone at your new school and you no longer see them every day, even if you've still been in touch through texting. Your feelings of isolation, thus, may be related and a reaction to other things going on in your life.
Make sure that the root of your feelings is the sense of being ignored. In other words, make sure the feeling of being ignored is at the root of the issue and is not a symptom of something else you might be dealing with.
To connect with yourself and tap into your emotions, try exercising, keeping a journal or talking to another person you trust like a friend or family member. The most important thing is that you move from your current physical position and do something else. Changing positions and spaces can bring about a shift in your mental state and give you fresh energy for some much-needed reflection.;
, It's possible that your friends may be going through something else in their lives that is affecting their friendships. Thus, they may not be intentionally ignoring you, but instead, are distracted by their own issues and unable to focus on you or give you a lot of their time.









Compare how much you and your friend used to interact with how much you've been interacting lately. Is it a drastic change? Also, compare how much you and your friend interact with how much she interacts with mutual friends or her own friends. Is she frequently hanging out with others but not able to make plans with or talk to you?
Consider whether your friend has recently experienced a life-changing event (e.g., the divorce of her parents, a death in the family, depression, etc.) that may be impacting her ability to stay connected to friends.
Reflect on your previous interactions and see if any situations come to mind in which there may have been tension between you and your friend. Is it possible that your friend may be feeling offended or hurt by something you said or did? Did you say something behind her back that you knew you shouldn't? Did you make an insensitive joke or comment? It's possible that you may have offended your friend or hurt her feelings and that she is distancing herself from you for a while.

, You only have control over yourself and your own actions.You can't force anyone to hang out with or talk to you; you can control, however, how you react to the situation with your friends and how you decide to respond to it.








No man is an island, and everyone needs social support and engaging friendships to stay healthy and happy. However, all too often people rely on others to affirm their own sense of self-worth. Instead, try to let your feelings of self-worth come from within, from your own assessments of your behavior. What matters at the end of the day is how you feel about the things you have done. You're the one who has to live with yourself., Get in touch with your friends and ask them to meet you in a safe, private, and quiet environment that is good for talking, such as a cafe or classroom. Try to find a neutral space for the people you are confronting; don't invite them to your home, for example.








Think ahead of how you will approach your friends and what you will ask or say to them. Try also to anticipate how they may respond. You know your friends, so you can probably make a pretty good guess as to how they might react. The goal is to prepare yourself mentally and emotionally for the confrontation; don't dwell over each possible reaction your friends might have., Stop and allow your friends to explain the situation. Seek first to understand first, and then be understood. Be specific in your phrasing and give precise examples of the behavior you want to discuss. For example, you could try asking them, ""I noticed you all went out on Friday. You said you were going to text me about the plans. Why didn't you?""










Actively Listen as the other people explain.Maintain steady eye contact, keep your body turned towards them, and keep your arms and legs open, rather than crossed.
Your friends' responses may surprise you -- and they may also help relieve your stress! For instance, you may discover that they simply forgot to text you and that nothing hurtful or malicious was intended. Or perhaps they got kept at work and thought it was too late to get in touch with you.
It's also possible that your friends' responses may be less straightforward. For example, maybe they let you know about the difficulties going on in their own lives. Or, in the worst case scenario, perhaps they simply have no excuses and have been deliberately ignoring you. This is hard to hear, but in the long term, you'll be glad you confronted them and heard the truth.

, State facts as facts and interpretation as your point of view and perception of the situation.Let your friends know how the situation made you feel and how you interpreted their actions. Be straightforward and use ""I""-language to avoid the blame game. Examples of ""I""-statements include: ""I feel"", ""I am upset by"" and ""I am confused about"".








For example, try saying ""When I didn't get a text on Friday night, it made me feel like you didn't want me to come and were deliberating leaving me out.""
Be honest about your feelings. But keep in mind that being clear about the issues at hand does not mean you have to be hard on the person. Focus on the issues, not the person specifically.Keep calm and don't let your emotions overtake you. If you feel like you are getting angry, upset, and unable to think clearly, then consider leaving the discussion and returning to it at another point. You don't want to say anything you'll regret later because you lose your cool. In addition, if your friend begins to get angry or aggressive, it's best that you leave the situation before it escalates.

, If you're being ignored because you hurt someone's feelings, then include a genuine apology when it's your turn to speak. Make sure to explain precisely what are you are apologizing for and avoid apologizing for how they interpreted your action, rather than the action itself.









For example, if you had stated that your friend's job was stupid and that you'd never work there in a million years, don't just say ""I'm sorry that you were offended by my comments about your work."" This is considered a ""non-apology apology"" because it does not admit anything wrong with the comments themselves and also suggests that the person may have been too thin-skinned in taking offense in the first place. Instead, say, ""I'm sorry I made those comments about your job. Those were offensive and hurtful. I know you're working really hard to pay for school, so that was insensitive of me."", Coming to a resolution together is usually the best option because sometimes what works well for one person may not work for another. It may be as simple as making a promise with your friends to schedule more get-togethers or write down reminders so no one gets left out or forgotten. Be sure to tailor the solution to the particular situation and the reason for the isolation. For example:









If your friend has been isolating you because of a particular situation in her life, give her time and space to work through her own emotional issues. Be sure to let her know (via email, text, or a phone call) that you're available whenever she feels ready to talk. Do not put added pressure on your friend by insisting on hanging out; rather, reach out to her by letting her know that you miss her and value your friendship. As the saying goes, 90% of life is just showing up, or, in this case, making yourself available when your friend needs you.If you've been feeling ignored because of something you're going through, as determined in Part I, then let your friend know what you're going through and discuss ways in which you can maintain the friendship while you deal with this particular moment in your life. For example, if you've been really busy helping your mom due to her illness and haven't been able to see your friends recently, ask if they'd like to come over one day so that you can both be at home with your mom and fit some needed time with friends into your schedule.

, It is possible that the solution may be a difficult one. In some cases, friends outgrow one another.Thus, if your friends confirm that they've been ignoring you because you just don't have as much in common together, it may be time to let those friendships go. If your friends don't validate your feelings or try to work out a way to improve the situation or the friendship, chances are that it's because they don't want to. Though it's a hard lesson to face in life, our friendship groups do change over time.The good thing is that there is a whole world out there where you can make new friends!

Be cautious when your child says that the other person was a bully and they themselves didn't do anything. The more information you have and understand, the better informed you'll be when talking with your friend.


If you were present when the friend's child bullied your kid, make sure to correct the bully immediately so they understand what they're doing is not acceptable.
If you weren't present when your child was bullied by your friend's child, try to get more specific details about what the bullying child was doing, and what your child was doing at the time. Avoid overreacting if your child says something like, ""I don't like hanging out at their house. He's mean. He keeps bullying me."" You need to get the specifics of what this means.
Keep in mind that it might be possible for your child to handle this on their own depending on their age and on the situation.;
, If the roles were reversed and your friend came to you about your child, think about how you might respond. As a parent, you may naturally want to defend your child and their actions. The same may be true of your friend.Be thoughtful about what you do. Think before you act.
Avoid confronting your friend when you're very upset. For delicate matters about bullying, you need to be calm and level-headed.
You may want to work with a close friend or family member to help you develop your strategy. Just make sure not to do this publicly, such as on social media, and do not engage in gossip.

, Some friends are closer than others. Have you been close friends for many years, or have you just been friends for the last few months? The length and strength of the relationship may impact how you confront your friend.Closer or lifelong friendships may allow for more openness and brutal honesty. Consider whether you feel comfortable talking about bullying in a direct way because of your friendship.
Friends of friends, or recent friendships may require more subtlety when talking about a child's bullying behavior. You may feel like this could change the nature of the friendship.
Think about whether or not you have had other conflicts or difficult conversations with this friend in the past. Consider how they went and what you might do differently this time.

, Figure out if you still want to be friends with someone whose child is a bully. Most likely, if it's a meaningful friendship or a person you see on a regular basis through work or family, you'll want to find ways to make the friendship work. If the friend is becoming just as mean as their child, you may want to stay away.Consider having one-on-one time with your friend, rather than interacting in groups or with the kids present. Try to show some compassion, and figure out how to be helpful to your friend rather than mean yourself.
Don't take your child along on visits to your friend's home or where the friend's child may be present.

, This is the best way to avoid miscommunication. It provides both sides with the opportunity to speak. Be aware that your friend may not react as you expect, so be prepared.


Focus on talking with your friend one-on-one first, without getting your child or the friend's child immediately involved.
Be prepared for your friend to possibly act defensive. Your friend may be caught off-guard.
For example, say, ""I hope that we can sit down and talk for a little bit. I wanted to talk with you about our kids.""

, Some people want to avoid confrontation. You may feel like it's too awkward to talk directly with your friend about what's happening. Consider a less direct approach.Though not in person, phone calls allow for back-and-forth dialogue. Consider scheduling a time to talk when it's convenient for both you and your friend.
Emails are the least direct way to confront your friend about their child's bullying behaviors. At the same time, emails allow for the respondent to process what is said and have more time to respond back.
Avoid texting back and forth with your friend about bullying. Texting is for short, brief information, not long discussions.

, When confronting your friend, focus on giving just the facts of the situation. While bullying incidents can be emotionally upsetting, it likely won't help you or your friend if you go into the conversation already upset.Present the facts of the situation, including the who, what, where, and when. The more detail you can provide about a specific incident, the less it will feel like an open-ended blame game.
Avoid using the terms “bully” and “bullying when you talk with your friend. These terms may put your friend on the defensive. Also, make sure to use the children’s names rather than saying “your child” and “my child.”

, Bullying is unacceptable, regardless of whose child it is that's doing the bullying. But it's important to make your friend feel that the conversation isn't about assigning blame and punishment. The discussion should be about how to move forward in a healthy way.


Talk with your friend about the importance of both your child and your friendship with them. Make it clear that you're not trying to make drama or get into a big fight. Try to enlist their help as a collaborator. For example, say something like, ""Any idea what we should do about this situation?"" This will help to avoid a “me against them” mentality.
Understand that punishing another person's child can be a tricky thing. If your child was bullied at school, there may be certain school policies in place. Otherwise, if your child was bullied at your friend's home, it may be up to your friend to make the call about punishment.

, Ask your friend if they have noticed any changes in their child's behavior. Discuss any concerns you have personally seen in the child's behavior, regardless of the bullying. Be empathetic to your friend and their child.Rather than making your friend feel judged, listen to what may be worrying your friend about their own children. They may also be concerned about what to do regarding their child's behaviors.
Offer emotional support if it seems like your friend is going through a difficult time with their children or life in general. You might even want to prompt them to think about any factors that might be affecting their child’s behavior. Let them know that you are willing to listen if they want to share, but do not pry.

, If your friend is open to your help and advice, find ways to collaborate and support one another. Parenting is tough, and sometimes parents with mean or unruly children are the sweetest people themselves. Help to show them alternative parenting methods without criticizing them.Get their perspective on what is and is not bullying.
Ask them about what methods they use for discipline, and what has worked and not worked in the past. You might also want to have a book recommendation ready or the phone number of the school counselor at your children’s school. It might be easier for them to talk with a third party and get advice than to hear it from you.
Be reassuring when possible that you want to help and support, rather than criticize and judge.

, Avoid getting angry or interrupting your friend each time they say something that you disagree with. They may not have the same approach or beliefs about their child or bullying, but getting upset won't help to resolve the situation.


Give them an opportunity to talk. When they talk, you'll be able to see if they are interested in change or not. The more that they seem open to other perspectives, the more opportunities you have work on the situation with them.
If you feel yourself getting upset, or wanting to constantly correct them, step away for a moment. You may need to talk with them at a later point when you're calmer. For example say, ""I'm sorry but I need to take a moment. I hope that we can talk about this later today or tomorrow when I'm more ready.""
Keep in mind that your friend might need some time to process this new, upsetting information. Make sure to keep the lines of communication open and let them know that you are there for them if they would like to talk.
be careful with your response if they make accusations about your child. It is important to avoid getting upset and to lead by example.

, Sometimes you can't change other people's behavior, or their children's. They could be in denial, or are on the defensive, about what their child is doing. Even if you talk in the most calm and comforting way with your friend, you may not get through to them or their children.Set boundaries for yourself, your child, and your friend. If you feel like there's no resolution after confronting your friend, think about ways to limit your interactions between your child and your friend's child.
Understand that each person will handle their children and family life differently. Be cautious of passing judgment about others. Instead, focus on making a safe and protective space for your children that is understanding of others.
Keep in mind that it is okay to feel hurt if your concerns were dismissed. Make sure to take some time to grieve the changing relationship or loss of friendship.

, If your conversation with your friend has reached a stand-still, or continues to fester unresolved, you may want to find someone who can help to facilitate the conversation.


Talk with a mutual friend who may be able to help. The other friend could sit-in on the conversation with your friend about the bullying. They could help you stay calm and focused, as well as help to make your friend feel less judged.
If you and your friend have mutual family members or a common place of worship, you may want to get family members or religious leaders involved to help with the dialogue.
Find people that can help to mediate or counsel rather than make your friend feel judged or alienated.

, If the bullying incident happens in school, day care center, or other child-centered place, it may be best to speak with the staff there about the situation. Be sure to let them know that you tried to resolve the matter on your own and that it did not go well. This may help them to avoid escalating the situation unintentionally. Depending on the severity of the incident, you may also want to report the incident to the local police.


While some bullying may be a matter of saying mean or nasty words, other bullying could involve physical harm or injury to a child. Be vigilant when a child's life may be in danger.
Help to ensure the safety of your child and other people's children by notifying the school staff or other child care centers about behavior that could lead to future injury.

Reflect on your behavior.",How to Cope With a Fight with a Friend2," Don’t try to pull mutual friends into your disagreement and try to get them to take your side. Be the bigger person.


If your friends ask you what happened, you could say, “I don’t want to talk about it right now,” or “That’s between Kate and me.” Don’t unload on mutual friends about your frustrations; you may end up pressuring them to take sides. While it may be tempting to feel like you have allies in your fight with your friend, think about how it would feel if the roles were reversed., Don’t talk about your friend behind their back. Gossip usually has a way of getting back to its subject matter. You may make your fight even bigger and more painful.If someone gossips to you about the friend you are fighting with, you could say, “I don’t want to gossip about her right now. I don’t want to make our fight worse.”

, If you need to vent about the situation, talk to someone who is not in your social circle. Better yet, take it outside your everyday social setting. Find someone who goes to a different school or a friend who lives far away to chat with.


You could say, “Do you mind listening to me vent about something I’m dealing with at my school right now? I know you don’t know these people, but I could use an outside perspective.”

, Even if you’re not getting along, you can still be nice toward your friend. Treat your friend like you would treat someone you don’t know very well: distant, but respectful.


You may be forced to interact with your friend at some point, whether it is working together on a project or attending the same party. Stick to the business at hand. If you want to talk about your disagreement, find another time to do it. If your friend tries to bring up your fight, you could say something like, “We’re here to celebrate Jesse’s birthday. Let’s talk about this later.”

, While it may feel good to get under your friend’s skin, it’s not a very mature way to respond. Just act normal and do your best to prevent causing more drama.


Trying to make someone jealous makes you appear insecure. It also makes you place unnecessary importance on what someone else thinks of you.Avoid showing off around the friend you are fighting with, like you are having so much more fun without them.

, Don’t let the fight with your friend get in the way of your relationships with other friends. Try to get on with your social life as best you can.


Hang out with your friends even if the friend you’re fighting with is there. You can think of some ways to avoid the friend you’re fighting with, like standing away from them or striking up a separate conversation with another friend. It can feel awkward, but you don’t have to put your whole social life on hold because one person is upset with you.
If your friend has turned others against you, you may be feeling isolated. Stand up for yourself without trying to turn others against your friend. You could find a friend you are close with and say, “I know Laura has told you about our fight and now you’re mad at me, too. I didn’t want to talk about it because I didn’t want people to feel like they had to choose sides. But if you want to hear my side of the story, I will tell you.” In this situation, it might be best to start building a new circle of friends.

, If it’s been difficult to hang out in your normal group of friends because of your fight, you may want to look outside your usual circle for other social opportunities. You might choose to make new friends or grow closer to acquaintances.Make plans with friends in other circles, perhaps others you don’t hang out with as much. For example, maybe you’re friends with people on your athletic team, but don’t hang out with them much outside of practice. Try to get together with them off the field.

Make some new friends by participating in new activities and meeting new people. If your friends have turned against you and are unwilling to hear your side of the story, you might want to start hanging out with other people instead., Spend some time thinking about the fight and your role in it. Could you have done anything differently to prevent the fight from happening? Did you exhibit behavior that routinely causes you problems?If you see a pattern of behavior in your life that contributed to the fight with your friend, consider examining that behavior more closely and taking steps to change it. For example, perhaps you contributed to the fight by blurting out some hurtful words before you really thought them through. If you have a history of speaking before thinking, you might want to look into ways you could address that problem and prevent future, similar situations from happening.
You could spend some time writing in a journal about your thoughts and feelings.
Talk to another friend or someone you trust about how you are feeling. Maybe that person can offer their own perspective on your situation."

Be open to hearing your friend’s concerns.,
Acknowledge their feelings.,
Write a note.",How to Cope With a Fight with a Friend3," Once you and your friend have calmed down and both feel ready to talk about what happened, set aside some time to talk. Find a place and time when you can discuss your issues privately.You could say, “Hey, do you have a few minutes after school to talk alone?”

, Conversations about a fight are never fun, and can make both people feel upset, uncomfortable, or angry. Do your best to remain calm.


Speak in a calm, quiet voice. This will help you both stay calm, making you both better able to listen to each other without getting defensive.
If you find yourself getting angry again, take a few deep breaths. If you feel unable to control your anger, you could say, “I’m sorry, I thought I was ready to talk about this. I guess I need a few more days.”

, Shoulder your share of the blame and apologize for your role in the fight. Most likely, you are not blameless, and have something you can apologize for. Apologies can be difficult, but don't ignore the fact that you did something that hurt someone you care about, even if it seems small.You could say, “I’m really sorry we got into that fight the other day. I realize that I said things that really hurt your feelings. I was angry, but that doesn’t give me the right to be hurtful. I’m so sorry I upset you.”
When you apologize, make sure you take responsibility for how your behavior hurt your friend. For example, “I’m sorry that I hurt your feelings,” acknowledges responsibility, but “I’m sorry if I hurt your feelings,” makes it sound like you don’t acknowledge that your behavior was wrong.Tell your friend how you will change your behavior, so your friend doesn’t need to be concerned you will do it again. For example, “I didn’t realize how making fun of you like that would really hurt your feelings, but now I understand why it did. I promise I won’t joke about that again.”, Don’t be defensive. When your friend confronts you, listen with an open mind to try to understand where they are coming from.If your friend says, “When you told me you wanted to spend more time with Brian, I was really hurt,” you could say, “I get how that could make you upset, and I wish I hadn’t said it.” Do not respond defensively with something like, “Well, when you started dating Mark you ignored me for two months!”
You could say, “I’m glad you told me your side, so I could understand better. I want to respond to one thing you said, though….” and respond respectfully to your friend’s point of view.

, Try to see your actions from their perspective and acknowledge their point of view. Show empathy to their perspective. It will help your friend feel listened to and understood.You could say something like, “I understand why my behavior made you feel that way. I shouldn’t have ignored you and made you feel unimportant.”

, If you are having a hard time talking to your friend (whether you are too nervous, or your friend doesn’t want to talk to you), you could write a note apologizing and explaining your feelings. Remember that talking face-to-face is best to avoid further misunderstanding.Remember to remain polite and respectful in your letter, just as you would be talking to your friend in person.
You could write, “I wanted to write you a letter to let you know how sorry I am about what happened. I want to explain my side, but I also understand why you are angry with me.”

Explain to each friend that you are still friends with both of them.Even though they may not like the other, it is not fair to either friend that you end your friendships just because they do not get along.,

Focus on the behavior, not the character.,
Be kind.,
Discover the sources of the conflict.Why do your friends dislike one another?,
Explain how their conflict hurts you.,
Mediate the dispute.,
Be patient.,
Come to a resolution.",How to Be Friends With Two People That Hate Each Other," Continue to spend time with both friends just as you would have before. Their conflict should not affect their treatment of you or your treatment of them.


Be honest with your friends.Tell them that because you care about and respect both of them, and do not want their conflict to have a negative impact on you, you will remain friends with each of them.
Do not show favoritism to either friend. For instance, do not sever ties with one friend at the behest of the other, or due to your own inability to remain neutral in the conflict. Do not spend more time with one than with the other. A good friend will spend equal time with each friend, despite the conflict between them.;
, When your friends ask you to take their side, or insist on an explanation as to why you will not support them against the other friend, stay firm.Remind them that you deserve to make your own decisions about your relationships and will not be pressured to do otherwise. Do not give in to threats or intimidation.


If Sam says “If you do not side with me and stop spending time with Armin, we will not be friends any longer,” relay your disappointment but stand your ground. Sam, like you, has choices to make about how he acts toward his friends and how much he values your company. If he chooses to give you up as a friend, it’s best to let him do so, as his actions reflect that he doesn't care for you as a friend should.
If your friend will not respect your decision and continues to pressure you into denouncing the other friend, or insisting that you agree with them, it might be best to limit contact with that individual.Let them know why, suggesting that “I look forward to spending time with you again when you are willing to accept my neutrality in this matter. I hope you understand that my decision to stay neutral is final.”
Choosing healthy, positive relationships means choosing friends who listen to and understand your point of view. If your friend cannot do so, they are failing as a friend. Let them know how you feel by saying “I’m sorry you cannot see my point of view. I feel that my decision is not being respected.”
Respect must be given as well as received. Be respectful to your friends who are in conflict. Do not pressure them into spending time together or reconciling before they are ready. Similarly, do not accuse them of being petty or stupid for fighting at all.

, Let them speak their minds.Allowing them to express their feelings can be cathartic. Knowing that someone has listened to, acknowledged and understood them can help them get over the conflict, or realize they were wrong.


Remember, listening to your friend is not the same as validating or agreeing with their point of view. If Sam starts ragging on Armin (or vice versa), insist that you are not taking sides, but you are glad to hear he is thinking about the problem between him and Armin. If Sam asks for your agreement, suggest that “If you feel that way, you should let Armin know. I am your friend as much as his, and I won’t take sides in this conflict.”
To start listening, stop talking. You cannot listen when you are constantly interjecting your point of view or telling the speaker they are wrong.
Put the speaker at ease with calming body language. Sitting down, putting your hands in your lap, and smiling go a long way toward creating a positive sharing environment.Be patient when listening. Do not interrupt your friend when they speak. Not everyone can quickly and concisely summarize their feelings or point of view.
Think about what the speaker is saying. Ask yourself if you agree or disagree and why.
Follow up on what your friend said later; perhaps you can help him or her find a new perspective by asking them to clarify what they believe. Responding constructively to what your friend says will show them you care about their point of view.

, Never engage in criticism of your own. Even if you get mad at a friend for making acerbic comments, don’t lash out at them.Creating more conflicts will not resolve the dispute between your two friends, and may even make the dispute worse.


If you feel yourself becoming frustrated with your friend, excuse yourself. Say something like “I am frustrated by the way you are speaking. Let’s continue this conversation later.”
Try deep breathing techniques; slowly repeating a mantra or a relaxing phrase (“I am cerulean blue; I am a cool breeze”); or envision a peaceful scene such as a pine forest or snow-capped mountaintop.Don’t act defensively if your friend starts blaming you or name-calling for your decision to remain friends with the other individual. Stay cool. Do not become angry just because he or she is angry. The problem is their attitude and perception, not you. Do not take their insults or bad attitude personally. Use humor to defuse a tense situation. If you or your friend are getting really worked up over the conflict between your two friends, try to make a joke of the situation. Do not be sarcastic or caustic with your humor. Rather, employ some self-deprecation and a congenial tone to reevaluate the situation you and your two friends are in.

, If one friend asks you to pass a message on to the other, tell them they should bring it to the other friend directly. Instead of acting as a go-between, instruct your friend(s) to give you more information about what they want to say, and offer to help them find a great way to say it.Acting as the messenger for one or another of the warring parties may bias the other against you.
Sam might, for instance, suppose that you were half-hearted or insincere in your extension of the peace offering or apology to Armin if Armin does not accept the offer of reconciliation.
Emphasize to both friends that reconciliation can only occur when both are willing to speak to each other directly and honestly.Apologizing, forgiving, and trust-building can only be accomplished via direct communication between the two individuals involved in the conflict.Once these are achieved, the conflict often takes on a new dimension as the parties work towards a resolution.

, If one of them asks you to, or tries to make you feel guilty enough to do so, simply refuse. Say, ""Hey, this is between you guys. I'm Switzerland.""


Do not intervene in the substance of the dispute. When the subject is raised, try to change the direction of the conversation to something different. If you friend insists on speaking about it, let him or her do so, then remind them that you cannot support or takes sides in their conflict.
Typically, neutrality indicates that you are disinterested in the results of the conflict or the parties involved.However, as a friend of both parties, you may rightly have an interest in their conflict and hope they will resolve it amicably. There is no problem with this desire, since it is what good friends wish for one another.

, Cultivating mindfulness can make you more aware of your own thoughts and biases. Mindfulness is a quality which instills peace of mind and a positive attitude in those who possess it, especially when they're making tough decisions or dealing with stressful situations.If you are mindful, you will be more aware of your feelings about the conflict between your two friends who hate each other. This can help you remain objective and neutral. You can gain mindfulness through yoga, tai chi, or mediation.


Mindfulness requires three skills:Awareness. This means being alive to the moment and the things going on around you. When you are talking with your friends, enjoy their company. Do not dwell on the conflict between them since it is not occurring at that moment. Think about how much you enjoy being with them.
Responsibility. Responsibility requires a kind and generous attitude toward yourself and others. In a conflict between two friends, this means you should do what’s best for both parties involved. Empathize with each, speak and act without preference or judgment, and remain neutral.
Effort. This means acting on your awareness and responsibility. When two friends are fighting and you wish to remain neutral, making a big effort to do so will be difficult. You can continue to be neutral and build mindfulness by acknowledging that you are in a difficult position but must stay the course for the good of yourself and your friends.


Neutrality can seem like an impossibility. Everyone has biases, both conscious and unconscious. Being more aware of yours will help you overcome these biases.

, Some people will not be willing to hear the truth no matter what.Think about your friend’s personality in order to gauge whether informing them of your true feelings is a good idea.


Are they willing to accept criticism? Do they readily admit to being wrong when confronted with compelling evidence? Do they take responsibility for their actions when wrong? If so, sharing the truth with your friend is a good idea and will likely make a positive change.
If, conversely, your friend is frequently defensive and shifts blame onto others when confronted with evidence of his or her shortcomings, your honest efforts at helping them see that they were in error will be wasted.
In the case of a defensive friend, try to broach the subject in a variety of ways. If they don’t understand that what they did was wrong the first time you explain it, maybe they need to hear it a different way. Perhaps the first time you broach the subject, you’re indirect: “Do you think that what you said to Sam was kind?” If they blow you off, make a stronger declaration next time: “You were very rude to Sam. He deserves an apology.”

, Do not try to qualify your point of view by agreeing half-heartedly to your friend’s insistence that the other person is wrong. Do not begin with a statement of praise before delivering the reality-check that your friend is in the wrong. Finally, do not employ phrases like “With all due respect” or “No offense, but...” Be direct and honest in your evaluation of your friend and explain why he or she is wrong.For example, if Sam called Armin stupid directly or indirectly, and Armin (rightfully) refuses to hang out Sam, you should tell Sam “It was unkind and wrong of you to call Armin stupid. You owe him/her an apology . That’s the best way to put this conflict behind you.”
Do not cover up your feelings of disappointment or frustration. When you fail to express yourself to the person you have negative feelings toward, the feelings remain trapped, which leads to further frustration. You may experience a building sense of resentment, apathy, detachment, and disdain, either generally or towards the friend who you didn’t confess your feelings towards.To avoid the buildup of negative feelings, let the friend whose behavior you disapprove of know immediately.
You may worry that your friend will be displeased when you admit you do not support their previous action or offense against your other friend. This fear is unjustified, since openness and honesty between friends can strengthen the friendship.

, Remind your friend that while they should not have spoken to, treated, or badmouthed your other friend in the way they did, you know they are still a good person.Emphasize to your wrong friend that they made a mistake, and that they can and should make amends.


Don’t make assumptions or generalizations about your friend’s personality. For instance, do not say “You don’t know how to deal with people.” Instead, say “You spoke rudely to Sam, and that was wrong.”
Emphasize that he or she can change.Encourage your friend to stay aware of how he or she might cause offense and avoid doing so in the future.
If your friend has difficulty changing a particular antagonistic or confrontational behavior, advise them to consult a therapist. Cognitive behavioral therapy is especially useful in transforming negative behaviors. This type of therapy encourages individuals to actively consider their evaluation and processing of certain situations in order to help them adjust their emotions and behavior.
Ask your friend how you can help. Suggest that in the future, you point out similar behaviors in a nonjudgmental way., Offer criticism in a gentle way. Do not call your friend names or raise your voice when explaining why you feel they are in the wrong.Conversely, do not shut them out or give them the silent treatment. Communicating your point of view in a healthy way will prevent the situation from escalating, and your friend might be more understanding of the person they were originally in conflict with when they hear your perspective.


Remember that the conflict between your two friends is not the end of the world. It is only one part of your whole friendship with each of them.
Understand that both you and your friend(s) may have valid points. Sometimes agreeing to disagree is the best option. Tell your friend(s) “I would have handled the situation differently, but I see where you are coming from.”
When discussing sensitive issues with your friend like the conflict between him/her and another individual, be discrete.Do not bring it up in large social situations where others who are unaware of the conflict might learn of it or weigh in without understanding all the facts.
Friends should always be sensitive to each others feelings. Do not employ shame, blame, or a judgmental tone when speaking to your friend about the conflict.

, There might be one reason or many. Your friends may not get along because one or the other of them acted badly. Whatever the cause(s), identifying them is the first step toward resolution.Ask each friend why the conflict began. Let's say you have two friends, Armin and Sam. Ask Sam why he dislikes Armin. Maybe Sam doesn't really have a reason, but just feels vaguely uncomfortable or uneasy around Armin. Go to Armin next. Repeat your question. From Armin, you learn that at some point, Sam said something that hurt Armin's feelings, or made him feel insulted. Maybe they had an argument over something. Whatever the case may be, armed with a basic understanding of the problem, you can try to work with them to resolve it.Sometimes your friends may not tell you why the conflict began. Perhaps they both said or did something wrong and are afraid, ashamed, or embarrassed to share it with you. In this case, with the permission of your friends, you might try to enlist the help of a third party trained in conflict management to investigate why the conflict between your friends began.Many conflicts are caused by simple misunderstandings.Perhaps Sam failed to remember Armin’s birthday; perhaps he thought Armin badmouthed him behind his back. Helping your friends identify the roots of their conflict can empower them to move past it.

, When your friends fight, you’re put in a difficult, and often stressful, position. After all, you must constantly watch what you say, choose how to balance your time, and endure hearing negative comments about one from the mouth of the other. If your friends understand this, they will be more willing to bury the hatchet.


Not talking about negative emotions like frustration, emotional hurt, or disappointment will only enlarge them. Talking to your friends about your feelings on their conflict is important not only for its potential to speed their swift resolution but for its ability to give you good mental health.If your friend is a narcissist who does not care about your feelings, and is unable to concern themselves with your feelings and point of view, don’t bother sharing them with that friend. You can detect a narcissist by listening to their response when you share your own perspective. For instance, you may explain to Sam that you feel stressed by his fight with Armin. If Sam replies that he, too feels stressed and does not appear to be acknowledging the psychic pain you’re experiencing, Sam is a classic narcissist. Limit spending your valuable time with such a person.
Do not blame or attack when expressing how you feel.Use “I” statements rather than “you” statements. In other words, instead of saying “You’re very inconsiderate and it stresses me out,” say “I feel very stressed by this whole situation.” Where the former sentence is accusatory and will inspire the listener to defend him or herself, the latter sentence is explanatory and personal, and engages the listener in dialogue.If you have a hard time giving voice to what you feel, write it out before addressing your friends. This will allow you to explain yourself more fully without dealing the the pressure that sometimes comes from a face-to-face meeting.

, When you mediate a situation, you act as a referee, trying to get the two of them to bring their problems and concerns out in the open with the goal of reconciliation. It can be a challenge, but is well worth it when two people who hate each other are finally able to set aside their anger and hate.


Bring both people to a neutral location. Do not meet in either of their homes. The one on ""home turf"" may feel they are the boss, and the one who is not will feel ill at ease. Private rooms in a library or school are good options.
Thank them both for meeting each other with the intent to settle their differences. Let them know that they are both important to you and you want to see them patch things up.
Lay the ground rules: interrupting each other, name-calling, yelling, and other emotional outbursts are forbidden. Insist each party acts with mutual respect and remains open-minded.Without these basic guidelines in place, the process could easily deteriorate into a shouting contest.
Encourage each party to speak their minds. Ensure the other listens carefully to the opposing perspective. If either side feels they are not being heard or the mediation effort is futile, they will not invest themselves in the process and it will be fruitless for all three of you.Illustrate to them how similar they are.Find the common ground between them -- especially the fact that they are both friends of yours.
If it starts to turn ugly, put a stop to it. ""All right, all right,” you might say. “It's pretty plain to see that you guys are not going to be able to work this out today. I plan to remain friends with both of you, so I hope that you will try to be civil to one another in the future.""
If you do not believe you are unbiased enough to settle the dispute, identify and seek assistance from someone with the diplomatic skills who may be able to. A good conflict mediator will be neutral (evaluate the situation objectively); impartial (act without a stake in the outcome); and fair (approach each side in a balanced manner).Enlisting help of am unbiased third party who does not know either friend is a good idea if you do not want to mediate yourself.

, Don't expect them to patch up everything overnight.If the first mediation is unsuccessful, don’t give up. Use the experience to plan another one.


Talk to each individual about their thoughts after the first mediation session. If you detect a softening of attitude or tone in both or either party, suggest a follow-up mediation in another week or so.
Continue to offer your support and friendship to both, and if one or another of your friends broaches the subject, express your continued hope that a positive resolution can be found.
Do not try to pressure either party into accepting a resolution they are unhappy with.This will either break down the resolution process entirely or cause one (or both) friends to feel resentful at having been “forced” into a bad deal.

, Brainstorm some possible resolutions with the interested parties. Each individual should have some input. Look for win-win solutions where both individuals walk away happy. For instance, if the problem is that Sam felt snubbed because Armin didn’t invite him to his party, suggest that Armin invite Sam to his next party as the guest of honor.


With all the possibilities in front of you, consider the pros and cons of each. Print a spreadsheet outlining each possibility with the pros and cons and distribute one to each friend.
Keep both friends focused on finding an outcome. Continue to push them toward compromise and give each individual equal time to speak. Paraphrase and ask questions of each friend’s statements at regular intervals to ensure you are understanding them correctly. Give each a chance to modify what they have to say if any confusion arises.
A lasting resolution must address both the substantive and emotional issues.Substantive issues are objective facts which are not debatable. For instance, Armin crashed Sam’s car into a wall -- that’s a substantive issue and might be the central trigger which led to the conflict between them.
Sam felt betrayed and let down by Armin because he’d loaned Armin the car in good faith with the pledge that nothing would happen to it. Sam’s feelings of betrayal and disappointment are the emotional issues.


A resolution for a substantive issue, using the above example, might be Armin paying for the repairs to the damaged car. A resolution to the emotional issues might be Armin admitting his wrongdoing and apologizing to Sam, and Sam accepting that apology.
If one or the other of your friends won’t accept a resolution, return to the process of asking questions, listening to their reasoning, and understanding what their desires are. Listen to what they have to say and continue working with them toward a resolution."

Consider why you’ve chosen to stay a virgin.,
Understand that there is no rush.,
Recognize the risks you’ve avoided.,
Understand your own worth.",How to Cope With Being a Virgin when Your Friends Aren't1," Maybe you’re still a virgin because you are making the conscious choice to stay one. Maybe you are waiting for the right time, and the right person. Or, maybe you follow a religion that requires you to abstain until marriage. All of these are valid reasons to stay a virgin, despite what your friends are doing.There really is no “wrong” reason to stay a virgin. Keeping your virginity is totally normal, and nothing to be ashamed of. If your friends not being virgins makes you feel ashamed or inexperienced, remind yourself that it is totally okay that you are still a virgin.;
, Even if you aren’t still a virgin by choice, and just haven’t found the right person, it’s normal and nothing to be ashamed of. Everyone will have their time, and there is much more to life than just your sexual experiences.


Keep in mind that you are much better off waiting for the right time or person than you are losing your virginity just to “get it over with” or to feel like you’ve hit some kind of milestone. Be patient and give yourself time.

, Sexual activity comes with various risks and possible consequences that you may or may not be prepared to deal with. Abstinence, for example, is the only 100% effective method of preventing pregnancy. Avoiding sexual activity can also protect you from sexually transmitted diseases.

For women, becoming sexually active also means seeing a gynecologist on an annual basis to screen for cervical cancer and STDs. These visits involve pelvic exams that can sometimes be uncomfortable. If you don’t become sexually active, you don’t need to start these annual visits until around age 21., Remember that despite what your friends are doing, you are worth more than your level of sexual activity. You have more to offer your friends than stories about sexual experiences. Your friendships should be based on mutual respect and kindness, rather than judgement.


If your friends are judging you negatively for being a virgin, consider the fact that they might not be the best friends to have in your life. You want friends that will be supportive and helpful rather than judgmental.

Talk to your friend in a public place.,
Consider writing a letter.,
Set boundaries, respectfully.,
Ask for help if things escalate.",How to Cut Ties with Toxic Friends As a Teenager1," While it's tempting to phase the person out of you life without telling her why, addressing your issues with your friend is a more mature and productive way to approach the situation. It will help you learn to be assertive and set boundaries — important skills to learn as you become an adult. This is probably the most upfront — but also hardest — method. For one thing, you’ll have to be pretty honest. You may also have to do it in-person. Start by setting a time to talk.Ask your friend to talk. You might decide to do it at school, at a cafe or restaurant, or at a park. Since you’re dealing with a toxic personality, though, it’s best to choose a public place. You might say, for example, “Hi, Sam, I think we should talk. Can you come by during lunch in the cafeteria?”
Plan out what you want to say in advance. Have your reasons for cutting ties ready and in-mind before you meet the friend, e.g. “Look, Juan, I feel like we’ve been growing apart for a while now. I don’t think we should hang out,” or, “Lynn, I think you’ve changed since we first met. I’m not comfortable around you anymore because you use drugs and always talk about getting high.”
Try using “I” statements, e.g. “I think...” and “I feel...” This will make your explanations less accusatory, and more about you than about the other person.;
, You might also consider putting your feelings and wishes down in a letter, if the thought of a face-to-face encounter is too much. In this case, explain that you don’t think you should hang out anymore and the reasons why. This letter can be your entire explanation or it can be a sort of “dress rehearsal” for a later talk.Don’t feel the need to give a huge explanation, but be clear and direct. It’s enough to state your feelings, e.g. “Jason, I don’t think we should hang out anymore. We seem to fight more often than we get along, and I feel sad and anxious when we fight.”
Send the letter to your toxic friend, deliver it in person, or bring it to a talk. In either case, make sure that the letter expresses your desires clearly, in a way that isn’t open to debate.

, A toxic person might go to great lengths to stay in your life or refuse to accept your decision, leading to fighting and arguing. Expect to have to define your limits. Be firm but resist the urge to get angry or overly personal.Be firm. This isn’t a negotiation and you have the right to decide who to be friends with. Say something like, “Look, Tyreese, I can’t hang around with you anymore, because I feel overwhelmed when you talk about the problems you deal with.” Be willing to repeat your position.
To reduce the chance of hurt feelings, frame your decision in terms of you rather than your friend, e.g. “I just need a bit of space and the chance to hang out with other people.” Be specific about how much space you need, e.g. “I think we should limit our time together to once per month and limit calling to once per week.”
Try to be respectful and avoid arguments. Don’t use your breakup as an excuse to air grievances against your friend for all the things that he has ever done to you. Don’t cut your friend off in a way that will be humiliating, either, like publicly on social media., The danger of saying something openly to a toxic friend is that the conversation can lead to anger, resentment, or, in the worst case, a violent outburst. Remember to talk in a safe, public place. And don’t hesitate to get help if things go wrong.


Walk away if your friend becomes belligerent and argumentative. Just remove yourself from the situation.
Consider talking to a parent, teacher, guidance counselor, or other trusted adult if the toxic friend is unwilling to let go — or threatens, harasses, or bullies you.

Breathe together.,
Kiss them like they've never been kissed before.,

Have a relaxing nap in their arms.,
Make eye contact.,
Consider foreplay.,

Talk about your relationship.",How to Get More Intimate Without Having Sex," Breathing together can be extremely sexy and very intimate. Start by lying down in bed together, on your sides, facing each other, with your faces just a few inches apart.Then let silence fill the spaces between you as you sync your breathing with your partner's. The air you breathe will become the air that your partner breathes. When you feel completely in sync, this becomes a great time to talk and have those deep conversations that seem so difficult when you’re out around other people.;
, These days, relationships seem to move so fast that some people forget that there used to be bases between hand holding and sex. Don’t neglect the importance of a solid make-out: you need to know that you and your partner can really sync up those passionate kisses before getting under the sheets. Practice your kissing technique and don’t be afraid to really let the passion in and experiment.


For example, try nibbling their ear or kissing their neck, in between sessions with their delicious lips.
Lick a line down their neck and blow on it softly. The cool sensation will blow their mind.

, Don’t just hold their hand awkwardly as you sit together on the couch. Make hand holding more intimate by exploring their hands with yours. Trail your fingers along their fingers, spell out love notes into their palms, and kiss the tips of each of their fingers as they’re interlaced with yours. This is sexy without the sex and a great intimate activity.

, This may be old-fashioned, but a lot of people have forgotten how intimate, relaxing, and wonderful this can be. With your partner’s head in your lap, you can give them a massage or scratch their head. You can also do even more intimate activities, like brushing or braiding their hair. This activity gives you time to talk as well, or you can just enjoy this relaxing activity in silence.

, When you do any activity, you should be sure to make strong eye contact with your partner. We communicate a lot of feelings through the expressions in our eyes, and when you spend a lot of time trying to avoid eye contact (because you’re embarrassed or shy), you miss out on a lot of opportunities to tell your partner how much they mean to you without saying anything at all.

, You might not want to have sex, but there are sexual activities that you can do together that involve many of the same feelings and sensations without the actual act. These can allow you to be intimate, without worrying about some of the consequences of full sex.


If you do decide to do foreplay activities, however, it's important to remember that while they may not be able to get you pregnant, some activities can still come with risks. Make sure you practice safe sex, even when you're not having ""real"" sex.

, Whether you’re watching a sunset, sunrise, or creating your own constellations as you stargaze together, getting outside and looking up at the sky is a great way for the two of you to bond and become more intimate. This kind of activity gives you lots of time for talking and bonding on a level that might even be more intimate than sex alone, which makes it a great alternative to sex.


For example, make a date of stargazing. Watch a couple of your favorite movies together to help you stay up, and then take some tasty snacks, a couple of warm drinks, and some music out to a place where you can get a great look at the night sky. Lay out on a blanket together and come up with your own constellations and stories to go with them as you enjoy whatever you brought with you.

, Looking at pictures of your childhood and the people that were important to you is a very intimate act. When you discuss the things that mattered to you and the events and people that led you to become who you are, you reveal a lot of vulnerabilities to your partner. Showing your weaknesses in an inherently intimate act, that is emotionally significant for the exact same reasons that sex is, making this a great alternative or supplement to a more physical relationship.

, Exercising together also puts you in a vulnerable position...except that exercising is sort of a special case, because it’s sexy (sexier than you think!) and vulnerable at the same time. Exercise makes our bodies mimic the physical appearance of sex, making you look sexy to your partner when you work out even if you feel really gross (never mind the fact that studies have shown that the smell of fresh sweat is very attractive ). However, both you and your partner will realize that it might be an opportunity to see flaws in each other, and that vulnerability also makes exercising together a really intimate act.


If you want to give this a try to you want to make it as sexy as possible, try going for a swim together at a local pool. Challenge each other to see who can swim the fastest from one side of the pool to the other.
If you don’t know how to introduce the idea of exercising together to your partner, or you’re worried they might take it the wrong way, try saying something like, “I want to start going to the gym but I get really lonely and bored and then I stop going. Would you be willing to also start going so that I have some sexy company?”

, When you ask most people about sexy art projects, most people will think of that scene from Ghost but the history of creating art as an intimate act goes back a lot further than Patrick Swayze’s borderline-mullet. Creating a piece of art is like making a child and when you do it right, it reveals a lot about your soul and who you are as a person.


For example, you can work together to create two paintings: one that you can put above your bed and one that your partner can put above theirs. This way you feel like you have something of them that you can look at as you fall asleep.
Another option would be to save up a year’s worth of date receipts, movie stubs, photographs, and other paper ephemera and then decoupage them into an artistic journal cover. You can then trade the journal back and forth, writing about your personal thoughts about each date you go on, writing each other poetry, or even just writing each other letters in the journal.

, Reading a book together is a great way to bond, feel physically close, and get intimate in a way that goes beyond sex. We’re not just talking about reading a book at the same time here either (although you can totally do that!). Sit down together, wrapped up in each other’s arms, and take turns reading a chapter or a page aloud. If you’re not the best out-loud readers, you can also read the page silently and then signal when you’re ready for a page turn. With the right book, i.e. one you both really like, this is a very intimate activity and it gives you a lot to talk about later.


This intimate activity can be preceded by another one: going to a bookstore together. Go shopping together to find a book that you both think sounds great.
Don’t feel limited to books either. While a whole, traditional book will give you many opportunities to do this activity (because it’s long), you can also read things like comics and graphic novels. These are shorter and might work as a better introductory experience. Scott Pilgrim might be a good place to start for a young couple, if you’re new to the realm of comics.

, Bonding mentally is all about getting to know each other on a real level. It’s about going beyond the obvious questions of favorite colors and number of siblings. By asking your partner some real, personal questions, you can start getting mentally intimate. Just be sure that you approach these conversations in a good way: don’t be judgemental and do be respectful of what they tell you.


Ask questions like “If you could choose to be anyone, real or fictional, who would you choose to be and why?”, “What would you say to your younger self, if you could? What would you say to your older self?”, and “If you could make three wishes for someone else, who would you make the wishes for and what would you wish for them?”.

, Talk to each other about what you want to do before you die. What, right now, are the goals and future events that you want to see happen? Don’t just talk about what you want to happen or what you want to do; you should also discuss why you want those things to happen. The why is almost more important than the wish itself and it can tell you a lot about each other.


For example, maybe you want to travel to the Japanese countryside because your grandparents met there and their love story has been an important inspiration for you.

, It’s easy and fun to talk about what you’re the most proud of and what we take pride in does say a lot about us. However, a much more intimate act is to talk about the things that you don’t like about yourself. Talk about the things that you want to change or improve and why those things matter so much to you.


For example, you might talk about how you hate that you apologize for everything and you want to be better about asserting yourself, especially in family situations.
This kind of conversation has to be done in the right way, however. You don’t want your partner feeling like they showed up for the pity parade. It’s also important for your own mental health that you don’t focus on the negative side of seeking self-improvement.

, Asking your partner for advice can be very intimate. We’re not talking about seeing what they think about your shoes, though. You should ask them for serious advice for serious problems that you’re facing in your life. Admitting that you need help with the tough stuff to someone you’re very close to is not only a good, healthy habit in relationships, it is also very intimate because it’s such a difficult thing to do.


For example, you might be struggling with your mom, who thinks your choice to go to vocational school rather than a liberal arts university is pretty much the worst thing you could do to her. Ask for some advice on what you should do and how you can help her understand your decision.

, You can also talk about who you are as a couple. Talk about what you have in common, what your differences are, what your hopes are for your future as a couple, where you want things to go between you, etc. These are all sometimes uncomfortable conversations that might make you feel shy or embarrassed but there’s a good reason to talk about things like this. Not only will you have a better picture of what you can expect from your partner, but you’ll also feel closer to them because of that added feeling of security.


Ask things like, “How do I make your life better?”, “What is your favorite thing that we have in common and why?”, and “What good things to you want to come out of this relationship?”.

Remember that you are the only one who gets to decide.,
Ask your friends not to talk about sex around you.,
Talk to friends who are teasing you.",How to Cope With Being a Virgin when Your Friends Aren't2," Whatever your values are regarding sexual activity, be true to those values. If you have made a decision to stay abstinent until marriage, stick to that. Or, if you’ve just decided you want to wait until the time is right, then you should hold true to that.


Don’t let your friends be the reason you let go of something you have always believed in.

, Even if you aren’t a virgin by choice, don’t have sex just to “get it over with” or to catch up with your friends. You should still wait until you meet the right person, and do it only when it feels comfortable, right, and safe.You don’t want to have sex just to catch up with your friends and end up regretting it, or feeling emotionally negative about what you did. Your virginity is important, and so are you.

, No matter what anyone says, losing your virginity is completely up to you. Remember that consent can be given and taken away at any point, and that your partners need to respect your choices.


Also remember that all sex acts, even oral sex or kissing, require consent. Don’t ever let anyone pressure you into any sexual activity you aren’t willing to engage in, or that you don’t want to do., If hearing about their sexual experiences makes you uncomfortable, change the subject when it comes up. Ask them politely not to talk about it while you’re around. Don’t be afraid to let your friends know that you aren’t really interested in talking about it.


Find other things to talk about with your friends. You can redirect the conversation anywhere else, without even letting them know you are avoiding the topic of sex.

, If any of your friends are teasing you about being a virgin, talk to them about how their teasing is affecting you. Ask them to stop teasing you.

Try saying something like, “I would really appreciate it if you stopped teasing me about being a virgin. It really hurts my feelings, and makes me feel like you don’t value me as a friend.”

Avoid letting your virginity define you.,
Avoid basing your confidence on your sexual history.",How to Cope With Being a Virgin when Your Friends Aren't3," It’s not uncommon for people to sometimes lie about having had sex, especially in high school and college. Since there is such a strange stigma that comes with virginity at these times, a lot of people will lie and say they have had sex, even if they haven’t.There are many, many people who are virgins into their twenties. It’s really not uncommon for people to remain virgins all through high school and college.

, Rather than constantly identifying yourself as a virgin, find your identity elsewhere. Don’t let your virginity be the central point of description for yourself. Remember that you have other qualities and other experiences to share with others, and that sexual history is only a small part of who you are., When it comes to dating, don’t feel like you need to have sexual experience to feel sexy or confident in new relationships. You can still feel sexy and confident while being a virgin.When it comes to dating and intimacy, don’t go into things thinking to yourself “I’m a virgin so I’m going to be terrible at physical intimacy.” Instead, think to yourself, “I’m attractive, confident, and sexy, and anyone would be fortunate to have me as a sexual partner.”

Try to stay on good terms.",How to Cut Ties with Toxic Friends As a Teenager2," One way to maintain your boundaries or “break” from a toxic friend is to put some space between the two of you. f you have already told your friend that you only want to hang out once per month, begin to put those rules into place by decreasing the amount of contact you have with her. Call and take calls less often, for instance, and don’t interact as much on social media. It is better to first let your friend know about your need for space; however, you don’t have to tell your friend directly that you’re ending things — but it might take longer for her to get the message.


Screen your phone calls. Don’t pick up when your toxic friend rings, or have your family say that you’re not available to talk, e.g. “Jenny isn’t available to talk, I’m afraid. Can I take a message?”
Or you can answer the phone to briefly explain again that you need space and only want to talk once per month. For example, “Hey, remember when we talked about me being overwhelmed and needing space? I still need that. I will keep in contact once per month and will call next week, but I will not be answering your calls until then.”

, You don’t necessarily have to stop hanging out all at once with your toxic friend, but gradually decrease the amount of time that you spend together. Be less available. Be too busy to come out. With luck, your friend will either get the message or give up and lose interest in you.You might say that you’re busy and can’t come out, e.g. “I’m sorry, Cherie, but I’m going to be busy that night” or “I really can’t come to your party, Chase. I’ve got something to do this weekend.”
Don’t be tempted to feed your friend a lie, as you could get caught in it. Just be noncommittal and direct. You can also try a simple, “No, I’m sorry, I can’t make it.”

, Your toxic friend may have a hold on you in different ways, too. Cut back on other forms of contact, whether it is via text message, email, Facebook, or other social media. This doesn’t mean to block him — it’s not a complete cut off. It just means to be less responsive.


For example, don’t feel the need to reply immediately to texts or emails. Your friend may give it a rest upon realizing that you’re not being responsive.
You might also need to reduce your time on social media if you’re trying to avoid an open break. Spend less time on sites like Facebook if your friend can see your activity.

, Extend your distance to face-to-face interaction. Be more aloof when interacting in person with your toxic friend, but without being impolite or rude. If your friend approaches you at school alone or in a group, for instance, be civil but quickly excuse yourself from the conversation.


Don’t make it seem personal, e.g. “Hi Rheana, how are things? Can you excuse me? I’ve got to run!” or, “I’m sorry Ken, I can’t stay to talk right now.”

, Ideally, you can lessen your contact and have the relationship move from one of friends to one of distant acquaintances. To do this, however, you’ve got to stay respectful and not deliberately hurt the other person.Avoiding hurt feelings is partly about taking the high road; however, it’s also to your advantage and can help you dodge drama and a messy split.
Be prepared to assertively answer questions from your friend. If you did not explain your need for space first, your friend may become confused about your sudden distance. Be prepared to truthfully answer her questions about spending less time with her.
Speak kindly of your friend to other people. In other words, don’t trash her in front of other people. If you can’t say anything nice, try something like “Yes, we don’t talk as much as we used to. I hope she’s doing well.”
Avoid gossiping about your friend, too, and don’t force any mutual friends that you might have to choose sides after you’ve split."

Avoid your friend in social situations.,
Block your friend’s phone number.,
Unplug from social media and electronic contact.",How to Cut Ties with Toxic Friends As a Teenager3," “Ghosting” takes avoidance to a higher level and cuts your friend out of your life suddenly and completely. It is quick and immediate. But, it’s also cruel behavior that many people consider abusive and can lead to anger and resentment. Consider it a last resort after having tried a more direct tactic or if your friend is abusive or threatening. Before taking the plunge, also be sure that you are ready to deal with the potential blowback.To ghost your toxic friend, you’ll need to stop interacting socially. This not only means avoiding the friend but also, perhaps, ignoring him completely in an accidental encounter — in other words, the silent treatment. Keep in mind that this can be hard to do, especially at school.
Ghosting hurts and leaves no opportunity for explanations or closure — you may regret your actions in the future.However, don’t hesitate to cut a friend out of your life immediately if he is controlling and abusive toward you. You have no reason to maintain contact with such a person.

Signs of an abusive friendship include someone who insults and puts you down in front of others, a person who wants to dominate you or make you feel ashamed, or uses emotional manipulation tactics like the ""silent treatment"" or social isolation to get you to behave in a way he wants., Ghosting requires you to cut off every possible kind of contact with your toxic friend, not just personal interaction. This means phones, texts, and social media. You’re not just hard to reach — you’re completely unreachable. To do this, set up your phone to block your friend’s number, calls, and messages.


Blocking a phone number will depend on what kind of phone you have. There are different methods for Android phones, iPhones, Blackberries, and for different service providers.Check your phone provider’s website to see how you can block numbers. Or, try calling the service provider’s customer help telephone number.

, Disengage entirely with your toxic friend by cutting her out of your online presence, too. Don’t leave her any opening to have a continued presence in your life or to bully, manipulate, or guilt you. In other words, purge her from all of your electronic contacts.You can start by defriending and possibly blocking your toxic friend on Facebook and by unfollowing her on Instagram and Twitter.
You may also need to block your former friend’s email addresses to stop that form of communication. In a worse scenario, you may also need to close and replace your own email accounts.

Avoid feelings of guilt or shame.",How to Get Rid of Losers in Your Life," Sometimes, the easiest way to end a friendship is to do so indirectly. You may feel guilt about not being upfront with someone. However, if a person is very difficult to deal with, a confrontation can be more trouble than it's worth. If you fear someone would get aggressive or angry in response to you being upfront about ending the relationship, try to make an effort to gradually see less of this person.


You can stop sharing as much privileged information with someone. Do not talk about details of your personal life or share deep feelings with this person. Return texts and phone calls sparingly. Stop inviting this person to every social event you attend. With luck, this person will eventually take the hint that you are not interested in maintaining the relationship.If this person asks you where you've been, be vague. Say something like, ""I've just been busy"" or ""Work's been really stressful."" While you may dislike the idea of being dishonest, not everyone deserves an official confrontation. It you truly feel this person is a loser, and is draining your time and energy, you do not owe this person anything.In most cases, the person in question will eventually take the hint. However, sometimes people catch on to the fact they're being cold-shouldered. The person may demand to know why you are ignoring him or her. In this case, consider being honest about why you are ending this particular relationship.;
, In the event you need to have an official confrontation with someone, you should prepare ahead of time. Decide what you want out of the conversation, as well as what you expect of the relationship going forward.


Think about why, specifically, you're ending this relationship. In anger, you may be inclined to say hurtful things, like, ""I don't want to be your friend because you're a loser/a drain/a narcissist."" However, this is probably not productive. You want to make a clean and quick break from this relationship and saying things that will result in an angry response from the other person will only serve to escalate the situation.Try to outline, specifically, why this relationship is not working for you. Does it seem too one-sided? Do you feel like you're constantly being put down or taken advantage of? You don't have to outline every single grievance to the person in question. In fact, someone who you consider ""a loser"" will probably not take criticism well. After writing out your issues, try to condense what you're saying into a short, somewhat vague sentiment. Try something like, ""I just don't feel like I'm benefiting from this friendship anymore and I think it's better if we both move on.""You may also want to consider what you want going forward. You may want this person out of your life completely and, if that's plausible, be upfront about that. However, if shutting a person out completely would make things difficult in family or social situations, see if there are other solutions. For example, you could maybe not hang out with this person one-on-one anymore, but still remain friendly at larger get-togethers. You could say something like, ""I feel like we don't always click when it's just us hanging out together. I think we'd work better as more casual acquaintances."", If you're going to break off a relationship officially, a face-to-face confrontation is best. Meaning can get obscured in writing. A real life conversation gives a person the chance for real closure. If possible, try to talk with the person face-to-face.Send a text or e-mail asking to meet up. Make it clear there's something you want to discuss. Send a text saying, ""Can we talk sometime this week? When are you free?""Choose a time and place that works well for both of you. In case the conversation runs long, you want to avoid external time constraints. Pick a night when you're both free and choose a location where you can really talk. A crowded, loud bar does not help you have a conversation. A quiet coffee shop, big enough that the two of you can find some privacy, would be better.

, It's not always possible to talk face-to-face. If you worry the person in question will get loud or aggressive, skip the in-person discussion. You want to make a clean break, avoiding unnecessary drama. If you worry meeting someone in person will result in further stress, write a letter or e-mail expressing your feelings.


Take some time to compose your thoughts in writing. If necessary, write out a few drafts of a letter or e-mail before sending it. You want to make sure you make things as clear as possible.
Try to avoid the temptation to write a hateful or spiteful send-off. Remember, you're trying to free yourself from losers in your life so you can move towards a brighter future. You do not want to end a relationship with unnecessary drama. As respectfully as you can, explain why your relationship needs to end.

, If you feel like you're able to be straightforward, do so. In some situations, like if someone is prone to emotional outbursts, it may be best to keep information vague or to even obscure your reasons to avoid a blow-up. For example, you can say, ""I just don't feel like I have time to keep up this relationship right now"" may be better than, ""I don't feel like you're a nice person."" However, if you feel like you can be honest safely, do so. For your own personal closure, strive to express your feelings as frankly as possible.Explain why you're ending the relationship. If the person has hurt you in some way, tell them specifically how. You do not have to have a laundry list of every grievance, but you should provide some general reasons. For example, say something like, ""I feel like you don't respect my needs. I feel like you're always talking about yourself and you never ask about me.""
Set very clear boundaries. You do not want to continue to allow someone to hurt you. Make it clear what you expect going forward. You can say something like, ""I want us to be civil when we're around mutual friends, but our one-on-one relationship is over.""Try to be civil yourself. Just because you're eliminating someone's presence in your own life does not mean you have to harbor resentment. In fact, resenting someone or wishing ill against them can cause you unnecessary stress. Say something like, ""I hope that you're happy with your life, and I only wish you well. I just feel like, personally, I can't maintain this friendship."", ""I""-statements are statements phrased in a way that emphasizes personal feeling over objective fact. When having a difficult conversation, using ""I""-statements can help because you're not forcing external blame on the situation. You're simply stating how another person's actions make you feel and why.


An ""I""-statement has three parts. You begin with ""I feel..."" after which you immediately state your emotion. Then, you explain the actions that led to that emotion. Lastly, you explain why you feel the way you do.
Confronting someone without an ""I""-statement can cause unnecessary hostility. For example, you may say something like, ""We can't be friends anymore because you're a drain on me. You complain about your own problems, but you never ask me how I'm doing, even though you know I've been through a lot lately.""
Rephrasing the above sentiment using an ""I""-statement can help emphasize your own feelings. This can make it feel less of an objective judgment and more of a personal declaration. For example, say something like, ""I feel drained when you complain about your own problems without asking how I'm doing because it makes me feel like our relationship is one-sided.""

, If you've decided to get rid of someone's presence in your life, that person may resist. He or she may ask you for another chance, with promises to change. If you've made up your mind about ending this relationship, be firm. Keep repeating something like, ""I'm sorry you're upset, but I've made up my mind."" If the person will not stop attempting to contact you after you've told them the relationship is over, it's appropriate to start ignoring texts and phone calls.


If a person is unrelenting in their attempt to contact you, consider blocking their number. You may also want to block them on social media.

, Many people have a tendency to fall into unhealthy relationships over and over again. If you're worried about losers in your life, try to take some time to honestly evaluate relationships. It can be hard to accept when certain relationships become toxic to the point of not being sustainable.Do you feel drained when you're around a person? Do you honestly want to spend time with certain people, or do you feel obligated? Do you expect an amount of respect that you never received? Are you consistently disappointed by someone's attitude, behavior, or treatment of you?
Answer these questions honestly. Avoid the temptation to make excuses, like, ""Well, I do feel tired when I'm around Marguerite, but she's been going through a lot lately."" If you're feeling negative about someone overall, this is a sign this is not a healthy relationship. Everyone goes through bad times. However, even at their worst, most people will have some ability to care for another person's needs. If someone is consistently draining to be around, and this has been going on for quite some time, you may be better off ending the relationship.

, A relationship should make you feel positive about yourself. You may occasionally feel frustrated with another person, and everyone inadvertently hurts someone else's feelings on occasion. However, if someone always makes you feel bad about yourself, this may be a toxic relationship.Try logging your feelings after spending time with someone. Returning to the above example, jot down how you feel after, say, having coffee with Marguerite. Do you feel drained, tired, frustrated? Are you going over things she said that upset you? If this happens consistently, this is probably not a good relationship. This is likely someone you should get rid of in your life.
You may find you're significantly affected by another person's drama. If your friend Marguerite is upset about her boyfriend, for example, she may be unwilling to talk about anything else when you two are together. It may get to the point where you dread being around her when she's upset, because you know it'll result in endless and unproductive complaining., A relationship should be relatively equal. You should each support one another's emotional needs. In a toxic relationship, one person may always believe his or her needs are important.Once again, try to be honest with yourself and avoid making excuses for the other person. Try to remember the last time you were in need. Did this person reach out to you? Did he or she ask how you were doing? Or did this person simply avoid you until your neediness passed over?
In a toxic relationship, one person may be competitive about his or her needs. Returning to the Marguerite example, you may bring up a stressful issue with your significant other. Marguerite may respond by saying something like, ""At least you have someone. I've been single for almost a year."" She may then launch into a tirade about her own issues, leading you to comfort her. This is an uneven balance. This person is placing her own emotional needs on a higher level than yours, and using your problems as a way to shoehorn in her own.

, Toxic relationships are often ripe with emotional manipulation, which can take many forms. Watch for signs of emotional manipulation to identify toxic relationships.If you're being emotionally manipulated, you may be afraid to assert your feelings to a friend, romantic partner, or family member. This person may find a way to dismiss your feelings, accusing you of hypersensitivity.
You may also find an emotionally manipulative person does not take ""No"" for an answer. If you say you cannot attend an event due to work, for example, a manipulative person may ask several follow up questions, pushing you to blow off work unnecessarily.
You may also feel controlled by this person. You feel like you have to walk on eggshells around this person to avoid an outburst, to the point you're emotionally checked out. You may simply go along with situations to avoid the fallout, ignoring your own needs to cater to the other person.

, It may sound strange, but identifying the perks of toxic relationships can be helpful for you. There are often reasons people are drawn to the wrong people. Try to figure what you get out of the relationship. You may have deeper issues you need to work out to stop the cycle of toxic relationships.You may be drawn to a type of personality due to previously poor relationships. For example, say your mother was cold and emotionally distant. You may unconsciously seek out people similar to your mother as you're hunting for an approval you never received.
You may also have issues with self-esteem that draw you to toxic relationships. For example, if you worry your own life is a mess, you may unconsciously be drawn to people with problems you perceive as worse than yours. Emotionally unhealthy people may allow you to feel like you're caring for someone else, making you feel needed even when you have doubts about your own capabilities.

, When you've removed someone from your life, you'll need time to mourn that loss. Even if a relationship was negative, ending it can bring about a feeling of loss. Give yourself some time to evaluate your feelings and come to terms with the loss.It can be helpful to write a goodbye letter. This letter will not be read or sent, but writing it can be cathartic. Pretend you're writing to the person in question and state exactly how you feel. This is a great way to get out all the things you felt you couldn't say when ending the relationship.

, Ritual is important to marking big events or big changes. When a relationship ends, it's sad. You can have some kind of ritual that helps you symbolically mark the end of a friendship or other relationship. For example, you can throw away items that remind you of a person, like old photos or keepsakes. While it may feel silly, many people find ritual helps bring them closure., You should make an effort to surround yourself with positive people after removing the losers from your life. Seek out friends who make you feel good about yourself. Choose people who make you feel energized and happy after you hang out.

, You may feel guilty about ending a relationship. However, try to silence feelings of guilt you experience after ending a relationship. You deserve to feel respected and to have your needs met. Everyone ends relationships throughout the course of a lifetime. You don't have to feel bad about making the decision to cut ties, especially if someone's presence caused you undue stress."

While the person is dreaming, try saying something to them quietly, such as ""Dream of Nicky"" or ""Didn't Nicky look pretty tonight?"" Don't be loud enough to wake them up.The reason this may work is because you tend to incorporate sounds and sensations into your dreams.

, Most royal weddings have a large guest list. If this is something you would like to achieve at your wedding, start making the lists early from most important i.e your family to just acquaintances.

These are also things that can be easily damaged by failed past relationships, unaddressed wounds from childhood, etc.


Self-respect means accepting who you are, and also forgiving yourself for mistakes. When you learn to practice these things, you'll also learn to love, accept, and forgive your partner.
When you have self-respect, you also understand how you expect and deserve to be treated. This is crucial for avoiding potentially abusive relationships.

, The last thing you want in your new relationship is an unsettled issue from a previous relationship or marriage. Working through the reasons why your last relationship was unsuccessful can also help you avoid repeating the same mistakes.


A therapist may help you develop a clear view of your relationship patterns and make a constructive plan for resolving any difficult issues.It's never too late to change a pattern of behavior. If you feel incapable of intimacy or unable to maintain a long-lasting relationship, know that you can always change that with time and the right amount of guidance., Social pressures sometimes make us feel as though we need to be in a relationship at any cost. This is a myth. Remember that no relationship is better than a bad relationship. Make sure your interest in your potential partner is genuine., Love at first sight is a nice idea, but is not the case for many relationships. If you aren't instantly attracted to someone, it doesn't mean that they are a bad choice for you: lasting love is something that grows over time, and friends can turn into lovers. When considering potential partners, do not get overly obsessed with their appearance. Personal qualities like kindness, humor, and curiosity count for a lot more in the long run, and you may find yourself very attracted to this person as a result., It's easy to overlook certain things you don't like at the beginning with the thought that you'll eventually get this person to change. However, people can only change themselves, if and when they want to. If there's something you think you really can't accept long-term, think twice about getting into the relationship.

, While certain patterns (such as drinking, abuse, or irresponsible behavior) may be clearly unacceptable, there could be other, smaller things that get under your skin, like chewing with their mouth open, questionable fashion choices, or different taste in music. If this is a person you're really interested in, don't let these become an excuse to avoid intimacy.

, If you've been having trouble meeting someone, make a list of the things you like doing. Mutual interests can be a great boon to your relationship.Consider joining a club for one of your hobbies, like hiking, reading, or dancing.
Volunteer for a cause you're passionate about, like a food pantry, animal shelter, or political campaign.
Take a class. Check offerings at a local college or community center. Cooking, languages, or art classes are fulfilling on their own, and can be a good social opportunity as well., For some people, Internet dating may work well, while others might find them too high-pressure or lacking in spontaneity. If you do opt for online dating, remember: despite formulae allegedly created to find your perfect match, it takes a long time to get to know someone, and that needs to happen in person., If you've met someone of interest, feel free to make the first move and invite them for a no-pressure activity. Going out for coffee is almost always a viable option. Other choices may depend on how you've met: for example, if you're both in the trail club, you could invite the person on a hike with a few of your friends. If you both like music, see if they'd like to go to a concert.


It's a good idea to suggest a meeting in a public place where there will be other people. This gives both of you a certain assurance that you can get to know each other in a safe, neutral environment.
A casual meeting also removes any pressure that a more formal invitation might incur.

, Rejection is an inherent part of the dating process, and you'll need to learn how to handle it in a positive way.


Don't take rejection personally. People have all kinds of reasons for not wanting to be in a relationship, and for the most part you don't have control over that.
Take a constructive attitude. If you've been rejected several times, take a step back and ask if there's something in your approach that may need to be changed. Perhaps you're moving too fast, or choosing to date people who don't actually share any of your interests. In any case, don't dwell on rejection: keep a positive attitude, and move on.
Don't ignore your feelings. Some rejections can be particularly difficult. If you're feeling sad or angry, acknowledge these feelings rather than suppressing them. This will help you move on more quickly and completely., Sharing your most intimate behavior with someone you've just met can throw off the pacing of your budding relationship. If you like this person, chances are there are going to be emotions connected to sex that the two of you are not ready to handle yet. What's more, one or both of you might not take responsible actions regarding issues like STIs or pregnancy prevention. Worse still, the other person might just disappear afterwards!While your date may show interest in having sex, they should never pressure you. Make it clear that your wanting to hold off isn't a rejection, but rather precisely because you like them and want to wait until the moment is right. If they don't understand this, put some distance between you: this could be a red flag that they are possessive or potentially abusive.

, As the dating process moves on, you'll probably meet some of the people close to them, and they'll meet yours. See how comfortable the two of you are in those situations: this can be a clue as to how the relationship is going.Sometimes one or both of you may not feel entirely comfortable. That's okay - the main thing is that you're making the effort to spend time and connect with each other's loved ones.

, Some new relationships can seem all-consuming, but resist the urge to drop off the face of the Earth with your new love interest. Make it a point to stay in touch with your friends and family, taking time to call and see them regularly. Don't forget that romance comes and goes, but these are the people who'll be there for you in the long run., There are some signs that the relationship is not headed in a healthy direction. Learn to listen to your gut, paying attention to how the other person makes you feel. If you feel undervalued, insecure, or ashamed, it's better to end the relationship early and invest your time in search of something long-lasting.


Alcohol-dependent dating: the two of you only connect when you've been drinking.
Non-committal behavior: sometimes people have a lot of difficulty making a commitment because of something from their past, such as a broken home or an inability to trust.
Poor nonverbal communication: the person should be showing you their interest with body language, such as eye contact and touch; if not, they may be too tuned out.
Jealousy: if your partner doesn't like you spending time on other things important to you like hobbies, friends, or family members.
Controlling behavior: if they try to tell you what to do, think, or feel.
Exclusively sexual relationship: if the only time you spend together is in bed.
No time alone together: if the other person isn't interested in one-on-one time with you (other that in bed)., When the initial excitement of your romance has faded a little, you'll both need to commit to spending time together and investing in the relationship. Discuss what you both like doing and make a plan to do fun things on a regular basis, no matter how busy you are.Studies have shown that the excitement of doing new things together increases arousal and brings you closer., Talking together in a kind, honest way is crucial to your relationship. Your bond will be strengthened as you share your feelings, thoughts, fears, and desires with each other., While it may be tricky to balance relationship and self-realization, the latter is in fact very important to your love life. Mutual independence means you both continue to grow as individuals, doing what you love. This not only helps stave off unhealthy relationship patterns like codependency (when one of you depends on the other for your self-worth and identity); it can also be stimulating and renewing by allowing you to see each other do what you love and are good at., As relationships continue, disagreements almost inevitably arise. It's important to feel safe to express things that bother you without fearing the consequences.

Many women who work full-time jobs are still doing more than half of the chores and childcare. If she says that she’s too tired for sex, then it may be time to take some of the burden off her shoulders indefinitely., The next time you are snuggling, ask her about her fantasies. When you are intimate with each other, pay close attention to notice what drives her absolutely crazy in bed. If it works, then keep doing it!

This may be pretty easy to find out if you share mutual friends. Finding out what she likes can focus on what you have in common.For example, you may find that she loves the same types of movies that you're passionate about. Try catching movies at the same time so you run into her and have something to talk about.;
, Some people can become instant friends while others need to spend a bit of time in each other's company. Create emotional bonds by hanging out together, having fun together, and becoming comfortable around each other. If you're both hanging out in a group, make a point of seeking her out to talk to her.

You'll probably need to spend a considerable amount of time together.

, Let the girl know that you're there for her if she needs someone to talk to. If she does come to you for support, listen and be there for her.

This will increase her feelings of friendliness towards you, even if she's in a romantic relationship.

Remind yourself that being a supportive friend can actually encourage the girl to reconsider her current relationship. She may realize that you make a better partner., If you like a girl, it's easy to think that you need to be the kind of person she'd like. For example, if she competes in several sports but you don't enjoy being athletic, don't pretend to enjoy or participate in sports for her sake. You should be honest with the girl so she becomes interested in starting a relationship with the real you.If you are dishonest with her, you'll weaken the emotional bond you're building with her.

Bear in mind that she may like to take charge sometimes, but also quite enjoy it when you make the moves. If she always waits for you to start the move to the bedroom, then she might like it when you are slightly dominant.

Spend time with her one-on-one.,
Offer a romantic gesture.,
Drop hints that you like her more than a friend.,
See how she responds to flirting.",How to Get a Girl Who Is in a Relationship to Like You2," You don't need to ask a girl out to spend time with her one-on-one. She may feel less pressure if you simply ask her to go do things together without labeling these outings as dates. If she always agrees to spend time alone with you, she's probably interested in you too.For example, you could go out for coffee, buy music together, check out a farmer's market, or just go shopping.

, Think back to the things she likes and try to do something out of the ordinary for her. The classic is giving the girl flowers or something romantic like a poem. However depending on what she likes, you could do something original that's also romantic. For example, if she's really interested in original artwork, paint her something.Don't worry that whatever you give her isn't professional quality or expensive. The point of the romantic gesture is to signal your feelings for her.

, While you're spending time together one-on-one, tell her how much you enjoy being with her. Let her know that you have fun hanging out in a mutual group too, but place the emphasis on your time alone. You could also mention how important she's become to you or how your feelings have developed towards her.If you're anxious about hinting to her directly, consider texting or calling her. You might find that you have more courage when communicating electronically. This will also give her a little time to process her feelings and respond to you.

, Casually flirt and see how she reacts. If she's encouraging you, she may smile, flirt back, tease you or laugh. These may be signs that she's interested in starting a romantic relationship with you. If she gives you the cold shoulder, tells you to stop it, or seems uncomfortable, give her some space.You can keep spending time in mutual company, but if she doesn't respond well to your flirting, you should consider moving on. If she does like the flirting, continue paying her attention and trying to spend more time together.

Think about your needs.,
Decide if you should ask her out.,
Ask her out on a date.,
Respect her decision.,
Be honest with yourself.",How to Get a Girl Who Is in a Relationship to Like You3," Before you become too attached or involved with the girl in a relationship, ask yourself what you're hoping to achieve. Do you want to simply become good friends because you think you have a lot in common? Or are you looking for a romantic relationship? Since the girl is in a relationship, you need to figure out:If you're willing to wait for her current relationship to end
If you can move on emotionally if she remains in her current relationship
If you'd be fine with looking for a different girl who's available to date

, If you've become good friends, you may be wondering whether or not to move the relationship forward. If she's still in a relationship, avoid asking her out. Since she's in a relationship, she's already made her choice. If she's broken up with her partner, you could prepare to ask her out or wait and see if she asks you out.If you do decide to ask her out, plan how you want to do it. Figure out in advance what you want to say and how you'll ask her.

, Keep the stakes low and ask her out for a date. Avoid jumping straight to asking her to be your girlfriend. If she just ended a relationship, that may be too much pressure. Be confident and hopeful when you ask her. You should also give her a few choices.For example, you could say, ""I know you like Thai food. Would you like to try the new Thai restaurant in town with me tomorrow? Or maybe we could go to a concert this weekend?""

, If she says no, don't get upset, argue, or keep asking. She might not be ready or interested in starting a relationship with you. Be mature and calm if she refuses you. Chances are, she feels bad about turning you down, so there's no need to be mean or rude to her.


If you don't know what to say, say ""Ok, maybe another time, I totally respect your decision."" This shows her that you like her, but also that understand how she feels.

, If the girl is still in another relationship, don't lie to yourself about her feelings for you. You might be good friends, but if she's still in the other relationship, it's because she's choosing to remain. Don't tell yourself that she's secretly in love with you or is just waiting for you to ask.


Part of being honest with yourself is knowing when it's time to move on. If you think you're more than just friends but the girl doesn't want to leave her relationship, you may need to consider seeing someone else.

Go out often.,
Know how to stop girls properly.,
Be assertive with common sense.,
Recognize the level of interest from girls.,
Record yourself.",How to Get Good at Picking Up Girls1," Like any other skill, picking up should be practiced on a regular basis. So going out consistently helps a lot.


Although, don't use 'going out often' as a crutch. You can always start by going out consistently until it becomes second nature. Then you can practice while grocery shopping, while you're walking around town, running errands, commuting etc. So you don't have to dedicate special time to practice. It is highly recommended that you read Cold Approach a Girl and Pull a Girl Home to get yourself started.;
, There will be many occasions when you will need to stop a girl to talk to her. The way you stop a girl is quite important as it can distinguish you as being either creepy or confident.


When a girl or girls are walking towards you, start talking or wave at them while they are about 7 to 15 feet away from you. Use common sense; don't start talking when they are too far away or too close. This would not surprise them much and they would have enough of a time window to let their initial reaction subside. For example, when you and the girl are walking towards each other, wave to her and say something indirect like ""Do you know if there is a coffee place around here?"" As per the social conditioning, she usually would stop. Then you can tell her your intentions like ""I am just kidding, I thought you are absolutely adorable and I had to say hi"". Or you can remain indirect on the basis of a response from the girls. So calibrate.

Also, if you want to be more dominant, simply stand in front of her, as you give her a hand gesture to stop. Make sure there is enough distance between you and her. See if this works for you or not. A humble smile helps a lot.


If the girl is walking in the same direction as you, then jog or run up to her, give her a light tap on the shoulder, and say ""Hi"". This may still surprise her but it communicates confidence. Alternatively, you can just walk up to her, until you are shoulder to shoulder, turn and say 'hi' and do your spiel.

Another way would be to call her from the back. Say something like 'Excuse me' or 'hi', and when she turns around then jog up to her and do your spiel.


When a girl is behind you and walking in your direction, then simply turn around and do your spiel. Make sure there is an appropriate distance between you and the girl so you don't surprise her too much.
Stand your ground. Don't follow the girl or walk backwards if she's walking away, despite your assertive request of asking her to stop, or after doing your spiel. Stand your ground and let her walk away. You wouldn't want to talk to someone who can't stop for a few minutes to have a conversation with you, although it's okay to walk with a girl if she genuinely seems to be in a hurry and/or asks you to walk with her.

, Most girls like an assertive, commanding and leading guy. It doesn't matter how confident or independent they are. Its because of biological and evolutionary factors. A majority of the girls, especially attractive ones, most likely, will not stop or have a conversation with you unless you are dominant and assertive. So next time when a girl walks away from you, say something like, ""Hey, wait! I am talking to you"". Use the ""beckoning finger"" or the ""beckoning palm"" gesture to call her back. If you do it right, it will turn on a biological switch in her head and make her compliant. If you are not assertive enough, you will most likely lose her.


This doesn't mean to force yourself to be assertive. So use common sense and naturally calibrate as per the response from the girl. Also, keep in mind that majority of the girls would not be interested in you due to the factors like being taken, personal choices or life situation etc. Move on.

, Girls can be categorized into three categories:

Yes. 'Yes' girls are those who are attracted to you from the beginning itself. These are girls who are easiest to maintain conversation and go on dates with. Unless you screwed up something, that attraction remains almost indefinitely.
Maybe. These are those girls who are somewhat attracted to you. To get them to be more attracted to you, you need to be polarizing from the beginning itself or they will lose interest. Read Be Polarizing for more on this.
No Girls. These are girls who are not attracted to you at all. It is better not to waste your time and theirs, as most likely you are not going to get anywhere.. Some 'No' girls may flirt with you just to seek attention. However do not take that seriously. Majority of the girls will be 'Maybe' or 'No' girls.

, It's quite important that you record yourself while practicing pickup. Analysis of recordings will improve your social skills by many folds. You will be very surprised how quickly it helps you identify your mistakes and sticking points of which you were unaware. For example; body language, facial gestures, weird noises you make, up-talk (unassertive tone), neediness, supplicating behavior, etc. In fact, it's so important to record yourself that without it you will, most likely end up ruminating for weeks or months or years; trying to figure out what you might be doing wrong. You don't have to record every interaction. Just a few recordings from time to time should be good enough to help you recognize your sticking points and mistakes you have been making repeatedly.


Before you go out and start recording interactions, ensure that its legal in your country or jurisdiction. For example, recording someone without their consent is illegal in most states in US.If that's the case, do it at your own risk.
Audio recording. Most smart-phones have a recording feature, so use yours as a recording device. Just wear earphones as if you are listening to music, and turn on the recorder before approaching. Of course, test it before going out to see if the voice quality is good enough for analysis, when recorded from different angles. You can also use a digital recorder with a good quality mic for better sound quality. Look it up on any e-commerce website.
Video recording. If you want to go more advanced, you should have a friend video record you. Before every approach, turn on your audio and signal your friend to start video recording. It's pretty fruitful, as signalling makes it easier to sync audio and video while using a video editing program. Or you can use spy or body cam. But again, do it at your own risk.
Yes, it can make one cringe to listen and/or watch yourself, but that's exactly what you need to dissolve your ego as the truth will be right in front of you; if you are open to it.

Consider the context of the relationship.,
Schedule a private meeting.,
Do not relinquish possession of your pet.,
Take written notes to use as guidance.,
Use an objective, rational approach.,
Avoid insulting your former partner.,
Make an effort to listen.,
Put any agreement in writing.",How to Get Pet Custody After a Breakup1," If your relationship with your former partner involved physical or emotional abuse, attempting to negotiate pet custody with them directly may not be the best option for you.Breakups are seldom completely amicable, but unless there are abuse problems, you should be able to get your former partner to listen to reason.
However, if your former partner was abusive, or if you suspect they might hurt your pet, call an animal law attorney immediately to learn your options.
You can find an attorney by doing a general internet search for ""animal law attorney"" with the name of your city or state. You also may be able to find names through your state or local bar association's online directory.
In some cases, animal law attorneys have been successful with getting restraining orders that include pets.
If you're concerned for the safety of your pet as well as yourself, talk to a family law attorney who has experience with restraining orders. You also can seek help from a local domestic violence shelter.;
, Ideally, you want to talk about pet custody in a private environment where the two of you can talk about the issues involved with a minimum of distractions.You may want to choose a neutral location such as a local café or restaurant. Go for a time when you are both available, but try not to make it late at night or on a weekend when the place will be packed.
Let them know what you want to talk about when you schedule the meeting. If they try to insult or demean you for making such a big deal over it, simply tell them that it means a lot to you and you'd appreciate it if they would give you the benefit of the doubt and take you seriously.
When you call to schedule the meeting, try to keep your conversation civil. You want to meet and discuss the issue, but there's no need to get in a fight about it over the phone.

, According to state law, pets are considered property. This means that with pet custody, as with determining ownership of other items of personal property, the law favors the person in possession.You may have heard the phrase ""possession is nine-tenths of the law."" This phrase is true in most cases and applies to the issue of pet custody.
If your former partner already has taken your pet with them, coming to an agreement together may be the best chance you have of getting your pet back.
If you end up having to take them to court and they already have possession of the animal, chances are the court will end up awarding custody to them.

, There are a lot of issues wrapped up in pet care, including food, activities, and veterinary care. Assuming that both of you love the pet and want what's best for the animal, you want to go over all of these aspects at your meeting with your former spouse.Create an outline of your history with your pet, starting from the beginning. This can help you create arguments for why you should get pet custody after the breakup.
For example, suppose you are the one who initially adopted the pet. Your former partner was reluctant at first and wanted nothing to do with it, but eventually came around and grew to love the animal.
In that case, the fact that you originally adopted the animal works in your favor. It also helps if you are typically the one to take your pet to the vet or the groomer and buy its food.
Money can be difficult if you and your former partner had a joint bank account. In that case, think about who provided most of the care and attention.
You also may want to think about which of you the animal is more attached to – although typically that will be the person who most often feeds and cares for the pet.

, It can be difficult to hold back your emotions if you're particularly attached to your pet, but try to do your best to look at the situation objectively and determine which of you is best suited to take care of the animal.Regardless of your feelings, if your former partner would take better care of your pet than you would be able to, you may want to let them have custody.
Just make sure it's understood that you want to be able to come and visit your pet – for example, to visit once a week and take the dog for a walk in the park.
On the other hand, if you have the time and money to adequately support your pet, use the reasons you wrote in your outline to explain to your former partner why you want custody of your pet.

, Breakups rarely happen for no reason. Tensions are bound to be high anyway, but the last thing you want to do is turn your pet custody meeting into a shouting match.Try to keep in mind that you are there because you both love and care for your pet. If your former partner didn't care about the animal, they probably would have let you have it with no problem.
If you find yourself getting angry or frustrated, turn your attention back to your pet. Keep your pet's face in your mind and remember what you're doing this for.
It also can help to remind your former partner, if things start to get heated, that you're both there for your pet, not for each other.

, Assume that your former partner genuinely cares about your pet and its well-being. They may have serious concerns about your ability to provide adequate care for the animal.You can only learn these concerns by keeping an open mind and listening carefully. Try to ask your former partner questions, if necessary, to draw out their reasons for not wanting to give you custody of your pet.
By listening to your former partner's concerns, you may be able to find a solution that makes both of you happy and puts your pet in as good a position as it was before the breakup.
For example, suppose your former partner is concerned you won't have time to take the dog for a walk during the day because you have a 30-minute commute to work and are gone all day.
In that situation, you may be able to work out an arrangement in which you allow your former partner to come over during the day to walk the dog. In exchange, you could pay them a small amount (which could potentially save you from having to hire a stranger to walk your dog).

, When you sit down and discuss the situation rationally, hopefully you and your former partner are able to come to an agreement regarding custody of your pet. If you do, draw up a written agreement that both of you can sign.A signed written agreement is legally binding, but it's not necessary to stress that point. Nor do you need to hire a lawyer or draft a complex contract with lots of legalese.
A simple agreement that outlines what you've decided is fine. Include everything you've discussed about your pet's care.
Both of you should sign it, then make sure your former partner gets a copy of the signed agreement.
To avoid any problems later, grab someone to witness the signatures, or take a photo on your phone of each of you signing the agreement.

, He will eventually catch on and he should move on. It may seem harsh but he will keep coming back for more if you don't!

, If you're at school, avoid sitting next to him or becoming his partner in projects. If you're at work, keep interactions short, work-focused and professional.


If you are assigned to be his partner at school, go up to the teacher and ask nicely for a different one. If your teacher asks why, explain politely that he won't stop bothering you and it annoys you. Don't be pushy or sound stuck-up. That will lower your chances of getting a new partner.
If the teacher refuses, have as little contact with the guy as possible. Speak in short, clipped sentences and don't look at him. If you are a naturally flirty person make sure you don't flirt with him at all.

, If he has your phone number or any contact with you over the Internet, block him and ignore all phone calls from him. Delete any friend requests he sends you or messages. Totally shut him off.

, If he asks who you are dating, just tell him it doesn't matter. Tell him that you're not interested in him, and he should respect your relationship and your boundaries.

, If he continues to bother you, ask your parents for advice; they will be a good judge of what steps are necessary to create clear boundaries.


If you're an adult seeking to create distance from someone who isn't respecting your boundaries despite your clear attempts to change his opinion, consider reporting it to the authorities or filing for a restraining order. Keep in mind these are extreme moves, though, so only pursue them if you feel you are in some kind of danger.

""Be content with what you have; rejoice in the way things are. When you realize there is nothing lacking, the whole world belongs to you."" - Tao Te Ching.
Make a habit of often talking to the ""least attractive"" girls, or even guys, when you go out and genuinely practice to make a deep connection with them. It not only helps you to perceive people beyond their looks and change your existing paradigms, but it's a practical way to get yourself in a social mood.

, Romance has a very high value for women because of the fundamental idea its based upon. In ancient times, men were the ones who used to provide for the family and women used to rear children and take care of the house. That's what has a great momentum, from thousand of years of conditioning, and is hard-wired in our brains, despite how independent we are. Romantic connection implies to a woman that a man will be there for her when she needs him. That's what makes it so powerful and rare. This is something to become aware of and allow to grow naturally., Girls are very good at testing your patience and you as a person overall. It's inherently hardwired in their brains so at times they don't even know that they are testing you. They will do all kinds of shenanigans and play games, just to get a rise or reaction out of you. It's like they are qualifying you to see if you deserve them or not.


For example: If they say something like 'You are quite older than me, I am just a little sophomore girl', what would be your normal response? Something like 'Yeah I know, but I am not that old' or 'I have dated girls your age before'. These are very defensive and supplicating responses.
Instead turn the tables by saying something like 'Yeah, I am old. I don't think you can handle me' or 'I always wanted to be a sugar-daddy', or something like 'Yeah, you better watch out. I am a pedophile'. This way you can also qualify them.
It's like using the opponents energy against themselves without using force. Like what is seen in non-aggressive martial arts like Aikido or Tai-Chi. So play it cool. Once you pass a test, she will like you more. As non-reactive and non-needy mindset is extremely attractive to most high value girls.
Second example: If they say something like, ""I have a boyfriend"", ""I am seeing someone"" etc, then instead of replying with generic answers like, 'Okay, nice meeting you' etc.. Remain non-reactive. Reply with something like, ""Oh yeah, me too"", or ""Amazing, let me give you a hug"" (then go in for the hug), or ""and I have a maths test....I thought we were talking about things we can cheat on"" etc. It's like subconsciously telling the girl, ""I don't care, if you have a BF or not. I'm gonna have fun"".
Third example: When a girl rejects you, instead of reacting just bow down as you leave or say something like ""I am just gonna tuck in my tail and go talk to that girl,"" or you can simply express what you are feeling like, ""Man, that hurts."" or ""I knew it. You are so out of my league."" It's therapeutic when you just express what you are feeling and/or just channel your reactions in a creative and constructive way.. Note: Reaction are not you but conditioned patterns. So don't let them dictate your reality.
Don't react, as in the long you would realize that rejections are more valuable experiences than favorable responses. Also, more you fail at something more likely you are going to succeed at it. . Its also called as 'fail-fast mentality'. As in the long run you may realize that no experience goes waste.
According to Tao Te Ching ""She is good to people who are good. She is also good to people who aren't good. This is true goodness.""
If you just practice non-reaction and making deep, genuine connections with women(or people in general), then the below conversation practices are no more than supplements to boost your conversation skills.

, It's a quite persuasive conversation tool to keep the girl engaged. It can also make both of you feel comfortable pretty quickly. It means making the conversation about 'both' of you rather than you and the girl. For example; if she says she likes the video game 'Sims', then you can reply with something like ""You know what we should play 'Sims' at my place. I will order pizza and you bring the soda. We can build a home together with a garden full of lilies and roses. Also what color do you think we should paint the room for our baby?"". It's like bringing her into your world or bubble you made for both of you. Don't be too serious, you could push her away. Have fun but she'll wonder if you are seriously interested in her. It can be quite powerful.


Use the 'us' mentality in accordance with your personality and humor, or it's not going to come out as genuine. So experiment to get a better understanding of your humor and personality. You could try using sexual or plain lame humor in your conversations and see what you are more comfortable with and find more fun. If the girl finds it fun too, then that's what makes a good connection.
Remember it's about you and not about the girls. You always have to put yourself first. It sounds selfish but it's not. It's cause when you are having fun, then in the long run, people in your company would have fun too., This means you both play roles in an imaginary scenario created by you. Read the conversation in the image to get a better idea.

, If your motive is to have sex with the girl then sexual hints are quite essential. Some of these ideas may come in handy to create sexual energy.


Thinking about having sex while talking to a girl, charges the conversation with sexual energy.
Use sexual humor during conversations but don't force it. Use common sense. Let it come naturally as if you were talking to a friend.
Show intent with body language. For example: Lean in a little closer while interacting to a girl, touch her, sub-communicate your intentions with facial gestures etc.
Keep a strong eye contact. It's so effective to keep a strong eye contact. Your eye contact should be piercing her soul, as the expression goes.
Physical escalation. This is gold if you do it right. It works best in the night. Read Make Out with a Random Girl and Pull a Girl Home for more details.
Stop masturbating. Keeping yourself from masturbating, or at least reducing the frequency, helps naturally build sexual energy within you that may surface during your interactions. Keep in mind that this may or may not work for you. Also whenever you masturbate then think of your sexual experiences or fantasies, rather than masturbating to porn. As it helps improve your imagination and doesn't let you to use porn as a crutch. Which can affect your sexual life, There are funny and informative memes and vines posted regularly on these apps that you can use for your own life situation. Not only does the information on these apps help you fix the problem of 'running out of interesting things to talk about', but it also helps you be more funny.

, This means to keep a right balance between disinterest (teasing, sarcasm, playfulness, etc.) and interest (compliments, praise, etc.) and not being too interested or too uninterested. It's like keeping the girl on toes.


Verbal examples: ""You look cute (pull) but you don't seem to be my type (push)"", ""Here, put your number in my phone (pull), but promise me you won't call me again and again (push)"", ""Let's go to my place (pull), but promise you won't touch me below my waist (push)"", ""You forgot my name? Go away I don't wanna talk to you. (Push)."",""I forgot your name too (pull)."".
Physical examples: While making out, 'push' at the right moment, when her craving for you is the highest. This will make her want you even more. Another example would be, while touching the girl don't go for her breasts or vagina (push), instead gently touch around other areas (pull).

, Persistence is when you continue to persuade or try to pull the girl into a conversation, when the girl seems interested but is bound by social conditioning(Yes or Maybe girls). Signs could be like laughing at your average jokes, trying to walk away but still not leaving, smiling, keeping a longer eye contact than usual, playing with her hair, giving vague answers when you ask for her number or to go for a beverage etc. Use common sense while looking for these signs though. Read Cold Approach a Girl for more.


Keep it simple. If a girl is not replying your texts or calling back, take the hint that she's not interested or has other priorities. So no need to persist, move on. Yes, some girls do like to play games but in the long run you may realize how irrational and futile they are.

Experiment.,
Try new things.,
Test the validity of your self-limiting beliefs.,
Get another opinion.,
Keep a journal.,
Find your demographics.",How to Get Good at Picking Up Girls3," Pickup is very subjective, as you meet so many different people who all have vastly different personalities, mental interpretations of things, humor - the list goes on. For example, suppose telling a vulgar joke to a girl, Martha, makes her laugh and telling the same joke to another girl, Anna, creeps her out. Does this mean the Martha is cooler than Anna? Maybe or maybe not. There could be countless reasons for their different reactions. A few of them could be:


Your personality and sense of humor resonates better with Martha.
Anna: could be in a bad mood, she didn't like you, she didn't like your physical appearance, she likes taller guys, you could smell bad, she doesn't like to crack vulgar jokes with random strangers, she's insecure or has irrational beliefs, you were not confident enough, you didn't groom well, you are not wearing good clothes, she's a 'no' girl and the list goes on.
You have no control over other people's reactions, actions, personality, mood, etc., and if you worried about it, you will just suffer. Even your own thoughts and emotions are not in your control, they just come and go. Read Become Mentally Flexible and Surrender to the Present Moment for more depth.
So work on the key practices or habits, as mentioned in the article and related articles, that are in your direct control. For example: dressing well, grooming and smelling good, speaking with confidence and assertiveness, analyzing your audio recordings, having fun, keeping a strong eye-contact, stopping girls properly, keeping an analysis journal, being non-reactive, making a deep connection, body posture, etc.

, Practicing pickup as an experiment means you can try new things as test cases and just observe their outcome like a good scientist, without any emotional or mental interpretation. Then the true unconditioned interpretation will come naturally, and you will clearly see what works and what doesn't work for you. According to the Tao Te Ching, ""A good scientist has freed himself of concepts and keeps his mind open to what is.""


For example, if you learned that 'maintaining strong eye contact during interaction builds attraction', then don't just reject or accept it right away. Use it as an experiment test case. Maintain a strong eye contact in all of your approaches and just truly observe the outcome. Like a good scientist, don't get identified with the outcome. That would be more ego. This may go on for some days or be over after only a few approaches. It will depend on your personality, your openness to try new things, your humility and learning curve. Like a successful scientific discovery is adapted by people on a larger scale, adapt what you discover into your game.
""When I keep a strong eye contact, girls seem to be pretty attracted to me. So if I keep doing 'that', I will get the same or similar results all the time"". This would be just another mind made concept made in a futile attempt to understand the world through your mental constructs. It's fine to use concepts in the beginning or may be time to time, but as you go along you should have no clinging to concepts, as they fragment the reality. Read Stay Rooted in Being for more depth on this.
""The scientist's religious feeling takes the form of a rapturous amazement at the harmony of natural laws, which reveals an intelligence of such superiority that in comparison with it, all systematic thinking of human being is an utterly insignificant reflection. This feeling is the guiding principle of my work"" Albert Einstein.

, Different people may have different self-limiting core beliefs that have a vast impact on their actions, personality, etc. These beliefs may exist because of a person's conditioning, misinterpretations, experiences in the past, environment, physical looks etc. A vast majority of the times these beliefs or thought patterns are wrong or flawed. So it's an enlightening practice to test the validity of the beliefs by gathering evidence to see if they are erroneous or not and become free of them.


Suppose you have a negative belief or thought, that comes before approaching an attractive girl, that says 'What's the point? she's going to reject me anyway'. Then test the validity of this belief via experimentation. Which means, when you approach the girl simply observe if its really the case. Don't just stop after approaching a few girls. As mentioned above, it depends on your personality, openness, etc. Also keep in mind: seeing people through concepts or beliefs on the basis of their looks, is like missing 'not so often' opportunities to meet some genuinely cool people.
To add more evidence, think of any experiences when girls have been receptive and interested in you. When the evidence(the truth) suggests otherwise, that's what helps to dissolve these self-limiting beliefs. It's like cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).Read Eradicate and Stop Negative Thoughts for more.
Warning: Be aware of the unconscious expectation before testing the beliefs or you may end up in a state of scotoma.Scotoma means a state when mind sees what it wants to see and ignores any evidence that contradicts the belief. For example: if a girl rejects you and you say ""See, I told you she will reject me"". This means there was an unconscious expectation attached to it. This implies that mind is more open to evidence that would support the belief. Again, like a good scientist, be very honest and just observe without any attachment or expectation. Or just remain aware as the background presence and let the thoughts come and go. Read Stay Rooted in Being for more depth.
Affirmations. It is very fruitful practice to replace negative beliefs with affirmations. For example: whenever a negative thought comes like ""she's too hot for me"", replace it immediately with something like ""I deserve it."". As it helps to have a balance between relationship, health and wealth to back these affirmations. As you will read in the second step of section 6.

, While analyzing your recordings, an unbiased third person wouldn't care whether you do good or bad, he/she would just observe. There is a strong identification in the word 'I' and it's forms. 'I failed the test' or 'She failed the test': which would be more distressing?


Alternatively, you can simply ask the girls if they find anything about you that could be improved. You will be surprised how many of them tell you. However just because they have a vagina doesn't automatically make them 'know it all' about dating and pickup.

, After practicing pickup, jot down the 'good' things and things 'you need to improve', in a journal. You cannot always record yourself so keeping a journal can be quite yielding to become more aware of the 'mistakes' and 'good things' you have been doing during your interactions. Or you can just audio record your mental notes. Read notes in the image for a better idea.

, As mentioned, everyone's different, have different personalities, passions, interpretations etc. So it helps a lot to go to places where there is a higher possibility of finding like minded people. For example: If you are really into video games then chances of meeting like-minded people will be higher at a video game arcade as compared to an outdoor club. Similarly if you are into books then chances of meeting like-minded people will be higher at a book club rather than a bar.


Of course, this doesn't mean that you shouldn't go to places like bars, outdoor club etc. As you can still meet cool people there as people have more than one interest, but chances will not be that high.

Locate a community mediation center.,
Discuss mediation with your former partner.,
Prepare for your session.,
Arrive for your mediation appointment.,
Give opening statements.,
Work with the mediator.,
Sign a written agreement.",How to Get Pet Custody After a Breakup2," Most towns and cities have community mediation clinics that offer mediation services for common disputes that people have, including pet custody issues.To find a community mediation center near you, do a search on the internet or call the county court clerk's office.
Particularly if you live in a larger city, you may find several different service centers. Look at their websites or call for more information to find the one you like the best.
You also may be able to get a recommendation by calling a local animal law attorney. They may have a particular mediation clinic that they prefer.
Most community clinics are relatively affordable. You can expect a single mediation session to cost a few hundred dollars, although many have sliding-fee scales to assist lower-income individuals.

, Since mediation is a voluntary process, you can't force your former partner to participate if they aren't interested. However, you can tell them about it and do your best to convince them it's the easiest way to resolve the dispute.The mediation center you've chosen may have a pamphlet that explains their process and services in a straightforward way.
Emphasize to your former partner that with mediation, a neutral third-party will work with the two of you to emphasize a mutually agreeable solution. They will not pressure you to come to an agreement, and if you don't reach an agreement you can walk away.
Another benefit of mediation is that any agreement you reach is confidential. This may be helpful if your former partner is concerned about how it will look to be arguing about pet custody in a public forum such as a courtroom.

, If you already attempted to resolve the dispute with your former partner in person, you may have notes from that attempt that you can use to frame the points you want to bring up in mediation.A previous attempt also can help you isolate the issues about pet custody that are particularly contentious.
It can help the mediator if you can figure out where there is significant disagreement, as opposed to more minor issues on which you could both find common ground.
Take some time to think about what your goals are for the medication. Perhaps your ideal outcome is that you have full custody of your pet and your former partner never has anything to do with either of you.
Given the odds of that outcome happening are slim (or you wouldn't be at this point), try to think of some areas on which you would be willing to compromise. You can present those ideas to the mediator.

, On the date of your mediation appointment, try to get there at least 10 minutes early so you have time to get to the right place and get settled before the session actually starts.Mediation is not court – the session typically will be in an office-like setting. However, try to dress neatly and conservatively. You want the mediator to have a good impression of you.
Bring with you any notes or other materials you want to use in your negotiation. You also may want to bring a picture of your pet, so you can look at it and focus on that during negotiations.
Typically you'll be directed to a private room, although you may have to wait in a waiting room. If your former partner is not there yet, you may meet your mediator, but don't expect to engage them in conversation.
Your mediator usually will keep conversation to a minimum so they can remain neutral and assist both of you in finding a mutually agreeable solution to your problem.

, Once you and your former partner have arrived, the mediator typically will provide a brief introduction and explain the basic procedure. Then they may ask each of you to give a brief opening statement.Your opening statement doesn't have to be a long, involved speech, like an opening statement in a courtroom. Nor should it include a single conclusory statement like ""I want full custody of my pet."" This kind of statement is not helpful for mediation.
Come up with two or three points in your favor that you want to emphasize. For example, you might say ""I believe I am entitled to full custody of the dog because I brought him home from the pound, named him, and feed him every day. I have taken him to the vet regularly and his registration is in my name.""
This isn't just about factual arguments, though. If you're short on such points, you may be able to point to the unique bond you share with your pet. For example, you might note that your cat sleeps with you every night and comes running to the door when you come home from work.

, After the initial part of the mediation has concluded, the mediator typically will have you and your former partner move to separate rooms so the real work of mediation can begin.Before moving to separate rooms, the mediator may identify particular issues upon which both you and your former partner can agree.
If you're able to find common ground, it sews the seeds for continued agreement and compromise – even if the issues you're able to agree on are fairly minor points.
Once you've separated, the mediator will move back and forth between you, discussing the situation and trying to find room for compromise.

, If you and your former partner are able to reach an agreement through mediation, the mediator typically will write up an agreement for you both to sign. Read it over carefully and make sure it reflects everything you've discussed.Your custody agreement can cover many different aspects of pet care, including not only which of you gets to keep the animal in your home, but what kind of food your pet can eat as well as specifying activities or particular veterinary services.
For example, your former partner may be willing to let you have custody of your dog if you agree to take him to his favorite park at least once a week.
Take this agreement seriously – even if it includes relatively minor things – and understand that once signed it is a legally binding document and can be enforced in a court of law.

Identify the appropriate court.,
Consult an attorney.,
File your claim for pet custody.,
Have your former partner served.,
Wait for any response from your former partner.,
Gather evidence to support your claim.,
Present your case in court.,
Listen to your former partner's arguments.,
Receive the judge's order.",How to Get Pet Custody After a Breakup3," If you're thinking about suing your former partner for custody of your pet, you need to first figure out what court has jurisdiction over both your former partner and your dispute.If you and your former partner were married and are seeking a divorce, the issue of who gets the pet will bewared up in your divorce case.
If you were not married, however, you'll have to file a lawsuit on your own. In most cases, small claims courts are equipped to handle a pet custody issue.
However, keep in mind that small claims courts only award monetary damages. If you file a lawsuit in small claims, you run the risk of winning your case but being awarded the monetary value of your pet – rather than the pet itself.
Your county court typically also has jurisdiction over these sorts of claims, and can order your former partner to give your pet back to you if they currently have possession of the animal.

, If you intend to pursue custody of your pet in the courts, you'll have the best chance of success if you have an experienced animal law attorney on your side. Even if you have a family law attorney for your divorce, an animal law attorney will understand more about the ins and outs of animal law in your state.Keep in mind that animal law is a relatively new area of law. It may be difficult to find an attorney who specializes solely in animal law unless you live in or near a fairly big city.
However, because animal law is relatively new and is rapidly changing, it's important to find someone who has experience litigating cases similar to yours.
Your local humane society or other nonprofit groups dedicated to animal rights may be able to connect you with an attorney who can help you.

, After consulting an attorney, if you want to sue your former partner for pet custody, you should do so as soon as possible. You can initiate a lawsuit by filing a complaint with the clerk of the court you've chosen to hear your case.If you're not using an attorney, check with the clerk's office or on the court's website for forms you can use to draft your complaint.
The complaint lists factual allegations which you believe, if proven, entitle you to custody of your pet. Keep in mind that this is a legal argument, so you must have facts that tend to indicate you are the rightful owner of the animal.
When you file your lawsuit, you'll have to pay a filing fee – typically amounting to several hundred dollars. If you can't afford this fee, ask to apply for a fee waiver. If your income and assets are below the court's threshold, your court costs will be waived.
Take your complaint forms to the clerk's office along with at least two copies. The clerk will stamp all of them ""filed"" with the date, and assign a date for the next time you have to appear in court. They will then give your copies back to you.

, One of the two copies of your court documents is for your own records. The other copy must be delivered to your former partner using the correct legal service of process.Technically you can get anyone over the age of 18 who isn't involved in your lawsuit to hand-deliver the documents to your former partner. You might choose a trusted friend or relative.
After service is completed they must sign a proof of service form for you to file with the court.
You also can hire a sheriff's deputy to hand-deliver the court documents to your former partner, or mail the documents using certified mail with return receipt requested.

, When your former partner receives your court documents, they have a limited period of time – typically only a couple of weeks – to file a written response to your lawsuit.If your former partner does not respond to your lawsuit, you may be eligible to win your case by default. However, you still must show up on the date your hearing is scheduled.
If your former partner does file a written response, it will be served on you using a process similar to that which you used to serve your former partner.
It also is likely that your former partner will contact you seeking to come to an agreement rather than go through a trial.
The other option is that your former partner will decide to fight you every step of the way, perhaps even filing a motion to dismiss arguing that you have stated no legal claim to ownership of your pet.

, Lawsuits are won or lost based on the weight of the evidence. In your lawsuit, you must show that it is more likely than not that you are the rightful owner of your pet and should therefore be granted custody.Depending on the court in which you filed your lawsuit, you may share evidence with your former partner through the discovery process.
Unless your former partner has decided to fight you every step of the way, however, you shouldn't expect this to be an extensive process.
Evidence that will support your claim for pet custody in court includes things such as proof that you adopted the pet, state registration or veterinary records that list only you as the owner, and even receipts for pet food and other pet supplies.

, When your hearing date arrives, you will have the opportunity to tell the judge your story and present your evidence to show that you deserve full custody of your pet. If you have an attorney, your role in the actual proceedings may be limited, but you still should expect to take the stand.Try to show up at the courthouse at least 30 minutes before your hearing is scheduled, but keep in mind that the judge likely will be hearing several cases on the same day.
Once you've passed through courthouse security, take a seat in the courtroom gallery until your case is called. Then you (and your attorney, if you have one) can move to the front of the courtroom.
As in any trial, you can introduce evidence and even call witnesses if you want to support your arguments. For example, you may call a friend to testify regarding your relationship with your pet.
Your pet's veterinarian, or a veterinary assistant in their office, also can be a good witness if you were the only one who ever took your pet to receive veterinary care or treatment.

, Once you've presented your side of the story, your former partner will have the opportunity to respond. Just as you did, they may introduce evidence or even have witnesses testify on their behalf.When your former partner is speaking, watch your body language and try to pay attention. Avoid shouting out or interrupting your former partner – even if they interrupted you.
If your former partner calls any witnesses to testify on their behalf, you will have the opportunity to cross-examine them (through your attorney, if you've hired one). Pay close attention to their statements and draw on your own knowledge of the person called to question their reliability and the trustworthiness of their statements.

, After the judge has heard from both sides, they will enter an order deciding who gets custody of your pet. You may learn the judge's decision immediately after the end of the hearing. However, it may be a few days before he written order is ready.Keep in mind that if the judge rules in your favor, the court isn't going to enforce the order for you – you must do this yourself.
An attorney can help you determine what you need to do if your former spouse does not immediately comply and deliver your pet to you.
If you filed your case in small claims court, your ability to appeal a decision that wasn't in your favor may be limited.
In any case, if the judge doesn't rule in your favor, you have a limited period of time to file an appeal – typically 30 days or less.
Talk to an attorney immediately to find out if you have a possible case for appeal.

Practice Non-reaction.,
Practice humility.",How to Get Good at Picking Up Girls5," Non-reaction is so much more effective and attractive. In general terms, people who are non-reactive are the ones considered as 'cool'. It's because they don't react to content and take life too seriously. Below are few pointers that can help you in your practice to become non-reactive.


Feel your body from within, as much as you can. Keeping some attention within your body, while doing anything, brings immense joy and aliveness from within you. Your body is like an ideal sink that can drain all your mind-made negativity and all you are left with is joy and peace of no mind. It is highly recommended that you read Stay Rooted in Being for more depth.
Be aware of your breath and sense perceptions. Awareness of breath and/or sense perceptions gets you out of mind or content. Here's a practice for you: keep some attention within your body and/or sense perceptions and/or breathing while doing anything; especially while interacting with someone. Then monitor the quality of interaction as compared to when you are not aware of them. Read Stay Rooted in Being for more insight.
Rather than running away from your reactions(emotional, mental or physical), go deeper into them. Its cause there's no escape; the only way is through. So feel them fully and don't let your reactions rise up and turn into thinking. Read Stay Rooted in Being for more depth.

, It means letting the real 'you' out of you and not playing roles, while interacting with anyone. Do you talk to your boss the same way you talk to a cashier at the supermarket? If not, you are playing roles and subsequently you will play different roles while talking to different people in your life. That's what makes people look gamey and ingenuous.


People who practice humility are a lot easy to talk to and are a lot friendlier and 'real'. It's because they are not suppressing their 'true' (negative or positive traits) self with fake confidence or something else. Humility means trusting your natural or real self and never needing to be defensive. Its cause through becoming ""vulnerable"" can you discover your true and essential invulnerability.
This doesn't mean to force yourself to not play roles. Instead just be aware of the role-playing patterns and this awareness will take you beyond them. As when you are aware a different dimension of consciousness emerges through you. Far more intelligent than human mind.
According to Tao Te Ching ""Humility means trusting the Tao, thus never needing to be defensive."" Read Practice Humility for more insight.

Live an interesting life.,
Work on the balance between health, wealth and relationships.,
Understand that looks, status and money do matter.",How to Get Good at Picking Up Girls6," People who follow their passions, hobbies, desires etc, are considered very attractive. For example musicians, tech entrepreneurs, actors, adventurists and the list goes on. Living an interesting life also gives you a lot of interesting stuff to talk about. Also it gives you deep inner confidence and enthusiasm. Most people are boring and lead a quite straightforward life. For example go to work or school, then come back and play some video games, talk and hang with friends, watch TV etc. Life pretty much revolves around these things and this is what they talk about.


Ask yourself, what is the most interesting or adventurous or spontaneous thing you did in last 100 days? What are your passions? Make a habit of doing something interesting and new from time to time. For example: hiking, sky diving, visiting new places or exploring your city, visiting animal shelters, volunteering, working on your passions etc.

, Having a good balance between these three aspects is tremendously important to get good at pickup. Since all these aspects are interconnected and back each other up. People who maintain a good balance between these aspects have a great potential to quickly get good at pickup. As they would easily be able to connect the dots between these areas and sub-areas. For example: people who have a good social life are more likely to be confident.

While lacking in one of the aspects would, most likely, affect the other two in the long run. For example: if you are investing too much time in making money (wealth) and working out (health), there is a good possibility that your social (relationship) life may suffer, which in turn would affect your wealth and health(emotional and physical) in the long run. Similarly, if you have the right amount of wealth but don't have have good social life or health, then eventually it could affect your wealth.
However this could work like a priming affect too. Which means If you are spending a lot of time just doing pickup, then eventually you will realize the importance of relationships, health and wealth in the long run to get good at pickup. There's a possibility that you may burn yourself out in this process before realizing it. Since everyone is different so experiment to find the method that works for you.

, Lets clear this: Yes, they matter and if someone say otherwise, they are lying or don't know.

In some cases they matter more and others not as much. However they don't matter as much as men think they do.. In a way men are lucky, as many women are not into looks as much as men.

Make a commitment to make this new marriage your last one.",How to Get Back Together After a Divorce," Don't make sex the reason you are getting together. Or the kids. Or money considerations.;
, If the relationship is going to work out, there is plenty of time to talk about those things, hopefully in front of a trained professional. For now, just enjoy each other.

, Don't be too 'familiar' with each other. Be respectful, kind, considerate, and thoughtful...just like you'd be with anyone you are trying to get to know.

, More than anything, now is the time to do the things that you never allowed yourself, while you were married. Try out new restaurants. Take in a play. Walk by the water. Hike in the mountains. Many marriages fail because couples don't have much fun together. Be sure to introduce a lot of good times, hard laughing, silly moments, and enjoy each other.

, Be sure to go out by yourselves, not only with your children or with friends. While it might feel more comfortable having a ""buffer,"" when the two of you decide to ""try again,"" include time alone, in a public place, as well as in your home.

, That's right...be teenagers, and explore all the wonderful ways to be intimate with one another that doesn't result in pregnancy. Focus on arousal, not orgasm, and make it last.

, It can cause hard feelings when one of you tells everyone you know that you are ""getting back together,"" when that wasn't what your ex- had in mind. Agree when you will ""make it official.""

, It failed the first time for a reason. Maybe you realized that reason when it kept showing up in other relationships. Learn how to have a passionate, happy marriage that works. Evidence-based treatment for marital distress is very effective in teaching couples new ways to interact with each other. Learn these new ways well, and apply them in your new (old) relationship.

, Many 'second timers' recognize that their first courtship wasn't thoughtful or slow enough. Don't assume that moving in isn't a real 'commitment.' Again, take it slow.

, Don't just jump into it, assuming you already were married so that this time ""doesn't count."" Set up an engagement period, go to couples counseling, pick out dress (it doesn't have to be white or fancy) and select who you will invite to the wedding. It is very important that you have a community acknowledge your (re-)commitment to each other. This should not be an after-thought. Be as serious about re-marrying your ex- as you were (or should have been) the first time.

, You are building memories of your early years, even if this is a repeat. Be deliberate in where you go, what types of things you do (or don't do) while you are on your honeymoon, and make it memorable.

, There are plenty of opportunities to clash, as you are getting back together: when to tell others, when to be intimate, when to move in, when to marry, etc. Recognize that successful marriage have conflict. This is not the problem. The problem comes when this conflict escalates. Learn to fight with each other in a way that is mutually respectful, keeps things in perspective, and avoids name-calling, defensiveness, criticism or stonewalling. Keep engaged in your fights, but keep a sense of humor. If you can't, get help to learn how.

, Commitment is a vital pillar that stabilizes relationships. Focus on the benefits of being with this person, not the drawbacks. Every relationship has benefits and drawbacks. Remind yourself daily how fortunate you are to be re-united. Vow never to use the ""d"" word (divorce) again, no matter how angry you become. And put this relationship ahead of all others in your considerations.

Listen actively.,
Paraphrase what your partner says.,
Refrain from judging.,
Focus on the other person.",How to Foster Mutual Empathy in Your Relationship1," The best thing you can do to foster mutual empathy in your relationship is to actively listen to one another. This isn’t just taking in what the other person says, but really hearing what they say. This means you pay attention as the other person speaks.Don’t pay attention to other things, like the television or your cell phone. Don’t let your mind wander. Keep your mind focused on your partner.
Maintain eye contact and turn your body so you are facing your partner.
Be conscious of your facial expressions. A neutral expression can help the other person feel at ease and able to share. Couples are often very familiar with and hyperaware of their partner's facial expressions and how they relate to what is being said.;
, One way that you can really start to empathize with your partner is to paraphrase what they say. This helps you understand what they are saying and make sure you heard it correctly. Hearing your partner’s feelings coming out of your mouth can help you put yourself into their shoes.If your partner finds this annoying, explain to them that you are trying to actively listen and empathize. The more practice you get, the better you will be about doing this internally.
For example, if your partner just told you about their bad day, you may say, “You had a bad day at work because of your coworkers. Now you feel stressed and discouraged because of this.”
You can also use this to clarify what your partner is saying. You can say something like, ""It sounds like you're mad at your boss because they talked down to you in front of your coworkers.""

, When you talk to your partner and listen to what they have to say, try not to judge them. You may find yourself jumping to conclusions and judging their actions and feelings; however, this is not an empathetic reaction. Instead, try to understand what the person is saying or figure out what why they did what they did.You are not saying that your partner is right or wrong. You are just trying trying to see things from their perspective.
Ask more questions to help you understand your partner instead of judging.
Look at things from their point of view and put yourself in their shoes. Don't make a quick conclusion about your partner of their actions. Instead, pause, think, and have compassion for them.

, You may feel that your life is too busy and you can’t figure out how to make time for your relationship. The person may end up an afterthought at the end of a long day. To help foster empathy, you should focus on the other person more. Make them a priority in your life.Make a list of qualities you respect and love in your partner. Remind yourself of these qualities daily.
Tell yourself mentally to give time and attention to the other person in the relationship every day.

Create a ""time out"" system when the arguments get too heated.,
Agree on the logistics once ""time out"" is called.,
Relax your mind of negative thoughts.,
Open your mind to listening to your partner.,
Reestablish communication with your partner.,
Make a peaceful space that is free of distractions.,
Consider couple's meditation.,
Decide mutually on the topic of conversation.,
Agree to take turns talking.,
Think before you speak.,
Keep your message clear, brief, and focused.,
Use ""I"" statements.,
Avoid blaming, and focus on problem-solving.,
Think of listening as an expression of love.,
Reflect fully on what is being said by the speaker.,
Repeat back in your own words what you heard.,
Use empathy when listening.",How to Foster Mutual Understanding with Your Partner," Talk with your partner about having a signal such as ""time out"" as a way to prevent a heated argument from escalating further. The best way to communicate effectively with your partner is when both are mutually ready to continue the conversation in a calmer way.The purpose of ""time out"" or ""stop action"" is to create some space and time for each person to regain their composure, and to re-engage at a later point (possibly in a few minutes, hours, or the next day).
Emotions will hopefully be less high after having a ""time out"" so that communication can continue in a more loving way.
If you call a ""time out"" and your partner is not able to decompress, or sees this ""time out"" as an avoidance tacit, consider reminding him or her in a loving way about the positive intent of this action. Taking a ""time out"" can be positive for both of you because it gives you the chance to cool off from the argument. Ideally, both parties have already come to a consensus about when and how to use the action of ""time out."";
, Instead of continuing an argument, focus on the terms of where you and your partner will go to decompress, and regain composure. This may mean that you go into one room and your partner in another. Talk about how each of you needs to take a moment to think and relax, before continuing the conversation.


Determine if you both are willing to continue the conversation in a few minutes, or if a longer period of time is need. Set a specific time so that this conversation isn't left hanging unresolved.

, When your emotions are high, your blood pressure may go up, and your ability to think and focus may go down.Try to put stressful thoughts on hold for the moment. In order to deactivate your body's stress response and relax more, take a moment to consider doing one or more of the following:


Take deep breaths, counting to 10.
Take a short walk outside, or around the house, and come back when your mind is more relaxed.
Lie down and close your eyes while listening to soothing music.
Draw something in a journal, or write down your thoughts as a way to release them.

, Be open to your partner. That does not mean that you need to abandon or invalidate yourself, but rather to be more receptive to a mutual understanding of one another's concerns. Be receptive to other ways of thinking.Create a place in your mind and heart where you see your partner as lovable and worthy of your attention.
Allow more space in your mind for listening openly to your partner's thoughts, feelings, and experiences without immediate resistance, defensiveness, or judgment.

, When you feel you are composed, centered, and receptive, check in with your partner to see if he or she is ready to engage in a more understanding dialogue. If not, ask him or her to come and get you, or let you know when they are ready.


In the meantime, continue your breathing and relaxation exercises as mentioned. When you partner is ready, you can engage in a more open dialogue.

, While you can't always stop things from getting in the way of a conversation, there are ways to prioritize your dialogue, and reduce other distractions.


Find a room or space that allows you to talk, away from children, other people, phones, TV, and other things that may hinder effective communication.
Consider holding hands, hugging or smiling at each other, as a way to make amends from previous heated conversations. Physical touch may signal you and your partner are ready to focus on what matters--open communication.

, Use this mindfulness practice as a way to free your mind of negative thoughts, and become receptive to listening and speaking in a constructive way. Do this before starting the conversation again, as a way to calm yourself, and becoming ""in tune"" with your partner.One way to practice this is by sitting cross-legged and facing each other with your legs gently touching. Hold hands. Close your eyes, and breathe. Notice your breath.
Being present with your breath helps to slow down racing thoughts and emotions. Notice the rhythm of your own breath, and your partner's breath. By doing this for a few minutes, you can be ready to go back to difficult conversations with a more-centered mindset.

, Don't try to re-hash the argument you had before, but instead share the topics of importance with each other. Reflect on the topics presented, and pinpoint which topic(s) is presenting the greatest obstacle. Decide on which one to focus on, or focus on more than one topic.

, The first person to act as the ""speaker"" could be decided by preference or by some chance method like flipping a coin. The other person will act as a ""listener."" Each person will have the opportunity to be both ""speaker"" and ""listen"" through possibly several rounds of making your points known.


It is important to give you and your partner equal time to speak, and to not interrupt until one or other has finished his or her thought.
Fostering understanding starts first with the goal of active listening., By carefully thinking about what you want to say, and how it makes you feel, you are better able to communicate effectively. In order to foster mutual understanding with your partner, the point of open dialogue is not about ""winning"" an argument. It is about making your voice heard about your concerns in a loving and respectful way.

, You may feel like ""your turn to speak"" is an opportunity to make a laundry list of all the problems you're having with a specific topic. In this form of communication, keep the need to vent minimal. By being clear, focused, and staying on topic, your partner will be able to listen more effectively to what you're saying.


Avoid getting derailed, and starting to talk about things that aren't on topic.
Be choosing your words more strategically, and carefully, you are less likely to escalate an open dialogue into a heated argument.

, Instead of saying, ""You're crazy,"" ""You're wrong,"" ""You shouldn't...,"" use statements that focus on yourself, or ""I"" statements. People often get emotional and upset if you focus on how they are ""wrong"" or ""crazy,"" so instead try to express how the situation or their actions make you feel.


Be specific in what you are feeling, and avoid phrases that are simply ""you"" statements disguised as ""I"" statements.Consider statements like ""I feel worried when you don't call me about when you're coming home."" By using ""I feel""_____ ""when""______, you can show how a feeling is tied to specific action.
Use these statements as way to express both concerns and gratitude. Talk about how ""I feel insecure"" when...., or ""I feel happy"" when...

, While it may seem like a perfect opportunity to use your time to speak as a way to talk about what your partner ""should"" or ""ought"" to do, this is not a forum for blaming. Avoid using labels that will simply incite anger.


By coming up with possible solutions to the problem at hand, you are more likely to find mutual understanding. You and your partner are simply that---partners. When people encounter problems, it is important to focus on the possible solutions, rather than trying to prove who is wrong or right., Active listening involves giving your undivided attention to your partner, and showing that you are being present in the conversation. By both paying attention to your partner, and really hearing what he or she is saying, you are expressing love, respect, and understanding. Your body language can help to show you're listening, in the following ways:Not talking, or interrupting by being silent while your partner speaks.
Providing nonverbal cues such as head-nodding or resting your head on your hand in thoughtful way.
Leaning your body forward slightly.
Maintaining eye contact with your partner, but not staring.

, After your partner has finished sharing, pause for a moment to take in what was said, and reflect on what parts you understand or may not understand fully. It is okay to ask your partner to clarify their message if there is any confusion.


By processing what is said, you are giving yourself time to react in a more calm and constructive way that shows you care.

, By paraphrasing what your partner has just said, you both are reducing opportunities for miscommunication and misunderstanding. The use of repeating back, and paraphrasing, will be key to actively versus passively listening. If you partner can hear what you thought you heard, there is the possibility of understanding the other's point of view on the matter. “What I’m hearing you say is that you feel ____________ when ____________ because ___________ and you want ____________.” See how your partner responds when using this way of paraphrasing.
Find out if the speaker feels heard after you have asked questions, or discussed clarification. Consider using statements like “Do you feel understood?” If the speaker states no, consider asking for clarification such as “Would you please repeat what you said, so I can listen further?""

, Provide validation and appreciation for what your partner is trying to openly and honestly say. This is important to showing that you love, respect, and trust your partner. Empathy is crucial to finding some form of resolution, because you have shown that you are willing to ""talk in their shoes."" Consider using expressions such as:


“I can understand that you feel the way you do."" And, “Thank you for sharing that with me.""
Be forgiving, and understanding that if you and your partner are able to engage in even some of these techniques, that you and you partner are both heading in a healthier direction.

Allow yourself to feel.,
Write a list of negatives.,
Write a personal farewell letter.,
Reframe your feelings in a positive light.,
Share your feelings with someone you trust.It's never easy admitting how much you've been hurt, or that you can't get over the loss of your love.,
Know when to seek help.,
Unfollow your lost love on social media.,
Delete your past love's phone number.,
Give yourself some space.,
Remove your lost love's presents, trinkets, and personal items.",How to Forget Lost Love," Bottling up emotions can influence other areas of your life drastically. It can lead to aggression toward people you care about, poor performance at work or school, or it can even influence you physically by lowering your immune response, among other things.

If you have a hard time letting out your emotions in front of others, you might benefit from finding a quiet, private space where you can let down your emotional guard.
Keep in mind that there is a difference between allowing yourself to feel your emotions and allowing yourself to be controlled by your emotions. Fixating on your negative thoughts can make you feel even worse and even drive away support you need.Instead, acknowledge your feelings, allow yourself to feel them for a determined period of time, and then try moving forward.;
, When you're in the depths of your misery, the memory of your past love might seem better than it actually was. To maintain perspective and remind yourself that your past love was a human being with human failings, just like everyone else, write a list of your ex's negative traits.

, It may not be possible for you to get the kind of closure you desire. In this case especially, writing a farewell letter to your past love can encourage healing and help you let go of the relationship.

If you still have things that you never got to say to your partner, or if your relationship ended on a sour or emotional note, a closure letter can help put these feelings to rest.

, You may feel anger, jealousy, betrayal, sadness, or any number of other emotions. However, behind every negative emotion is a positive intention.This may be difficult, but explore your feelings, and when you find that positive intention, focus on that instead of the negative.


If the root of your anger is that you feel shame that you allowed someone to hurt you so deeply, you reframe that feeling as: ""I was brave enough to love fearlessly. That's a good thing, but I've also learned I need to protect my heart.""
If the root of your sadness is that you believe you'll never find a partner again, you can reframe that emotion as: ""I was good enough, strong enough, and successful enough to live my life before this relationship, and none of that has changed."", But it's important for you to reach out to someone you trust. This person can offer perspective and support. Some studies show that while you might be uncomfortable making yourself vulnerable in front of someone else, it can strengthen your relationship and make you feel more connected.

, If your feelings of loss are debilitating and don't improve with time, you may be suffering from a condition called complicated grief. Grieving is an intensely personal experience, and each person grieves differently. But if you have trouble carrying out your daily life, feel as though you've lost your sense of purpose, or feel that life isn't worth living, you should seek professional help.Some symptoms of complicated grief are:


Intense sorrow and pain at the thought of your lost love
Focus on little else but your lost love
Intense and persistent longing or pining
Numbness or detachment
Bitterness about your lost love
Feeling that life holds no meaning or purpose
Irritability or agitation
Lack of trust in others, This may seem like a bitter step to take, but seeing status updates and pictures of your lost love will only make your pain worse. Nurturing the false hope that you will get back together can make it very difficult for you to fully move on.

, Though you might think leaving this data in your cell phone harmless, calling your lost love will be a difficult temptation to refuse when you're feeling down, inebriated, or when something serious happens. You were able to manage your life before this relationship, and you'll be able to do so now that you've broken up – but only if you allow yourself the chance.

, If you and your lost love share a social circle, workplace, or locale, you may need to spend some time avoiding the places your ex frequents. It's important that you don't think of the end of your relationship in terms of a challenge; there is no winning or losing in a relationship. By giving yourself space, you are also giving yourself time and space to heal. Breakups are difficult; try to respect your needs throughout the process.

, These can be a painful reminder, and can trigger negative emotions when you might otherwise have felt fine. It's important to feel your emotions, but allowing yourself to be controlled by feelings can be unhealthy."

Share your feelings.,
Talk about important things.,
Respond empathetically.,
Stay open with your actions.",How to Foster Mutual Empathy in Your Relationship2," Building empathy in your relationship takes both of you. Though you need to listen, you need to share, too. It may be difficult to articulate your feelings, but this can make your relationship deeper and better. Mutual empathy is taking on and sharing feelings.You may say, “I am feeling sad today,” or, “I really enjoyed spending time with you.”

, You may have lost the conversations about deep, meaningful topics in favor of the everyday routine topics. This is common, but working on conversation topics can help deepen your empathy. Talk about things like your goals, dreams, desires, interests, and fears.Make a time each day or week to talk only about these kinds of topics. Discover each other’s dreams again or hopes for the future.
Limit the talk about chores, kids, work, or groceries during these sessions.
For example, you may say to your partner, ""Remember when you used to have a dream of travelling to exotic locations? I haven't heard you talk about dreams or goals lately. Is that still your dream, or do you have new dreams and goals?""

, One way to foster mutual empathy is to work on the way you respond to the other person in the relationship. Many people respond in a sympathetic way instead of an empathetic way. This leads to you putting your own feelings onto the other person and decreases the understanding of someone’s different feelings.Responding in a sympathetic way generally means you feel bad for the person or feel pity. Sympathy doesn’t always encourage that you explore and discuss another person’s feelings.
Instead of saying, “I know how you feel. I felt something similar” and then talking about your experience, try to respond empathetically. Say, “That must have been terrible. I experienced something similar and felt terrible. How do you feel about what happened?”
This kind of communication encourages the other person to talk and open up instead of shutting them out as you talk.

, As you interact and talk with your partner, stay open with them in the way you act and speak. This means that you don't close yourself off in your mind or body. Interacting with the other person in the relationship with openness helps you stay present in the relationship, which leads to better communication and a deeper connection.Being open means that you listen to your partner and think about their point of view. You also keep your body turned towards them with a relaxed posture. Refrain from turning away from your partner, crossing your arms, looking at your nails or your phone, or walking out of the room while they are speaking.
Staying present and open can help both of you keep from withdrawing from one another, which may cause conflicts.

"
"
Touch your partner.,
Watch the other person.,
Imagine things from your partner’s point of view.,
Try empathy building exercises.",How to Foster Mutual Empathy in Your Relationship3," Physical affection can help build empathy in your relationship. Give your partner a hug, a kiss, hold their hand, or put an arm around them. These simple gestures are good ways to focus your attention on your partner and form a physical connection between the two of you.Touching releases oxytocin, a chemical which helps increase feelings of happiness.

, To help gain empathy for the other person in the relationship, watch them. When you have down time while you are spending time together, look at the other person. Think about what is going on inside their head and what they are thinking about. Look at their body language and pay attention to it.Try to figure out how they are feeling. Are they upset? Are they content?
As you watch your partner, really absorb what you are learning and then care that they are feeling this way or doing this activity.

, One way empathy can help with conflict resolution is to help you gain insight into what the other person is thinking. Instead of reacting emotionally, take a moment. Close your eyes and put yourself in your partner’s place. Think about how the situation looks for them, or how your actions may have been construed.Consider what you know about your partner's history, such as interactions with parents, other family members, their worldview, etc. This information should be available to you through the relationship, and it can add another layer of understanding of your partner's decisions, actions and how things may have affected them.
Refrain from thinking about what you would have done in your partner's position when being empathetic — that is not the point of empathy. Instead, take all that you know about your partner and their background, and try to see how that might make them react how they did.
For instance, you may not have yelled at someone whistling at you on the street, but you may know that your partner deals with catcalling and street harassment on a daily basis, and so they may be more likely to react. It may seem like an overreaction from your perspective, but from your partner's perspective and experience, it might seem like a pretty mild reaction.
Looking at the situation this way can give you empathy for the other person. If both of you do this, instead of fighting, you will be able to talk about the problem and see the issue from the other point of view.

, If you are trying to build empathy in your relationship, you may consider using activities to build more empathy between the two of you. These exercises aim at putting yourself in someone else’s shoes so you can learn empathy. You will try to connect to your partner by looking at things from their point of view.Good exercises to foster empathy include dramatization, role-playing, and imitating.
You may also want to try dance therapy where you try to mirror your partner’s actions to increase awareness of the other person.

Learn to love yourself before attempting to love another.,
Know what sort of person will light your fire.,
Let your friends take control of the wheel.,
Try out dating sites.,
Remember that you’re available, not desperate.",How to Find Your Better Half," You know how you change your wardrobes daily to whatever you feel would suit a certain event or a crowd? Yes, well with your personality, the same can’t be done. It’s something you were born with, so whether you like it or not, it’s a “till death do us apart” kind of relationship you have with it. But if you persist and try to change your characters, you surely will end up with the grim results of either facing an identity crisis or a dwindling confidence. And those two are your love life’s arch-nemesis. So accept who you are, embrace your every element, and disregard those who unduly criticize.;
, You can’t go out into the woods at night with a torch light not knowing what to look for, right? So who is the one you label as your knight in shining armor or your princess? Is he/she the kind to mutter a word and have you in stitches? Is that soul mate of yours one with not a bead of humor in his/her temperament? Is that life-long companion you’ve always dreamt of emotional, independent, confident, wise, responsible, or carefree? You have to know what you want first, before you set out for the search.

, No one can possibly know your likes and dislikes more than your closest friends. Ever seen the show Disaster Dates on MTV? See how they victimize one another by virtue of their exclusive insight? Your friends won’t do the same to you, but they just might be able to serve you that anxiously awaited soul-mate on a silver platter. So, having put in mind that there is no failure in trying, let your friends take control of the wheel and set you up with someone.

, Make wise choices in your pursuit; select the right places to scour for Cupid’s arrow. Dating sites vary considerably in appeal and it's worth finding the one that aligns with your philosophy and needs, so that the same people you are interested in are actually looking in the same place.

, Being desperate or arrogant usually curtails your chance at getting a second date. First impressions really do matter, so:


Don’t forget that you’re available, and that you’re on the quest of finding the one. But appearing to be too available runs the risk of making you look too desperate, which can have your date run out of the restaurant for his or her dear life. So calm down.
It doesn’t hurt to have some spice in you. Act as though dating comes to you as a second nature. But be sure to keep that flare within reason, as it can lose its composure and turn everything to dust.

Don’t be self-conscious about it—the worse you are, the more fun it will be. If you’re nervous about singing on your own, make sure you get a singing partner or two. Pick old songs from when you were in elementary school and have fun belting them out at the top of your lungs.


If you really want to get fancy, you can even get a karaoke machine for you and your friends to use at home, so you’re less self-conscious. But remember that part of the fun of karaoke is embarrassing yourself in front of strangers.;
, You don't have to be good to have fun bowling. Bring a bracelet-making set and a group of friends to the bowling alley and bowl your hearts out. While the others are bowling everyone else makes friendship bracelets, so there’s never a dull moment. This can be a fun way to bring together friends who like bowling and jewelry making too.


Bowling can get a little boring if you’re with a big group and have to wait forever for your turn. Making bracelets while you wait can make it so you always have something fun to do.

, If the weather is hot and humid outside, what better way to have fun than to get wet? Invite your friends over for a watery day. Make a slip 'n' slide by putting a plastic tarp on a hill. Make sure you pin it into place so it doesn't blow away! Then get the hose and pour water onto it while you and your girls slide down. Have a friendly water balloon fight afterward and dry off with towels, lemonade, and brownies.


Don’t think you’re ever too old for a slip ‘n’ slide! This can be a cool way to channel your inner-child.
You can also get all fancy and buy a slip ‘n’ slide, but that’s not as fun as making your own.

, Have a group of nine or ten friends head to the park with you for some softball! Nobody has to be very good at it, and the game doesn’t need to be very competitive at all, though you can add a fun bonus, like having the losers buy pizza for the winners. Plan to play for just an hour or two and make sure not to take yourselves too seriously. Playing a team sport together can help you bond with your friends while getting some activity, too.


If people get bored but you want to stay outside, then you can do cartwheels, play kickball, or try to make a human pyramid.

, Picnics don’t have to be just for you and your family. Pick a nice weekend afternoon and invite your friends out to a picnic at a park, by a lake, or even in your backyard. All you need is a blanket and some simple foods, such as sandwiches, cheese and a baguette, grapes, or some hummus and pita chips. You can also bring along a pizza or even some sushi if you want to be a bit creative about it. The important thing is that you and your friends have fun sitting and relaxing and eating the tasty treats you’ve brought.


You can have each friend bring something different, so everyone is contributing.
You can also bring some fun activities to play outside after you’re done with the picnic, such as ring toss, badminton or frisbee.

, Sure, you may think the playground is for kids in elementary school, but there’s nothing stopping you from having a fun retro playground day with your friends. Have fun hitting up your local playground for a few hours, going on the swings, the merry-go-round, running up the slide, or even playing tetherball or lava tag. Let go of your self-consciousness and just enjoy the moment.


If you’re with your true friends, then you’ve got nothing to prove. Knowing how to have fun and let loose is more important than acting all mature anyway.
If you want to have the playground to yourself, go closer to dusk so it’s less likely that there are little kids there.

, Manhunt is another underrated outdoor activity that is perfect for teenage girls. Manhunt is just a version of hide-and-seek played outside, normally in the dark. You can play in the dusk and stick close to home if you want to feel safer. The bottom line is that someone is “it,” and the rest of the people scatter within a given area and find a good hiding spot. The darkness and outdoor element adds an extra bit of fun and excitement to the game.


If the person spots you, then you can still run away, as you would in tag. Just make sure you’re being safe, and this will be a fun way to spend a few hours.

, If one of your friends has her license, take a fun day trip to the beach over the weekend. Enjoy soaking up the sun, reading gossip magazines, splashing in the waves, or even building a sandcastle. If you’re at a beach near a boardwalk, have fun strolling around it, playing carnival games, and maybe even hit up a ride or too. Remember that you’re never too old to go to the beach.


Everyone has that one friend who hates going to the beach because she’s afraid of getting burned. Make sure you get her to come along and bring an umbrella, or rent one, to keep her happy.

, Spending an afternoon in a thrift shop is one of the most fun things you can do with your friends. Pick a thrift shop in your area and have fun exploring all of the cool clothes and other unpredictable items you may find there. Make a goal of having everyone purchase just one item and wearing it out that night. Try on all of the funky clothes you find and even take some photos to see how cool or ridiculous you look.


The key is not to take yourself too seriously. You’re not shopping for your prom dress; you’re just trying to have some fun.

Play old games from your childhood.,
Prank call the boys you know.,
Make a scrapbook.,
Have a classic movie night.",How to Have Fun with Your Friends (Teen Girls)2," Invite the girls over for the evening and cook a delicious three-course meal. Decide on the appetizer, main course, and desserts in advance, and make sure you have all of the ingredients you need when everyone gets there. Then, follow the recipes to make delicious treats for yourself, whether you make a watermelon salad or mushroom risotto. Try to pick recipes that are pretty easy and which don’t take too long, so you can enjoy your meal without exerting too much effort.


When everyone gets there, blast some fun music and assign everyone to a certain task such as “Elizabeth does the chopping,” “Veronica cleans the veggies,” “Maria boils the rice,” and so on. Talk and have a good time! You can also play some music in the background to make things more fun.
If one of your friends really hates cooking, you don’t need to force her to do it, but you can put her on clean-up duty.

, Blast your stereo and sing and dance your hearts out to popular songs on the radio, or play your favorite CDs or songs from your iPod to get people grooving. Have fun just dancing like fools while you dance, or even make up a coordinated song to the beat of the song that you’re dancing to. The most important thing is that you don’t care what you look like and that you’re committed to swinging your hair and looking like a goofball.


You can even teach each other coordinated dances, such as “The Wobble” or “The Cupid Shuffle,” and have fun goofing off or even performing them for your other friends or siblings.

, Another fun thing you can do at home with your friends is to play with your pet. Take your dog out in the yard or to a park and throw a frisbee to him, or take turns letting people hold or pet your pet hamster, Nibbles. If you have a kitty who likes playing with his feather toy, then let your friends take a turn playing with him, as long as he doesn’t get overwhelmed. You may think that playing with pets is for kids, but this can actually be a nice change of pace for teenage girls, too.


If your dog needs to be walked, all of you can go take him for a walk together. This will let you bond with your pet and get some physical exercises. Besides, you never know what cute boys you might find when you’re walking around.

, Go to the store with a few of your friends and get all of the necessary ingredients for ice cream sundaes: ice cream, bananas, chocolate syrup, maraschino cherries, and crushed peanuts or anything else you like to add to your favorite treat. You can even get some waffle cones to crush up and place on the bottom for an added flavor. Then, throw an ice cream sundae making party in your kitchen, and have some soda or milk along with that sundae to boot.


You can also add some sprinkles to your favorite dessert.
If you have some friends who are opposed to ice cream, you can use frozen yogurt, instead.
Caramel sauce can be just as tasty as chocolate sauce.

, You may think you’ve outgrown board games and that you’re too old to really enjoy them. However, you can actually end up having a fun, silly night playing old games with your friends, whether you’re playing Sorry!, Twister, or charades or another game you haven’t played in a while. Don’t worry so much about looking cool or mature and focus on having a good time instead.


If you have old board games from your childhood, such as Pretty Pretty Princess, then you and your friends can have a blast playing them.

, Okay, so making prank calls may not be the most advisable thing you can do as a rule, and it can lead you to even get in trouble with the law, but calling up a boy you know and teasing him a bit or throwing him off guard can be a fun way to pass the time. Call up your crush, your boyfriend, or a guy one of your friends likes, and have fun disguising your voice and asking him if he ordered a pizza or asking him to report to the principal’s office as soon as he can.


Call from the phone of a person whose number he doesn’t have, or dial *67, if relevant, if you call from home so that your number is not identified. It can be more fun to call from home because then multiple girls can get on multiple phones to hear the funny conversation.

, Don’t think that scrapbooking is just for your mom and her friends. Get together with a few of your close friends that you’ve known for a long time, and compile a basket of old photos, old notes, and old trinkets and keepsakes that remind you of your friendship. These days, people actually print their photos less and less, and it can be nice to create a physical record of your friendship. This can also be a fun way to go down memory lane together.


Just make sure that all of the girls you’re with have known each other for a while, so that someone who is newer to the group doesn’t feel left out.

, Invite your friends over to watch your favorite Audrey Hepburn or Hitchcock film, get the popcorn popping, and enjoy snuggling up and watching your favorite films together. Not only will you be immersing yourself in culture, but you’ll be having fun in the process. If the classics are too much for you, you can pair a more classic film with something more contemporary or mainstream.


A movie night can be a great part of a sleepover. Consider adding a sleepover into the mix. It can be the just the thing you need after watching a movie with your friends.

Go window shopping.,
Have a photoshoot.,
Strut down the catwalk.,
Put makeup on each other while blindfolded.,
Do a clothes swap.,
Have a jewelry making party.,
Do each other’s nails.",How to Have Fun with Your Friends (Teen Girls)3," Hit up the mall with the goal of not buying a single thing. Instead of feeling pressure to buy something or to find the perfect outfit, just stroll through the mall with your friends and have fun looking at all the fun clothes or funky designs you see in the windows of different stores. Point out your favorite or least favorite clothes and just have fun browsing together. Instead of separating and going to your own favorite stores, stick together and even link arms as you have a different experience walking through the mall.


Tell yourselves that the only thing you can buy is some ice cream, a pretzel, or some chocolate chip cookies, so you’re not too worried about finding the perfect outfit.

, Put on your favorite clothes and have fun taking pictures of each other going about your day. Aim to have at least 100 pictures taken for that day, and then pick the best ones to make a photo album with. You can also just have fun taking photos of yourself jumping, making silly faces, or dancing with your hair flying in your face. A lot of people complain that they don’t have enough photos with their friends, so you can work on adding some photos to your collection.


You can even take pictures against different backgrounds, from the mall to the woods behind your house. Play around. Don’t take it too seriously.

, Act like you’re a model strutting her stuff and put on ridiculous clothes, high heels, and wear your hair in elaborate styles. Get a super-serious look on your face, put on some intense music, and walk down a fake catwalk without cracking a smile. Have your friends sit in the audience looking serious and fanning themselves with fashion magazines for an added effect.


The more ridiculous you look, the more fun it will be. Wear a trash bag and say it’s the latest futuristic trend.
Glue some leaves to a white t-shirt and say it’s the hottest fall fashion.

, Blindfold yourself and have fun putting makeup on your friends’ faces. When you’re done, take off your blindfold and see how crazy your friends look! You can take turns applying makeup to each other like this, and will giggle at the result. You can even take some photographic evidence, if you want! Just make sure you’re safe and careful and don’t poke your friends in the eye or hurt them.


For added fun, you can pretend like you all look beautiful and act like you’re ready for a night out with makeup smeared all over your faces.

, Have everyone bring a trash bag of clothes they no longer want. Then, take turns showing what you’re giving away and have friends raise their hands to claim items. This can be a fun way to put your old clothes to good use and to have a fun evening in with your friends. Even if not all the clothes are claimed, you can also just have fun trying on some of the most ridiculous items.


If two people claim the same item, create a rule for how to obtain it. They can have a dance-off, play rock-paper-scissors, or have a staring contest. This will add an even more fun element to the clothes swap.

, If you don’t already have a friend who is an expert at beading and making jewelry, just hit up your local craft store and get some beads, nylon string for bracelets and necklaces, earring hooks, and any other tools you would need to tie it all together. Then, get together with your friends and have fun making your own creations together.


Getting beads and everything else you need to make jewelry can be a bit expensive, so make sure you share the costs with your friends in advance.
You can also look online for inspiration or just make whatever comes to mind.

, Instead of getting an expensive mani-pedi at the mall, you and your friends can take turns doing each other’s finger and toenails, or you can just paint your own nails while chatting with your friends. You can get decals, fake nails, or paint lightning bolts or other fun patterns on your nails, too. If you want to get all fancy, you can all even soak your feet in hot water or make a lavender bath for your feet and hands first.


Not only is this cheaper than going to the salon, but you’ll also be able to talk to each other more this way.

Find a charity or store in your local area, that you want to help out.,
Always do your research before you donate your time, money, or old things.,
Assemble old clothes that are in good condition but no longer useful to you.,
Donate other unwanted items.,
Donate money.,
Donate time.,
Tell your friends about your great time volunteering.,
Ask your school.,
Sometimes, physically giving can be hard.",How to Give to Charity As a Teen," Find out whether it does pick-ups or whether you need to visit and drop off items. If you want to donate volunteering time, you'll need to be able to get there easily, so work out which bus routes or see if there is someone who can take you. Make sure the store is for a charity that you support.;
, Be sure that the charity has the values that matter to you. Think about what you are passionate about and what big problems you want to solve.

, For example, they may not fit anymore or you've just stopped liking them. Take them to the charity store or have them collected, such as asking your friends if they have clothes they don't use.


Check that nobody else in your family wants the clothes first. Charity can start at home.

, For example, your old toys (dolls, stuffed animals, etc.), jewelry, books, etc. can be useful for donating to charity when you no longer need them.


Ensure that the items are in good condition, clean and likely to be wanted by someone else. Broken and dirty items are best recycled or disposed of.

, If you have an income or allowance, consider putting aside a little each week to donate to the charity of your choice. For example, Make a Wish, which helps to grant wishes to young children with disease.

, If you are allowed to spend some time volunteering, this can be a good choice. There are laws about what age you can volunteer in many places, and the charity may also have its own restrictions, especially if you're dealing directly with people or animals. Also, you'll need to get your parent's permission. Once that's all clear, consider giving a few hours of your time each week or month to help out at such places as animal welfare centers, charity stores, soup kitchens, backroom sorting, and so forth. Call the charity that is of interest to you and tell them that you're interested in volunteering and see what they have to offer.


You could offer to collect funds once a year or every now and then, such as at the mall or on the street on that charity's designated collection day. You will need to follow the charity's rules, be clearly identified as collecting for that charity and ensure that you are somewhere safe.

, Encourage more people to join you in making the world a better place!

, Often, High Schools or Middle Schools require volunteer work. They should have something for you to try there such as working a senior center or cleaning up the park. You can do these with your friends too!

, You can donate to thousands of different online charities as well!

Get to know her family.",How to Get to Know a Girl," Aim for many quick conversations instead of one long one, at first. If you want to be flirtatious and get a girl interested in getting to know you back, try to talk to her regularly.


Talk in the hall during passing period at school. Exchange a few quick sentences, then say, ""Talk to you later.""
Always establish that you'll talk again soon. This will help to ensure that you're thinking about her, and you'll both be thinking about each other.;
, One of the best ways to get a girl to open up more to you is to be a good listener. Focus on being a good listener. Show that you're interested in what she has to say.


Don't dominate the conversation. Ask a question instead of launching into a story. Look at her while she talks and nod your head to show that you're paying attention.
After she finishes, summarize what she said and use her name while you talk. This helps to show that you're giving her your personal attention.

, Eye contact is very important in establishing a good conversation. If you want to get to know a girl better, practice making better eye contact while you're speaking and while she's speaking.


If you struggle to keep eye contact, or it makes you feel awkward, then practice. When you watch TV, practice holding the gaze of the TV actors as long as possible, or practice picking a spot on the face near the eyes, like the nose, the eyebrow, or another spot to hold your gaze.

, If you want someone to open up to you, put them at ease by smiling. Even if you're feeling nervous, or feeling serious, or feeling the serious feelings about this girl, you need to relax yourself and relax her by flashing those pearly whites. Make your flirty talking face a smile.


Even if you don't want to get to know this girl better romantically, it's still good to establish that you like talking to her and you enjoy her presence. A smile goes a long way in doing just that.

, It's important to make sure you're not bugging someone by approaching them and asking questions. Make sure that your presence is ok by learning to read a girl's body language. If she's not into talking, she'll display some of the following body language, which means you should just end the conversation and leave her alone:


Crossed arms
Frowning
Looking down and avoiding eye contact
A furrowed brow or confused face
Turning away from you
Very brief answers to questions

, If you're nervous every time you strike up a conversation with a girl, learn to calm yourself down in the moment. Be as natural as possible. Keep it simple and straightforward by keeping the conversation short.


Lots of times, you'll be nervous because you think you won't have anything to talk about, or you'll say something dumb. We'll cover that in the next section.

, Lots of people, especially guys, talk too much about themselves in conversation. If you tend to do that when you're nervous, try to switch tactics. Instead, ask more questions and keep her talking about herself. This helps to take the pressure off of you and lets you learn a bit more about her.


Make your questions complication and probing, but relatively light. It's always good to ask, ""What did you think of that test in chemistry? Did you feel good about it?"" Immediately asking a deep question about what she thinks of religion might be a little awkward.
Use open-ended questions. If you ask, ""How are you today?"" it's easy to answer ""Fine,"" which doesn't give you much to work with. Ask a specific question that will take some time to answer: ""How's soccer going this year?""

, If you want to start a conversation and get to know a girl better, look for something that you share. This helps to build trust and companionship. If you can talk about something regularly, she'll know she can come to you about that subject.


If you're in class together, you've always got that to talk about. Talk about how you're doing, how dull the teacher's lectures are, and other class-related topics. Try to study together.
You at least know you probably live in the same town and can discuss things related to where you are. Talk about local things, hang-outs, and topics specific to where you live.

, It's much easier to talk to someone when you know what makes them laugh. Is she sarcastic? Goofy? Does she appreciate a good random line? try to find out more about what she thinks is funny.


Check out her Facebook page or other social media. What movies does she seem to like? What makes her write ""lol""?
Be careful. If you want to get to know a girl in a real way, complimenting her ""space pants"" or asking her if it hurt when she fell from Heaven usually isn't the way to go. Pick-up lines, while sometimes funny, are the most shallow way possible to start a conversation. Unless you want eye-rolls, avoid using with lines., Sometimes, the second and third conversation can be a lot more difficult than the first. Once you've covered the basic topics, what do you talk about? Learning to follow up is an essential conversational skill.


Ask about what she's been doing since you talked last. ""How did that test go?"" or ""How was your weekend?"" are good follow ups. Even just asking, ""Hey, it's been a while. What have you been up to since we talked?""
If you talk about a movie, band, or some other subject, do a little research and bring it back up. ""I listened to that band you mentioned. I really like their second record. What's your favorite?""

, Picking on a girl you like is what kids do in elementary school. It's not a good way to get to know someone on a more personal level. If you like someone and want to get to know them better, avoid controversial topics and avoid an argument.


A common pick-up artist tactic is to try to ""subtly insult"" girls to make them more vulnerable. This isn't a good way to get to know someone.
Eventually, you can and should disagree with people that you like. If you know her well, you don't have to always be agreeable. But at first, don't make a point of picking on someone, or they may get defensive or offended.

, When you get nervous, sometimes it seems like having a script would be helpful. Most of the time, this will come across as more awkward and uncomfortable than talking more naturally. Even if you're not a great conversationalist, don't be a robot reading a script.

, It's hard to get to know someone well in a group. If you want to deepen your bond, spend time alone together. Go somewhere you can have a quiet talk, like a coffee shop or a restaurant in the middle of the day.


If you go to school together, just finding a quiet place to sit, away from other students, can be a great way to have a private conversation.
It doesn't have to be a ""date,"" and calling it one can put a lot more pressure on things. Just find an excuse to hang out together and talk.

, Eventually, your conversation needs to deepen beyond talk of school and bands and movies, if you want to get to know someone better. Ask about her opinions on serious issues. Find about what she thinks about. Talk the real talk.


Stay informed about world events and politics. Ask about her opinions regarding recent elections, or talking points. Find out what she cares about.Ask about her anxieties and fears. What kind of a person is she? What keeps her up at night?

, What does she want to do with her life? Where does she want to be in ten years? What makes her happy? These are important questions that will be good to talk about down the road, if you want to get to know someone.


If you're in school together, talk about your future in school. Is she hoping to go to college? What will she study? What does she want to be beyond school?
If you're beyond school, talk about where you'd like to progress in life? Where do you want to live? Are you satisfied in your job? Do you want a family? Kids?

, Your job isn't to impress a girl, or ""wow"" her with your accomplishments.Your job is to be real if you want to get to know someone. Be yourself. Conversation is a give and take. Share deeper feelings and anxieties that you have, if you want to her learn about hers. Open up and put yourself out there.


It's possible to go too far with all the questions and come off as kind of a creep. If you never bring anything to the table, but want to know whether or not she wants kids, it won't seem like a conversation. It'll seem like an interrogation. You've got to talk about things, too.
Let her ask questions as well, but don't wait for her too. You should both be sharing about an equal amount. But if she wants to talk more, let her., Seeing how someone interacts with their family can be a very telling experience. If you want to really see what someone is like, see how they interact with their parents. See how they treat their brothers and sisters. See how their family gets along.


This might take a while, but if you've been hanging out with someone a lot, coming over for dinner, or a quick hang-out is pretty common. Let her ask you first, don't invite yourself over.
Introduce yourself to her family, and see how they react to you as well. Learning about someone's parents can be just as revealing as learning about someone.

You need to come to know yourself with your disorder first. So, keep any dating casual at first. Dating can be stressful, so you don’t want to jump into anything too fast which could trigger a relapse of your condition.Avoid using any labels like “boyfriend” or “girlfriend.” For right now, simply focus on having a good time and connecting with people you are interested in. Don’t place too much emphasis on where it will lead.;
, To slowly get back into the dating scene, consider meeting people online. The usual places for meeting people like bars and clubs may be provoke anxiety or overwhelm you. Online dating, however, offers the chance for you to connect with compatible partners from the comfort of your own home. This allows you to set the pace of the interactions and build your confidence over time.It’s entirely up to you if you choose to disclose information about your condition in your profile. Some people may choose to be straightforward about this while others may choose to disclose on an individual basis once they see how a connection progresses.
You do need to follow safety precautions when dating online. These may include refraining from posting any personal contact info like your address or last name, watching for red flags like a person who sounds too good to be true, and scheduling initial meetings in public places., If you have an existing social circle of friends, it may be nice to ask them if they have a suggestion for a date. Plus, this gives you the chance to buffer a first date in the presence of a group of people who support you.


Ask a friend or coworker if they know someone who would be a good match for you. Consider fun dates like a sporting event, miniature golf, or even preparing a meal at a friend’s home., Romantic relationships bring with them many challenges.It can be easy to get lost in your relationship and start neglecting your health. Prevent a relapse of your condition by making your health your #1 priority. Talk to your doctor and mental health providers to verify whether you are well enough to pursue a relationship or forge a deeper connection with someone else.


Continue your treatment. Even when you start feeling better, keep taking your medications and attending therapy or support group meetings.
Practice regular self-care and stress management.Nurture your physical and mental health by eating balanced meals, getting 7 to 9 hours of sleep each night, and exercising. Do activities that you enjoy like reading, hiking, or watching comedies with friends.
Know your triggers. Pay attention to the things that affect your mood, energy, or behavior and develop measures with your therapist to prevent or avoid these stimuli. Being proactive about your triggers can mean the difference between a relapse and a healthy recovery from your mental illness.

, You might feel dishonest about not telling a new date about your illness right away. However, it’s best to wait it out and see if you truly have connection with the other person before sharing news about your condition. Only discuss your mental illness once you believe you are interested in building a long-term relationship with the person.It can be emotionally draining and frustrating to disclose your diagnosis to everyone you meet, especially if the relationship isn’t going anywhere.

, There’s no point dragging out the discussion once you’ve decided to share with someone. Sometimes, beating around the bush can make things seem worse than they really are. Speak candidly with your date and only share what you feel comfortable sharing. Every detail of your mental health history need not be brought up during this first discussion. You might overwhelm them by doing so.You might say, “I care about you and I see our relationship growing stronger so I wanted to talk to you about something. A few years ago, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I take medications and see a therapist on a weekly basis to help me manage it.”

, It might be helpful to let your date know that you welcome any questions that they may have for you. Some people are ignorant about what it’s like to live with a mental illness. They here terms like depression or PTSD and associate them with stigma that they hear about in the media.Educate your date and help them better understand what you condition is like and how you are managing it.


Ask, “I want you to feel comfortable talking to me about this. Do you have any questions? I’m happy to make things more clear for you.”

, Because disclosing your diagnosis can be met with a negative reaction, some people are tempted to minimize their condition so as not to “scare” potential partners away. Avoid doing this. Keep in mind that even if you partner is initially accepting, they can always change their mind later. Refrain from giving them false hope that you condition isn’t that serious or that there is a cure.

, Even once you find that special someone and you think you are ready to take things to the next level, move slowly. This may be frustrating, but, sometimes, a mental illness can make you feel strongly for someone who is in not necessarily a good match. In order to take care of yourself and ensure that you are in a healthy relationship, take your time making any commitments., Relaying your thoughts and feelings when you are recovering from mental illness can be difficult. However, it’s important to understand that communication is a fundamental element to having a healthy and supportive relationship with your partner.Have the courage to share your feelings with your partner, and be willing to listen when they do the same. Avoid name-calling, guilt-tripping, or threatening your partner.
If you have unhealthy conflict resolution skills, try couples therapy to learn ways to fight fair and resolve arguments in a productive way.

, A healthy and secure relationship involves two partners who acknowledge and respect one another’s personal boundaries. It may seem counterproductive to set limits in your relationship, but boundaries allow both partners to express what makes them feel safe and happy in the relationship.Sit down with your partner and discuss your boundaries. For example, you might say, “Privacy is really important to me due to having obsessive-compulsive disorder. Can you please give me advanced notice whenever you come over to visit?”
It may help to do this in the presence of your therapist who can help you facilitate this discussion and brainstorm idea. Plus, this professional will have insight into your illness to know what boundaries will be most helpful to you and your partner.

, Dating with a mental illness can leave you open to becoming too dependent on your partner. It’s easy for a person recovering from a mental health crisis to latch on to a new partner, seeing them as a savior of sorts. You may come to believe that with this person you have found healing, which leads to you dropping out of treatment and stopping your medication regimen. In addition, you may start to worship this person, doing whatever they say and changing yourself to appease them. Codependency is unhealthy and can result in a setback in your mental health recovery.Keep your therapist in the loop about the progress of your relationship. By doing this, they can help you spot signs of codependency and develop measures to prevent it. Plus, if a relationship starts to take over your life, it may be necessary to end it.
You can also counteract codependency by building support networks outside the relationship. See friends and family regularly, both with and without your partner present. Pursue passions and interests of your own. Participate in support groups for people with your condition and openly share your story. All of these strategies can give you the confidence and self-efficacy to avoid entering a codependent relationship."

Stay in touch.",How to Get a Guy to Talk to You," If you want a specific guy to talk to you, start by making regular eye contact and smiling to show him that he's caught your attention. If he responds positively, but doesn't approach, go up to him instead. It's the 21st century. You don't have to wait.


Just start saying ""hi"" and using his name on a regular basis. Give him a little wave. He'll get the message.;
, All guys are different, and different situations call for different approaches. If you want to get a really social guy to notice you, try talking to him in a big group by cracking on him with some jokes. If you want to get a shy guy to notice you, that'd be a terrible idea. Try to talk to him one-on-one in private instead. But don't make it too obvious that you had a plan in the first place. Just be yourself.


If you get tongue-tied when you approach a cute guy, make sure that you plan out the basic things that you're going to say before you try and say them. This will help calm you down and make you seem more natural while you're talking.
Don't memorize a script. Even if you're feeling really nervous, it's a whole lot better to go in naturally and have a normal conversation than to try and recite something as if you're in a movie.

Once you do this, you know if you have anything in common, and if you do, then you have a conversation topic.


Even if you're not particularly knowledgeable about a particular game or a particular sport, ask him some questions about it to try and get him to open up. Guys are usually a lot more comfortable talking about ""subjects"" instead of talking about themselves.
Once you've got a conversation topic, you can start with a simple question about this topic, and this may lead to a wider conversation. For example, ""Hey, I heard you like (fill hobby in here) and was wondering if you could help me with (fill area in here).""

, Have one of your friends start you off, if you're feeling nervous. Probably one that already knows this guy. If you don't know anyone who knows him, I'm sure one of your friends will be happy to get to know him. You don't want to start out talking to him straight up. That will be awkward and uncomfortable.


Have your friend talk you up. When your friend talks to him, have him/her bring you up in a few conversations. Tell your friend to explain how you are funny, and love to laugh, and how you have a great smile. Don't be afraid to talk yourself up while asking your friend to talk you up.
Have your friend introduce you to him, and have her introduce him to you. Now is when it gets fun.

, There's no big secret to flirting. It's just talking to someone that you like, but sweetly. He'll find out sooner or later how you feel and he might feel the same.


Just worry about initiating the conversation and keeping it fun and casual so he'll want to be the one to start it next time. Because a guy won't just talk to you out of the blue, that's not how relationships work. So you have to put a little effort in, and then he'll pull his weight too.

, Boys can be a little dense. They can not see that you are an amazingly perfect girl unless you show him that you are. If this guy says something funny, cute, or smart, tell him what you thought. Say explicitly, ""That was really funny."" Guys love it when you compliment them.


Guys also appreciate sarcasm often. Try going the sarcastic route and be like ""That wasn't funny at all,"" if your guy has a sense of humor. These guys go crazy when a girl is funny and she can joke around with him.

, Guys often take your personality the wrong way because you act a certain way. So just remember to be yourself. If he doesn't like you for you, then that's his problem.

, If there seems to be someone else he might like, or does like, it's important to find out whether or not they're dating. If they are, you should probably wait to flirt. If he's single, and only has a crush on someone else, make sure to be better friends with him than this other person. Try and get closer with him to win his affections.

, If you want to ""bump into"" a guy on a regular basis, you can start making your own fate work for you. Find out where his locker is, so you can bump into him in the hallway before class starts. Or just ""accidentally"" sit at his table during lunch.


This can seem creepy if it becomes obvious. Don't start stalking this guy through the hallways. Don't bump into him more than a few times a week, if you go to school together. If you just live in the same town, no more than once a week.

, It's a lot easier to talk and get a guy to open up if you're not in a big group, and aren't trying to carry on a big conversation. If you want a guy to get to know you, try pulling him aside in the hallway during passing period for a conversation, or sitting with him on the bus.

, Never try to change your personality to make yourself ""cooler"" or ""more noticeable."" You may see other girls doing this and it might work for them, but those girls will be replaceable, because they're not authentic. You are one of a kind. Be yourself, so when you do reel this guy in, he'll definitely want to keep you.


Who wants to be someone they're not for the sake of a relationship? It doesn't matter how good-looking or ""perfect"" the guy is. If you have to compromise on your values, beliefs, ideals, worldview and personality to attract him, then he's not worth it.

, You don't need to change the way you dress or the way you look to get a guy to talk to you. The only secret is that you need to dress in a way that makes you feel comfortable and confident. The more confident you feel, the more attractive you'll be to a guy.


Guys are attracted to confidence, because confident girls are not clingy, and do not need anyone to complete them. Being someone's other half is a big responsibility. What you're looking for is someone to complement you, not to complete you.
Make-up isn't always necessary, but if it helps you feel confident then go for it. A guy might think that if a girl believes that she is worth the time and effort to groom herself and to look pretty, then she is probably worth his time too.

, To stay out of the friend zone you have to keep flirting with him, if its obvious he's not getting the hints, flirt more seriously. ""Accidently"" bump his hand when you guys are walking, lean in a little closer than you need to when you're talking. and if you really want him to like you, or at least know if he does, just tell him. make sure its at the right time and place though, and do it with a flirty tone.


Being friends is a good way to get to know someone first. The ""friend zone"" is kind of a myth in a lot of situations. Many close friendships turn into relationships later. If you like each other, you like each other. Simple as that.

, Sometimes, guys appreciate a straightforward approach. They appreciate knowing that someone likes them (who doesn't?) and it'll make things a lot easier to get that out of the way.


Just ask him if he likes you, and tell him you like him. If he says he doesn't feel the same way, it's his loss.

, When you let someone know that you like them, it can get intense pretty quickly, or it can kind of fall off. It can be a little awkward letting someone know that you like them. That's OK. It's a good idea to reach out via text or via DM on Instagram to chat a little bit outside of your one-on-one interactions. This can be much less awkward, and let you continue getting to know each other even better.


Text him often, but not obsessively. and make sure he feels comfortable with texting you all the time. If not, take it back a step. Still just be friends for a while. If he is comfortable with it, then that's great!

Be confident.,
Smile a lot.,
Rehearse the things you like talking about.,
Care for your body.,
Dress smartly.,
Have good grades.,
Be friendly with people.,
Be prepared to talk to everyone.,
Listen.,
Enjoy yourself at parties and other social events.",How to Get Social With Kids of Your Age," Confidence is about knowing that you matter and are as valuable as the next person. Confidence is about knowing that you are worth knowing. Moreover, confidence is about feeling beautiful and valued without having to have someone else tell you this.


More than anything, confidence attracts. People love being near someone who has obvious self-confidence.;
, Smiling attracts people because it's a sign of friendliness and approachability.

, If you feel tongue-tied talking to others, realize that this isn't unusual. Practice talking about a set of things that interest you. Stand in front of the mirror and practice talking about a few topics that you know a lot about; watch your facial expression, how your hands move and listen to the things you say. Are there changes you could make to improve how you say things and what you're saying? By practicing, you build up the confidence to talk more about these and other topics with other people.


Things you could talk about include: Hobbies, sports, studies, your pets, travel (or places you'd like to go), future plans, passions, etc.

, Clean your teeth daily, maintain good hygiene and look after your hair. Wear sunscreen to protect your skin and have a good skin care regime. There is no need to be obsessed with your looks; just care for yourself properly so that you present well and keep healthy. Good grooming is a sign of being willing to spend time presenting yourself well to others.

, Whatever your preferred style, wear it well. It doesn't matter what your age, size or height are; what matters is that the clothes you wear are neat, clean and worn well. Choose clothes that suit you best and are comfortable for you. Fix any missing buttons, tears, loose threads, etc. so that your clothing looks well cared for.

, Good grades give you confidence, are a sign of self-care and also give you something to talk about with others. Being known as someone who does well at school also opens up the opportunities for tutoring others in need.


If you get good grades, don't talk about them too much. Your friends of classmates that doesn't have as good grades as you might get jealous.

, By being open to all, you open the possibility of future friendships. Most importantly, don't wait for others to be friendly to you––lead the way by showing them how!


Try not to make assumptions about the people you're meeting for the first time; you don't know them yet, and there are many things to learn about them.

, You've rehearsed your topics, so you know you have things to talk about. Try to find common connections with people, no matter how much of a challenge the other person may seem at first. Realize that often the most difficult people are wanting most to be understood; maybe this is something you can do.


Don't ignore people on purpose; it's unkind and it cuts off the chance that that person may just be the most interesting person in the room.

, Although you may enjoy talking, remember to listen more than you talk. Being an earnest listener draws people out and they feel a deeper connection with you; this encourages them to see you positively and to know that you're not only thinking about yourself.


Learn the paraphrase what people say, namely, summarize what they've said and say it back to them by way of showing you've heard. This is not the same as agreeing; you do not need to see eye-to-eye with someone to have a good conversation and to learn about each other.
Catch yourself if you want to interrupt. Be genuinely interested in what you're hearing instead, focusing on getting to know this person better.
Be patient; most times you will get your turn to speak too. If not, then you know that this person is probably not good friend material, at least not with you.

, See such events as a chance to meet new people, to talk to people you know and to have a good time. You don't have to stay a long time if you feel overwhelmed; do quality time instead.

, Say random things like ""Meep eep a deep"" and ""Oh snap"" when you and your friends are in an awkward silence.

Make positive comments about others and be willing to help your classmates, but remember to take care of yourself as well. Additionally, when necessary, express your true feelings and thoughts in an appropriate manner. Although being amicable can be a vital element to building a strong reputation, you should be cautious about reining in too many emotions for the sake of maintaining an optimistic appearance. Otherwise, you may eventually appear fake to others or pile unnecessary stress and pressure upon yourself.;
, Even if you may feel insecure, appearing self-assured of yourself increases the chances of gaining attention, approval, and perhaps admiration. Small changes, such as straightening your posture and walking with long, quick strides, can transform your appearance and cause you to appear confident. When speaking to others, you can maintain eye contact and speak in a slightly firm voice. If others attempt to bully or demean you, give them an assertive, polite response. For instance, if a classmate calls you ugly, you can tell them something along the lines of, ""Thanks for sharing your opinion!"" or ""You can think whatever you want about me.""

, A good way to gain attention is to become friendly with your classmates, as well as people outside of your class. Although it may not be possible to become close friends with everyone, you can try to at least be on amicable terms with the majority of your class so that they think of you in a positive manner. Even if you dislike someone, remain polite and neutral so that they cannot accuse you of being negative. When maintaining friendships, remember to be realistic and avoid overwhelming yourself with too many meetings and events. Depending on how many friends you have, you may not be able to see them every day, so do your best to spread your time among them. If you cannot spend a lot of time with certain friends, be sure to at least stop and ask how they are doing so that they do not feel abandoned or left out.

, You can try being open and friendly towards others, as long as you are comfortable. Furthermore, while you should not erase your personality for the sake of popularity, assess yourself and decide if there are any highly negative habits that may upset your reputation. For instance, if you have a tendency to be overly loud around others or spread rumors, you can do your best to stop doing that.

, Although you should not partake in spreading rumors or become heavily involved in others' personal lives, you can keep an ear out for gossip so that you know about current events in your school. However, avoid blackmailing your classmates, tearing down their character, or fishing too frequently for gossip; otherwise, your reputation may be tarnished, and others might view you in a negative light.

, Although it can be easy to ignore your studies in favor of fun, you should remember your priorities. You are in school to gain an education so that you are well-prepared and equipped for a future career which can lead towards success. Your current surroundings and social circles will not last forever, so it is important to prepare for the future. Furthermore, having good grades will boost your reputation, cause you to appear intelligent, and perhaps prompt people to seek your assistance.

, Presenting a positive image of yourself online can help you gain people's approval and give them a better idea of your personal identity. Follow your classmates and friends so that they may follow you in return. Post appropriate images that reflect your personality and interests, and be sure to include various pictures so that they are new and unique. For instance, instead of solely posting selfies, try to take pictures of different subjects, such as your pets, delicious meals, friends, and gatherings or outings with your classmates and friends. If you are not comfortable with sharing images of your face, do not feel ashamed, and remember that your comfort is important.


Look at other popular girls' accounts for inspiration. Based on the style of their pictures, what are your first impressions of the person? If you are pleased with their style, think of a way that you can imitate it while remaining as original as possible. Avoid completely copying someone; otherwise, people may label you as a copycat.
If you want to, edit your pictures. However, experience and hours of editing are not necessary, especially since you can simply find a nice filter to enhance your images. Be sure that you keep your editing as light as possible so that your natural beauty shines through, allowing others to see you as you truly are.
Try not to become absorbed by social media or allow your life to revolve around it. Allow yourself to take a break from it, and avoid spending too much time with the camera.
Be careful about who you share your pictures with, as well as what you post. For instance, avoid posting your location or landmarks that will allow people to determine your whereabouts. Furthermore, remember that your pictures represent your personality, affect your reputation, and can be spread by others. Do not allow unknown people to follow you, especially if they do not attend your school.

, A well-balanced, organic diet can help boost your health while leaving space for some treats, such as candy and chips. Protein and calcium are important. Although you should eat what you like, remember to maintain control over your eating habits and avoid frequently consuming high-fat, unhealthy foods. To get a better idea of how you eat, you can start a food diary to mark down your food while planning future meals. If you want, you can also look up healthy recipes to try. To remain fit, be sure to exercise for at least thirty minutes a day. If you have a tight schedule, you can split the time up into three ten-minute sessions. Running, yoga, sports, walking your dog, or dancing are all good ways to remain active.

, Maintain basic habits, such as daily showers, brushing and flossing your teeth, and keeping your face clean with cleanser, toner, and moisturizer.

, Your wardrobe should consist mainly of tank tops, cardigans, jeans, oversized sweaters, leggings, shorts, skirts, and dresses. Make sure you have a good amount of t-shirts too. They don't have to make you look like a model, but they have to make you look good.But make sure its like sexy or hot.

, Wash your face every day with a face wash if necessary. Put a moisturizing face cream on every time you wash your skin. Do not put Vaseline or sticky body cream on your face.

, Popular girls care about their appearance, so to make your fashion or outfit even more cute wear some accessories. Don't be afraid to go for a nice long necklace or maybe even five skinny brackets. Even check in magazines to check the popular trends.

, Cutting it short is cute, or if you want long hair, you can do more things with it. It depends on whether you want it short or long. If you want, get some highlights or colored streaks. Make sure they look good on you. Side bangs and layers are good too. Style your hair in ponytails, updos, braids, and curls. You could also just add a nice headband or clip. Make sure you treat your hair nicely. Shampoo and condition weekly depending on your hair type. Only condition your ends because conditioner can make your roots greasy.{a{fact}}


Hair is a massive part of your look. If your hair is naturally straight, straighten it further so that it is perfectly straight and then see the look of shock on other people's faces when you inform them it's naturally that style! If your hair is naturally curly or wavy, you can enhance that too or straighten it if that is what you want, not changing who you are. At school, carry around with you or have in your locker a giant hairbrush so that you can brush your hair with a minimum amount of strokes at a time, creating the illusion that your hair is always perfect.

Avoid inappropriate behavior.",How to Earn the Respect of Your Peers at School," Everyone deserves respect, and the best way to earn it is to show it to other people. You need to respect everyone in your school, including younger students, upperclassmen, friends, strangers, and teachers. Don’t make fun of, tease, or gossip about your peers.Respect other people’s property as well. Never take something that isn’t yours, and if someone lends you something be sure to return it in the condition you received it.;
, If you see someone, whether it’s a friend or a stranger, being bullied, step in and stand up for the person. Similarly, if you’re being bullied, stand up for yourself. Your peers will respect you for standing up for yourself as well as helping others. The worst thing you can do is stand by when someone is being bullied, and not take action.For example, say to the bully “Hey, man, that’s not cool. You shouldn’t talk to Susie like that.”

, Your peers will respect you if you are someone whom people can come to and feel like they are being genuinely heard. If a friend or classmate wants to talk to you about something, give them your full attention, make eye contact, and demonstrate empathy.For instance, if a classmate tells you that her dog just died, say something like “Wow, I’m really sorry to hear that. I remember how hard it was when my dog, Tally, died last year. Is there anything I can do to help?”

, You can demonstrate kindness by holding the door for the person behind you or helping a peer pick up the books they dropped. Don’t single someone out, tease them, or spread rumors. Doing so will not earn you respect from your classmates., Greet people when you see them and acknowledge them when they are speaking to you. Say “please” and “thank you” often. You should also say “excuse me” and always apologize when necessary.For instance, if you bump into someone in the hallway and they drop their books, help them pick them up. Say “I’m sorry Jack, I didn’t see you there. Let me help you.”

, It can be difficult to be the bigger person in a tough situation, but your peers will certainly respect you for it. If someone attacks or pushes you, be mature and handle the situation the right way. Don’t be afraid to talk to a teacher or counselor if you feel you don’t have the tools or the authority to handle the situation correctly.


For example, if a classmate insults you, laugh it off or walk away. Don’t stoop to their level by calling them names or getting into a physical fight.

, Being a leader will gain the respect of your peers. Leaders are confident and prepared for all situations. To show your peers you are a leader, you can become the captain of a team or club, join the student council/government, or offer to tutor others in areas you excel in., When people recognize that you are active in school teams or groups, they will respect your efforts and see you as a leader. Try out for the soccer team, join the chess club, or become a member of the drama club.

, People who are open-minded earn more respect than those that are close-minded and think their way is the only right way to do something. Accept that people come from different backgrounds, religions, and cultures, and while these factors may make people different, they don’t make them better or worse than anyone else., If you are an asocial person, then you may have a hard time getting the respect you may feel you want from your fellows and peers. Try to find out what you may have in common with your peers, such as strong organizational skills, a talent for basketball, or a love for sci-fi.


Take small steps to relate to others, such as commenting on a classmate’s shirt if it has your favorite band logo on it.

, Starting a conversation with someone you don’t know very well can seem daunting. However, being friendly to others and striking up a conversation can help you earn respect. It’s as easy as sharing something funny that happened to you, or asking about an assignment or project.


For example, say “Wow, I’m super tired. I was up late cleaning because my dog knocked over a can of paint in the living room!”
You could also say “Have you started your history project yet? I’m thinking of doing mine on the Titanic.”

, Both teachers and peers will give you criticism during your time at school. If the criticism is constructive, rather than blatantly rude, say something like, “Wow, thanks for pointing that out, I didn’t notice it before.” Likewise, when someone compliments you, don’t laugh or brush it off. Instead, show the person that you appreciate their words.


For instance, if someone compliments your outfit, say something like “Thank you! I got this at T.J. Maxx. Green is my favorite color.”

, People who lie will quickly lose the respect of their friends and peers. If you are seen as untrustworthy, it’s hard to be respected. Tell the truth, and own up to it when you make a mistake. Taking responsibility for your words and actions goes a long toward showing others that you are mature and deserve their respect., It’s important that you stay true to yourself, and don’t let others influence you negatively. Don’t feel as though you have to change your interests or opinions based on what others like. A strong sense of self will earn the respect of others.


For instance, if everyone in your peer group is eating pizza for lunch, and you don’t like pizza, don’t feel as though you have to eat it too. Select what you like, and if someone comments on it, simply say “I’m not a big fan of pizza. I like getting my lunch from the salad bar better.”

, Show people what you are good at, and encourage them to do the same. Everyone has unique skills, so don’t worry if you aren’t good at everything you try. Simply showcase the things you do well, and appreciate others that can do things that you may struggle with.For example, if you are a skilled runner, join the track or cross-country team.
If someone you know has a great voice, encourage them to join the choir or try out for the spring musical.

, Intelligence is a highly respected trait, so don’t be afraid of letting people see your smart side. You should give all your schoolwork maximum effort, volunteer answers in class, and offer to tutor a student having trouble with something you understand well. Don’t brag or boast about your intelligence, though, just let it speak for itself.

, Make others laugh by telling them a good joke or a funny story. You can even do an Internet search for funny jokes so you have a few on hand at any given time. Just avoid jokes that demean or make fun of different genders or racial groups.

, Confidence goes hand in hand with respect. Accept and love yourself for you who are, flaws and all. Dress in clothes that make you feel good and always have a smile ready to share with friends or peers., This a no-brainer, because participating means you're letting your voice be heard in front of your whole class. If you have a difficult time answering questions posed by your teacher, try asking questions instead. Other students who were wondering the same thing will be glad you brought up the topic., Strong communication skills can help you earn your peers’ respect. If you have difficulty getting your point across, try some exercises to help you strengthen your skills. For example, read a newspaper or magazine article and practice summarizing it. This will help you weed out unnecessary information while providing the key points., Think about how others will react to your actions, and about how your actions make you look to others. Don’t tell jokes that are in bad taste, gossip, or spread rumors. Avoid arguing with your peers and never resort to physical altercations.

, Creating sexual tension with eye contact can create a healthy attraction. Never stare at a girl. This is just a rude thing to do. Instead make short glances at her and look at her eyes. Hopefully she'll meet your eye contact and then turn away. Continue this until you both hold eye contact longer than the previous time.

, Girls don't like guys who are pretending to be someone else. They'll like you for you. If you were pretending to be someone else before, then just be yourself. She might like you if you relax and stop trying to change for other people.

, Friends of a girl you like are usually easier to talk to. Be casual and ask about the girl you like. Say something like, ""Does Jessie have a boyfriend?"" or ""What's Jessie's type""? They'll either tell you or they won't. The important thing is that they'll probably tell the girl and the more they talk about you, the better your chances are.

, Continue being yourself, but if there are certain thoughts you have that might be rude, keep them to yourself. There's always some give and take, so make sure you're not being a jerk.

Even though she says she doesn't like you, she might want you to try harder to get her attention. The key is to become better friends with her and spend more time together. You'll know her real intentions by her body language and the vibes she's sending., Once you've become a little bit closer with this girl, you can try again. You have to vary the way you present yourself to her. She may not of liked what you said to her the first time. If she says no or looks really uncomfortable, don't force it.


Be honest to her.

Extend your right hand.,
Grasp their hand.,
Pump their hand two or three times.,
Release their hand and lean back.",How to Shake Hands1," Leave three or four feet (1-1.25 meters) between the two of you.You should both be able to comfortably extend your arms to shake hands. If you stand too close, you may come across as creepy. However, if you stand too far away, they may think that you don’t want to shake hands.



Use good posture when shaking someone’s hand. This will make you look confident.
If you’re sitting, rise before shaking someone’s hand.;

Smile while you extend your hand. Otherwise, you may come across as aggressive.
If the person’s right hand is injured, offer your left hand instead.

Notice if she laughs at your jokes, even when they are not funny.",How to Find Out Whether a Girl Loves You or Is Just Being a Good Friend1," If a girl looks down when she first sees you, or if she lowers her head while smiling, it’s a strong indicator that she’s attracted to you. It can be hard to look someone in the eye when you have strong feelings that are not yet exposed.


Triangulation describes a pattern of eye movement that is a strong indicator that a girl is into you. She will look at one eye, then the other, then your mouth, and then repeat the sequence.;
, Playing with hair causes blood to flow and makes you feel connected with your body, so if you notice a girl twirling hair, it’s a positive sign., If a girl leans in close to you, makes an excuse to touch you, or lets each tough linger for a longer period of time, then she may see you as more than a friend.If she touches your shoulder, brushes your hand, or hugs you for no real reason, it is a positive indication she likes you.
If a girl wants to share a drink or food with you, chances are she is way into you., If a girl has a big smile every time you two have a conversation, and laughs nonstop, then she thoroughly enjoys your company. This is an unconscious way of saying, “I really like you, and I love listening to you talk"".When in love, you see that person through rose-colored glasses, making everything that person says seem perfect and funny.

Offer to provide support.,
Take on the responsibilities that you can.,
Help them stay healthy.,
Let them know you respect their autonomy.",How to Respect Your Elders1," Elders often need some kind of support with simple day to day tasks. They may need help reading their mail, or they may need almost constant care due to health concerns. Begin by letting the elder in your life know that you would like to provide help.


Don’t make assumptions about what the person needs or wants. Always ask before providing any kind of help. If you don’t, the person may feel that you think they’re incompetent or don’t respect them.
You can say something like, “Grandmother, I know you may not need it, but if you’d like some help around the house or running errands, I’d love to do that for you.”;
, You might not be able to provide all of the care that the person needs. For example, if someone needs nursing around the clock, it’s unlikely that you’ll be able to provide that. However, you can take on the responsibility of hiring and paying a nurse, or arranging for a rotation of family members to provide the necessary care.In some cultures, it’s considered disrespectful or a failure to hire someone outside the family to care for an elder.
Don’t overextend yourself. Taking care of an elder may create some change in your life, but it shouldn’t cause you to lose your job or abandon your other obligations.

, Elders may have a hard time staying active and eating healthy meals. They may be less mobile than they used to be. Shopping and cooking may be difficult for them. Do what you can to make sure they’re eating right and getting gentle exercise.


Visit the person regularly and go for a walk with them. Even a short walk provides fresh air and movement.
Bring them food when you come for a visit. You can bring food you’ve prepared ahead of time, or groceries they can easily make use of. That way, they won’t need to expend a lot of energy to get a nutritious meal.
If you can’t bring them food, look into programs such as Meals on Wheels that deliver food to the elderly.

, Losing the ability to take care of oneself can be difficult and sometimes embarrassing for people. Make sure that the elder knows that you still respect them and don’t think of them as infirm.


You can say things like, “I know you can cook for yourself, but I enjoy making meals that I can share with you.”
You can also say, “Please let me know if there’s anything you need. I’m happy to help, but I can respect that you like to do things on your own.”

Position your legs.,
Use your sporran to your advantage, if you spread your legs.,
Be aware of your surroundings.",How to Sit in a Kilt2," You have a couple of options for positioning your legs. You can spread your legs (and tuck your sporran and kilt between them). You can also cross your calves or your legs, but this may not be as comfortable., Press down on the front part of the kilt and your sporran. This should allow the kilt to fall between your legs., Every few minutes, check to make sure that you’re still sitting on your kilt. You should also make sure that you are not exposing yourself because of the positioning of your kilt. Even if it feels unnatural at first, it will become second nature with time!

Know her type.,
Stay on her good side.,
Recognize flirting.,
Flirt with her.,
Tell her your feelings.,
Ask her out.",How to Change a Girl's Mind2," Being friends with her will give you access to what she's looking for in a guy. You could even casually ask her if she thinks Jim Smith is attractive, and then find out why. Talking about her attraction to other boys may remind her of your feelings.

, If she has put you in the friend zone, you have one thing going for you: she doesn't mind being around you. Don't mess this up by annoying her and pestering her for a romantic date. This will take time if it's even possible.

, Sometimes a girl will act like she put you in the friend zone, but sometimes she's interested in you. Friends can become big influences on how she acts towards you. Notice her actions, gestures, and hints such as smiling and laughing when things aren't that funny. Pay attention if she is noticeably worried about her appearance around you., This can be tricky because you don't want to appear too attached or engrossed by her. Acting somewhat disinterested will make her more interested. Create a strange balance of cute gestures and slight bullying in a playful way.Do not go overboard with bullying her or else she won't want to be friends at all.
Being sarcastic can go a long way.

, Open yourself up to her. Sometimes you really need to put yourself in the spotlight. Try to say it casually and to her face.Try something like:


""I know we've been friends for a while, but I've started to develop feelings for you.""
""her name, I like you""

, She probably won't tell you she likes you back. Once the seed of your feelings has been planted in her mind, invite her out. See if she wants to go to the movies, play laser tag, or bowl with you over the weekend. This will make her think of how she sees you. She'll decide if it is a date or not. The decision is always hers.


You should know what she likes to do. Pick something to do where you can both let loose and have fun.

"
"
Observe this girl.,
Take on a common interest.,
Say something in passing.,
Be funny.,
Hold a conversation.,
Be friendly to her friends.,
Ask her out again.,
Respect her decision.",How to Change a Girl's Mind3," Don't stalk her to find out what she is doing. Casually look for clues when she is nearby. Notice if she is reading a book whenever you see her. Observe what she is wearing. Does she like wearing a Sublime t-shirt?


Look her up on social media. Everyone stalks each other on social media sites, so you don't need to feel guilty about doing it. Look at her interests!

, Only do this if you are interested in this interest. Don't start wearing a Shania Twain t-shirt if you don't like her music. Pick up a book that she's reading. You want to have a genuinely shared connection. Pretending won't get you anywhere.

, There is a chance she had never seen you before, and didn't want to take a chance. Start saying hello to her whenever you pass her. Small gestures of kindness can go a long way. Hopefully she'll respond or smile back to you.


You could ask her ""what time it is?""
Compliment her outfit by saying, ""that's a pretty dress,"" or work with what she's wearing.

, A good way for this girl to recognize what a good catch you are is to be funny. Telling knock knock jokes may not work. Showcase your natural humor when she is nearby. Don't be offensive and tell inappropriate jokes. She could get offended or creeped out by this., Try to strike up a natural conversation about something. This can be hard because you are trying to appear casual when you may not feel casual. Wait for a good opportunity like waiting for an elevator or stuck waiting for the bus. These are good places to share a thought.


You are shooting for her to look at you and actually talk to you.
Talk about an easy topic like the weather or a recent celebrity's antics.

, You can try to approach her friends and ask questions about this girl. Even if you just do small gestures, they could think it's sweet and tell the girl you like. You really just want her group of friends to notice you and think you're nice. Once you have conversations circling around about you, you'll have a better shot.

, Be sure not use the same line or approach as you did before. You want to catch her off guard, but also impress her. Try complimenting her as you do this.

, She is entitled to her decisions and you need to respect that. Nobody likes someone who complains when they don't get what they want."

Avoid offering a handshake unannounced.,
Don’t use inappropriate pressure.,
Don’t extend a sweaty hand.",How to Shake Hands2," If you offer someone your extended hand when they aren’t paying attention, they may not shake your hand. While this situation is embarrassing, it doesn’t mean that the other person is unwilling to shake your hand. Instead, announce yourself with a greeting or a farewell to get their attention. Some examples of good phrases include:


“Hey, Robert! It’s been a while, how are you doing?”
“Excuse me, Mrs. Becker? Hi, I’m Ian. I work in the Engineering department. It’s nice to meet you!”
“We’re headed out, James. Thanks for the wonderful party! We had a great time!”

, This can include grasping someone’s hand too firmly or letting your hand go limp mid-handshake. If you apply too much pressure, you’ll come across as arrogant and aggressive. However, if you shake someone’s hand too limply they may think you don’t care about meeting them.Practice with a friend if you need help gauging your handshake pressure.

, If you give someone a sweaty hand to shake, you may gross them out. Before shaking their hand, subtly dry your own hand against the side of your pants or skirt.If you’re holding a drink, hold it in your left hand so that the condensation doesn’t make your hand feel wet and sweaty.


If you experience chronic hand sweat, spray your hands with an antiperspirant once a day. This will help your hands stay dry.

Shake hands during an introduction.,
Extend a hand for greetings and goodbyes.,
Keep other customs in mind.,
Understand unique handshake variations.",How to Shake Hands3," Many people consider it polite to shake hands during introductions. Therefore, it’s usually a good idea to extend a hand whenever you meet someone for the first time. If someone else is introducing you, wait for them to finish speaking before shaking someone’s hand. While you’re shaking hands, offer a greeting such as:


“Hi, I’m Jane. It’s nice to meet you!”
“Nice to meet you, I’m Jeremy.”
“It’s a pleasure.”
“Hi, how’re you doing?”

, If you’re close friends with someone and don’t usually shake hands, it would be awkward to try. However, depending on the formality of the situation, it may be appropriate to shake hands when greeting or saying goodbyes. Some examples of appropriate situations include:


Greeting an older person or family member
Greeting someone in a professional setting
When arriving at or leaving a nice party
When you haven’t seen a friend in a while, Most Western countries use a firm handshake as a greeting. However, there are many countries around the world where there are different ways to politely show respect. If you’re traveling in a foreign country or meeting up with foreign friends, research the greeting etiquette ahead of time. For example:


In Russia, men shake hands with other men but kiss women’s hands.
In South Korea, the senior person initiates the handshake. Use a soft grip while shaking hands.
In Morocco, only people of the same gender can shake hands.
In Turkey, firm handshakes are considered rude. Instead, use a soft grip.
In China, always greet the oldest person first. Bow slightly while shaking their hand. , If you’re a part of an organization, you may need to learn a special handshake to subtly identify yourself to other members. Similarly, you can use popular handshake variations to show that you’re a part of particular cultural group. For example, many people use the homie handshake when greeting close friends. Some other examples include:


The Freemason handshake. This handshake is top secret and used by Freemasons to identify other members of their group.
The Scout handshake. Both Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts shake hands with their left hands when greeting other scouts.The Parent Trap handshake. This handshake, popular with movie buffs, is from the movie Parent Trap.

Pay attention to how she treats you in comparison with other guy friends.,
Observe her behavior when you are in a group.,
See how well she knows your interests.,
Do a jealousy test.,
Pay attention to how her friends treat you.,
Listen for certain statements she makes around you.,
Take note of who initiates conversation.",How to Find Out Whether a Girl Loves You or Is Just Being a Good Friend2," If she likes you, she'll probably act more shy or blush a lot when you are around. If she treats you the same as other guy friends, chances are she just wants to be friends.

, If a girl likes you, she may give you tons of attention, even if she is around other people. This is because you are the one she prefers talking to and spending time with., If a girl has romantic feelings for you, she will remember specific details about what you say. For example, she will remember when you said you prefer chicken to steak, or keep track off all your favorite songs., See if she gets angry and jealous when you flirt with another girl. If she seems bothered, or starts asking you what you were talking about with that other girl, then she may have romantic feelings for you., If they show a sudden interest in you or ask you a lot of personal questions, chances are they are trying to get to know you better because their friend has strong feelings for you.


If they try to tease you when the girl is around, it is probably because she likes you.

, When a girl likes you, she will indirectly express it when you two hang out. Here are some things she may say:


""I love spending time with you.""
""You're my favorite person.""
""You are so funny.""

, If a girl always starts a conversation with you, especially if she has no real reason to talk to you in the first place, she’s definitely interested!


If she sends you text messages just to say hi, or that she's thinking about you, it's a good sign.

Be straightforward and ask how she feels.,
Ask questions about love and romance.,
Ask a mutual friend how she feels.,
Find out how she talks about you when you are not around.,
Initiate a date.",How to Find Out Whether a Girl Loves You or Is Just Being a Good Friend3," It is okay to ask someone about their feelings for you.It may seem embarrassing at first, but if she cares about you, either as a friend or something more, she will get over it and appreciate that you feel comfortable enough to be open and honest. Here are some ways you can ask:


""How do you feel about me?""
""Do you see me as a friend, or do you see me becoming something more?""

, If you do not want to come straight out and ask how she feels about you, then ask questions about love that may help you figure things out. Here are some questions you can ask:


""How do you feel about falling in love?""
""Do you think people can fall in love after being good friends?""

, Girls tell their friends almost everything. If you are too nervous to directly ask a girl if she has feelings for you, casually ask a friend she is close to. Be aware that once you start inquiring to friends, they will likely report what you said back to this girl. Here are casual questions you can ask:


""Do you know if she like anyone?""
""Does she ever talk about dating?""

, If a girl finds a reason to constantly bring up your name, speaks positively of you when you are not around, or smiles when your name is mentioned, she has strong feelings for you.

, Build up some courage and ask this girl to see a movie with you, or grab dinner. If she dresses up, or puts on more makeup than usual, then she is trying to impress you. A girl who loves you will want to stand out in your eyes by looking great and being fun.

Visit them.,
Slow down.,
Be polite.,
Ask them about their life.,
Accept generational differences.",How to Respect Your Elders2," Life can be lonely for elders. If they don’t have a spouse or family living with them, they may not see very many people on a regular basis. Try to visit them whenever you can make the time.If you can’t visit regularly because of distance, make a point of calling to talk to them on the phone.
Try to make visits or calls on a regular schedule. Sometimes surprise visits or irregular schedules can be disorienting for an elder. Visiting every Wednesday afternoon, for example, can be a regular activity that the person can look forward to.

, As people age, they process things and move more slowly. Your elder may need you to walk more slowly or repeat things that you say. Avoid showing impatience and remember that they’re doing all they can to keep up.Elders may have a particularly difficult time using or understanding newer technology. You may need to go very slowly when showing them how to use it, or you may choose to not introduce new technologies into their lives.
Let the elder set the pace for things like walking or preparing meals.

, Most elders will have a strong sense of propriety and etiquette. Their expectations for how people talk to each other are likely very different than yours. Don’t use the same kinds of slang and casual manners that you would use around your peers.If the elder is not a member of your family, refer to them as Mr., Miss, or Mrs. If they tell you to call them by their first name, you can then feel free to do so.
In some cultures, elders expect to be referred to as “sir,” “ma’am,” or something equivalent.
Always make sure that they have food before you serve yourself, and that they have a place to sit before you or other younger people are seated.
Avoid paying attention to your phone or computer when you’re with an elder. Try to keep your focus on them and your quality time together.

, Asking an elder about themselves is one of the best ways to show respect. It indicates that you are interested in who they are and that you respect the fact that they’ve lived a long life and have things to teach you.You can ask them to tell stories from their life. You can ask something like, “Do you remember anything from your time in the war?” or, “Where did your family move after they sold the business?”
If they're a member of your family, you can ask them about your family tree. This is a great way to learn about your own history. You can say something like, “Where did your mother’s family come from?” or “Did you know any of the people on Grandfather’s side?”

, This may be the most difficult thing for people of all ages to do. However, it’s important to remember that cultural norms and expectations change across generations. Things that seem perfectly normal to you may seem unthinkable to someone two generations older than you and vice versa.If matters of politics or social norms become a wedge between you and your elder, try to let it go. You can say something like, “I understand where you’re coming from, but I think we might just disagree,” or, “We can do things that way here, if you want. But at home I’ll probably still do things the way that works for me.”
You can also ask the person to talk about where they’re coming from. Be sure to do so in a way that doesn’t convey judgement, though. For example, you can say something like, “Tell me more about why you don’t believe in divorce. That sounds really interesting to me,” or, “I’d love to know more about what you like about your church.”

Ask about their heritage.,
Invite them to engage in cultural or religious practices.,
Celebrate life’s milestones.,
Absorb and adapt traditional practices.",How to Respect Your Elders3," Many elders today grew up in a time when cultural and religious traditions were a more central part of daily life. No matter their heritage, chances are that someone who's your elder has some connection to traditions that may be lost in a generation or two if they’re not passed down.Ask about traditional or culturally specific foods. Your elder may be able to teach you the most authentic way to prepare homemade tortillas, matzo balls, or tzatziki.
Your elder may have a different first language than you. Ask if they could teach you some important phrases. This is especially welcome when the elder speaks a language or dialect that’s declined in its usage, such as Native American languages.
If the elder is someone in your family, this is a great way to learn about your own history and heritage. If they're not of your heritage, it can be a great way to learn about another culture.

, Your elder may have grown up attending religious services regularly, or community events such as parades and dances. Let them know you’d like to attend something like that with them.Look for relevant events in your town. For example, your British grandmother may enjoy attending an evening of English country dancing.
Even if you don’t personally practice a religion, going with an elder to a religious event they connect to can be very meaningful for them.

, In some cultures, reaching specific ages, such as 60 or 70, is celebrated with big parties. Make sure to mark milestones in the elder’s life. This honors the fact that good things are still happening in their life and they’re still active.You can celebrate an elder’s retirement or the anniversary of an accomplishment in their life.
An elder may not have the energy or will to gather many people for a party. Take on that responsibility yourself to show them how many people love and care about them.

, You may not agree with everything your elder has to say. Still, there may be kernels of wisdom that you can adapt to your own life. Let them know how what they’ve taught you is useful to you.If there’s a specific proverb from your culture that’s resonant to you, share that with your elder. Let them know what it means to you.
Find a way to express your heritage that is authentic to you. For example, it may not make sense for you to go about your life in your culture’s traditional clothing, but you can wear some jewelry or other accessories that represent your culture.

Increase your vocabulary.,
Correct your grammar.,
Use slang sparingly.,
Stay humble.,
Be silent.",How to Present Yourself As an Educated Person1," The way in which you speak and words you choose communicate a lot to others in each conversation you have. The vocabulary you use is not only a sign of intelligence in conversation but is also a major component in the measurement of your Intelligence Quotient (IQ) and education level on intelligence and achievement tests.Increasing your vocabulary will help you to improve that perception as well as:


Avoid repetition.
Express yourself succinctly.
Increase your creativity.
Illustrate your knowledge.;
, There are few ways in which you could do more harm to the perception of your education than to use incorrect grammar, incorrect phrases, or “crutch words” such as “like” or “um.” When you are speaking you'll appear more educated if you enunciate, use proper grammar, complete sentences, and correct phrasing. Some of the more common mistakes include:


""Yeah"" instead of ""Yes""
”For all intensive purposes” instead of “for all intents and purposes”""I could care less"" instead of ""I couldn't care less""”Irregardless” instead of “regardless”Should, could, or would “of” instead of should, could, or would “have”, It may be difficult to remain conversational in your speech, but you should try to limit your use of slang words or attempt not to use them at all. Be particularly careful of any slang words that may offend someone, including the use of curse words. While the use of curse words does not necessarily indicate someone is uneducated, it does impact the social perception of intelligence, particularly in conversations where you do not know the other people well.

, No one is capable of knowing everything, and those who are more educated understand that, and rarely claim to be as intelligent as they really are.Be modest and avoid the temptation to “prove” how smart you are. It will often come off to others as boastful and will lower their opinion of you.

, Sometimes, in an effort to sound educated or smart, someone can appear to be ""trying too hard."" If you have a habit of always trying to interject on every conversation and add your thoughts, try and step back a bit. A key to speaking intelligently includes knowing when to be quiet. Staying silent has the potential to show more intelligence, especially if the alternative is saying something you think is smart.


This will also help if you feel you are in a conversation of opposing opinions where the other person is attempting to get you into an argument. Being quiet shows you are not interested in verbal fights or arguments, but rather more educated discussion.

"
"
Educate yourself.,
Be honest.,
Listen carefully.,
Act courteous.,
Limit negative emotions.",How to Present Yourself As an Educated Person2," The easiest way to present yourself as an educated person is to, in fact, be educated. Knowledge truly is power in this instance, so try to know at least a little bit about may different topics, if you can. It may take some time to develop your knowledge, and you may not be proficient in everything. Some ways to educate yourself include:


Learning a foreign language, or select words in other languages. Try learning how to say “please,” “thank-you,” and “you're welcome” in several different languages. They are easy to slip into conversation.
Keep up on news and current events. Follow your favorite news station, paper, or online news aggregate site. Knowing what is currently going on in the world will help you to appear “worldly” and knowledgeable.
Research areas of interest. If you'd like to be perceived as intelligent or educated to a particular group of people, research what is of interest to that group. Better yet would be to research areas that you are interested in.

, A misconception of being educated is that an educated person “knows everything” when in reality, educated individuals are always questioning and always learning. In your effort to be perceived as more intelligent, try not to build a false image of yourself or pretend to be something you are not. You will be viewed as more intelligent if you ask questions and are interested in learning new things.


If someone asks you a question that you do not know the answer to, it is perfectly acceptable to say, “I don't know, but I would be really interested to find out what the answer is, that's a great question!”If someone else is speaking, you can always add, “That's fascinating! I have to admit I haven't had a great deal of experience with that, can you tell me more about...”

, You do not always have to be the one speaking in order to be viewed as educated. It can be conveyed in how you act, as well. Make an effort to listen attentively. This will help you to completely understand what the other person is saying before offering your view or asking questions to further the conversation. A good rule, especially in a conversation with multiple people is to be listening twice as often as you are speaking.


A great way to convey your attention (and according to one study, your intelligence) is to make eye contact with the speaker. When offering your view, always leave it open for further intellectual discussion with phrases such as, ""Correct me if I'm wrong, but..."" or ""Do you agree?""
When asking questions, try and use words or phrases that show your knowledge of the topic. If someone is speaking about a school or university and you'd like to know if they went there, ask ""Is that your alma mater?"" or ""Did you attend their graduate program for your masters or your doctorate?""

, Remembering your manners will show respect for others and give you the appearance of being socially educated in the proper ways of conversation. Acting courteous to others will also illustrate the confidence you have in yourself and help you show that to others. Exhibiting confidence through your personality, style, and charisma, is viewed as the trait of a smarter individual.Being courteous includes:


Greeting others politely, with a smile.
Taking the care to be prompt and on time.
Not interrupting others while they are speaking.
Saying ""hello,"" ""please,"" ""thank you,"" ""sorry,"" and ""excuse me.""

, Try and keep a divide between your emotional reactions, especially strong, negative ones, and your conversation. It is good to be excited and passionate in what you are talking about as it is viewed as an important factor in appearing smart.Getting easily angry, exhibiting outbursts, or becoming combative; however, are not regarded as qualities of the educated individual. Staying in a positive, calm demeanor, shows that you are above having simple arguments and instead prefer intellectual discussion.

Surround yourself with intelligent people.,
Be neat in appearance.,
Remove bad habits.,
Cultivate cultural habits.,
Use your middle initial.",How to Present Yourself As an Educated Person3," Not only are you more likely to be perceived as educated and intelligent, you are more likely to actually become more intelligent due to the probability that you will have more intellectual discussions and be more challenged.Being around educated individuals will help increase your intellectual stimulation, help further your knowledge base, and help further your own education.

, Impressions are important to conveying a great deal of information including intellect and education. Particularly affecting the perception of education is the amount of exposed skin others can see.The more modest and formal your appearance the more others will focus on what you are saying and thinking, rather than what you are wearing.Wear modest and formal clothes that fit well.
Make sure your clothing is ironed and stain-free.
Keep your hair neat.
Have good hygiene.
Remove facial jewelry.
Keep your shoes, fingernails, and teeth clean.

, Watch out for bad habits or nervous habits such as nail biting, hair twirling, or chewing on pens. You want to communicate confidence in yourself, your education, and your intelligence. While these habits don't necessarily show a lack of education, they will cause you to be perceived as anxious, nervous, or uncomfortable. If you feel the urge of a bad habit coming on, try to actively refocus your mind on the other person or the conversation.

, There is a cultural component among the educated, that includes music, art, theatre, and cultural experiences. Taking part in these activities will increase your exposure to various topics, spark your creativity, and provide you with conversational material which illustrates your education. Some cultured areas to consider include:


Attending theatre performances or the opera.
Listening to classical music.
Visiting museums and art galleries.
Reading books, journals, and the newspaper.

, While this may seem like an odd factor, using your middle initial in your name is largely regarded as an indication of intelligence and education.This appears to be due to the fact that the use of a middle initial often occurs in formal and academic contexts.At events, have your middle initial included on your name tag, or if you like the way it sounds, include it in your introduction, especially if it makes you feel more like the intelligent, educated person that you are! On the other hand, you should be perceptive of what is culturally acceptable. For example, middle initials are rarely used in the UK, and are far more common American English contexts.Therefore, using the middle initial during introductions in the UK may violate the 'stay humble' principle above.

Hold open doors for people.,
In traffic, just keep reminding yourself that the person who just cut you off was probably having a bad day.,
Be kind to the elderly.,
Be generous.,
Give money to homeless people, but not directly, as this could cause problems for you and more importantly, for them.,
Offer to be friends to people you have known for even a short time or who you know are going through a tough time.,
Kindness begins at home.,
Remember you have a responsibility to society as well.,
Show kindness and responsible behavior to the environment.",How to Practice Courtesy and Kindness," It may seem small, but it doesn't take a lot of time or effort, and someone holding open a door with a smile can make someone's day. Helping or just being courteous to other people can make you feel good about yourself.;
, Let others in front of you when there is a back up. Move up a little so the soccer mom ten cars back can get into the proper lane to make her turn and get the kids to soccer practice on time for a change.

, Give up your seat on the train or bus or any other transport. Of course, if you are eight months pregnant and need to sit, keep the seat. But if you think someone else needs it more than you, let them have the seat. You will feel good about it and you will make the person who you were generous to feel happy.

, If someone is missing a few cents for their purchase in a store, give it to them.

, Give generously to organizations which feed the homeless.

, They need to know you care (especially if you are the only one who does).

, Obey your parents if you are a kid, and do your chores and homework. If you are all grown up, call your parents once in a while.

, Apart from our own needs and satisfaction, one needs to offer a helping hand to the immediate society as well. This can be done in small ways, yet in significant ways. Offering a neighbor to switch on the lights, or to feed their pet when they are away are examples of gestures that reciprocate kindness.

, Attempt to protect the planet by contributing to the upkeep of public parks, gardens that fall outside the realms of your property etc. By helping an elderly or sick person to tend their gardens or even plant a tree shows goodwill and selflessness.

Be extra aware of body language when you're under stress.",How to Not Be Rude," A truly gifted conversationalist will always try to filter what he says before he finally says it. While thinking about everything you're going to say may sound exhausting to some, it doesn't require a lot of brainpower. Really, all you'll usually need is a split-second to figure whether something you say might negatively affect someone around you. If you have a bad feeling about saying something, it's best to keep your mouth shut for the time being.;
, It may help to be conscious of the way your voice is sounding when you speak.While it may be distracting to focus on yourself when you're trying to have a conversation, casually keeping track of the tone, speed and volume of your voice can go a long way towards preventing unintentional rudeness.


In particular, be careful with your talking speed. Nervous or awkward people tend to accelerate their speech when they're under pressure. This only serves to add to the awkwardness.

, Being seen as polite and considerate isn't least among the benefits. Empathy is something virtually everyone has to some extent. The key to bringing it out is to invest a legitimate interest in what the other person is saying. If someone is telling you something about his life, make a concerted effort to see things from his point of view. If he recently lost his job, for example, try to empathize with how that might feel. Empathetic people are in tune with the other person's feelings and it's easier to charm them as such.


Empathy works in less-than-pleasant interactions as well. It can be frustrating to talk to someone who is being aggressive or mean-spirited. While it can be easy to let loose on someone like that, you can have an easier time keeping calm by using empathy. Try to see the situation from the unpleasant person's point-of-view. In some cases, you may have a new lease on the situation by taking yourself out of your own perspective for a bit.

, No one likes being talked about. Even if the subject in question isn't around to hear it, many people take offence to hearing people they know talked about in a negative light. If you want to avoid rudeness on your part, you should steer clear of interactions like this. Even if other people are gossiping, you should turn the other cheek. Those who are there to see you refuse the prospect will think more highly of you as a result.

, Some people are rude for the fact that they focus too much on themselves. This is most often an innocent fault, but it's one that can easily be avoided if you try to look at the conversation from both perspectives.

, As a general rule, people like to voice their opinions. They'll feel constricted if they can't get a word in. Listening is a skill, as real as any other. If you don't want to be rude, you'll need to have a fine command of listening.


Active listening refers to a broad range of reactions that let the other person know you are giving him your fullest attention. This can include body language, such as nodding your head, or soft responses like repeating the gist of what the other person said can get this point across.

, The established rules on etiquette, or expected politeness, will vary based on whichever people you are spending time with. When all else fails, reading up on proper etiquette is a good idea. Although the idea of ""proper etiquette"" is associated with the outdated Victorian period, a lot of the customs still hold up in the current period. If you're any bit unsure, its better to adhere to a custom than to ignore it. Politeness is no less important today than it was back then, and there are new rules that should be observed in modern times.Generally speaking, keep your phone out of sight when you're talking to someone.
Give the other person ample time to finish what they have to say.
Invest yourself in whatever the other person is saying. Even if you're not so interested in what he's saying, you won't do yourself any favours by acting unimpressed.
Always remember to say please and thank you. These tricks have never lost any favour over the years.

, Not coming across as being rude is made all the more challenging if you're talking to someone who is naturally sensitive. Emotional sensitivity should be seen as a good thing in most instances, but it can be tricky if you're talking to someone who might get hurt by the slightest grievance.If you think this is the case with someone, it's a good thing to know what their personal preferences are before going into an extended conversation with them. For instance, if you think someone isn't likely to enjoy crude humour, it's best to hold off on it until they're out of your company.


Asking about someone beforehand can give you the edge you need in a conversation if politeness is an issue. Ask about their preferences or emotional triggers. Failing that it's always helpful to see the way someone interacts in a social situation before you interact with the person yourself.

, Even if it doesn't involve a direct action on your part, a lot of rudeness can be evaded completely through empathy and knowing how the other person is feeling while you're talking. Because people can be tricky on this front, your best option is to try and gauge how they're feeling through non-verbal communication. Make a habit of paying attention to someone's facial expression while they talk. Sometimes, what they're saying won't match up to the mood their expression is hinting at.


Unfortunately, asking ""How are you feeling"" won't result in a sincere report from most people. People aren't trained to report their feelings accurately. Others may feel embarrassed or unwilling to show their true feelings., A lot of what someone considers to be rude has to do with the culture they were raised in.If you're going to be travelling or regularly deal with people who were raised in other cultures, it's a good idea to verse yourself on what is and isn't appropriate in their eyes. Although people are usually accustomed to getting past these cultural differences, the simple act of looking into these customs beforehand will be seen as very gracious on your part.

, As with most social interactions, the way you act needs to be informed by the circumstances of your situation. In other words, the way you demonstrate respect and politeness will differ depending on whether you're at a wedding, funeral, or a casual night out. Politeness means being self-aware and tactful. If you're acting cheery at a funeral wake, it will evoke the same negative reactions as if you were being glum at a birthday party.


This should also include your dress and appearance. People will judge you a lot based on the way you make yourself appear.
If you're ever unsure about which particular way you should be acting in a social setting, it's a good idea to try copying what other people are generally doing.

, Politeness can't be an act. Rather, it needs to be a constant state of mind. Keep your behaviour consistent. If someone sees two different sides of you, you'll appear all the more phoney to them.

, By reflecting the other person's facial expression, you will demonstrate that the two of you are on the same page. In the majority of cases, this will go over in a positive light.


It's not recommended to mimic the other person if you suspect he is using sarcasm.

, Even the most kind-hearted person can come off as rude if they don't tend to basics first. This includes taking a shower at least a few times a week and making sure your clothes are freshly laundered. If you carry a sour body odour with you wherever you go, you're not likely to make any friends and people are bound to be repulsed. Something this simple can mean a world of difference as far as politeness is concerned.

, Some people tend to blink rapidly when they're under stress.If noticed, this can give the other person the impression that you're uncomfortable or feel rushed. Because this is an involuntary action, it can be hard to train yourself out of it, or even know if you do it. The next time you're in a somewhat stressful situation, try to be conscious of your blinking.


This and other facets of negative body language can be eased by allowing yourself to relax.

, Body language is most often done without thinking. If we are stressed, it is often seen in the way we position our bodies. Even if we're otherwise making an issue to be as polite as possible, this rudeness can manage to get through. The best way to keep it under control is to make an emphasized point of paying attention to your own body language. Crossed arms and an aggressive stance can come across naturally, but if you fix your focus on the way your body's reacting, you'll be able to keep these signs of stress from showing.

Talk about unique experiences you’ve had.,
Showcase your talents and knowledge.,
Name-drop to suggest your worldly experiences.,
Speak confidently and clearly.",How to Make Yourself Seem More Worldly2," If you want to impress people with your worldliness, be prepared to show that you’ve done amazing, exciting, once-in-a-lifetime things. As you travel or interact with people in your area, seek out new and interesting things to do. Stock up on stories you’ll be able to drop in conversations and impress people with. For instance:


Don’t just tell people you’ve visited Tuscany. Tell them about the time you met some locals in a bar in Florence who invited you to hop a train to Naples, climb Mt. Vesuvius, pick grapes from a centuries-old vineyard, and sample wine on a sunlit terrace.
Seize the opportunity to be an extra in a film. While you might have to stand in line for hours in the cold waiting to be called up, it will be worth it when you can brag about appearing in the film, and taking a selfie with Hollywood’s biggest star.

, Maybe you have a special skill, like vocal chops or the ability to play all of Beethoven’s piano concertos. Maybe you know everything there is to know about modern art, or tech startups. Make sure to mention this to others whenever you can, or show them off in some way, like performing at a community event. The more exclusive and elite your talent or expertise is, the more others will be impressed by your worldliness.


There’s a fine line between seeming worldly and bragging. It’s fine to show off your talents, but don’t do it in an obnoxious way.
If someone strikes up a conversation about music with you, don’t just blurt out right away that you know how to play all of Beethoven’s piano concertos. Wait for a natural point in the conversation. If they ask about your repertoire, you can say something like “Actually, I’m quite familiar with Beethoven’s works…”

, If your goal is to convince people that you are worldly, you need to share your life. Make sure to casually drop information about your experiences into conversations. For example, if someone mentions that they’ve always wanted to go to Europe, you could follow up with something like “Oh, when I lived in Spain for a year, I loved the convenience of European railways. I was able to visit so many places.”


If you are careful, you will be able to imply that you’ve had exciting, enviable experiences -- even if you haven’t actually -- without really lying. Drop places or peoples’ names into conversation as though you’ve been there or know them, even if you don’t. For instance, you might say something like “All the big stars in Hollywood go to Republique for brunch.”
Be cautious if someone calls you ought or asks for more information. If a friend asks “Oh, so you’ve been to Republique? Who did you see there?” you have the choice of either trying to invent a story about seeing Brad Pitt there, or just admitting “No, but I’ve read about it.”

, Talk slowly, avoid filling what you say with words like “um” and “uh,” and think about what you want to say before you speak. This will project confidence and convince others that you know what you are talking about."

Join or contribute to organizations.,
Throw yourself into your work.,
Appreciate the finer things in life.,
Don’t overdo it.",How to Make Yourself Seem More Worldly3," Getting involved in a charity, community organization, or professional association isn’t just a way to show others that you are worldly and sophisticated. It’s also a way to take a talent, interest, or value that you have and make an impact in the world.


Volunteer time with a community organization to show that you want to share your worldliness with others in your area.
Donate to a charity supporting a cause you believe in to show that you are worldly enough to help others.
Get involved in your field’s professional organization to connect with colleagues and mentor the next generation.

, Worldly people strive to be successful in their professions. If you put your heart into your work, it can show how much you value it, and that you draw something meaningful from it. This will impress others. To show that you love your job and approach your work in a worldly way:Avoid complaining excessively about your job.
Seek opportunities for advancement, to gain new skills, or to work with new teams.
Jump on any opportunities your job offers for travel. It will impress people when you tell them you’ve got to go catch a flight to Jakarta for business, and you will increase your knowledge of the world at the same time.

, One of the benefits of being a worldly person is getting to experience life beyond the mundane. Familiarize yourself with fine wine, exotic cuisine, and high fashion. Learn about modern art and the latest trends in interior design. Visit the orchestra for the season opener gala, or stop by your local museum to see the latest exhibit. Whether it’s fancy cars, exclusive society, or high art, savor the best of what life has to offer!, Worldliness won’t replace less tangible values that are even more important, like being loved and accepted, caring for others, mindfulness, or spirituality.

That way, you’ll impress others with your worldliness, but also be true to who you are.Signs that you are taking it too far include feeling stressed or anxious about constantly trying to impress people, or suffering financially because you are overspending on luxury items or travel.

Don’t worry about what other people think.",How to Present Yourself," Taking care of your body and your health is one of the first aspects of your life that people will notice when they come into contact with you. By exercising and eating right, you’ll look and feel healthier, which will improve your mood and make you more pleasant to be around. People will know immediately that you care about yourself and that you’re capable of working hard.Simple dietary changes can lead to massive improvements in your overall health and look. Focus on eating more healthy foods, like lean proteins (salmon, chicken breast, soy beans), fresh fruits and vegetables (cranberries and avocados are loaded with nutrients), and healthy grains (brown rice).Avoid trans fats and foods high in sodium. Cutting fast food and soda out of your diet will help.
Jogging is a fun and easy way to exercise and stay fit that doesn’t require equipment or a health club membership. Get a friend to tag along and keep each other motivated.;
, Your clothes say a lot about who you are. They’re a choice you make each and every day that speaks to your sense of style and they should be utilized as a tool for presenting yourself to others. Whether in a business scenario, a first date, or just gathering with friends, people judge you on the clothes you wear, so make sure you’ve got a look that you’re comfortable with.People are more likely to trust, be friendly with, and invest in a person who wears nice clothes. Subconscious judgments occur in the minds of even the most non-judgmental people.Iron your shirts and pants to avoid looking like you just rolled out of bed. It’s easy to do and doesn’t take very long, yet the results have a big impact on your presentation.
Try to coordinate outfits that match, using clothes that fit and accessories that don’t clash.

, Even if you’re in great shape and are wearing the perfect outfit, the way you present yourself can still be a disaster if your body language doesn’t shine. Body language communicates more than spoken words or appearance when it comes to how people perceive you and your emotions, so don’t ignore this crucial element of presentation.The most important aspect of body language is your expression. Scowling and pouting don’t make for a good impression, so try to maintain a smile as much as you can.


Maintaining eye contact when you talk to someone assures them that you’re invested in what they have to say and that you respect them. This reflects well on you.
Practicing proper posture tells people that you’re alert, focused, and care about your health. Don’t slouch, instead, try to sit upright while aligning along the natural curve of your back. Set reminders throughout the day to keep you on track until its second nature., Much like your wardrobe, your hygiene stands as an immediate indicator of your personal presentation. Even if you are a gracious, kind, and caring individual people will perceive you negatively if you have poor hygiene. Make sure to bathe regularly, and don’t forget to wash your hair and brush your teeth. If you have problems with body odor, wear a deodorant. Pay attention to small details like keeping your fingernails clean and trimmed, don’t let your hair or beard become unkempt, and avoid wearing unwashed clothing.


Good personal hygiene will keep you looking and feeling better. It helps prevent disease and improves confidence and self-image.Keep a clean house. When you have guests over, a tidy living room, organized kitchen, and made bed inform visitors that you are in control of your life.

, Doing little things can have a big impact on how you present yourself to others. Be sure to introduce yourself to people you don’t know, whether at a business meeting or a casual party. Once you’ve said hello, make an effort to remember people’s names. It makes them feel special and they’ll take note that you did it. Graciousness isn’t something that comes in big gestures, but in everyday efforts to make people feel included and appreciated.Offer small compliments to make people feel appreciated. Maybe they got a new hairstyle or made a strong contribution to a good effort. Saying “You look nice today” or “That was a great idea” can make somebody’s day and doing so improves their perception of you.
Simply saying “please,” “thank you,” or “bless you” goes a long way when meeting new people.

, Don’t be overly modest. A little self-deprecating humor can lighten the mood and break the ice, but too much can make people uncomfortable.

, Ask questions, and listen to people’s answers. You’ll learn about them and in turn be able to follow up the next time you meet. You’ll appear considerate and thoughtful. In turn, you can offer personal details of your own life and develop meaningful, substantive relationships.Be careful not to over-share or pry to hard with your questions. Keep topics light in the beginning by asking about fun parts of people’s lives like vacations and hobbies.

, When you’re with other people and you don’t make your opinions known or don’t defend them, you miss out on an opportunity to earn people’s respect. Without shouting down others, make a case for yourself and what you believe. You’ll find you respect yourself more for doing so.


When encountering new people, find a balance between shyness and assertiveness. Make an effort to introduce yourself to people but don’t force your way into conversations. Be aware of people’s body language., Behavior in the workplace contributes massively to how you present yourself as a person. The way you act when working in a group or on your own says a lot about who you are and how people perceive you. Showing up late, missing deadlines, and making poor contributions to team projects reflects terribly on you as an employee, and in turn as a human being. People judge someone by the quality of his or her work, and the things they produce as much as by their appearance or personality.


Besides the benefit of other people’s perception of you, working hard results in improved feelings towards yourself. People derive satisfaction and pride from a strong work ethic.Good ways to improve your work ethic include: Better punctuality, avoiding procrastination, helping with other people’s projects, focusing on small details, embracing responsibility, starting early, and never saying “that’s not my job.”, It sounds simple, but eating like a slob, even in casual settings, can detract from an otherwise great personal presentation. Some foods are meant to be eaten by hand, and there’s nothing wrong with chowing down on a burger and fries with your fingers. However, that doesn’t mean you need to inhale your food. Take small bites, use a napkin, and don’t talk with your mouth full of food. Make your mom proud!

, Presenting yourself depends on how you feel about yourself. Without genuine confidence you lack the key elements of a positive self-image. Believing in yourself and living with confidence improves your success in dating, leads to upward mobility at work, and leads to greater achievement of personal goals.Many of the steps listed above in this article can help build confidence. Exercising, dressing well, and being a gracious and friendly conversationalist all lead to improved levels of confidence.

, Nobody is perfect, and even if you present yourself as perfect you’ll still have flaws in your personality. Remember, it’s ok to be yourself even if you have faults. Try to work to improve on the aspects of yourself you don’t like. If you feel you aren’t well spoken or don’t have interesting stories, try reading more and sharing what you learn. If you can’t lose weight no matter how you change your diet and exercise, embrace it as a part of who you are, and learn to take pride in yourself.When focused on your own flaws, it’s easy to forget other people aren’t perfect either. If you actively work to better yourself, people will notice and admire you for it.

, You aren’t always out in the world trying to impress people and make a good impression. Maybe you’re at home by yourself, or making a routine trip to the grocery store. Keep these tips in mind during the smallest interactions and make presenting your best self a part of your routine. Compliment a cashier, exercise when you’re tempted to watch television, and practice other healthy habits that will pay dividends down the road for presenting yourself to others.

, Even when you’re working to present yourself to others, don’t get bogged down worrying about how they’ll judge you. Be yourself, and be content with the effort you put as long as you are comfortable with who you are. These changes won’t come overnight, so be patient. Remember, while it’s important to present yourself to others, it’s far more important to present a positive image to yourself.When you’re happy with who you are, it shows in the way you present yourself to others, so focus on yourself as the person you want to impress the most.

Take a moment to think before you speak.;
, Remain calm in tense situations and speak in a calm, relaxed voice. Strive to act, rather than react emotionally. Diffuse bad situations whenever possible, and take a moment to think before instantly reacting to a negative provocation.


Well-respected people know how to keep their cool under tense conditions.
During arguments, hold your temper to prevent escalations, and if someone raises their voice at you, respond calmly., These things exude confidence, which people very much respect.


Conversely, slouching, mumbling and being afraid of eye contact communicates to others that you aren’t confident in yourself. Self-confidence is respected.

, When faced with a problem, do not react emotionally or with visible frustration. Instead, focus on addressing the problem and looking for ways to solve it. Try not to complain or get angry, since neither of those things are going to help the situation.

Being poorly groomed usually sends a negative message to others about your self-worth.

, When you are around others, don't be uptight or nervous. Make sure other people around you see that you are relaxed and happy, not stressed out and upset. If people think you are carefree they will want to be around you more than if they think you are nervous about everything and this will make them love.

, Be authentic when you compliment and actually mean what you say. If there isn't anything nice to say, you could say nothing. However, even better is to challenge yourself to find at least one good thing about someone that you can say without making it up. Give it a try––it'll help you see the better side of everyone you meet.

, Clinginess terrifies people because they are being made to feel responsible for the person clinging. This isn't lovable behavior––it's a form of suffocation. If you find yourself being clingy, remind yourself of the value of being independent and giving people the best of yourself rather than trying to hide under the shelter of another.

, Don't judge others for their mistakes; there but for the grace of circumstance go you. Always remind yourself that the position someone is in could very well be the position you're in some day thanks to the vagaries of life, luck and coincidences. Be understanding, be ready to investigate deeply and be ready to forgive.


Remember this: If you want your friends and close ones to love you when you're unlovable, the same is expected of you for them. It's only fair.

, Send love out there to others. Have the faith it will come back to you from the persons who matter.

, If you have a lot of emotional baggage and inner turmoil, you won't be able to inspire, help or support others because you're not in the right place. On the other hand, if you take care of yourself first, there will be room for caring for others as well.


Self sacrifice may seem noble but it comes at the expense of expressing yourself properly. It can lead to resentment, bitterness and feeling unfulfilled. Seek a balance between being there for others and being attentive to yourself too.

, Consider your body a sponge absorbing everything around you. You can only have so much happiness before you will start to give it off to those around you. Same with anger, sadness, jealousy. It is a way to keep your emotions balanced.


This doesn't mean dismissing those you care about when they're down and going through hard times. People need support during such times, and their negativity is temporary and does not define them. Be helpful and kind, help them through these times by letting them know they have your support.

, These are limits that others see and respect. If your limits are low, people will cross that line and respect you less for that. If you want people to love you, love yourself in order to be lovable.


People can't love you if you don't love yourself.

, When someone has low self-esteem, people usually don't want love them. If people realize that you are confident, while at the same time being selfless they will want to be around you.

, This may sound like a bizarre ending to an article about which getting people to love you is the very essence. But the point is this––you can be as lovable as you can be but what matters is the why. If you are being lovable because that is your intrinsic nature, your dearest desire and your thing that you want to put out there into the world, then it's authentic, good and self-nurturing. On the other hand, if you're doing this to be liked, to be loved in turn, then you're chasing validation rather than expressing yourself genuinely. Be careful not to get this motivation mixed up and most of all, don't be a sucker for needing validation from other people.Remind yourself often that this is about you being you, not about garnering the world's love in return. Love will come but it's not the end point for your exercise in being a lovable human being.


Be lovable in order to express your true self, not to gain accolades and win friends.
Realize that even with the kindest, most caring intent in the world, you will still rub someone people the wrong way and some people will just dislike you, because they can or want to.

Say “no” more often.People often believe that taking on more projects and responsibilities will make others respect them, but that’s not the case.,
Have an opinion..,
Stop being too nice.You can be kind to others without constantly having to do things for them.,
Quit apologizing.,
Say something when you’re being mistreated.",How to Make People Respect You2," You can’t agree to every opportunity or request presented to you. Saying no shows others that you value your own time and care more about delivering quality results over quantity.


The delivery of the message is just as important as the message itself. Be polite, frank, and decline with a smile. It’s not personal, you just don’t have the time to take on anything extra right now.
Don’t feel guilty about saying no when you have to. Feel good about standing up for yourself., Whether it’s an idea, a thought, or a protest, avoid remaining passive if you have something to say. Don’t be afraid of voicing your opinions and bringing ideas to the table, even if it makes you a little nervous. People appreciate when someone has the guts to say what they think.


If you aren’t used to speaking up, try practicing what you want to say beforehand.
Voicing your opinions doesn’t mean verbally passing judgement on everything going on around you. Voice your opinions when they matter.

, No one respects a pushover. You can’t please everyone, nor should you try, and allowing yourself to be taken advantage of because you’re nice shows others that you don’t respect yourself.


Being too nice can also have the undesired effect of people thinking you are fake and disingenuous.

, The only time you need to apologize is when you’ve done something wrong. Unfortunately, many people get in the habit of saying “sorry” almost automatically, without even thinking about it.


Reserve your apologies for situations that actually call for them.
Stop taking the blame for every little thing that goes wrong around you.

, If you are being taken advantage of or mistreated, you don’t have to resign yourself to enduring it silently. Stand up for yourself. Standing up for yourself doesn’t mean lashing out in response – that will only make things worse. Instead, be tactful and polite when you do it.


Standing up for yourself can be scary, but that’s precisely why other people will respect you for doing it.
When you speak up, make sure you literally speak up – do not mumble, trip over your words, or look down at your feet in embarrassment. You have every right to stand up for yourself.

Keep your word.,
Be on time.When you are late, whether that is to an appointment, a meeting, a deadline or responding to an email, you lose the respect of others because they feel that you don’t value their time.,
Avoid gossiping.Frequently engaging in gossip, especially negative gossip that puts other people down, will do nothing good for you.,
Stand up for someone else.",How to Make People Respect You3," When you commit to something and then don’t follow through, people see you as unreliable. Keep your promises to others and get out of the habit of making promises that you can’t keep. Proving your dependability will garner respect from others. Be the person who can be counted on.

, Strive to always be punctual.


When you show your peers that you respect their time by being prompt, they will respond by respecting your time and you.

, In fact, it usually results in people thinking less of you and gossiping about you when you aren’t in the room.


You don’t have to like everyone, but you should always be respectful toward them.Know the difference between socializing and gossiping, and never participate in the latter.
Make an effort to avoid drama with your peers.

, Just as you should always stand up for yourself, you should also try to do the same when you see someone else being mistreated, especially if they are unable to do it for themselves. There is a time and place for this, and sometimes butting in would be inappropriate, but if it’s something that you can do, do it. Respecting someone else enough to take up for them will earn you their respect in return.


Pay attention to your surroundings and take opportunities to show empathy toward others when at all possible.
When you are able to demonstrate that you are willing to offer help when it is needed, you’re demonstrating that you care about others, which never fails to gain respect.

Request to see how different animals are treated.",How to Shadow a Veterinarian," Call their offices to ask about available shadowing opportunities. Every vet has different policies, so you may need to call more than one vet to find one that will agree to let you shadow.


Say, “Hi, I’m interested in pursuing veterinary medicine and wanted to see if you allowed people to shadow the vet.”
Ask if the office offers one-time visits or recurring visits. Some offices will let you shadow the vet on a regular basis if you schedule times with them.;
, Some vets require you to fill out an application, while others may expect you to come in to the office to talk with the staff. Make sure that you fulfill all of the requirements.Some vets may be more informal and may be willing to just set up a shadowing appointment for you when you call.

, Allow the office to choose a day that works well for them, but let them know if there’s something particular you’re interested in seeing. For example, if you hope to specialize in small animals, then you can tell them that when they’re scheduling you. While they might not be able to schedule you how you want, it will give them some direction if there are options available.


Don’t expect to be accommodated, but express gratitude if it happens.
If a day doesn’t work for you, tell that to the office staff, making it clear that you’ll take any other day that works for them.

, Some clinics set limited hours for shadowing, so don’t assume that you’ll be in the clinic from open to close. Ask what time they expect you and then arrive on time., Long pants will help protect your legs from possible bites, scratches, and fleas from untreated animals. They also look more professional than shorts.If you don’t wear pants, wear a long, professional skirt.
Check with the vet to see if they’d prefer that you wear a specific type of clothes, such as khakis or scrubs.

, A shirt like a polo, button-up, or blouse is appropriate, but remember that you’ll be moving around a clinic all day. Avoid t-shirts and tank tops., Protecting your feet is a must, so don’t wear a shoe that has an open-toe. The clinic will have nervous animals, medical gear, and many shuffling feet, all of which put exposed feet in danger.It’s best to choose nice tennis shoes because you’ll be on your feet all day.

, The clinic is already filled with a lot of smells, and perfumes and lotions will only add more stress to already anxious pets.Show good hygiene by being freshly showered and wearing deodorant.

, If you have long hair, make sure it’s out of the way. Loose hair can be a safety hazard around the equipment and animals.

, Unless the vet directs you to touch an animal, keep your hands off. Whether the pet is in the waiting room or the exam room, you shouldn’t try to pet or handle it.If a pet starts to break free from the vet or a technician, do NOT try to intervene. They are trained to handle the situation, and you are not. Even if you feel bad for not helping, they’d rather you stand aside.

, Not only is it rude to use your cell phone during your time in the clinic, it is also a distraction for both you and the staff. Be respectful and engaged by keeping your phone silent and put away.


If you choose to use your phone during your visit, you may be asked to leave.

, If the vet is talking, you should be quiet, even if they aren’t speaking to you. If you have a question, wait to ask when the vet has a free moment.


Asking someone else a question while the vet is speaking is also a form of interruption because your talking can distract from what the vet is saying.
Recognize that the vet may interrupt you in order to maintain the day’s schedule. Don’t be offended if they have to cut you off.

, Your experiences at the clinic are for educational purposes, so don’t share the private business of the pet owners whose appointments you sit in on. For example, don’t tell everyone at your school that your friend’s dog was behind on its shots after you saw his mom in the clinic., Include the Dr., Mr., Ms., or Mrs. and use their last name. Be respectful when addressing the vet, staff, and pet owners. Unless someone gives you permission, don’t refer to them by their first name even if you know them outside of the clinic.

, Read about veterinary procedures and watch a few videos that show what it’s really like to treat animals. If you may be watching a surgery, prepare yourself by watching it on video first.


Be honest if you aren’t ready to see a surgery in real life. You don’t want to cause a distraction by fainting or throwing up.
Prepare a list of questions you’d like answered through your observations in the clinic or by directly asking the vet.

, Arrive at the office prepared to take notes about your experiences. Have your questions ready in your notebook so that you don’t forget what you wanted to know. As the day goes on, you may find yourself adding questions to the list.

, Vets have different ways of doing their jobs, so take note of how this vet initiates and completes the treatment process. For example, watch how they approach the pet, what they do to make it comfortable, and how they react when a pet tries to get away., How a vet is with their human clients is just as important as how they are with animals. Watch how the vet greets the pet owner and how much information they provide about the treatment., Don’t be afraid to ask questions. The vet likely expects you to. As long as you wait for the right time, the vet should be happy to answer your questions.Wait until an exchange between the vet, staff, and pet owners is complete.
Don’t talk to the vet while they’re concentrating or treating the animal.
Do ask the technicians questions as well.

, If your vet specializes in more than one animal, ask to observe appointments for different kinds of animals. While they may not be able to accommodate you on this visit, it’s possible that you could get another opportunity at a later time."

Be funny, but don't act like a complete idiot.,
Remember one rule: People are interested in themselves.,
Talk about positive things.,
Pay attention to body language.,
Look like a friendly and attractive person.,
Make your conversation partner comfortable.,
Be energetic and enthusiastic.",How to Make People Instantly Like You," The class clown is usually a pretty popular kid, as is the prankster who's always making people laugh. Being genuinely funny is a hard thing to do, but it's an important part of getting other people to like you. Act funny and go with the joke the other person says. And don't constantly joke around or do pranks or the other person will get annoyed, bored, or frustrated with the pranks you are doing.;
, The first step of getting people to like you is simple. All you have to do is be interested in them. Talk to people about themselves. Lead the conversation, making sure that it stays about them and they believe that they're the one in charge.









Find out what they're interested in and seek to learn more. For example, you're talking with someone and they drop the hint that they went rock-climbing over the weekend.

Ask the person more questions about this hobby: ""How did you get started rock-climbing?"" or ""What do you like about rock-climbing?"" or ""Where is the coolest place you've ever gone rock-climbing?""


These questions will lead to answers, and you can ask more questions or develop a conversation based on that. Regardless, the other person will be impressed that you're so interested in them, and glad that they get to talk about something they actually care about.

, By and large, people want to be happy more than sad, so positive things are happier to talk about than negative things. Talking about negative things or complaining too much can put the person you're talking to in an uncomfortable position and sometimes leads the conversation astray. Instead, focus on sharing the happy or positive aspects of your life for other people to enjoy or relate to.









Talk about what you love doing, and show sincere enthusiasm. Even if people know next to nothing about what you love doing, they'll be happy if you're happy explaining it. That happiness is infectious. So the person you're talking to knows next to nothing about Tom Ford clothing, but you can make them interested in the topic by showing your love for fashion and your expertise in explaining it to someone who doesn't know.
Stay away from ""danger topics"" like religion and politics if you're meeting somebody for the first time. Most people will automatically judge you if you happen to share different beliefs about religion or politics, so it's best to leave those discussions for a later time.
If you want to talk about something negative or bad that happened to you, make it a funny story. Humor is a great way to get people to instantly like you, especially when you can turn a horrific or boring story into something that's lighthearted and exciting. Look at yourself and find the humor in your life. It's okay to make fun of yourself if everyone knows that you're not taking yourself seriously.
Develop your own sense of humor. Some people are really good at physical comedy — impressions, slapstick, vaudeville. Others have more of a dry sense of humor, preferring puns and wisecracks and cynicism. Figure out what kind of humor you're good at so that you can call it your own.
Find humor in the things that other people have missed. Really good humor often comes from the stuff that's right in front of our eyes, but that everyone else hasn't noticed. Take notice of the funny things that happen to you and write them down or store them in your memory. When the time comes and the subject is right, unleash them on your friends.
Bounce back from failed jokes. Some jokes will miss their mark and not end up being funny. But the great part about this is that no one ever remembers the jokes that weren't funny! People only remember the ones that were. So as soon as you get discouraged about telling a bad joke or missing the timing on a joke, remember that you'll have another chance at it soon and make the best of it.

, Your body language is like another you screaming signals that other people pick up on without ever really noticing. A lot of our body language happens without us even knowing about it — it's subconscious. Training your body to recognize the body language it gives off is an important part of being likable.









Don't forget eye contact whenever you talk to anyone. The eyes are an incredibly potent part of our body. Use them well! Making eye contact with someone tells them that you're engaged in what they have to say and interested in them. If your eyes are constantly darting around or looking down at the ground, that says that you're distracted or not confident.
Smile. It's as simple as that. Separate studies found that people who smiled were seen to be more trustworthy, and that people who smiled more outlived people who smiled less.Smile from your eyes, as if you're truly happy to be meeting someone or speaking to someone.
Look alert. Make sure you do not look like you are wrapped up in yourself, or distracted by some other thing. When meeting a new person it is vital to communicate that you are interested in them. Give yourself a pep talk before entering the room, or drink a small glass of coffee, or get focused in a way that suits you.
Avoid the unconscious body language that signals boredom or disinterest. Crossing your arms at your chest tells other people that you're bored and don't want to be talked to. Sighing heavily means that you're disgusted or frustrated. Tapping your feet repeatedly means that you're in a hurry. Clenching a fist means that you're nervous or angry.

, This does not mean you have to have to dress in the same way as everyone else does. You just need to look open, honest, natural, friendly, outgoing and clean. This is important because most people make a judgment about someone that they meet for the first time within the first thirty seconds of meeting them.









Be clean and have good hygiene. Having shampooed hair, kept nails, clean teeth, and fresh-smelling pits really makes you more appealing to the people around you. Guys, if you choose to wear facial hair, that doesn't mean you don't have to groom it.
Wear nice clothes. You don't need the wardrobe of a model to be well put-together. Stick with classic, dependable clothes rather than trendy and flashy ones. It's easy to look good in clothes that never become obsolete, so invest in them.

If money is an issue, then invest in one nice article of clothing every time you can afford. Chances are you'll keep it for a long time and you can slowly build a closet's worth of great clothes around it.



, This all depends on your partner's definition of ""comfortable,"" but a lot of things apply here. Put in the extra effort to make the other person feel special. Everyone wants to feel special when they're being talked to, so keep that in mind.









Make appropriate physical contact from time to time. Maybe this will mean shaking hands or even possibly greeting people in a slightly more intimate way. If you appear confident, positive, and non-threatening in your gestures, people will most likely take well to you reaching out.

Patting someone on the back is usually acceptable among men, while hugging is generally acceptable among women. Be careful what kind of physical contact you give to the opposite sex: Women can give men the wrong signal with an innocent attempt to be friendly, while men can scare women off in the same way.


Don't be afraid to flirt a little if the situation is appropriate. People love romantic attention. It makes them feel special. Flirting is a good way to get closer to people.

Women can flirt by making eye contact with a subject and smiling; men can flirt with subjects by complimenting their physical features, making jokes, or buying them drinks.



, You know what works well about you and what doesn't. Whatever you do, be energetic and enthusiastic. Let your voice, your body, and your confidence show that.









Give a lively and pleasant tone to your voice. Moderate the pitch in your voice so that it has a lot of energy and emotion. (Radio DJs do this well, although it's probably not a great idea to sound exactly like a radio DJ.)

Try not to stammer or say too many ""Ahs"" or ""Ums"". It's a sign of nervousness. If you find yourself stammering a lot, slow your speech down. Rehearse the gist of what you're going to say in your head before you say it.
Men can try to lower their voices if it's natural. Studies have shown that men with lower voices attract more sexual partners.Don't, however, try to do this if it doesn't feel right. It's much better to keep your voice calm and relaxed than it is to change it to something it's not.


Just be yourself. Finally, the golden rule of making people like you. You can modify things about you, but you can't change your personality. You are who you are. And that's great, because that person is special in ways that no other person is, and so are you.

",How to Make People Feel Good," People tend to feel good when they hear their name. Sometimes people also love friendly nicknames-for example: if they love football,you can acknowledge that by calling them ""Footy Queen/King""! Do not call someone a nickname if they wouldn't appreciate that, and you know that already. Instead, just say their real name.;
, People always feel good about themselves when they are teaching people - and when the person gets it right, it is a great feeling !

, Even if you don't like a person, you can always find one thing that you like about them. It could be the car they drive or the watch they wear.

, This will show them that you are really listening. All too often we want people to hear us. Most often we want to impose our opinion or we want to tell a person what they should have done in a situation, or what you would have done. If you just listen, and I really mean really listen, not just nod and be forming a reply in your head, people really feel good when they know someone is listening.

, Put yourself in their position and really understand what they are saying or going through. People feel good when they know someone understands what they are saying.

, If you just smile at someone, it will make them feel more at ease.

, Then when you see them you can ask ""How is Linda?"", or ""Still building the model boats?"" Remembering important facts about a person makes them feel like they are special.

, This is a pretty simple one. If someone is in need and you help them, it will show them that someone cares.

, But all of them must be natural. Feel the beauty (think about it - it's the perfect plural!) of loving someone...

Project a ""really useful attitude."",
Establish rapport by design.,
Synchronize.,
Recognize the secrets of effective communication.",How to Make People Appreciate and Like You," Your attitude sets the quality and mood of your thoughts, which in turn influence your voice tone, the words you use, your facial expressions and your body language. Your attitude determines the quality of your relationships. When you project a ""really useful attitude,"" one that is cheery, interested and helpful, other people will want to be around you. It's up to you to choose your attitude. When you project the opposite attitude, they will have the opposite reaction. Very important: make sure your words, tone of voice and gestures are all consistent. When faced with inconsistency among these three ways of delivering a message, people pay most attention to body language, and then to tone of voice -- and surprisingly little to the actual words.The thing is that you should recognize the fake friends and the real ones.;
, We like people who are like us, so the key to establishing rapport with strangers is to learn how to be like them. This requires you to deliberately control your behavior to become sufficiently like the other person to form a connection -- at least for a short time. Look around a restaurant or any other public place where people meet and socialize and compare those couples who are in rapport with those who are not. The ones who are in rapport lean toward one another, adopt similar arm and leg positions, and talk in similar tones of voice. In short, they seem to be synchronized. The quickest way to establish rapport with people you meet is to synchronize with them. Synchronizing does not mean you are being phony or insincere. Its purpose is to help you put the other person at ease and speed up the rapport that would otherwise take longer to develop. You are not expected to make your movements, tone and voice mimic the other person's, but just to act with him/her the same way you would if you were already friends.

,


Try to start synchronizing within seconds of making a new acquaintance. Five stages of a successful first encounter...
Use open body language. Uncover your heart by leaving your jacket or coat unbuttoned and facing the other person.
Be first with eye contact. Look the other person straight in the eye.
Beam a smile.
Be the first to identify yourself with a pleasant, ""Hi! I'm Nick.""
Lean subtly toward the other person to show your interest and openness, and begin to synchronize.
Pick up on the other person's feelings and identify with him by synchronizing your movements, breathing patterns and expressions. Use your voice to reflect back the mood conveyed by his voice. Don't copy him clumsily, but notice his posture, gestures, head and body movements and facial expressions and mirror them. Particularly important: Mirror his voice tone, volume, speed and pitch.

, Get the other person to start talking openly so you can find out what matters to him and synchronize yourself accordingly. Begin by asking open questions -- those that cannot be answered with a simple ""yes"" or ""no"" but encourage the other person to open up and reveal himself. Key words: Who? When? What? Why? Where? How? Keep the conversation going by answering a question with another question.

Shake hands firmly.,
Keep your posture relaxed, but not slouched.,
Maintain an appropriate amount of eye contact.,
Keep your hands still, in your lap or at your sides.,
Widen your stance.,
Keep your arms uncrossed.,
Align your body with the person you’re communicating with.,
Lean in slightly.,
Point your legs and feet toward the person.,
Nod and smile when appropriate.,
Mirror the person you’re speaking with.,
Laugh genuinely.",How to Make a Good Impression Through Body Language," Weak, listless handshakes can make you seem timid and anything but confident. Your handshake should be firm but not overly tight, because you won't impress anyone by giving them a sore hand. As you shake the person's hand, make eye contact with him to show you're sure of yourself and genuinely interested in meeting him., Stand up straight, but don’t tighten up so that you look rigid and nervous. If you’re a natural sloucher, make sure to check your posture sporadically and straighten up as needed.A hunched back can make you look unsure of yourself, or even like you don’t care too much about the situation.
Standing or sitting up straight and tall can not only make you appear more confident, but it can actually make you feel more confident as well!, By maintaining eye contact with the person you’re talking to — or meeting for the first time — you’re letting her know that you’re paying attention to what she is saying. Not only are you paying attention, but you’re interested in it as well.Whenever there is a natural pause in the conversation, feel free to casually glance at something else. Eye contact is good, but nonstop staring can be a little unsettling!


Pay attention to how much you’re blinking. It can be an unconscious thing, but rapid blinking can make you look nervous or uncomfortable. If you find yourself blinking a lot, try to slow it down.

, When people are nervous nervous, it’s common for them to fidget with their hands. Try to keep your hands still, or clasped in your lap if you’re sitting. Avoid touching your hair or adjusting with your clothing, which can make you seem anxious, unsure of yourself, or even deceitful.Talk with your hands, if it’s appropriate! If you’re passionate about something you’re speaking about, feel free to gesture — just don’t overdo it., If you want to appear confident when you're meeting someone, stand your ground! If you keep your feet close together, or crossed, you're more likely to come off as nervous or insecure. Instead, stand with your feet apart in a ""power stance,"" and show everyone around you that you feel sure of yourself., When you’re communicating with a family member or a friend who knows you well, they probably won’t think twice about your crossed arms; however, to new people, this gesture can look defensive or closed-off. It can also signal boredom and disinterest, so avoid it altogether., In other words, turn your body so that you are facing the person fully and directly. This will show him that you are completely engaged, and he has your complete attention.If you’re in a group of people, try not to cut anyone off or leave anyone out, but do try to pivot toward the person you want to impress.
If you’re in a situation where it isn’t possible to completely turn towards the person, just maintain eye contact to show your interest. Disrupting an interaction by trying to angle your body towards him could make you appear overeager and might be a bit awkward.

, Don’t get too close and invade the person's personal space, but tilt your body toward her to show her you’re attentive and engrossed in whatever she is talking about.Even if you’re just ever so slightly leaning in over a tabletop or in a chair, it can convey a lot to the person you’re with whom you’re communicating.


If you aren’t in a situation where you feel comfortable leaning in, just make sure you aren’t leaning away. Just like leaning in shows interest, leaning back shows disinterest., This applies to both sitting and standing. Nothing says disinterest like angling your legs in the opposite direction, as if you're ready to leave at a moment's notice! Most people focus intently on their facial expressions and their hands when they're trying to make a good impression, but it's important to pay attention to your lower half as well., These nonverbal cues can show the other person that you’re fully engaged in what he is saying, and in agreement. Try nodding three times to show that you’re really absorbing what he is saying. When it comes to smiling, make sure it reaches your eyes! If you turn up the corners of your mouth but your eyes remain neutral, you could come off as fake and insincere., Don’t be obvious, but try to casually match her body language and facial expression. By doing this, you’ll help the other person feel comfortable toward you. This mirroring technique has even been shown to increase a person's good will toward the person mirroring her.If she's leaning on a wall, lean on the wall. If she has crossed her arms, cross your arms. It’s an effortless technique that can pay off big time.

, Even if you’re in a formal setting, if he has clearly said something that was intended to illicit a laugh, laugh! Show him that you have a sense of humor, and you’re listening to what he is saying.If you’re in a tense or nerve-wracking situation, laughter is a great way to help you loosen up and lighten the mood.


Avoid laughing out of nerves or because you have nothing to say. Random, unprompted laughter may make you look uncomfortable and nervous.

Make your environment inhospitable for coyotes.,
Do not leave food outside of your home or campsite.,
Prepare for encounters with coyotes if you frequent their natural habitat.",How to Survive a Coyote Attack1," Most coyotes are no longer afraid of humans and there are reports of increased coyote sightings in urban and suburban areas. In other words, a coyote who does not immediately run away when encountering humans has probably become habituated to the presence of people. You can help prevent coyotes from wandering into your neighborhood by attending to the environment in several ways.


Keep trees and shrubbery neatly trimmed to eliminate hiding places for coyotes.
Install coyote-proof fences or other motion-triggered deterrents like light or sprinkler systems.;
, Humans increase the likelihood of conflicts with coyotes by feeding the animals directly and by giving them access to garbage, pet food and other food remnants.


Clean up fallen fruit and birdseed from your yard and do not keep any pet food outdoors.
Secure your garbage and compost bins with rope, chain, bungee cords or weights to keep coyotes from getting in. To prevent tipping, secure the side handles to stakes driven into the ground or keep the bins in a secured shed or garage., When hiking, bring a large stick or umbrella with you in case of attack. It is also useful to have noisemakers, like air horns and whistles, readily on hand in order to scare off any approaching coyotes. Other options include vessels filled with chemical solutions, such as pepper spray or a vinegar-filled water gun.

Do not approach or frighten a coyote if you see one in the wilderness.,
Engage in ""hazing."",
Protect more vulnerable members of your group.,
Do not turn your back on the coyote(s) at any point.",How to Survive a Coyote Attack2," Coyotes commonly ""shadow"" humans passing through their territory to ensure that you don't bother their dens. As long as the animal does not approach, you should just continue with whatever you were doing.Escalate your response only if a coyote comes closer. Remember, most coyotes prefer to stay away from large predators, including humans. Avoid turning a harmless sighting into a dangerous encounter by evaluating the situation carefully before undertaking any action.

, To haze is to scare the animal away from you. Make yourself look as big, imposing, and aggressive as possible. Wave your arms above your head and shout in a low but loud and authoritative tone in order to frighten the coyote into retreating. Use tools that appeal to multiple sense, including different lights, sounds and motions.


Stand your ground. Make eye contact and haze until the coyote(s) retreats. Be consistent and assertive in your behaviors and mannerisms and make sure to allow room for the animal(s) to escape.
Keep the coyote's attention on you as the source of danger and discomfort. Do not haze from buildings or cars because the animal won't be able to see you as clearly. Throw objects such as sticks and rocks to make the coyote feel unwelcome and induce it to leave you alone.
Spray a hose or water gun and make loud noises by banging pots together if you are approached by a coyote in a residential or urban area.

, Immediately recall and leash your dog or other pets. Shield any children with your body or place them in the center of the group and form a ring around them.


Educate children about what to if they encounter a coyote on their own at home or in the wild. Instruct them to keep eye contact with the animal and to throw rocks and sticks if cornered and without an adult nearby to assist. Demonstrate and rehearse different situations with the children., This indicates submission, weakness and fear; instead, face the coyote to maintain a dominant posture."
"
Back away slowly and carefully from the coyote.,
Never run away from a coyote.,
Throw sticks or clumps of dirt if the coyote becomes aggressive.,
Continue to be loud and bold.,
Protect your throat and arteries if the animal attacks you.,
Avoid harming the animal.,
Consult a doctor or other medical professional if attacked.",How to Survive a Coyote Attack3," Do this if your initial efforts to look and sound aggressive do not force the animal to retreat. While moving away, maintain your dominant and powerful stance and keep facing the coyote.

, This increases like likelihood of being attacked. You cannot outrun a coyote. It may go against your gut instinct to not run away, but this is an important preventive measure against a coyote attack., Coyotes show their aggression by growling or snarling. If you see these behaviors, try throwing sticks or dirt, either at the ground near the coyote or at the coyote itself. Avoid aiming to strike the coyote's head, as this may intensify the animal's aggression.

, Try again to back away from the animal. De-escalation is the best strategy as an attack looks increasingly possible.

, These areas of the body are vulnerable to serious injury and blood loss through biting.

, Do not use poisons against coyotes as these are inhumane and may also be illegal. Further, they may result in the secondary poisoning of other pets or animals.In addition, do not try to enclose or capture the animal. It is most important that you get yourself (and your group if this is the case) to safety. Further, it is illegal to keep wild animals and domesticate them.

, You should especially see a medical professional if you have been bitten so the wound can be assessed and cleaned. In most attacks to date, the coyote was either being fed by people or had bitten an individual while he or she tried to rescue a pet from the coyote. In rare cases, individuals were bitten by cornered coyotes; even more rare are attacks by rabid coyotes."
"
Report any aggressive coyote behavior to the appropriate authorities.,
Keep track of when and where you encounter coyotes.,
Follow up with the health, animal control, or other authorities.",How to Survive a Coyote Attack4," If this behavior occurred on your property, consult your local municipality. For encounters in a preserved forest or national park, report to the relevant forestry or parks district., If you encounter them in urban or suburban spaces, share this information with neighbors and your local animal control branch. Coyotes are creatures of habit.Be sure to change your routine if you see a coyote at the same time and place while walking your pet., Coyotes involved in biting attacks will be targeted and removed from the population. They are then often tested for rabies and are killed if found infected. However, it is important to note that an attack by an individual coyote does not warrant the general killing of coyotes. Recall that coyote attacks on humans are exceptionally rare."

Schedule regular checkups with your vet.,
Take care of your dog’s teeth.,
Walk your dog regularly.,
Make sure your dog is up to date on their vaccinations.,
Watch your dog’s weight.,
Don't avoid or delay veterinarian care.",How to Save Money on Vet Care for Your Dog1," A key to preventative care for your dog is making sure they see the vet regularly for checkups. This way your vet can keep an eye on your dog’s weight, vitality, and check for signs of chronic disease such as arthritis or cancer. Make sure you take your dog in for a checkup with the veterinarian one or more times per year, depending on their age.If your dog is under seven years old, schedule a checkup once per year.
If your dog is over seven years old, make sure they see the vet every six months.;
, Prioritizing dental care is an investment in your dog’s long-term health. Your dog should visit the vet annually for a dental exam and professional cleaning. You should also feed your dog nutritious food as recommended by your vet, and give them dental bones or chew toys regularly to help prevent plaque and tartar buildup., Dogs need exercise and a daily walk around the block won’t cut it for most. Making sure your dog exercises regularly is key to maintaining health and vitality, and will help your dog lead a long and healthy life. Make sure your dog gets between 30 and 60 minutes of exercise each day, such as walking, running, or intense toy play., It’s critical that your dog is up to date on their vaccinations. Keeping your dog vaccinated can save money on expensive vet bills resulting from illnesses that could be prevented by a vaccine, such as parvovirus. Contact your vet to make sure your dog’s vaccinations are up to date, and keep a list of when they are due for their next round of shots.Ask your vet’s office to send you regular reminders about your dog’s vaccinations. This will help you plan for and stay on top of your dog’s vaccination schedule.

, Dogs that are overweight have a shorter life expectancy and lower quality of life than dogs whose weight is within a healthy range. Make an appointment with your vet and ask them to examine your dog to determine if they are overweight or obese. In the meantime, make sure you are not overfeeding your dog and that they are getting enough exercise.Overweight and obese dogs are more prone to developing arthritis, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, cancer, kidney disease, and heart and respiratory disease.

, It is extremely important that you do not avoid or delay getting vet care for your dog. Doing so is detrimental to your dog's health. It can also end up costing you a lot more in the long run if you put off prioritizing your dog's health.

Look at their nose.,
Observe their length.,
Observe the skin color.,
Look at the head shape and dorsal fins.,
Check out the teeth.",How to Spot a Tiger Shark1," If you see a tiger shark, you will know it by the distinct shape of its nose. The snout on a tiger shark is wide and blunt.It is also short. The nostrils are quite wide, almost in line with its eyes, which are on opposite sides of its body.When a tiger shark raises its head, you should be able to see a frown because the lips come inward a bit, slightly exposing the gums in a perpetual grimace.;
, Tiger sharks grow to become some of the largest sharks in the world. Large species can get up to as long as 20 to 25 feet (6 to 7.5 meters) and weigh about 1,900 pounds (900 kg).However, many remain under 15 feet (4.5 meters) and less than 1,800 pounds (800 kg). Baby tiger sharks (called pups) are born between one and three feet long (40-90 cm) and grow fast the first few years of their lives.
Pups potentially double in size their first year.

, Color is important with tiger sharks because their name is derived from the stripes visible along their backs (there are often spots of the same shade). The shark itself is usually gray and the vertical stripes are darker, close to black. However, the stripes usually fade in older adult tiger sharks.Tiger sharks can also be blue or light green. Their underbellies are usually white or light yellow., Aside from its stripes, a clear indicator you are observing a tiger shark is its distinctive head shape and dorsal fin location. Tiger shark heads are large and shaped like wedges, with the blunt nose and wide nostrils on the end. The fins are long, especially the upper tail. The dorsal fins are close to the tail, a placement that is unique to tiger sharks., Finally, tiger shark teeth are distinctive. They are large and curved with serrated edges. There is a notch on the outside edge of each tooth. The teeth are the same on the top and bottom. They get progressively smaller the closer they get to the corners of the mouth.When they eat, they shake their heads back and forth so that the teeth produce a saw-like motion, making use of those serrated edges.
The jaws are quite powerful."

Find a general location suitable for finding deer or other large game tracks.,
Look for a place where deer might have a regular source of food.,
Identify a deer or game trail.,
Find bedding areas.,
Look down at the ground.,
Observe the shape of a track you’ve found.,
Take note of the size of the tracks.,
Distinguish between similar animals.,
Spot other signs of deer movement.,
Know what different tracks indicate about the deer’s behavior.",How to Spot Deer Tracks," Depending on where you are, there probably are a variety of wilderness areas where you could try to spot deer tracks. Don’t be afraid to choose a few and to experiment and hike around the forest a bit before you start seriously looking. Consider:


Private hunting reserves (make sure you have permission).
National Parks and National Forests.
State Parks and State Forests.
Other public lands.
A variety of habitats including plains, mountains, lowland forest, and more.;
, As with people, a regular food source will draw deer. In order to increase your chances of finding deer tracks, try to locate a place where deer will frequent for food. That way, you won’t just be counting on the luck of coming across tracks, but you’ll be narrowing down areas where you won’t have to look.


Deer like to eat fruit. If there are fruit trees or any kind or berry bush, take a look.
Deer rely on grasses and other plants for food, too. They particularly like flowering plants and non-wood plants. If you see a field of green grass and flowers, you might want to check there.
Deer will also eat mushrooms., One of the best ways to spot deer tracks is to first find a trail that deer frequently use. If you’re on public or private land in a rural area, you should be able to find one relatively easily. As a result of the abundance of deer and their frequent use of trails, game trails are one of the best locations to try to spot deer tracks.


Depending on your location, deer trails may have high or low traffic.
Deer trails often appear as human trails, but will be somewhat less worn and pronounced. They won’t often be straight, either.
Deer trails will often still have some grass or plant growth on the ground that might be ripped up or disturbed., Deer spend a large part of the day bedding down and sleeping. Deer beds will vary in the way they look. In a tall field of grass, the grass will be matted down in a circular pattern. In a thicket or a location with lots of leaf cover on the ground, the brush and leaves will be flattened or moved out of the way. If you can find favored bedding areas, you’ll have a much better chance of spotting deer tracks, too. To find bedding areas, look for:


Night-time bedding areas. Deer like to rest near easy feeding spots. Look for alfalfa fields, abandoned fruit trees, and open areas with lots of green grass and non-woody flowering plants. From these areas, look for places with more cover, where the deer will feel hidden and protected. You might find a bedding spot.
Day-time bedding areas are often in denser woods or thickets. In areas with hills or mountains, they might be higher up rather than in the valley.
The location and circumstances of bedding areas will vary based on climate, topography, and environment., As you’re wandering around the forest, look at the ground and look for tracks. Spending a lot of time looking for tracks is really the only way to be sure you’ll find them. Don’t give up and persevere. You’ll find them soon enough.


You will need to be in an area where animal's feet make an impression in the soil.
Rocky or very sandy soil will be difficult to see tracks in.
Loamy soil, moist clay soil, or packed, damp sandy soil is good material for observing tracks. , The most important part of spotting deer tracks is knowing the general shape of the deer's track and how to distinguish it from the tracks of other animals. Deer have a hoof that is split (cloven) which appears as two symmetrical haves in an oblong crescent shape. This isn’t the easiest thing in the world to discern because there are a lot of animals that roam the forest and there are a lot of things, including human footprints, leaves, and brush, that obscure the shape of deer tracks.


When viewed upside down, deer tracks have a heart shape made up of the two hooves.
The sides of deer tracks are convex (curved outward)
The tips of hooves bend toward the inside of the track., The size of deer tracks is one of the best ways to tell it apart from the tracks of other animals. If you know the size, you’ll be able to eliminate other potential animals like elk, moose, and boar. Elk, Moose, and other large hoofed animals have much larger tracks. Hogs, on the other hand, have similar tracks to deer, but the hooves are splayed more, and tend to have a rounder shape.


The tracks of fawns or yearlings tend to be about 1 inch long.
Fronts tracks of adult deer will be roughly 2 to 3 inches (5 to 8 cm) long, give or take. They’ll be about 1.5 to 2.5 inches wide.
Rear tracks will be about 1.5 to 3 inches (3.8 to 7.6 cm) long. They’ll be about 1 to 2.5 inches (3 to 6 cm) wide., While you may be good at spotting tracks in the forest, it is sometimes hard to distinguish between deer and similar animals like antelope or goat. This is made even tougher by the fact that environmental conditions – mud, dirt, rocks, leaves, and more – often obscure animal tracks. Make sure to study different animal tracks carefully so you won’t confuse a deer track for another animal track.


Pronghorn antelope have a similar upside-down heart shape appearance, but the sides are concave not convex.
Mountain goat tracks are wider and much more rounded than deer tracks. The front tips are centered rather than being pointed toward the inside of the hooves.
Bighorn sheep tracks are straight rather than being curved inward. They’re also wedge shaped and the tips are duller than deer tracks.
Wild boar tracks are relatively wide and round compared to deer tracks. The tips are not pointy and are dull., One way to help you spot deer tracks is to look for other signs of deer being nearby. While deer can move through some areas without leaving much of a trace other than tracks, certain environs provide much better evidence of recent deer activity. There are a number of things you can look for when looking for tracks:


Plants that have been eaten by deer. Look for stalks close to the ground that have rough cuts bitten off. Rough cuts show because deer incisors are not as sharp as other animals like rabbits.
Look for deer feces. Deer feces (also called scat) is identifiable by its oval shape. These oval pellets have a point on one end and a dimple on the other.
Try to see if there is evidence of rutting. Rutting is when bucks use their antlers and rub them against the trunks of trees or large branches. You might also see leaves torn up and other evidence., Different tracks in different patterns indicate different things about a deer’s behavior. If you know how tracks correspond with certain behaviors, you’ll have a larger certainty in identifying your deer tracks. There are several things you should know:


Tracks headed downhill or down a mountain indicate that a deer is going to feed.
Tracks headed uphill mean that the deer is probably going to bed down.
Tracks going in circles or back and forth probably indicate that the deer is feeding."

Bring the right equipment.,
See them at night and on cloudy days.,
Look for a solo dorsal fin.,
Find them in murky tropical waters.,
Look at what they're eating.",How to Spot a Tiger Shark2," If you want to observe tiger sharks, find a position from which to observe them. They hunt at night or on cloudy days near the coastline of tropical water. Since they prefer areas where other wildlife gather, such as coral reefs, river estuaries, and wharves, look for ways to observe these areas. To be safe while watching for tiger sharks, stay out of the water. Sit on a dock, on the beach, or in a large boat.
Keep your eyes on the water. Look for a dorsal fin that is near the upper tail fin. , If you are trying to avoid coming in contact with a tiger shark but still want to observe it, you might need binoculars. A telescope could also be helpful. You might be quite a distance from the tiger shark location, especially if you are playing it safe.


Don’t try to snorkel in an attempt to observe tiger sharks.
Other things you might bring include a camera and a phone (and first aid kit) for emergencies. Bring along phone numbers for local emergency personnel, the Coast Guard, etc.

, Tiger sharks are nocturnal, rising to the surface to hunt for food either at night or on days that are overcast. They swim close to shorelines to do their hunting.If you are trying to observe a tiger shark, it is best to do so on a cloudy day.

, Tiger sharks usually hunt and live on their own, although they will sometimes join in with other sharks. Usually pods of tiger sharks don’t get larger than six members.If you’re trying to spot a tiger shark, look for a dorsal fin that is all by itself.

, Tiger sharks love coastlines. In fact, they patrol them. Studies have shown that tiger sharks swim up and down the length of land masses to hunt for prey.They also prefer river estuaries, lagoons, harbors, wharves, reefs, anywhere in the water where smaller animals congregate. They tend to live in warm water.Tiger sharks are predominantly located in the warm waters of the Atlantic Ocean in the southeast U.S. area and in South America along the coast of Brazil. They also have a strong presence in the Indian Ocean and Arabian Sea.

, Tiger sharks are carnivores, known to eat pretty much anything they can find. They eat other sharks and fish as well as sea turtles, birds, sting rays, dolphins, squid, and crustaceans.They are good scavengers due to their keen senses of sight and smell.Researchers have found all kinds of things in tiger shark stomachs, including antlers and trash."

Stay out of the water if you see a tiger shark.,
Keep in mind they are close to being endangered.,
Visit a tiger shark in an aquarium.",How to Spot a Tiger Shark3," Take measures to avoid being attacked. As far as shark attacks on people, tiger sharks rank only behind the great white shark in frequency of attacks. And unlike the great white, tiger sharks don’t swim away after biting a human.However, tiger shark attacks are rare. For example, in Hawaii, there is only an average of one shark attack per year (and it’s not always a tiger shark).Get out of the water as soon as you spot a dorsal fin.


Be aware of your surroundings. Because tiger sharks will eat anything, make sure you aren’t swimming near small sea creatures or in lagoon-like areas of tropical water.
In the U.S., shark attacks are most frequent in the Daytona Beach area, along the Atlantic Coast.It is believed that most of these attacks are by blacktip and Blacknose sharks.There are only 111 recorded unprovoked tiger shark attacks worldwide in the last 400 years. Only 31 were fatal., Humans haven’t left tiger sharks alone. They are in fact considered big game. They are hunted for their skin, fins, meat, and livers, which contain high levels of vitamin A. However, they are considered a “near threatened” species.They take a long time to repopulate, so overfishing of tiger sharks will eventually lead to their extinction.

, It is rare, but you may be able to find an aquarium with a tiger shark. The Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach, California, took on a female tiger shark in 2009. Most aquariums are new to caring for tiger sharks, so they have to be very cautious."

Applying for a zebra is usually very hard.,
See if you have the right amount of money and requirements.,
If you can't wait to buy a zebra, move to West Virginia or Wisconsin.",How to Raise Zebras1," If something bad happens to the zebra, all the responsibility is yours. Make sure you read all the rules of your country/state for owning a zebra before applying one.


Make sure you don't apply an endangered or rare species of zebras.;
, You have to have at least 2 years of experience for caring exotic animals (including one year for the animal you want to own, which, in this case, is the zebra). You will also need to be interviewed, including everyone in your family about zebras, so be prepared. Don't forget that your house needs to be suitable for a zebra.


Zebras can only be pets in some states only. If you have a zebra as an illegal pet, huge penalties may apply.

, You'll need $3000 - $7000 for only one zebra. You'll need a huge property enough to fit one zebra. It's great if you actually live in the safari rather than the city. You'll also need to build a huge and strong fence around the area so they don't escape.

, These two states have only a few restrictions on exotic-pet ownership, and you don't need permission from the local governments to start a zebra farm.

Wear light weight clothing.,
Learn foot commands.,
Approach the elephant from the right side.,
Mount the elephant.,
Sit up straight.,
Ride the elephant bareback.,
Dismount the elephant.",How to Ride an Elephant1," Decide between shorts or pants. Shorts might keep you cooler, but make sure to wear longer shorts as they will ride up. Pants would help protect your legs from possible vegetation and bugs. You can always roll your pants up if it's too hot.


You may also want to bring a hat, bug spray, and sunblock.
Take a change of clothes with you. Some elephant trails cross or arrive at rivers in which the elephants might enter to play. Be prepared to possibly get wet.
Leave anything you would care about breaking behind.;
, When you ride an elephant, you use your feet to control the elephant's movement. Your instructor should teach you the commands before your ride. Be sure that you understand and practice the commands before you get on your elephant. Here are some basic commands:To walk forwards, press your toes behind the elephant's ears.
To walk backwards, press backwards with your heels.
To have the elephant lift its trunk, use your toes to push upwards.
To have the elephant sit down, push downward with one of your heels.
To have the elephant turn to the left, hold your left heel backwards and press forward with your right toes.
To have the elephant turn right, hold your right heel backwards and press forward with your left toes.

, Always approach the elephant from the side where it can see you. If you come at the elephant from the back or from the front, the elephant may not be able to see you. Many elephants are trained to attack anyone that approaches from the left so always approach from the elephant's right side.Pay attention to the elephant's demeanor as you approach. Signs of a happy elephant include flapping ears and a swaying trunk and tail.
The elephant may examine you with its trunk to smell you or see if you have some food.
If the elephant is staring at you intently, holding their trunk in the mouth, or blowing the elephant may feel threatened or anxious. Do not approach the elephant if you notice any of these things.

, There are many different ways to mount an elephant. You can mount an elephant by using the front or hind legs, ears, trunk, or by stepping on the tusks.The instructor will have the elephant kneel so that you can mount. Grab the elephant's right ear and place your foot on its bent knee. Bend your knee and then swing your other leg over the elephant.Your instructor will give you directions before you mount and walk you through the process.
Try to mount as quickly as possible. Your elephant may begin to stand up rather quickly., Sit as forward on the neck as possible and tuck your legs behind the elephant's ears. Keep your toes behind the elephant's ears so you can give instructions. Sit up straight but be flexible and move with the elephant. This helps to keep your balance.Remember, elephants sway as they walk, so do not be too rigid.
If you feel like you're losing your balance place your hands on the elephant's back or neck to steady yourself.

, If you have the option, choose to ride the elephant bareback instead of using a chair. An elephant's neck is much stronger than its back.Riding on a chair puts more pressure on the elephant's back.


Often times saddles are on put on incorrectly or tightened improperly which leads to chafing of the elephant's skin.
Riding bareback also allows you to be closer and more intimate with the elephant.

, You will dismount the elephant the same way that you mounted the elephant.Command the elephant to sit down. Hold on to the elephant's right ear, bend your knees and swing your left foot over the elephant's body. Place your leg on its bent knee as you step down.


Make sure the elephant is in the sitting position before you begin to dismount.
Remember to maintain your balance as the elephant kneels down.

Zebras are known to be herding animals so it's better if you buy a pair of zebras so the zebra won't stress out.,
You'll need lots of grass for them to graze.,
You will need a huge fence around your area and a big place.,
Be prepared for infectious diseases.,
During Winter, ensure that they receive enough heat.,
Be ready when they turn violent.,
Check if your zebra is in good condition and body-shape.,
Show affection to your zebra.",How to Raise Zebras2," It's even better if you have more than two, but you need a lot of money and time to take care of them. They will show affection to each other when they groom each other with their teeth, etc.

, Zebras are fast eaters so you'll need a lot of grass. Provide them with fresh grass because some zebras only will eat the best grass. If you don't enough good condition grass, provide them with other things such as hay, alfalfa, shrubs, herbs, twigs, leaves, bark or carrots. When you buy a zebra, they should give you tips on how much you should feed them.

, Zebras really want to get out of small places, so the larger the better. You'll really need a 8-foot fence and be sure to check regularly if it needs repairs.

, Zebras are very prone to infectious diseases such as rabies and tetanus so vaccinate them before buying them. If they are infected, be sure to bring them to a vet for treatment.

, Some countries have very cold climates so it is recommended to have zebra pets there. Zebras are known to die in very cold climates so let them stay inside a shed or barn, paddock or house where there is enough heat. Check constantly if they are in danger of hypothermia because they are accustomed to the climate of Africa.

, If you annoy them or if they are angry at you, they can attack you. They usually attack you with their teeth or kick you with their hooves. When owning a zebra and looking after one, it's always better to have more than 4 people so they could help you out during a fight. Never look at a zebra alone.


If you do get attacked, it best to run or flee from the scene so you aren't seriously injured.

, Check it's weight, height etc. Bring it to a vet often. Males zebras are usually bigger than females. Don't forget to solve the problem!


Its average body length should be 6–8.5 feet (2.6 m).

50–52 inches (132.1 cm) at the shoulder.
A 18-inch tail.


It should weigh about 770 pounds (350 kg).

, This is the most significant step. If you don't show affection then what's the point of owning a zebra? You can groom it, hug it etc. to show simple affection. Just provide them with everything they need an great quality food.

Be allowed to ride bareback, by yourself.,
Determine how the staff treat the elephants.,
Examine the elephant's environment.",How to Ride an Elephant2," Riding bareback with only one person per elephant is in the best interest of the animal. Avoid places that allow more than one rider and that strap platforms to the backs of the elephants.If you visit a place that has platforms, ask to ride bareback instead.


Make sure the camp you choose has weight limits for riders.
The rides should also be no more than 20 minutes.Long rides are difficult for the elephant.

, Many different methods are used to control an elephant. Verbal and foot commands and positive reinforcement are healthy ways to control an elephant. If you notice that hooks, nails, fear, and punishment are used to control the animals, choose a different camp.Fresh cuts and bloody wounds may be a sign that the elephant is being abused. Cuts are often covered in a purple antiseptic spray, a bandage, or a plastic bag.
You can also check to see if there have been any complaints of abuse or mistreatment filed against the elephant camp.
Visit the camp website and read reviews before you visit. If the site mentions any type of elephant show or elephant painting, choose a different camp.

, Elephants are social animals and like to be with other elephants. Choose a camp that allows the elephants to socialize and not be isolated. The elephants should be allowed to roam freely and not be chained up.If you notice the elephants are swaying in place or rocking, they are likely experiencing emotional distress.
The elephants should also have regular access to food, water and mud.

Understand the problem with riding elephants.,
Volunteer at an elephant sanctuary.",How to Ride an Elephant3," Elephants are wild animals and must be controlled before humans can ride them. In order to control them, elephants are put through training that breaks their spirit and makes them more compliant. Elephants are often deprived of food and sleep and are physically abused to achieve this. Elephants in captivity also die younger than elephants that remain in the wild.Asian elephants are an endangered species, and while responsible elephant tourism can help conserve these animals, elephant riding is not considered responsible tourism and does more harm than good.
If you do choose to ride elephants, take the time to find an ethical place that treats the elephants well.

, Many elephant sanctuaries will allow you to volunteer and help them take care of their elephants. Activities include planting and harvesting elephant food, developing elephant friendly tourism options, feeding elephants, bathing elephants and walking with elephants.These experiences are also very educational and will help you understand the elephant tourism industry.


Many of the elephants in these sanctuaries have been abused and are being rehabilitated.
This experience also allows you to observe elephants in their natural habitat.
The Elephant Asia Rescue and Survival Foundation (EARSAsia) maintains a list of organizations in Southeast Asia that ethically treat their elephants.

Learn to identify types of bears before you go hiking.,
Purchase a bear bag in which to store your snacks.,
Carry bear spray.,
Talk loudly when you are out on a hike.,
Don’t run if you see a bear on the trail.,
Hike with the wind at your back.,
Speak in a loud, low voice and open your arms wide to keep bears away.,
Understand that the best deterrent is to avoid surprising a bear.",How to Keep Bears Away1," Black bears and grizzly bears require different deterrents. Stay alert and avoid coming between a bear and her cub.


A black bear can actually be black, brown or cinnamon colored. They are usually smaller, have pointier ears and don’t have a hump.






A grizzly bear is brown, blonde or even slightly silver. They have a hump on their back, have a dish shaped face and rounder ears. Full-grown, they are bigger than black bears.





;
, Their sense of smell is extremely acute and they are constantly foraging in the summer and fall months.

, It is a type of pepper spray that creates a 30-foot (9 m) cone of spray. It is only to be used when a bear is charging at you to change its direction.


Keep your bear spray within arms reach. Learn where the trigger is in advance.
Pull the trigger when the bear is within 40 feet (12 m) of you.
Never use bear spray as a preventative measure. It is extremely potent and should not be sprayed on equipment.

, Grizzly and black bears try to avoid this sound. Bear bells are usually too quiet to keep bears away, but human conversation will do the trick.


Don’t hike alone in bear country. If you don’t want to talk, carry a satellite radio and set it to a talk show.
Bears are more likely to approach an individual than a group.

, Bears run up to 35 mph (56 km/h), far faster than humans. They can also follow you up trees or into water.

, The bear will smell you and keep away. If you haven’t hidden your food in an airtight, bear-safe container, it could work to your disadvantage.

, Stand your ground and make noise, while avoiding eye contact.

, They may stand on their hind legs to get a better look at you, but it’s best to be confident and stand your ground.


If a small black bear attacks you, you may be able to fight back.
If a grizzly bear attacks you, curl up in the fetal position. Keep your hands laced behind your back. If the bear realizes you are not a threat or dead, it may walk away.
Remember that bear attacks are rare."

Consider your reasons for raising rheas before purchasing them.,
Check whether you'll need a permit in your state, province, region or country.,
Select your rhea stock.,
Prepare an appropriate living space for the rheas.,
Plant trees, bushes and shrubs inside the fenced-off area.,
Provide a shelter for the birds.For their safety, all young birds should be closed in at night.,
Feed your rheas a diet as close to their natural food as possible.,
Supplement the rheas' diet with suitable foods.,
Provide grit for proper digestion.,
Supply fresh drinking water at all times.,
Select your stock for breeding purposes.",How to Raise Rheas," You must be dedicated to taking care of the rheas, facilitating their healthy growth and recouping your investment by knowing ahead of time why you're raising rheas. Some of the most usual reason for raising rheas include:


Meat (red) (only if there is an established market in your area, such as gourmet restaurants or food stores)
Feathers and leather
Oils and creams
Eggs (each female rhea produces around 20 to 60 eggs per year)
Selling chicks to other rhea raisers
Furthering their protection
For their own sake (intrinsic value).;
, In some places, the fact that rheas can be treated as livestock means that you may not need to get any special license or permit.However, this will vary depending on your location, so always check first.

, There are two types of rhea, the white rhea and the common or gray rhea.Unless you need the particular color, both types should be fine for raising. Choose a reputable breeder and ask as many questions as possible about the health, background and care requirements for the birds you choose.


It is a really good idea to get an experienced rhea breeder to accompany you when purchasing your first rhea chicks or adults. This person will know to ask the right questions and will know how to steer clear of inbred, deformed or unhealthy birds.

, Fence in an area large enough for adult birds to freely roam using chain link fencing. Always have the housing in place before bringing home the birds.


The more male birds you own, the more space you will need in order to accommodate the colony. Males become aggressive during the breeding season and need about one acre for every two males, in order to avoid issue and injury.

, This is important so that the rheas have natural shelter and can turn this vegetation into nesting areas. Rheas will also look to these plants as a food source.

, Adult rheas will also appreciate shelter from cold, wind, heat, predators and sometimes, each other. The size of the shelter will be determined by the size and amount of rheas you will be hosting.


A three-sided shed or a lean-to is adequate for adult rheas. A small garden shed would work for young birds.
Use a dog house or kennel to house hatchling rheas. Baby rheas' shelters should be equipped with a working heat lamp to ensure that they're kept warm enough.
If you are planning to hatch rheas, you will need an incubator.
Hay or straw can be used for rhea bedding in any of the shelters.

, For the most natural approach to raising rheas, set aside established sections of grass, clover and alfalfa in a large enclosed area. Use this area to promote natural grazing among your rheas.


In the wild, rheas eat seeds, herbaceous plants, small mammals and insects., There are various foods that are good for the rheas:


Generous scatterings of fruits and vegetables can be tossed to the rheas in order to supplement and round out their diet.
Invest in some ratite food to give to the rheas. This will be balanced with the nutrients the birds need, although it's a good idea to talk to a vet who specializes in care of large birds.
Consider portioning out dog food to make up for any natural proteins the rheas may not be getting from not being able to roam in their natural environment.

, To help the birds digest their food, make sure they have access to grit of some sort, such as sand or small pebbles.

, A water source should be provided for the rheas, one that can be accessed all day and night, and is frequently refreshed.

, For a healthy, breeding colony, keep one male for every two to three females. Ideally, you will have two males. One of them will become the dominant male and will feed off the competition of the presence of the other male to breed with the females. The second male can also step in and take the spot of the dominant male should something happen where the alpha bird can not perform anymore.


Rheas will not start to breed until they mature. This will be around the ages of two to four.One male usually has up to five female mates."

Take a photograph of a koala's nose.,
Look at the white/pale pattern inside and around the nostrils.,
Now compare the first koala (Truganina) to this koala (Pat).,
To make it easier, here is a comparison of the two koalas nose pattern target areas.,
So once you've seen it, what do you do with this information?,
File the photograph in a folder on your computer for quick reference in future.,
Trace the nose pattern with tracing paper over a printed photograph.,
Use a computer graphics program.",How to Identify Koalas by Their Nose Patterns," The best identification photos are taken from front-on and slightly below the koala. The focus should be on the nostrils, in good light (not too much shadow or contrast).;
, This is the 'target area' where the nose pattern exists. See the area inside the pink outline in the image. Markings outside of the target area can vary throughout the life of the koala, so should be noted, but should not be relied upon for identification.

, Look just at the target area - can you see the differences?

, Truganina on the left has a lot more white in her nose pattern. The white extends outside the nostril area in a few places. Her lips have a lot of white too. There are black spots in the white. Pat, on right, has a simpler nose pattern. The white is almost totally confined inside the nostrils.

, There are three ways you can record nose patterns. Use just one, or two in combination, whatever works for you.

, Compare each new koala photograph to the existing photographs until you achieve a match by eye. These two photographs above are of the same koala, Truganina, 5 years apart. Can you see the match? This method works if you can see the match easily, and if there's not a lot of koalas to choose from. It will help if you file carefully, and keep a record of each koala seen (see Tips below on how to do this)

, This method is perfectly valid, quick and easy especially if you're not computer savvy, or don't have a lot of time. Take a photocopy or scan of your diagram, keep it handy in a binder to check against future photographs of the same koala.

, This method is useful if there are several people using the method on the same koalas, or if you are not confident of making the comparison by eye. Simple programs are fine - like Photoshop or Paint Shop Pro. Powerful programs like GIMP are good too. The image above shows two nose pattern diagrams, created with GIMP, of the same koala nearly 5 years apart. Pink layer = December 2013, blue layer = February 2008

Keep all your food away from your tent.,
Set your campfire and cooking area at least 100 yards (91 m) from your tents.,
Buy a hard-shelled, bear-proof canister to store your food.,
Move to a new site if you see bear droppings.

,
Hang your food bag 10 feet (3 m) above the ground and 10 feet (3.0 m) away from a tree.,
Bang on pots and pans if you see a bear in the area.",How to Keep Bears Away2," It is your job to keep bears from identifying humans as a food source. This is dangerous for humans and may result in the bear being euthanized.


This includes toothpaste, lotion and deodorant, which often smell like food., Keep the clothes that you cooked in this far away from your tent.

, This is better than hanging your food in a cloth bag. Eat canned and dried foods to minimize the smell.

,, You will need a good amount of rope to accomplish this., Leave the area if you see a number of bears and it is still daylight. Don’t hike out in the dark, or you can risk surprising a bear.

"
"
Invest in bear-proof garbage cans.,
Cut down your fruit trees.,
Remove bird feeders.,
Clean your barbecue after each use.,
Leave a radio talk show on when you are away.,
Install electric fences around beehives and livestock pens.,
Use ammonia or bleach (not both together) to clean garbage cans and around your house.,
Don’t place pet food outside.,
Close off the area below decks and porches in the winter.",How to Keep Bears Away3," Although they can cost between $150 and $300, the special bear locks will keep you from providing bears with an additional food source. Keep your garbage cans locked inside until garbage day to reduce the odor.


One study showed that human trash accounts for 70 percent of human-bear conflicts., They are a food source, and bears may come from up to 60 miles (97 km) away to enjoy them.If you want to keep fruit trees, pick them before they are ripe or just after they ripen.


If your town is near a bear habitat and has a lot of fruit trees, organize an event to encourage people to pick their fruit. Removing the temptation for them to eat off neighbors’ trees will also keep them further away from you.

, Bears are omnivorous and enjoy seeds. Black bears are good at climbing, so hanging them high on your trees does not remove the risk of a food-seeking visit.


If you still want to hang bird feeders, keep them at least 10 feet (3.0 m) off the ground and six feet from all trees.

, The meat drippings at the bottom will be especially attractive.

, Keep it on in your yard. Bears prefer to steer clear of humans and radio noise can tell them another large animal is in the area.

, Although they will need to be more hungry and desperate to attack these food sources near human habitation, they do pose a risk.

, Bears don’t like the smell of either of these products. For example, leaving a sturdy container with some diluted ammonia in it around your compost can deter them.


Better yet, if you are in a bear habitat, avoid keeping a compost pile altogether.
Clean recycling containers extremely well or lock them up inside.

, This renewable food source can create “nuisance bears” that return frequently for food. It may also provide a higher chance of smell which would bring the bears toward your belongings.

, Bolt and reinforce doors on cabins. Bears occasionally break into summer homes to den, especially when they are sure humans have vacated the area."

Note the coloration.,
Observe the head structure and teeth.,
Look at the fins.,
Try to determine the size.,
Keep the habitat and range in mind.,
Observe its behavior.",How to Identify a Sand Tiger Shark," Most sand tiger sharks have light brown or light greenish-gray backs and pale, grayish-white undersides. Adults usually have rust-colored spots scattered on the body, chiefly on the hind part of the body.;
, Sand tiger sharks have pointy heads with a flattened, conical snout and a long mouth that extends behind their eyes. They frequently swim with their mouth open, displaying three rows of protruding, smooth-edged, sharp-pointed teeth. Even when the mouth is shut, the teeth protrude in all directions, giving them a distinct menacing look. Numerous small teeth are present in the corners of the mouth.

, It is easy to confuse the sand tiger shark with the small-toothed sand tiger shark (Odontaspis ferox ) or, the less common, large-eyed sand tiger shark (Odontaspis noronhai ). However, sand tiger sharks have a distinctive, asymmetrical caudal fin (tail fin) with a more pronounced, notched upper lobe. In addition, the hind dorsal fin and the front dorsal fin of a sand tiger shark are almost equal in size. These large, broad-based grey fins are set back beyond the pectoral fins. Thus, the front dorsal is much closer to the pelvic fins than the pectoral fins. A male sand tiger shark can also be recognized by the grey, white-tipped claspers which are located on the underside of the body.

, The sand tiger is a large, bulky shark and this may be the first thing you notice. The average size of a sand tiger shark ranges from four to nine feet. The maximum length in males is about 9.9 feet (301 cm) while females can reach up to around 10.5 feet (320 cm).

, Sand tiger sharks are so-called because they have a tendency towards sandy shoreline habitats and can often be spotted very close to the shore. It has also been found that they like to linger socially beneath cliff overhangs or other similar structures. Divers typically encounter sand tiger sharks in such environments. The geographical range of sand tiger sharks is also quite well-documented. They commonly inhabit the Atlantic, western Pacific and Indian Oceans, and the Mediterranean and Adriatic Seas. However, any spotting in the Caribbean waters, eastern Pacific or New Zealand is rare. If you encounter a shark in these regions, it is probably not a sand tiger shark.

, The sand tiger shark is the only shark known to come to the surface and gulp air, which it then stores in its stomach. This enables the shark to become neutrally buoyant in the water column and hover motionless in the water. It has also been observed that when close enough to the prey, sand tiger sharks grab with a quick, sideways snap. They are nocturnal hunters and often hunt in groups when preying upon large shoals of fish. Although they are strong swimmers, they generally appear lethargic and swim slowly.

Talk to a person who has been friends with this friend before.,
Write down things that have to do with dates.,
If they look for a way out, ask firmly, ""Why did you tell me......?"",

Just ask.,
If you find a pattern of lying, take steps to protect yourself by beginning to distance yourself from the person.,
Check the believability.,
Look for Giveaways.",How to Find Out if Your Best Friend Is a Liar," See if these things are true. If your friend always has very negative things to say about past pals, it could be a red flag. There is no way that every single past friend has been a problem.;
, Usually people who lie forget their lies. Maybe your friend will say ""Danny from school asked me out last Monday."", then the next day they'll ""I pretended to be sick and skipped school on Monday!"" If you find that what your friend says doesn't jive with what others say happened on a certain day, be on guard. You don't have to check every little thing, but a pattern of mistakes is a red flag.

, See if they admit to what they said, or try to deny it.

, If they said something like, ""Caitlin said she's been gambling and needs money"", maybe you should ask Caitlin or one of her friends. This is especially true if what your pal is saying is out of character for the other person, or makes the other person always look bad.

, Don't look angry. Don't scare your friend away. A few well-placed questions can help you see deeper.

, You don't have to have an angry argument, but begin to pull away.

, If your friend says their parents know a whole load of 'celebrities', or they have loads of money, or they've been all across the globe (but go to the same places each year) then it should be obvious that they're lying.

, Someone who is lying to you will probably refuse to look you in the eye. They might tell you pointless details as they quickly think of their lie on the spot. They might touch their face, use a lot of ums and 'ahs' and if you show the slightest sign of disbelief they will elaborate.

Tell them how you feel.,
Don’t make assumptions.,
Apologize.,
Use “I” statements.,
Take responsibility for your actions.,
Don’t assign blame.,
Suggest ways to work through your issues.",How to Get Your Best Friend Back1," Your friend may miss you as much as you miss them, but one of you has to be the first to share those feelings. Talk to your friend about how much you miss them, and assure them that they are a core part of your life.Say, “You’re like a sister to me, so not having you around is like losing part of my family.”
If your friend has been spending a lot of time with a new friend or partner, let them know that you want some of their time, too. Explain that you understand that the new person is important to them and stress that you aren’t trying to drive them apart. Say, “I’m glad you found someone who makes you happy. I just miss hanging out with you.”
Be honest with your friend, even if you feel embarrassed. You could say, “It’s been really hard for me lately because you’re my best friend. I’m used to being able to talk to you everyday, but lately I’ve felt like you were too busy for me.”;
, Don't be too clingy. There are several reasons why your friend may be pulling away from you, so don’t think that a few unanswered texts or missed hangouts mean that you’ve lost your best friend. It’s possible that your friend has been going through something stressful or time-demanding, leaving little social time available.Realize that your friend may have other things going on in their life that have nothing to do with you or any of their other friends.
If your friend has been spending a lot of time with someone else, consider that the other person may fit into your friend’s life in a way that you don’t. For example, your friend and the new person may both be from divorced households, may share a similar cultural background, or may have both had to take care of an ill family member.

, If you’ve done something wrong, apologizing is the first step to healing your friendship. Simply saying “I’m sorry” usually isn’t enough. You need to be detailed and specific. Even if you don’t think the fight was your fault, you might have to take the high road and be the first to apologize.Show them that you know what you did and why it was wrong.
Say, “I’m sorry for forgetting your birthday. I know that must have really hurt you because I would have been heartbroken if you’d forgotten mine.”

, Don’t speak for both of you or project your feelings onto your friend. You may have differing perspectives on what happened and what your intentions were, and that’s okay. What’s important is that you are each able to share your own feelings on the situation and come to a point of understanding.Avoid statements like “You never listen to me!” Instead, say, “I felt like you weren't hearing me, and that made me feel frustrated.”

, As you apologize, resist the urge to explain away your behavior. Don’t make excuses, no matter how justified you felt in doing what you did or what was happening in your life. Nothing excuses hurting your friend, just as they have no excuse for hurting you.For example, avoid saying, “I’m sorry I forgot about your birthday party. I had a busy week and lost track of the days.” While this may be true, it weakens your apology because it shows that you feel like your behavior had some justification.
Say, “I know that what I did was wrong.”

, Regardless of who started the fight or what was said, focus on moving forward. Think about how much you want your best friend in your life, and remind yourself that pointing out who did what will only hurt the situation.Avoid statements like “I’m sorry you feel that way” because they put the blame on the other person. You are telling the person that your behavior was okay, and they just overreacted.
If you feel like they are unfairly blaming you, say, “I’m hearing that you think this is all my fault. Is that true?” If they reply yes, then you will be able to talk it out.

, Talking to your friend will start the healing process, but may not be enough to fully restore your relationship. Offer ideas for things you can do together, including a next step. Healing your friendship will require work, and your apology will hold more weight if you show your friend that you have a plan.Ask them to go see a popular movie together. You can spend time together without expectations of talking, and then you have a shared topic to discuss afterward that will put less pressure on you to find neutral topics.

Limit contact.,
Don't be clingy.,
Try new activities.,
Meet new people.,
Know when to let go.",How to Get Your Best Friend Back2," If your friend tells you that they need time alone, listen to them. They may need time to cool down, think things over, and recover. Constantly calling, texting, emailing, and pestering them will not help. In fact, you will likely make the situation worse.


Keep your interactions civil. If you see them at school or work, acknowledge them with a smile, wave, or nod.
Don’t confuse this with giving your friend the cold shoulder. Be open and available to them.
Don’t try to get information about them from mutual friends, and don’t ask mutual friends to pick sides.

, Allow your friend to make their own decisions about where they go and who they hang out with. When you feel like you might lose your best friend, it’s tempting to smother them with attention, but this often backfires. If you act like your friend isn’t allowed to have other people in their life, they’ll push even harder to get away from you and your efforts to control them.


If your friend is busier than normal, find an activity that keeps you just as busy so that you’re less tempted to cling.
If you are jealous of your friend’s new relationship, remember that you will eventually find a partner or new friends, as well.

, Rather than sitting around thinking about how much you miss your best friend, distract yourself by having fun doing something you’ve always wanted to try. If you’re stumped for ideas, check a local events calendar for upcoming options, or visit a local hobby shop., While you don’t want to rush out and try to replace your best friend, start the process of making new friends. Don’t rush friendship or hanging out one-on-one, but open yourself up to getting to know other people.Join a club.
Hang out with other friends.
Host a party.

, Sometimes when someone asks for space, they end up wanting things to stay that way. As hard as it is to give up on a best friend, it may be necessary for you to move on. Think of this as a learning experience that will help you form better friendships in the future. Reflect on what made this friendship end, and use that lesson to choose your friends in the future.Allow yourself to cry. It’s important that you grieve the loss of your relationship as you would a death so that you can work through it. Crying is normal and important, so don’t feel bad about needing to let it out.Even though you might not get closure from your friend, say your own goodbye by writing them a goodbye letter that you never send or holding your own goodbye ritual."

Ignore gossip.,
Forgive and forget.,
Invite them to a group event.,
Understand that new relationships are inevitable.,
Find new ways to spend time together.,
Engage in a favorite activity.",How to Get Your Best Friend Back3," Gossip will only hurt your friendship. If someone tries to talk badly about your friend, ask them to stop. Refuse to listen if people say that your friend is trashing you. Even if it’s true, it’s not going to help you patch things up.


Say, “I’m not interested in hearing that.”

, Start with a clean slate. Once your issues have been resolved, don’t keep punishing your friend, acting cold, or bringing up mistakes they made as ammo in other fights. Let go and move on.


Focus on the future.
If you find yourself in a similar issue as before, give your friend the benefit of the doubt instead of jumping to conclusions.

, When you’re first rebuilding a friendship, it can feel awkward. Spending time with a group will allow you guys to spend time together with a buffer while emotions are still raw.Ask your entire friend group to go out to dinner.
Find community or school events, and pick one that connects to a shared interest.

, If your friend has met someone new, don’t see it as the end of your friendship. One of you will be the first to find a partner or a new good friend. If your friend does before you do, it can be hard to accept your new dynamic, but know that it happens to everyone.Don’t see it as a rejection. Your friend is not trying to replace you. They just found someone else they click with.
Your relationship may change, but it’s not over.
Reach out to the new person. Keep an open mind and try to get to know the other person. If it’s a new boyfriend or girlfriend, be excited for your friend’s happiness and let them feel like they can confide in you.

, If your friend has a new situation in their life that keeps them from you, such as a sick relative, a new baby, or additional work/school responsibilities, find ways that you can easily fit into their day. Since your friend’s life is changing, your time together may need to change, too. Show them that you still fit into their life.Visit your friend during your lunch hour.
Join your friend in an activity you know they attend regularly, such as a class at the gym.
If your friend is in a new relationship, remind your friend that you need one-on-one time. Say, “Your new boyfriend is great, but can we grab lunch just the two of us this weekend?”

, Spend time rekindling your friendship doing something you guys both love, preferably something unique to your friendship. This will remind you of good times you’ve had together and help both of you move past the issues that had come between you. For example, if you both love singing, go out for karaoke."
"
Be the bigger person.,
Treat your enemy nicely.,
Pretend your enemy is a family member.,
Stop speaking negatively about your enemy.,
Ask for a favor.,
Look for things you have in common.,
Compliment your enemy.,
Use their name and practice active listening.,
Invite them to hang out.,
Get personal.,
Maintain the relationship.,
Be there for your friend.,
Be yourself.",How to Get a Person You Hate to Be Your Best Friend," If you hate someone, chances are there’s a reason why. Maybe you got in a fight or something hurtful was done to you. If you want to make your enemy your friend, you have to let that go and decide in your head to move on.Try to see your past interactions from your enemy’s point of view. Was there maybe something you did that might have hurt them too?
If you don’t know why you dislike this person, take some time to think it over. Maybe you don’t like them because they remind you of someone else you don’t like.;
, The nicer you treat a person, the more likely you are to think of them in a positive light. Take a week and do everything you can think of to treat your enemy better. At the end of the week, you may be surprised to find that your feelings for them are now completely different.Make an effort to say “Hi” to your enemy every time you see them.
Hold a door open for them or smile at them in the hallway.

, Everyone has family members who they don’t get along with. But family is blood, so you have to learn to put up with them. By pretending your enemy is part of your family, you force yourself to find ways to put up with them and even relate to them.Look for similarities between the person you hate and people you love.
For example, if your dad loves soccer and the person you hate also loves soccer, use that similarity to help trick your brain into liking them.

, Talking about someone behind their back may be a guilty pleasure, but it’s also a way of tricking your brain into believing the things you say are true.Whenever you have the urge to say something negative about this person, instead find something nice to say.
Make a list of all the things you like about the person (even if it’s a short list) and concentrate on the positive attributes instead.

, If this person is truly your enemy, then asking for help is probably not high on your priorities list. However, if you ask for a favor and they agree to help you out, you open up a door for further communication.The favor doesn’t have to be big; it can be something small, like asking for help with an assignment.
There is a chance the person will decline. If they do, try a different tactic later.
Make sure to say please and thank you – you’re trying to rebuild a relationship and manners help.

, As humans, there are so many things in this world that we love – books, movies, foods, experiences, etc. It’s almost impossible that you and the person you hate would have nothing in common, so look for opportunities where you can use this to break the ice.Surreptitiously observe your enemy and make a list of all the things they like and dislike.
Look for opportunities where you can bond over these commonalities.
For example, if you see them reading a book you love, say something like “I love that book. What part are you at?” and allow the conversation to go from there.

, Everyone likes to hear nice things about themselves, and your enemy is no exception. Make an effort to say something nice to them whenever you can; they may even throw a compliment back your way.Give your enemy honest compliments - don’t lie and say you like something if you really don’t.
Compliment your enemy on their outfit or hair or an idea they had in class or at work.
Don’t overdo it – they may worry that you’re making fun of them or being disingenuous.

, The way you talk to your enemy can have a big influence on how they respond to you. Use their name frequently and try to repeat back what they’re saying when you have conversations with each other.Be careful not to repeat back what they say exactly; always rephrase it and put it in your own words to show that you were listening.
If they say something like, “Let’s go over the assignment after class” you might repeat that back as “Okay, I’ll see you at the end of the day to go over the work.”

, Once you have managed to trick yourself into liking your enemy and had a few positive interactions with your enemy, it’s time to up the ante. Have a party or gathering and invite the person you hate to come along.


Make sure that the first time you hang out isn’t one on one.
Spending time with them in a group setting is a lower pressure way of getting to know them as a friend.

, As you and your enemy become friends, make an effort to expose something private about yourself. Confiding in your ex-enemy will help build your bond and strengthen your friendship.Tell your ex-enemy an embarrassing story about yourself or admit to a guilty pleasure.
Encourage them to do the same – the more you can open up to each other, the closer you will feel.

, Friendships, like any relationship, need love and care in order to flourish. Make an effort to keep in contact with your new friend; invite them over to hang out or invite them to go out on a friend date with you.Alternate who is inviting who over and who is planning what activity so it doesn’t feel like one of you is controlling the relationship.
Be friends online and by phone – add your new friend on social media and look for opportunities to text them things you think they’d enjoy.

, Friendship is a two-way street and the more you can give to a friendship, the more you’ll end up getting. If your new friend is having a bad day or needs a shoulder to cry on, make yourself available.Be there for your new friend and chances are they’ll be there for you.
Treat this new friend the way you would treat all of your other friends – stick up for them and be loyal and kind.

, If you really want to take your friendship status from “friend” to “best friend” the trick is to be yourself. You just put in all this work to turn an enemy into a friend – imagine how betrayed they will feel if they find out you aren’t being honest about who you are.Make an effort to keep spending time with your new friend. The more time you spend with them, the more comfortable you’ll feel around them.
Let them see the sides of you that no one else sees. Be goofy, be honest and encourage them to do the same.
Don’t worry if you never make it to “best friends” status. You have one less enemy and one more friend, so you’re doing okay.

Research why sharks are in danger.,
Buy fish that are caught without risk to sharks.,
Don't buy shark products.",How to Help Protect Sharks1," In order to change your buying practices to protect sharks, you need to have a little bit of information. Understanding what the risks are to sharks can help you to understand how your purchases can promote their death. Causes for the loss of sharks include:Overfishing – commercial fishing practices cause about 50 percent of all shark deaths, as by-catch.
Products – shark fins, jaws, liver, cartilage, skins and teeth all have a vibrant market in some parts of the world.
Fear – ignorance and fear causes the loss of many sharks in waters all around the world.;
, Don't buy fish from companies that don't protect sharks. Many sharks are killed when they are accidentally caught up in fishing nets. The fisheries are not intentionally catching sharks but they are also not putting in protections that could save the lives of sharks.Buying fish from companies that protect sharks is important. This shows companies that shark protections are important to consumers.
To find those companies that do protect sharks, do some research online. You can usually find lists of companies that actively protect sharks on shark protection groups' websites.There are also a wide variety of fish that you can eat that are caught nowhere near sharks. These types of fish, such as lake or stream caught fish, are a good alternative to ocean caught fish if you are concerned with protecting sharks.

, Be aware of the types of shark products that are out there and refuse to consume them. Sharks are used for shark fins, jaws, liver, cartilage, skins and teeth. The purpose of these products varies, from purported medicinal uses to souvenirs. Help others become aware of the problems and encourage them to stop buying such products as well.Outside of Asia not many products, such as shark oil or shark skin wallets, are made. However, some restaurants still serve shark on their menus. Don't go to restaurants that serve shark on the menu and encourage your family and friends to do the same.
To take it a step further, write or call the owners of a restaurant that serves shark and let them know why you're not going to their restaurant. Also ask them to stop using shark products. There are valid replacements for shark in food dishes.

Talk to your friend and find out what the problem is.,
Introduce them to each other, and tell them that its really important to you that they both get on.,
Try talking to them separately.,
Tackle any specific or particular issues right away.,
Consider what your friend has to say.,
Consider your options if there's no other way.,
If your boyfriend is being hated for no reason, don't befriend your best friend anymore, if he or she is your best friend then he or she will not put you in this situation.

Be nice.,
If your best friend completely understands that you love your boyfriend and when they are mean to your boyfriend they hurt you too, it is time to get a new best friend.",How to Get Your Best Friend to Stop Hating Your Boyfriend," Make sure you know why she hates your boyfriend, so that you know what you are dealing with. Don't ignore your best friend's comments. If she/he is your best friend then you obviously value their opinion and it is important to listen carefully to what they say. Have a good think before you do anything else. Has your boyfriend done something wrong or does your friend just not know your boyfriend well enough?;
, Ask them to talk out their differences

, Ask each of them if they would consider making up or at least not hating each other.

, For example, if your friend doesn't like him for something he did in the past, make sure they talk about it.

, If she has a valid and good reason for hating him, then there might be no way to solve this.

, You could either cope with them hating each other, or let one of them go. If this person is your best friend, it would be a good option to leave your boyfriend if you feel that your friend has a reason to hate him. Only do this if you feel that he is not the kind of person you want to be with, though.

,, Just simply ask your best friend if they can try to be nice to your boyfriend. Make sure that your best friend understands that you love your boyfriend and that by being mean to him, it affects you too.

, This may be hard to lose your best friend but if they can't stop being mean if they know it hurts you, they obviously don't care enough about you.

Find out what shark protection measures are already in place in your country.,
Join an organization that cares about the future of sharks.,
Hold an information awareness event at your school, university, college, or community center.",How to Help Protect Sharks2," Are they adequate measures or not? Are there some species still not protected? Does your country ban the importation of shark fins or other products? What are the assumptions about sharks held by the politicians and bureaucrats in your country? Once you find out, you can then write letters of concern along with suggestions for how your country could be better protecting sharks.For example, The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora has pushed to protect a variety of species of sharks that are targeted for their fins. These include all hammerhead sharks, the oceanic whitetip shark, and the porbeagle shark.These protections have led to more clampdowns on illegal shark fin shipping and trade.One person you can write to is the Secretary-General of the United Nations. Request that international action be taken to ban shark finning and the trade in shark fins.

, There are numerous organizations that are raising awareness and actively putting programs into place to help keep sharks thriving in ocean waters. For example, one such organization, The Sea Shepherd, has turned its attention to sharks, as well as dolphins, in light of the dire threat facing sharks. Sea Shepherds is confiscating illegally taken fins, pulling in long-lines and freeing caught sharks and defending against poachers, among other actions.Other organizations that are raising awareness and acting on shark protection include Protect the Sharks Foundation, The Humane Society, Oceana.org, Wildaid.org, The Dorsal Fin, Saving Sharks.com, and more.
Many local environmental groups you might be a part of could have an interest in sharks too. If not, your query might spark their interest!
You can become involved in these groups in a variety of ways. You could simply give them money so that they can continue their work. You could also become an active member, working on projects with the organization that actively help to eliminate the killing of sharks. Whatever level of involvement you are comfortable with you should do.

, Help spread the news about the fate of sharks to other people. Provide information in the form of pamphlets, speakers, movies, and other means for getting the information across.


You could turn it into a fundraising event as well. Pick a shark organization you believe in and send the money to that organization once the fundraiser is over.

Research the likelihood of being killed by a shark.,
Learn about the shark species that are in danger.,
Explore the ways in which sharks ensure a healthy ocean ecology.",How to Help Protect Sharks3," In North America, you are 30 times more likely to be killed by lightning than by a shark and more people are killed by falling vending machines than by sharks.Shark stories are sensational, big news items that make for dramatic reading. Unfortunately, this tends to make people fear sharks instead of seeking to understand them better.Sharks account for approximately a dozen human deaths a year. Compare that to car accident deaths, not to mention the number of sharks that are killed each year, and you'll begin to see the bigger picture., There are over 110 species of sharks that are now listed as under threat on the World Conservation Union's Red List, while another 95 species are near threatened.Do some research and learn about some of these sharks and why they are threatened.


Because there are a variety of reasons that sharks are at risk, it can be enlightening to research individual species and understand the obstacles they face for survival.

, These predators ensure health in the ocean by keeping other ocean populations under control and by removing diseased and genetically defective individuals from other species. As an apex predator (like wolves and lions), their loss would weaken the ocean ecology and cause an imbalance of many other species.An apex predator is an animal that is at the top of its food chain, and thus is not preyed on my any other animal."

Research the animals active in the region during this season.",How to Identify Animal Tracks," The animal kingdom is enormous, and one resource isn't enough for even scratching the surface of the different varieties of tracks left by the members of it. Generally speaking, people are interested in identifying the prints of mammals, but you can learn to quickly distinguish between prints left by mammals, reptiles, and birds, to make a quick generalization. In the next section, you can learn to more accurately identify mammals based on their prints.


Mammals will often leave more topographical prints, meaning that the prints sink to various depths in the surface of the earth. You'll notice claws, individual toes, and foot pads in the prints of mammals.
Reptile tracks will generally be found around water, meaning they're usually quite smudged and obscured. Most reptiles leave five-toed prints and usually evenly pressed into the earth.
Birds generally leave three-toed prints, which are usually quite straight and bony, but may also be webbed in some species, like ducks. It's usually difficult to identify birds based on their tracks.;
, If you're out and you find a mess of prints in the mud or the snow, make sure you find the cleanest and the most easy to examine prints to work with, or you might make a mistake. The smallest details can be the difference between identifying a print correctly or not.


Identify front prints and back prints as best you can, based on the orientation of the feet and the weight distribution shown in the depth of the prints. Most ""rear"" prints should be somewhat larger and wider than the front prints of four-legged animals.

, If you're going out tracking, carry a tape measure with you so you can make accurate measurements for later, if necessary. You can get pretty close with estimating, but it's always best to have the most accurate measurement possible if you want to get the correct species.

, The first thing you'll likely notice is the size of the print and the number of toes, which can tell you something about the size of the animal itself, but the depth of the print can also tell you a lot about the direction of travel, the speed of travel, and the size of the animal you're dealing with.

, For the most accurate identification possible, it's best to take a picture or a cast of the print for later, for comparison purposes. Use your own powers of observation, but also carry a cellphone camera around with your for the best results.

, Once you catalog the various features of a particular print, a field guide will help you make the most specific identification based upon the criteria discovered in the observation steps. These books are generally limited by region, meaning you won't have to sift through the tracks of animals that couldn't possibly be there. You should also include specific illustrations and track information to help narrow down your findings.

, The first step in mammal print identification is to count the number of toes in the prints. This is the quickest way to get yourself in the ballpark and in many cases is enough to identify the likeliest candidate.Hooved animals will have two near-symmetrical imprints, sometimes rounded and sometimes tapered. Deer, horses, goats, and caribou all leave hoofed prints.

Animals with four toes will often have another small pad behind the toes, and may also display claws. These are the tracks of canines, felines, and some species of rodents.

Animals with five toes should always leave claw prints as well and come in a variety of sizes. Raccoons, weasels, bears, marmots, and beavers should leave five-toed prints.

Animals with a different number of toes may seem tricky, but are actually relatively simple. All rodents have five toes on the front paws and four toes on the back. Gophers, woodchucks, squirrel, prairie dogs, and other rodents will leave two different tracks, like these.

, Once you know the number of toes, the size of the print can tell you a lot about the likely animal. For the best results, you can use a tape measure, or you can estimate in a pinch. For our purposes, ""large"" may refer to any prints roughly bigger than 2 x 2 inches, and ""small"" will refer to anything smaller.



Hooved animals all leave fairly large prints, so the shape of the print can tell you more about the likely animal who left it. Skip to the next step.

Animals with four toes who leave smaller prints include house cats, small toy dogs, rabbits, and weasels. Larger four-toed prints include all variety of canine and larger predatory felines. The presence of claws and the shape of the print can help you determine the animal more closely.Animals with five toes that leave small prints are almost always shrews or weasels. Medium-sized (2-4 in.) prints may be opossum, raccoon, otter, wolverine, beaver, marmot, or various other large rodents. Five-toed prints larger than 5 or 6 in. likely belong to a bear.

Animals with a different number of toes on front and back paws that leave large prints are usually porcupines, armadillos, or woodchucks. Smaller prints usually belong to squirrels, rats, gophers, chipmunk, and some mice. Very small prints (less than 3/4 in.) are almost always mice, pika, or vole., For some varieties of print, the shape of it can tell you a lot about distinguishing one species from another, even if the prints look very similar. Based on the size and number of toes, you should already be somewhat close to narrowing down the options, based on your region, but the shape can hammer it home.


Hooved prints will either be rounded or narrow and tapered in the front. Rounded prints generally belong to horses, but may also belong to muskox, caribou, or bison, if you're in the right area. Tapered prints most often belong to deer, sheep, moose, elk, or pigs.







Four-toed prints that are quite small and rounded usually belong to pika. If there are no foot pads, four-toed prints are always rabbits. If the back foot is longer than the front foot, the tracks are a variety of weasel.

Five-toed prints vary widely in shape. Bears all leave a very large foot pad behind the toes, while raccoon will leave a very flat print with no pad at all, like a rabbit. Shrews have very small prints, in which the toes are spread far out and quite bony. Weasel, skunk, otter, and badger have rounded foot pads and tapered toes, while beaver, marmot, and nutria have very straight toes.

Variable-toed prints with no foot pads are gopher or mice. Other varieties may be more easily determined from the size of the print and the likely candidates based on the region.

, Almost all mammal prints have claws, except feline. If the prints are four-toed, small, and you can't find any claws in the print, it's likely just a house cat. If it's larger and there are no claws, it might be a big cat or some variety of predatory feline, like a bobcat, jaguar, or even a lion, depending on the area you're exploring.


Cats always retract their claws while walking, so even though cats do have claws, you'll never see them in prints.

, It's easier to narrow it down if you have some sense of the likely candidates, based on the region you're exploring. You don't need to dig through the archives of large jungle cats for possibilities if you're in rural Illinois. Get a field guide of animal tracks in your area for the most accurate information available.

True friends offer supportive comments and encouragement.,
True friends listen to you.,
True friends communicate openly with each other.,

True friends are true to their word.,
True friends don't have other motives for becoming your pal.,
True friends make you feel good about yourself.,
True friends make you feel valuable.,
True friends make you happy.,
Follow your instincts to find true friends.",How to Decide if Your Friend is a True Friend," Real friends make you feel needed, confident, and happy. Everyone needs a little positive energy here and there, and true friends have it in spades. Even when they disagree with you (""that hat looks like it came from a dead opossum"") they still support you the best they can (""but, at least, you're rocking it!"").


If your friend gives you genuine compliments, on everything from your new outfit to your work ethic, it's a good sign.
Encouragement, even over dumb little things, is a good sign for both of you.
See if your friend is your cheerleader. Though your friend doesn't have to always cheer you on, if your friend is a good friend, then they should be your fan and should always root for you to succeed.
If your friend always dismisses or one-ups your successes (""You got an 85 on the test? That's cool, I got an 89""), puts you down, and/or doesn't believe you can succeed, then they aren't a true friend -- kick their unpleasant attitudes up the curb.;
, Sometimes all you need is for someone to shut up and listen. True friends know how to close their mouths and open their ears, as long as you can do the same from time to time. They make eye contact when talking, remember what you've told them, and ask thoughtful questions. Notice who does most of the talking. In an ideal friendship, both friends should roughly share the same amount. If you feel like you are always the one listening to your friend's problems, then you're not getting your fair share of the friendship.


If your friend is looking around the room and checking their phone every time you talk, or has no recollection of that time you said you were applying to law school, they're probably fake friends not worth your time.

, With true friends, you happily share embarrassing stories and secrets, and they share them back. They'll pick up on your moods without cues. ""Dude-- you seem off today,"" for example, may be a guy's best attempt at emotional empathy, but it is still a meaningful sign of friendship. He cares, dude. When things get rough, true friends don't beat around the bush, they have mature, honest conversations that get to the point.


If you know how to have a mature talk when you're unhappy, then you have strong communication. If you and your friend are comfortable saying something like, ""Hey, I was really hurt that you didn't come to my party the other night"" to each other, then you've found a friend worth keeping.
If you feel the need to hide things from him or her, can't trust them with secrets or big news, or feel like they don't open up to you about their lives, you're facing yet another not-so-true friend.

, If your so-called friend is a big gossip, then it's likely that your friend is gossiping about you when you're not around. Everyone loves some juicy gossip from time to time. But if you feel like your friend is always gossiping about someone or talking trash, chances are your ""friend"" will do the same as soon as your back is turned. Here are some ways to know if your friend's gossiping is out of control:


If your friend talks trash about someone as soon as they leave the room, then the friend is a terrible person.
If your friend routinely talks about people they claim to be their closest friends, then they're doing the same about you to their other ""true"" friends.
If your friend is always saying negative things about people who aren't around, then your friend is definitely not a true friend.

, Life can be nuts, and it's hard enough to find time to sleep, work, and eat, let alone socialize. But a true friend will always make time for you. If they can't find the time to hang out or talk on the phone, then why are they even your friend?


If your friend is good about scheduling phone, lunch, or dinner dates, and always follows through, then you have a good friend. Congrats! Make sure you do the same and make time for them, of course.
If your friend never makes time for you, always complains about how life has been ""crazy busy,"" and expects you to work around their schedule, then you have a problem. Especially if they spend their time with significant others or different friends. Everyone is busy; not everyone flakes out.

, In an ideal friendship, both people put the same amount of effort into the relationship, whether it's communication, making time to chill, or buying the next round of drinks. It's a give and take, so don't do all the giving if your friend is a taker. Usually, you can feel this happening -- movie night is always at your house, you always call first, they keep borrowing your Simpsons DVDs without asking, etc. And if you feel it happening, cut them off! True friends give back to you without having to think about it.


You should both be willing to show affection. Not everyone is a hugger, but everyone has a way of demonstrating that they care for you.
Keeping things equal doesn't mean you spend the same amount of cash on people -- relationships aren't bought and sold. It's just about feeling respected and cared for by a friend, however they show it.
Don't let your friend always come to you for favors and support, but get busy the minute you need a hand. You should both be reaching out from time to time, not only to ask for help but to offer it.

, A flake is not a friend. If your friend never seems to do what they say they'll do, leaves you stranded, or forgets about plans you've made, then you have a flake on your hands, and you don't have a true friend. We've all bailed on a plan or made a last-second switch, but if your friend never seems to do what they say they'll do, then they don't value your time or company. With a good friend: ""word is bond.""


If your friend bails on you more often than not, is wishy-washy about making plans, or skips out on a big or important date, they are a flake. Get some Head and Shoulders and wipe them off your calendar.

, This soul-searching is particularly hard to do, but it's important. Take the time to reflect on why your friend might want to hang out with you. More likely than not, you're just good friends, and the rest of the ""benefits"" just happen naturally. There are some classic reasons why a fake friend might find you, but usually, you'll see a few of the other warnings signs if they aren't true friends. Still, be on the lookout for those hoping to latch on to your:



Popularity. If Mean Girls taught the world anything, it's that true friends stick around no matter how popular you are. Popularity is a fickle beast, but it doesn't bother your true friends.

Wealth. Make no mistake-- having rich friends is fun. You get to do all the things you could never afford! But if your friends only love you for your wealth, they'll be gone before the last penny drops.

Convenience. Are you giving them a ride to the office or a chance to look over your homework? Are they giving anything back?

Boredom. It is summer vacation, and your next door neighbor is suddenly chummy. School starts and you never see him again. These so-called ""friends"" ditch you as soon as they find a new group of friends or a new boy/girlfriend rolls into town.

, Your friend doesn't have to agree with everything you've done, but your friendship should make you feel good about who you are as a person. They make the time fly and the world feel conquerable. If you leave a hang-out session with your friend feeling invigorated, excited, or just giggling from the silly time you shared, then you're both killing this whole friendship thing.


If, every time you say goodbye to your friend, you feel like you made a mistake, upset your friend, or you're a worse person, then you have a problem. If your friend is putting you down to make themselves feel better, then you have a problem. If your friend makes you feel bad through snide comments about your looks, weight, grades, etc, then -- well, you get the picture.

, If being involved with your ""friend"" makes you feel uncertain about your importance in your friend's life, then they shouldn't be important in your life. While a friend shouldn't coddle you with lies, a true friend always makes you feel needed, important, and indispensable. They ask your advice and listen to it, and don't leave your side as soon as the ""cool"" friend walks in the room. No one has time for dumb games like that -- find someone who does value your friendship.


Fake or casual friends might make your feel great in private, but won't even know you exist at parties or in public. They dismiss your advice or thoughts and leave you out of group plans.

, It seems so simple and obvious, doesn't it? That's what makes it so important to remember. Plain and simple, true friends are those you're happy to be around. If you're less happy hanging out with your friend than you are when you're alone, then you might as well go alone -- this person is a happiness suck.


Every person has rough patches. But if you feel like your friend is always going through a crisis and you can't enjoy yourself because you're too busy picking up the pieces, then you have a problem. You're a friend, not a box of tissues.
If you don't look forward to hanging out with your friend, keep them away from your other friends or family, or feel burdened to be with them, then they're not really true friends. This time, however, it is up to you to politely excuse yourself.

, If something doesn't feel right, it isn't. Don't follow horror-movie logic, ignoring your bad feelings to get burned later on. If you're unhappy with them, don't feel supported and loved, or can't trust a friend, then don't be their friend. True friends aren't easy to come by, but that doesn't mean you need to settle for someone who treats you like crap. Step back a minute and ask yourself if you really think they are a true friend, or if you just want them to be a good friend.


If you're even questioning whether your friend is a true friend or not, then there's a good chance there's a major problem in your relationship. No friendship is perfect, and bumps are bound to happen. But those bumps shouldn't make up the whole road of your relationship.

Figure out exactly what it is you find annoying about these two people hanging out together then work on fixing that problem.,
They are talking about their weekend to you politely, as a gesture of friendship, tell them about your weekend.,
Start to block the friend stealer out of conversations.,
Just keep blocking the friend stealer out of conversations, and start to try to be the best friend you possibly can be towards your best friend.

,
If this still happens for a while, try being friends' with the person who steals your friend, you'd be surprised what good could happen, you three could be best friends, but most of the time one of them gets left out so that could be a problem!

,
Make sure that you are there for your friend more than the thief is.

,
Tell your friend how you feel about the thief.,
Invite her over.,
Get some other friends.,
Ask your best friend help on ways that she can stop being so best friends with the other girl.

,
To tell you the truth you can't really trust your BFF until this is over because you can't trust someone that puts stress on you or mad you upset.",How to Deal With a Best Friend Stealer,";
, Try to make it funny; the best way to take back a friend is to be funny around them.

, Just stand in front of them before they start speaking.

,,,, She might get angry but keep reminding her over and over and keep telling her that the thief is bothering you.

, The thief will get angry about all the jokes that she got left out on and get left out. Your best friend will be attached to you for about two weeks and then things might get a little rough.

, Have back up friends in case. If she ever stops being your friend you will have a back-up friend that you will immediately go to and might make your best friend jealous.

,, But also TRY to still be friends with her. If you take the time to compliment her on a lot of stuff and be nice as much as possible to her. Don't make her angry. You might regret it later... But anyway compliment her and take time to spend as much time as possible with her.

, Don't make it obvious that you're trying to please the person, they don't want to be stalked. Just say ""Hello!"" to them at lunch or in the locker room, etc. Strike up a conversation about something you're both interested in, like sports, video games, dance, a certain T.V show, etc.

, You never know who might become friends with you! You have a better chance of finding a best friend or soulmate if you keep your eyes, and your options, open. Go up to a friendly looking person in the halls or in one of your classes and introduce yourself. You may just find the perfect person!

, You don't want them yawning at the sight of you. If you're going to have them over, then make sure you've planned something fun to do. For example, going to the cinema, having a swim or doing an art class. Remember that if you don't share tastes, you might not be as close of friends as you hope!

, You don't want your so-called 'BFF' (Best Friend Forever) resenting you and feeling pressured to be your friend. Notice the way they act around you. If they are mean to you they're probably not interested and you should cut ties with this person.

, If you're unapproachable you'll lose potential friends. Sometimes it's who comes up to you, not who you go up to. Have a nice, big, welcoming smile on your face when someone approaches you. Nobody wants to talk to a grumpy pants.

, Once you can trust them and feel comfortable with them, tell them that you have been looking for a BFF. Hopefully they'll accept or welcome your offer of being best friends. Once you're at this level of friendship, it should come more easily. Tell them about what's going on in your life, funny stories that happened to you, and/or your deepest, darkest secrets.

, If you're mean in any way, she/he may not want to be your friend. Help and support your friends when they need you the most.

, It's easy to make friends by pretending you like things they do, but at the end of the day you want a friend who appreciates you for who you are and shares your interests.

, Start a conversation by asking about them. Kids will often be excited to tell you about their talents/hobbies.

, Just because they are littler than you doesn't mean they are stupid. Young kids are smarter than we may give them credit for. A baby can learn any language on earth; although some adults might even speak 50 languages, they can't learn them all. And little kids, specifically kindergarteners, are learning how to do math and read for the first time. If you look at it with some perspective, kindergarten is actually the hardest grade; you don't have any jumping-off place. So when you are around little kids, appreciate their brain-power., Show them that you love them and enjoy spending time with them. Many times kids are starved for attention and love, so sharing a little around will go a long way.

, However, don't invite them to your house unless you are very good friends with the parents; most people will find this questionable.

, Ask them questions about anything, such as: favorite color, what they had for dinner last night, what they want to do when they grow up, where their favorite trees are, etc. Listen to their answers and really pay attention. Show them you value their opinion. Look them in the eye. Sometimes, you get some funny answers, so keep your ears peeled.

, Kids love it when you are over-the-top. Act larger than life around them! You'll have time to be dreary and tired when you get home or they leave.

Don't be falsely excited, though. If you really, really aren't having a good time, then ask if you can do something else. The child will not like it if you are either boring, or too bored.

, This will get them to trust and let you into their heads. However, don't go by age, gender, etc. to try to determine what they will find funny. Everyone has a different sense of humor- get to know them a little first and you should be able to determine what will make them laugh.

, Find something you are both into. For example, if you both like magic, teach them a trick. If you both like ball games, get out and play some. If you both like cookies, bake some together.

, Little kids respect you when you teach them how to do something. They love it when you take time to play with or teach them something, whether it's a sport, art, computers, cooking, and so forth. Consider the skills you have and ask the kids what they'd like to learn from you.

, When they ask you do something, give it a go, even if you'd never be seen dead doing it around your mates. Show the kids you're cool enough to blow bubbles with them, just because they asked you to.

, While you do sidewalk chalk with the kids, tell them how awesome theirs look. They'll be stoked that you're interested.

, Make up completely new games, or change the rules of existing games. However, if you aren't creative enough to come up with games to play, search for new ones online.

, Once you find a game, stick to it as long as the child does.

Sometimes, little kids will play one game for hours. If this happens, stick it out. Don't start to act tired, even if you feel tired. Instead, ask if they want to switch games.
However, if you are just getting into a game and the child wants to quit, agree with them. You are there to amuse the child, and if you want them to like you, you'll do so.
Be flexible. If the child wants to quit one minute, than wants to play the game again the next minute, just smile and nod.

Call your friend on the phone once in a while to check up on them. If they don't feel like talking about why they're upset don't force them to and give them some space.;
, Plan out what dates when both you and your friend are available to hang out. Figure out what activities both of you like to do so you'll both enjoy yourselves. You could go to see a movie, go to the park, invite them to your house, have a sleepover, go to the mall together etc.

, Invite your friend over for a sleepover and some other friends they don't know so the next time your friend is with them they won't feel uncomfortable.

, Before going to bed try your best to say a quick prayer asking God to help your friend if they're going through a tough time in their lives (family death, parents divorced etc) or thank God for blessing you with great friends.

, You don't always have to be so serious! Friends love having a great time with each other!

, Act the way you always act you don't want people to get attached to the fake you. If they don't like your attitude then it was never meant to be.

, That makes her feel good about herself, not to mention happy with you. Did your friend get a cool new haircut or a nice pair of shoes? If so you can say "" I like your ___ it looks good on you.

, If you just say, ""Ya, I know,"" then your friend might get hurt or angry with you.

, Try not to play with other people while ignoring your other friends. That might cause to break your friendship. If your upset with your friend instead of ignoring take the mature route by talking about it with each other.

, Ask them what's wrong and try your best to resolve the problem. Try cracking a joke when your friend is upset to make their day a little bit better.

, Spreading secrets and false rumours isn't very kind you wouldn't want others to talk rudely behind your back so don't do it.

, Help him/her out if they got hurt and don't say nasty thing to their face. Try to include them as much as possible or else they may feel left out and that you don't like them.

, Try not to upset them even more when they aren't feeling well.

, Call or video chat with him/her so they don't feel like you forgot about them.

Join a gym or community fitness center.,
Lend a helping hand.,
Call your relatives.,
Take up a hobby.",How to Avoid Loneliness When You Don't Have Friends1," Use your body's need for physical activity to interact with others. Sign up at your local gym for a challenging group class. At first, you will feel unnerved by participating in a class full of strangers (and potentially making a fool of yourself). Persist and you will find that group exercise can provide motivation, accountability, and camaraderie.Invite the person next to you out for coffee or a smoothie after. Or, after several sessions, suggest a carpool to better get to know some of the people in the class.;
, No matter who you are, there is something valuable you can offer to others. If you play a musical instrument, offer up your services to teach others. Help your pregnant neighbor cart her groceries inside. Offer to walk an elderly person's dog. For more structured helping opportunities, become a volunteer.Offering help to others can make you feel more confident, thereby increasing the likelihood that you might attempt to forge social bonds with the people you meet., It's a plus when the people related to you double as friends. Whether young or old, reach out to siblings, cousins, uncles, aunts, and grandparents. Who said friends had to be your age? Keeping in touch with your loved ones can help you to build social connections and lift both your moods.

, Enroll in a new class or activity learning and doing something you enjoy (or are interested in).One of the most natural ways to make new friendships is through shared interests.Find others who love the same things as you and then try to find a second commonality to further strengthen your connection with this person.


For example, join a Meetup for writers. When you meet with the group look for members who share other passions with you, such as for a specific kind of writing, for animals, or for horror films.

Get confidence.,
Identify why you cling to this person.,
Develop new friendships.,
Keep yourself busy.,
Be individual.",How to Avoid Being Clingy During School Years," People who cling to others usually don't have enough self confidence. They feel that they need to ""cling"" to people, in order to obtain strong friendships. This is not true, and in order to avoid being clingy, you need to understand that. Make a list identifying all of your good qualities, and put it in a secret place. Avoid including ""outside"" qualities like your appearance, material possessions, money, etc. This should be a list of things on the inside of you (like your sense of humor, your kind heart, your knowledge, etc.) Know that these are the things people like about you, and that you can get friends who like you for who you are.;
, Think of that particular person that you usually cling to. Why do you feel like you need to cling to them? Are they more popular, richer, prettier? What makes you need to be friends with them, and spend time with them every minute? Remind yourself that none of these things matter...or better yet, that you actually can possess them if you work hard.

, Get to know other people by joining clubs, and trying new things. Try to have an open mind, and talk to all sorts of people. Anyone could be a good candidate for a friend. Having more friends can help you avoid clinging to just one. It'll also boost your self confidence, as mentioned in the first step.

, If you feel yourself wanting to be with that person all the time, despite these steps, try to keep yourself busy. Hang out with other friends, read a book, enjoy the fresh air. Remind yourself that you don't have to hang out with this person all the time to be a good person.

, Try to express yourself in clothing choices, your locker, and more. This will help you develop your own personal style, instead of relying and clinging on others.

Listen to music.,
Play solo games.,
Develop a passion for reading.,
Watch an engaging TV show or movie.",How to Avoid Loneliness When You Don't Have Friends2," Pull up some of your favorite tunes on your cell phone, MP3, radio, or YouTube and listen. Studies strongly link music as being influential to mood - grunge music causes hostility and anger while genres like classics, oldies, rock, and pop make people feel happier and friendlier.If you are experiencing anxiety due to your loneliness, music can even help to calm and relax you.


Use your love of music to connect with others. Visit a spot that offers live music that you can enjoy with a group. Or, stop by a local record store and strike up a conversation with the clerk about the music you love most.

, If you have a computer or game console, you can play many single-player games. Video games naturally teach you by providing immediate reinforcement (winning coins, money or lives) or punishment (losing the game or losing a player life). The repetitive actions involved in game-play stimulate neural pathways in the brain, resulting in improved memory, reaction-time, decision-making, and visual capabilities.Game worlds like Fantage, Webkinz, and Wizard101 are great sites for making online friends. Just be careful not to share personal information about yourself on forums, as everyone logged on is not exactly who they pretend to be.
Beware that excessive time spent on computers or consoles can evolve into a gaming addiction. Some research also shows that video games may promote aggression and desensitize people from violence., Reading is a rewarding and healthy pastime for many. Whether you are thumbing through an entertainment magazine or envisioning the characters in a fiction novel, reading can keep you busy and distract your mind from loneliness.


Reading can actually feel more socially connected when you identify with particular characters or life experiences. Beyond that, reading boosts cognitive functioning, reduces stress, expands vocabulary, and helps you to develop greater empathy., If you live with others, you can invite them to join in as you watch so that you feel less lonely. Watching the television isn't all bad. Certain programs or films can be learning experiences, introducing you to new worlds and ideas.


Plus, sitting down in front of the tube as a family can be beneficial to children. Bonding and interaction can come about as a result of tuning in to a favorite TV show or movie with your loved ones.

Recognize the benefits of solitude.,
Journal.,
Meditate.,
Tame your negative thinking.",How to Avoid Loneliness When You Don't Have Friends3," One of the main reasons you may feel incredibly lonely is because you assume that you should always be around others. It's impossible to always be with someone else, and being alone can be a positive experience. You need to change your perspective of alone time, and see it as the opportunity for personal, emotional, and mental growth. Below are just a few of the advantages of spending time alone:You are able to recharge and find balance in your life
You can reflect on actions or events that have happened
You can consider decisions before you make them
You can uncover your voice and your feelings about certain topics
You can get work done without distractions

, Putting aside time to regularly write in a journal can be a rewarding and emotionally expressive experience. We often do not know our thoughts or reactions to certain situations without saying them aloud or writing them down. Journaling provides you with an opportunity to find your voice. What's more, this activity also relieves stress and fights depression, which is commonly associated with loneliness., Regular meditation has been shown to improve sleep, slow the aging process, increase concentration and attentiveness, improve brain functioning, and make you feel happier.It seems this centuries-old practice can also be instrumental in curing feelings of loneliness. Meditation teaches present-focused, mindfulness, which thwarts past- or future-focused worries about loneliness.To learn meditation for beginners, click here.

, Sometimes, the solution to feeling better about a situation lies in changing your perspective. We may get into ruts of negative thought patterns about our worthiness to others, and these horrible thoughts only make us feel worse. Thoughts, emotions and behavior are all connected. Therefore, in order to feel differently and act differently, you must change your thinking.The first step to taming negative thoughts is becoming aware of them. Take note of self-defeating or negative self-talk as it happens. What are you saying to yourself? How does this self-talk make you feel?
Then, reframe these thoughts into self-talk that is more realistic and helpful.
For example, you may think ""I will never make any new friends"". This thought might make you feel hopeless and ashamed. To reframe it, you must challenge it. Can you predict the future? No. So, there is no surefire way of knowing if you will ever make new friends. A better way of thinking might sound like: ""It will be difficult to make new friends, but I can try my best.""

Spot the toxic waste before it gets too close.,
Trust your gut-- if someone makes you upset and uncomfortable, make some space.,
Pay attention to body language and tone of voice.,
Keep your eyes and ears peeled for hotheads.,
Stay away from the cynics.,
Stand away from the attention seekers.,
Keep the gossip girls and rumor mill men at bay.",How to Save Yourself from Toxic People1," We all have our down days. But when it comes to toxic people, the blues are a constant rain cloud. And they want everyone to be just as wet and miserable as them. If you never see emotions other than anger, sadness, and jealousy, it is best to steer clear of that personality. Keep an eye out for the following toxic traits:


Jittery, nervous energy.
Constant whining and complaining
Clinginess and dependency
Criticism, usually aimed everywhere
Negative or cynical worldview;
, When you walk into the store to buy a new box of Cheerios, you know immediately what kind of mood the cashier is in. You can see it, even feel it, in your interaction. You can do this with your friends and coworkers, too! Even if you don't see the tell-tale signs, you know when something is off, and you know to avoid some people. Trust yourself -- there are plenty of happy people out there without trying out all the sourpusses.

, Listen to the sounds made, more than what people actually say. You can hear it when someone is just going through the motions. How do people relate to you? What do they seem to be thinking when they speak?


Bad body language looks like a sullen, sulky teenager -- shoulders down, lack of eye-contact, big, hostile gestures, etc.
Good body language looks like George Washington across the Delaware: back straight, chin up, shoulders back, etc.

, Anger, shouting, and negative criticism are major signs of a toxic personality. Angry people sometimes need a lot of help, but it's not your job to be their punching bag. It is definitely not your job to try and fix them! Staying around a person like this will cause you to become angry too. So kick back and find someone else to talk to: you'll have a lot more fun.


People who have control over their emotions don't usually feel the need to shout, so watch out for the loud ones.
Watch out for quiet,simmering anger as well. Some people won't say much, but will use poor body language and bottle it up instead. These people lash out at odd times, when anger doesn't seem called for. Luckily, this is basically a neon ""Personal BioHazard"" sign.
If you have to work with angry people, never stoop to anger -- you'll just rile them up further. Keep in professional, polite, and quick, and just walk out if they lose their temper. They'll hate you for it, but they'll learn their lesson sooner or later.

, Do you know someone who finds the darkness in everything? Much like your parents on Thanksgiving, misery loves company. These people will always complain about something, never see the good in anything, and claim they hate everything. It's exhausting just thinking about it, which is why they'll try to drag you into their little pity party.


People with very negative worldview will often be competitive about their misery, trying to outdo other people's sadness. This is the worst.
Watch out for people who constantly, even gleefully, talk about their failures and sadness. Anyone who criticizes the failures of others, or seems overly cynical, might have a toxic personality worth avoiding.

, Insecure people are unable to create their own sense of self-worth, and often cling on to others to get it. While not always toxic, these reality-TV hopefuls can get nasty when they don't get the attention they crave. If you don't give it to them, they'll find a way to make it themselves. And no one needs that kind of drama in their life.


Humble-brags (""I can't believe I only made fifteen sales today"") and obsessive posting might be a sign of this toxic personality.
These kinds of people often ""one-up"" everyone around them, or always swing conversation back to something about them.

, Instead of supporting others, gossips feed on envy. Gossip can be thrilling sometimes (duh), making you feel close with your fellow gossipers. If you've ever gotten caught up in gossip, you're not alone. But you should know that, once your back is turned, constant gossipers will start talking about you.


Gossipers constantly compare themselves to others, which is a good way to set yourself up for disappointment and failure. Don't worry about your neighbors, worry about your own backyard.

Make sure you look confident and smell good.,
Pick someone you don't know who happens to be alone to engage in a conversation.,
Once you have someone who you've become acquainted with, migrate together around the groups and be friendly when you approach.,
If someone is recounting a story, wait until they pause, then vocally ask a question or comment on it.,
When you're speaking to someone, be sure to be genuinely engaged in them, and not staring off in other directions.,
Try to be as relatable as possible.",How to Act Around People Who Know Each Other but Don't Know You (when You're Feeling Left Out)," Sociologically speaking, groups of friends can easily spot the person who is the odd one out. How you look, smell (yes smell), and act, can and will determine whether they decide to embrace you, or keep you left out. Make sure you don't look all snobby and messy; this will make it harder for people to engage with you.;
, If you've never seen them before, explain that you're new, or that you came with so-and-so, or whatever your situation is. Don't say ""Help! I don't know anyone"" unless you're fairly certain that they don't either.

, Introduce yourself to a few people and ask vague questions, like ""how long have you been working here?"", ""how do you know ______?"" or, ""what's your major?"". Keep conversations fairly brief until you've introduced yourself to several people. Try to find people who you can relate to--if you're at a college party and a girl, try to find other girls who look like they need a friend. If you're a guy, this is somewhat harder, but helps if you have a friend at the party/event.

, It is important that this is not forced--don't say anything unless you feel like it will be pertinent to their story. Make sure that when you speak, it is loud and clear so that the group focuses on you while you're speaking.

, If they are boring you, then excuse yourself to get a snack, use the restroom, or answer a text. Then move on to someone else.

, Recount personal experiences (not too personal though!)that relate to the topic, or express opinions when asked. Most of all, ask questions! Try to find what the person is interested in, and if possible, engage in a stimulating conversation.

Ask yourself, honestly, if any of your friends are toxic.,
Don't try to control or clean up the toxic mess -- you'll just get dirty.,
Empathize, but don't try to change people.,
Tune the haters out.,
Avoid toxic people like, well, toxic sludge.,
End toxic relationships completely.",How to Save Yourself from Toxic People2," Do the people in your life bring out the best in you, or are you a sponge for their negativity? Are there people who just make you feel bad, or that make you feel great when you leave? It's hard to put friendship aside. But don't let the worst people in your life pose as your best friends.

, Toxic personalities are only toxic if they affect you negatively. You can be friends with angry people. You can be friends with negative people. Accept people for who they are and what they are like, and don't let them affect you.


Not everyone is going to be friends! It's just the way of the world. Some people just aren't fun.
Negative emotions have a time limit. But if someone is holding on to anger and negativity, just throw out the clock and move on.

, Ask yourself if there is a reason someone is such a bummer. Are they going through something? Do they have a tough job or home life? Remember that you can't change another person, only yourself, so don't bog yourself down with excuses. Just try and get where they are coming from -- it'll make dealing with their crap a lot easier down the road., If you don't like what someone is saying, stop paying attention to it. Tune into the positive and constructive parts of the conversation, and start daydreaming when this person goes into negative territory. Imagine them in your underwear. Imagine yourself as a knight and them a dragon. Whatever you do, don't engage with them.


Battle away negativity with positivity -- they won't know what hit them. When they say, ""school sucks and this place is terrible,"" remind them ""at least there is lunch and recess!"" They'll move on to someone more on their toxic level.
Change the topic of conversation. Every time the person tries to steer the conversation negative, pull something else out to talk about. If your buddy wants to say ""Work sucks and my boss is a jerk,"" then change it up. Say, ""Yeah. At least football is good. What games did you watch on Sunday?""Stick to the facts with hot-tempered types. Point out what needs to be done to fix a problem. Avoid talking about opinions or guesses and they'll have nothing to try and shove back down your throat.

, If you're struggling to deal with the negativity that people bring into your life, it may be time to start limiting those interactions. You can't change the way that people behave, but you can remove yourself from the equation.


If you regularly initiate your interactions with this person, stop. If this person stops getting in touch, you're in luck!
If someone asks you if something is wrong, be honest. ""I have trouble dealing with your negativity. You bring down my mood when you __________. I like you, but I think we need to see less of each other.""

, If someone is really affecting your mental health and well-being with their negativity, end the relationship. It will hurt a bit -- no doubt about it -- but it will hurt a lot less than a lifetime with a person who makes you feel terrible.


Telling someone, ""We can hang out, but only if you're not negative"" would be like telling them you could only hang out if they were a different person. If it's not possible, come to terms with it. Cut them loose.

Kick back and chill out, man.",How to Save Yourself from Toxic People3," What is most important to you? What do you want out of your life? Listen to what other people have to say, but remind yourself that you, like George W. Bush, are The Decider. You decide your life, not the toxic sludge people surrounding you. If they can't accept that, they can get out of the way.


Write down your short and long-term plans on paper. Paste it on a wall where you can constantly remind yourself and stay focused. This will also help you when times get tough and you feel the gripping desire to fall back into older negative habits., Lots of people go through life saying, ""My parents wanted me to do X, so I did X"", or ""My spouse wanted to go to city X, so we went to city X."" Do you want your life to be decided by someone else? Make a choice, for better or worse, and live with the consequences.


Don't allow other people or their preferences to be an excuse for you. Saying, ""I'd be happy if X were different"" is just another way of saying, ""I'm not in charge of my own life. It's true that sometimes you need to need to make compromises with the people close to you. But don't let compromise be your go-to.

, Why would you hang out with people you don't like to be around? Find the guys and gals who are optimistic, upbeat, and happy. Your smiles will form a natural barrier against the haters.Move to a new town or switch jobs if you're surrounded by negative people at your old one. End that relationship and start a new one with someone who builds you up instead of dragging you down.

, Use the inspirational example of positive people in your life to guide yourself away from the toxic people. Smile, give compliments, say thank you, make eye contact, and generally do the things you would expect normal, nice people to do. Being nice is not hard, but some people need you to play the Big Bird to their Oscar the Grouch.

, If you constantly do battle with the negativity of others around you, you need to make a serious commitment to de-stressing. Find something that calms and centers you and to which you can retreat when you need to re-energize yourself. Kick loose and enjoy the world, wherever you are:


meditation
Yoga
Hiking or nature walks
Martial arts
Listen to music, read a book, or watch a movie.

Figuring out what you want can be tricky, but, usually, you know exactly what you don’t want. Sit down and put together a list of criteria that would disqualify a potential match first. Research shows that common deal-breakers for those interested in long-term relationship are:Having anger issues or exhibiting abusive behaviors
Dating several people at once
Being unworthy of trust
Being already in a relationship or married
Having health issues like an STD
Having a drug or alcohol problem
Being inattentive
Having poor hygiene;
, It’s unlikely to think that a romantic partner will share all the same values as you. However, it’s important for you to know what yours are so that you can know which principles and beliefs you are not willing to compromise.


For example, if you think honesty is really important, you are unlikely to mesh well with a partner who lies. What’s more, it’s likely to cause a rift in the relationship if your partner expects you to lie.
Find out your core values by answering these questions and looking for reoccurring themes:If you could change something about the community you live in, what would it be? Why?
Who are the two people you respect or admire the most? What traits do you admire about these people?
If your home caught on fire and all the living beings were safely out, what three items would you choose to rescue? Why?
Which moment in your life made you feel very satisfied? What happened to make you feel that way?



, Think back on relationships you have had in the past—whether romantic, platonic, or familial. For those relationships that ended badly, consider the factors that contributed to the relationship dissolving. What about those relationships left you dissatisfied or unhappy?Write down any negative patterns you can uncover from your relationships with past lovers, friends, or family members that did not fulfill you. Consider these problem areas as a foundation for what you don’t want in the future.

, Others’ relationships affect you, too. Surely, you have spent time with friends or family members who were in romantic relationships. Even though you were on the outside, you may have been aware of issues these individuals experienced.


For example, maybe your sister was devastated after her boyfriend cheated. You helping her through this time made you aware of how important it is to be faithful in a relationship.
Take note of any such red flags from others’ relationships that you don’t want to have happen in yours. Learning from the mistakes of others may help you to enjoy a more satisfying relationship in the future.

, Many people wrongfully search for a romantic partner to complete them. However, your partner should only complement you—you should already be complete on your own. Feeling complete translates to having self-love that is not dependent on anyone else loving you. Show love to yourself by:Creating a list of your favorite qualities about yourself (e.g. friendliness, your smile, etc.)
Speaking to yourself in a gentle, loving way as you would a friend
Becoming aware of your inner needs and desires and living in accordance with them
Caring for your body
Managing stress
Avoiding the tendency to dwell in the past—live in the now

, What are your expectations, for both your partner and yourself? Try to be as impartial about yourself as possible. This will help you identify types of people you want to stop seeing and behavioral patterns that you want to end, which will help you figure out the kind of relationship you actually do want.


For example, you might think you're ready to settle down, but deep down you know you're not ready for that kind of commitment. Or conversely, you might think you just want to have some casual fun, but you know from past relationships that you get too emotionally invested., Go back to your list of deal-breakers. By knowing what you don’t want, you can now uncover some things that you do. Transform your list of deal-breakers into positive qualities that you desire in a relationship.


For instance, if a deal-breaker for you was someone who has a drug or alcohol problem, you might transform that into “concern for physical and mental health”. You know you don’t want to be in a relationship with someone who uses drugs or alcohol abusively, so you would look for someone who seems to prioritize health.
Add more 'nice-to-have' qualities as you think of them. Be completely honest with yourself. If physical attractiveness is a deal breaker for you, put that down. But try to focus on qualities that don't have to do with looks, such as intelligence, patience, and empathy. You should also think about things like religion and politics, which may or may not be relevant to you. Don't leave anything out, no matter how embarrassing or trivial it seems.

, One way to maximize on the process of discovering your ideal partner is to embody the traits you yourself are looking for. This method allows you to check whether your expectations are realistic and it also gives you a chance to assess what you are willing to give in a relationship.It’s unreasonable to have a list of demands without making any changes on your own. But, personifying the traits you desire makes you an attractive partner that will likely attract someone like you.


For example, if physical health and well-being is an important quality you are asking for in a partner, strive to spend a month focusing wholeheartedly on your own health—eating well, exercising, fighting stress, and getting sleep. Keep up the good habits after the month ends.
Let’s say you listed “be rich” as a quality you wish for. If you yourself will have trouble becoming rich out of the blue, then you may want to relax this quality to something like “is financially stable.”

, You can make lists and look at your past relationships for signposts, but the very best way to figure out what you want in a relationship is to start dating casually. Go out for coffee, ice cream, or drinks with a few people who seem to meet your standards.


Know your limitations before you step into this domain, however. You may not want to become physically intimate with several people at the same time.Also, it’s wise to make sure you communicate that you are dating casually to prevent hurt feelings. Set a timeline for when you should stop seeing someone if you don’t feel a natural connection. If someone seems to become serious, or you start feeling more attracted to one person over another, cut ties with everyone else and follow your instinct.

, As you casually date a few potential suitors, consider how well each individuals matches up with your personal values, goals and dreams. Check to be sure no one is representing qualities from your deal-breakers list. As you come to get to know this person, don’t forget about your own wants and needs.At this point, you may naturally feel a better connection or more aligned with one person over any others. Now is the time to cut off any ties with other suitors so that you can focus on strengthening the relationship you have with this person and maintain fidelity.

, Every short-term relationship starts off by seeing your partner through rose-colored glasses. Everything the other person says or does is absolutely charming. In time, the perfect aura around this person starts to fade. Prepare yourself for this eventuality and start looking beyond the crazy-in-love phase to how things will be in several months or years.You must consider whether the seemingly small things that annoy you about your partner will be magnified as the rose-colored glasses come off. Return to your list and make sure that you haven’t been overlooking any important values or qualities due to being head-over-heels.
For example, if cleanliness was important for you at the onset, are you going to be able to ignore how your girlfriend piles dishes in the sink for days on end?
Before you break up with the person for any perceived slight, consider that you are bound to dislike to some small quirk of your partner. Just make sure you aren’t overlooking any non-negotiables.

, If you come to find that you and your partner are quite compatible—sharing similar values, goals, interests, and outlooks on life, then it may be time to have a candid talk about where you stand.Once you feel sure that this person embodies what you want in a relationship, you need to make sure he or she feels the same.


Be straightforward about your feelings. If your partner is not interested in a long-term relationship, it’s better to know that early on. Don’t make the mistake of thinking you can change his or her mind one way or another.
Ask your mate for some quiet time and express your feelings about this relationship. You might say “I have really enjoyed getting to know you over the past few months. I wanted to see how you felt about our connection and where we stand?” It’s significant to find out whether your partner sees the long-term for the two of you and whether he or she is ready to become mutually exclusive.

Become busy at work or within your personal life.,
Make specific plans with your friend on a sporadic basis.,
Learn to say no.,
Determine if this is a friendship worth saving.,
Take it slow.",How to Deal With a Needy Friend," Some indicators of dependency may include:


During social situations, he/she likes to be absolutely stuck to your side. Do you go to a party together, but find that your friend won’t mingle with others and is in every single conversation with you the entire night? Or does he/she always assume that when you're going out, he/she is always part of the group (even if you only want to go out with people from work, for example)?
Your friend's decision making always has to involve your input. If you're being summoned to determine if (for example) the blue sweater or brown t-shirt is right for every evening, then your friend may be having trouble making decisions on his/her own and has come to rely too much on you stepping into the breach.
Your friend opts to spend time with you versus pursuing a romantic relationship. Has your friend turned down dates or other events to hang out with you? Or does your friend constantly need your approval and/or advice about romantic connections?
It seems that your friend requires a tremendous amount of your time on a daily basis. From lengthy phone calls to daily visits after work, you feel as if your friend is always “there” and you hardly have time to socialize with other friends and perhaps even with family members.;
, Perhaps the same old stale plans are turning the relationship into a co-dependent situation.


Make your own plans and encourage your friend to make plans with other people. If you're joined at the hip, it may be time to branch out and do activities with others. Make plans with a friend you’d been meaning to have lunch with for months and then suggest your friend reconnect with old friends or someone new at work, for example.
Mix up the schedule. If you hang out every Friday night, suggest instead having lunch on Sunday. If you get pushed back about not attending your usual Friday night gig, ask him/her if there’s a friend out there he/she had been meaning to do something with, but hasn’t had the time. Suggest that your friend invite the other friend out on Friday night.

, If you find that you are functioning too often as a “we”, create a verbal separation by talking about what you may be doing this weekend and ask what he/she has planned. Continue doing this instead of talking about what “we’ll” be doing, creating a distance and confirming for your friend that you don't see him/her as part of all your social plans.

, Without sounding rude, let your friend know you have a busy week at work or numerous appointments in the coming weeks. Your friend will have to find something else to do or someone else to hang out with if you are tied up.


Make genuine appointments and get items checked off your list. Don’t lie –– actually get those pesky appointments done. Not only will you help your friend find a little more independence, you’ll get some nagging appointments off your list.
Don't completely dodge your friend, but certainly don’t make yourself available. Take your friend’s calls, but cut down on phone time. Be polite and friendly – never be rude or curt in order to get your point across. However, make it clear that you need to get things done, and sometimes, just don't answer the call but let it go through to voicemail.
Consider taking only a few days to a week off from the relationship. Don’t go cold turkey and suddenly have no time for your friend for an entire month or longer. Plan a vacation with your family; it's the ultimate good excuse!

, If your friend is used to a revolving schedule, meaning that you're together nearly every day without making actual plans, talk to your friend about planning an evening together.


Let your friend know that your schedule has ramped up but that you would love to have lunch or dinner with him or her on Saturday night, for instance. Be clear that the date you have chosen is the only time you can meet and make sure he/she can meet you at that time and day.
Always make every date with your friend. Don't wimp out and cancel, reschedule and then forget, for example. Unless you'd prefer to completely lose the friendship (which actually may be your plan), stick to your plans and don’t jerk your friend around.
Find new activities to try with your friend. If your relationship centered on clubbing or seeing movies, mix up your typical meetings and instead go ice skating or go for a hike. If you move away from your friendship comfort zone, perhaps your friend can find new-found independence as well.

, No is a powerful word but sometimes it's hard to say, especially when it comes to a friendship. However, a friend who is not able to understand why you're not willing to do something or to spend every minute of your spare time with them is not a true friend. An emotionally draining friendship is not a rewarding experience. Hence, saying no to give yourself more space and to do the things you need to do without your friend hanging about is an essential part of weaning your friend off needing you so much.


Don't jump when your friend says ""crisis"" (when you know it's not). For some people, this is an easy way to prevent others from pulling away. You need to communicate with your friend that his or her inability to make plans, be more organized or work things out in advance is not a reason to turn their issues into an emergency requiring you to respond by dropping everything. Not reacting is sometimes the greatest kindness.
If you have a hard time saying no to needy people, or attract them too often when check whether you have codependency issues, where you need to be needed, otherwise you believe you are not good enough or worthy enough to have friends.

, Are you spending too much time trying to help your friend through life or come away from every encounter feeling exhausted and/or depressed? If this relationship has become toxic it may be time to cut ties. Consider your answers to the following:


Do you feel dragged down and depressed by this friend? If it’s constant doom and gloom emitting from this person, it may be time to suggest professional assistance. Your friend may be subconsciously using you as his or her therapist when instead he or she should be seeking true, professional help.
Is this a one-sided relationship? After a conversation with this friend do you feel as if you're simply there to listen –– he or she gets out whatever is on his or her mind and then hangs up the phone or leaves the conversation? If the relationship seems to be only about your friend’s issues and problems, it has become completely one-sided and most likely is not a true friendship.
Does your friend seem to never be happy or satisfied? Does your friend seek your counsel or advice but never seems to be able to achieve peace or resolve a conflict? Or does it appear that your friend thrives on stress and complaining about issues he/she never makes a move to resolve?
Does your friend make time for you when you are going through hard times or lend a shoulder to lean on?

, Gradually put your plans in motion and hopefully, you'll be able to 'distance' yourself from your overly needy friend. Who knows, perhaps in the process, the friend may learn to stand up on his/her own two feet and lead a life with confidence. Whenever you feel overwhelmed though, recall the times he/she has been there for you. You're helping him/her as much as you're helping yourself. It is, after all, for the better. And in case you come up empty when recalling the times your friend has been there for you, well, that settles it, doesn't it? It proves that your friendship is but one-sided, giving you all the 'Go' sign you need to resolve this issue."

Approach people when running errands.,
Take public transportation.,
Work away from home.,
Better know frequent strangers.,
Talk to new people at gatherings.,
Work out someplace new.",How to Find People for Free1," Your weekly errands list probably includes a trip to the grocery store, filling up your tank, or stopping by the pharmacy. Although these tasks may seem mundane, they are great places to chat up new and interesting people. Next time you’re standing in line or browsing in the same aisle as another person, go out of your way to talk with them.


Make it a goal to talk to a certain number of new people every time you go out. For example, try to say at least “hi” to three new people each time you run your errands.
Don’t feel like you have to carry on a big conversation; simply greeting a new person and asking basic questions is enough to start. If the person is intrigued by you and you get along well, then the conversation will carry itself out naturally.;
, Heading to work or school is something you have to do anyway, so using public transportation kills two birds with one stone. Sitting or standing next to a new person on the bus, train, or metro is a great excuse to begin chatting. Plus, if you find someone you really enjoy, chances are they take the same public transportation on a regular basis. Meaning that you have the opportunity to see them often.

, If you have studying or work to do, or simply want to read a book, try doing it in a public setting instead of in your home. Head to a local park, set up camp, and hang out with others who do the same. If you share a common activity with a nearby stranger, start up a conversation about it!, Do you constantly see the same person in class or at work, but you’ve just never talked to them before? Then a great opportunity to meet someone new has presented itself to you. Approach that person you frequently see, start talking, and move past the ‘stranger’ zone you’ve currently been in.

, If you are already planning on going to a get-together or party put on by a friend or family member, take initiative to avoid being a wallflower. Although you may know many or most of the people present, step out of your shell and talk to those at the party that you don’t.

, If you go for walks, runs, or bike rides, consider moving your workout to a new location. Simply taking your dog for a walk at a local park is a simple means of finding people. Exercise in a more public location to get to know others who are doing the same.

After all, would you want to date someone who seemingly has no interests, hobbies or friends? Become a well-rounded person by spending time with friends, pursuing your own interests, and developing new hobbies. That way, when you finally meet the right girl, you'll have plenty to offer her in return.;
, You can't expect another person to love you until you love yourself. While everyone has their insecurities, letting them get the most of you will only make you unattractive to potential mates. If you find you cannot overcome your insecurities, ask a friend to point out your attributes. If that isn't effective, work on building your confidence with a counselor, therapist or a trusted member of the clergy.


Write in a positivity journal. keep track of your accomplishments, compliments people give you and any good thoughts you have about yourself throughout the day. Negative thoughts about yourself may not completely go away, but focusing more on the positives in your life will improve your overall feeling of self-worth.Encourage yourself. Making positive affirmations each day can help you become self-confident. For a few moments each day, look at yourself in the mirror and tell yourself something encouraging, whether it's something you believe about yourself or something you would like to believe about yourself. You can even write out your affirmations and place them in accessible locations, like inside your wallet or the welcome page of your mobile phone.Forgive yourself. Meanwhile, remember that no person is perfect, and everyone makes mistakes. Be sure and forgive yourself when you demonstrate imperfection.

, Neediness is a good way to repel romantic partners. And those who are attracted to desperation are probably not the best candidates for a healthy relationship. When you meet a girl, don't immediately drop the rest of your life to be at her every beck and call, and don't bombard her with endless calls and texts.


When you try too hard to find the right girl, you also set your expectations much too high. Live a fulfilling life and don't think so much about how you haven't met your soul mate. Love finds those who are not looking., You'll find it's easier to recognize a good potential partner when you meet her if you've already determined the characteristics you seek in a mate. Should she be religious, educated, funny, kind to animals or love kids? By knowing what you're looking for, you'll be better equipped to recognize a good match when you meet her.

, Everyone has qualities or behaviors that are deal breakers when it comes to relationships, whether they realize it or not.Spend some time thinking about characteristics that you absolutely do not want in your ideal partner. For many, dishonesty is a deal breaker, while others may be opposed to cruelty, prejudice, substance abuse or lack of ambition. Knowing your deal breakers is just as important in determining compatibility as knowing what attracts you, and can save you a lot of wasted time and effort in a dead-end relationship.

#Remain flexible. Just because you've decided what qualities attract you, that doesn't mean your ideal mate will possess every one of them. In fact, people are often surprised to find love where they least expect it. Think of your attractions as a guideline, not a strict rule., Looking for a mate with a particular physique, hair color or facial features is one of the quickest ways to find Ms. Wrong. Even the best looks fade over time, and while chemistry is important, if you have only physical chemistry in common, your relationship is doomed from the start.

, Don't leave your search for love strictly up to fate; you can't expect to come across the perfect woman from a random visit to the grocery store or even while buying a drink at the bar. Search in a variety of places by taking a class that interests you, joining a club, attending church, visiting online dating websites or even accepting blind dates.


Don't put all your eggs in one basket, either. While you might take an art class or attend a new church, that doesn't mean you shouldn't also test the waters of online dating or a variety of other opportunities available to meet new women.

, While you should maximize your opportunities of meeting new women, don't waste your time meeting them in places that are of no interest to you. If you aren't religious, you may not want to meet women at a church, and if drinking is a deal breaker for you, you probably don't want to look for a potential partner at a bar. Likewise, visit places that are of interest to you. Are you a sci-fi geek? Why not meet women at a book store or a Star Wars convention? Or perhaps you are a lover of the arts. How about seeking a potential mate in an art class or at a museum?

, If at first you don't succeed, try, try again. Just because you didn't meet your ideal women on one online dating website, blind date or dance class, that doesn't mean she won't be waiting for you at the next one. Don't give up on one way of meeting women just because it wasn't successful the first time or two. The world is full of people, and finding the right partner is very much a numbers game in which you'll often meet a lot of Ms. Wrongs before you find Ms. Right.

, As they say, you'll never know unless you try. When you meet a woman who you find interesting and attractive, don't be afraid to ask her for a date. Don't assume she is out of your league or wait for her to make the first move. What's the worst that can happen? She says no and you move on to someone else. Just be direct and honest in your proposition.


Based on your previous conversation, you can either choose to ask in a sincere manner: ""Hey, you seem like a really interesting person. Would you maybe want to grab a drink later on in the week?"" or in a romantic tone: ""I gotta say, when I saw you from across the room, my eyes lit up. And when we started talking, they lit up even more. Would you want to meet up later for a drink?""

, Drinks are fine for a first date, and asking her on a quick outing will place less pressure on the situation. You definitely don't want to sit through a seven-course meal with someone you’ve only just met, especially if it's obvious the chemistry isn't there by the time the entrees appear. Choose a familiar setting for maximum comfort, and a place that’s convenient for both of you to get to.

, Because you probably know little about the person, you should casually search for common ground. Remember to be your own person. Don't pretend you love a certain food or that you know everything about a movie you've never seen just to impress your date.


Ask open-ended questions about your date. For example, ""So, what got you interested in rock-climbing?"" is a more effective question than ""So, you're interested in rock-climbing?""
Discuss your immediate surroundings. Don't be so cliche as to talk about the weather, but instead discuss whatever it is you both happen to be doing. If you're playing a sport, for example, you can say something like, ""Wow, you're really good. I'll know where to come in the future if I want my butt kicked. Do you play here often?""
Relate to your date's responses. If she mentions an activity she really likes, for example, and you can relate, don't be afraid to share your similar experience.

, Sometimes it can be difficult to know whether or not someone you’re interested in is exhibiting suspect behavior, especially in the early stages of a relationship. A good way to spot deal breakers is by asking plenty of questions during your initial dates. What are her future goals? Does she like kids? Is she on good terms with her previous relationships? Since you've already established your wants, needs and deal breakers, you can more easily know what attributes to look for and ask about.


Ask things like ""Do you have any siblings?"" and ""Where do you want to be in five years?""While it's important to learn about your partner, don't overwhelm her with a constant stream of questions. Work them into the conversation slowly and appropriately.

, Just as you want to spot your deal breakers, you also want to discover if you and a potential mate hold common goals and values. Again, since you've already determined what you're looking for, you'll be better equipped to identify commonalities. Do you share a similar sense of humor?Are your future goals compatible? Does she hold similar core values to your own? Answering these three questions will provide an excellent clue to whether or not a future together may be possible.

, While you may be anxious to find out everything there is to know about a woman and determine if she is right for you, don't rush the relationship. While you shouldn't take too much time to find if you share core goals and values, you don't need to answer every question on the first date. Take some time to get to know each other naturally, and ask key questions as the relationship progresses.

Likewise, don't rush down the aisle at the first sign of attraction and shared interests. Sometimes a person's true colors only come to light after the excitement of the initial get-to-know-you period is over. It's not only important to have fun dating without worrying about making commitments before you truly know your partner, but couples who end up being successful in love are generally not the ones who commit while still starry-eyed and full of hormonal attraction.
Just as you want to take time to get to know your potential mate, it's also a good idea to take it slow when it comes to your physical relationship. Get to know one another and find out if you really like each others' personalities before you move your relationship to a physical level.

, The best relationships can't be forced. If she doesn't call or agree to another date, don't let the rejection affect your confidence and perseverance. Just believe that she wasn't the right girl for you, and be grateful you didn't waste weeks, months or years with the wrong person.

Playing a sport you enjoy, even if you're not great at it, is just one more way to meet new people who have shared interests. Many student athletes build life-long friendships with their teammates., If your school hosts these, this can be a great opportunity to try being outgoing in front of a group of strangers, and if you fail, this is a low stakes situation because you never have to see these people again. Sing a song, read a poem, tell a joke. Get outside your comfort zone.


You don’t even need to perform. You can just attend the show and talk to the performers and other audience members., People are more likely to approach or speak with a stranger who is smiling. Sharing a smile makes you appear happy and approachable. Smiling also boosts your own level of contentment, and in most cases, happier people are much more confident. Set a goal to smile at someone and say hello every day. You may not always get a response, but the act of repeatedly smiling and greeting new people will make you seem and feel more outgoing., If you have a class with someone else, see each other at a movie over the weekend, or are both in the school band, these are all great starting points for a conversation. Approach people and casually bring up your shared interest, even if you have to practice being casual.


For instance, you might say, “I did not feel great about that test in chemistry. How do you think you did?”
You could ask something like, “Did you enjoy that movie last weekend?”
Try complimenting them by saying, “You did great on that solo in band."", Even if it’s simply to go up and say hi, force yourself to talk to at least one person during any social engagement. This can mean chatting with someone at a party, a meeting of an extracurricular group, or simply in between class periods. Prepare a list of topics ahead of time, because if you’re afraid you might say the wrong thing, this is a great way to feel more confident. The list can include anything that may be interesting at the social event in question. For example, “What team are you rooting for?” Is a great opening line at a Friday night football game.Talk to people who seem shy. This can help you both feel more confident and comfortable because you might both be in the same boat.
Just say hi! You have to start somewhere, and a simple hello is just fine., This is likely a more comfortable situation, and it will be easier for you to approach them because you have a friend in common.


Start with something like, ""You're a friend of Brenda's right? I'm Sam. Brenda and I go to school together. We met at her birthday."" This takes all the pressure off the other person to remember who you are, and starts the conversation off.
If you don't already know from previous encounters, ask, ""How did you meet Brenda?""
If you haven't seen your mutual friend lately, you can ask after them. Say something like, ""How has Brenda been?"", Don’t feel pressured to always create the conversation. If a group of people are already talking, join in the chat. This can be as simple as saying, “Oh, I saw that movie too. What did you think of the ending?” Just walk up and join in the conversation. Remember your opinions are valid, and people will enjoy hearing them.


If the group of students you're joining is in another social group than the one you usually hang out with, don't let that intimidate you. Remember that the worst case scenario is you don't make new friends, and if the group of students doesn't like you, you can always try talking to a different group of people., This will make you feel more comfortable when approaching them, and take the focus off of you, if you’re feeling shy. Plus, this assures the person you’re talking to that you care about them, since you made an effort to remember what’s going on in their life.


If someone mentions they’re going to see family out of state this weekend, ask them about it on Monday.
If a friend was nervous about a math test last week, follow up to see how they did.
Remember people’s birthdays and wish them well on that day., They can review your behavior by directly observing how you act or by you telling your peer or family member about an incident where you felt very shy. Most people will be happy to help you with this and give you tips, but try to find someone who is outgoing and confident in the ways you would like to be.


Ask them, “What would you have done in my situation?”
Request feedback on how you can be more approachable or personable the next time you’re in a similar situation.
Remind your friend or family member to offer constructive (helpful) feedback, not just criticism of your behaviors., This doesn’t mean you shouldn’t be yourself or be confident in who you are. Instead, this is a way to learn outgoing behaviors by acting like a person who is already outgoing and confident. This is also a good way to reduce stress related to trying something new because you’ve already seen that these behaviors are effective.


Think of someone whose personality you admire - it could be your friend, it could be a family member, it could even be a celebrity. Then, watch them as they engage with other people. Pick up on their body language as well as their verbal cues. They might compliment others or give lots of hugs. Next time you’re in a social situation, try to mimic one or two of their outgoing behaviors., If you know you’re going to a party, meeting, or other event soon, practice. Ask a friend or family member to act like a stranger or acquaintance you may interact with at the event. Approach them and try a variety of greetings, conversation starters, and other interactions. The more times you do something, the more natural it feels.You could say, ""I'm going to a party and want to seem very outgoing. Can you do a little role play with me to see how I might interact with others to seem outgoing?""

, Search online or ask a guidance counselor or therapist for a recommendation of a class that can help you build confidence. This could range from debate to public speaking to cooking. National organizations like Toast Masters are a great option. You may even be able to find weekend or afternoon classes to help you improve your confidence and be more outgoing., If you find yourself unable to achieve your goals to develop greater confidence on your own, you may want to talk to a professional. Guidance counselors and therapists have the education and training to help you succeed in your goals to change your habits. There are also peer group programs for anxious people that provide support and encouragement.Antianxiety medications may be prescribed to help you feel more relaxed on a daily basis, if it’s discovered that your shyness is a result of a social anxiety disorder.
A therapist or counselor can walk you through cognitive behavior therapies to help you change negative thought processes, and improve your overall confidence, which makes being outgoing in social situations easier."

Be of good character.,

Don't deceive people, don't lie.,
Avoid gossip, rumor mongering or innuendo.,
Apologize when it is needed.,
Maintain the long-term relationship in place of the short-term gain.,
Realize that being trustworthy is a journey, not an endpoint.,
Remind yourself at all times that being trustworthy is a valuable asset to your life and to the lives of the people you care about.,
Be strong.,
Believe in yourself and validate the good in you, at all times.",How to Become a Trustworthy Person," Have more than good intentions in life. While it's nice to mean well, it's far better to show people that you're a person who is reliable, tries their best at all times and thinks clearly. Meaning well can end in all sorts of problems, including excusing oneself for failure to follow through. On the other hand, good character lets other people know that you have traits they can always rely upon.


Actions prove far more than words. Good character is forged in good, caring and thoughtful actions.;
, When you say that you will do something for someone, then do it. People rely on a promise and seeing it through is the hallmark of a trustworthy person. Hand things in on time. Be where you say you'll be punctually. Arrive when you say you will. Depart when you said you would.


Don't break your promise. If you have problems keeping it, talk to the person about the circumstances but with a view to fulfilling what you can of the promise. Don't simply fail to do it or slink away if it's not doable.

, Be honest in everything you do. Honesty is the keystone to people knowing where they stand with you. Honesty includes having good manners though; when being frank, at least be polite. Sometimes it is necessary to sugarcoat the truth so that its bitter pill is swallowed with greater ease.


Some honesty can be hard but is still essential. For example: Your least favorite coworker has spinach stuck in his teeth after a work function. Do you tell him? Of course you do. He deserves to know that. Your arch enemy has her skirt tucked into her knickers after visiting the bathroom. Do you tell her? Of course you do. She deserves to know that. You may have qualms because you initially think it's funny, payback or just desserts but realize that by being honest here, you gain respect from people who would otherwise be thorns in your side. They owe you one and know you are someone solid. Even in hard situations always tell the truth.

, These traits feed into trustworthiness because they let people know that you give people the time of day and that you're willing to give second chances. Compassion must be felt from within and learned through experience by standing in other people's shoes, seeing things from their perspective. Practice looking at things from the other person's perspective until it feels second nature. When you are able to think of the other person first, because you're already internally strong and well self-nurtured, then you'll be viewed as trustworthy.

, People tell you things in confidence because they trust you. That is a bond to never be broken. You must guard these confidences closely unless and until the person who bestowed you with that confidence says that you can do otherwise.

, Avoid befriending the gossiping types other than to say hello to them as you pass by. Instead, find people of good character, who are also aiming to be trustworthy, caring and strong, just like you. Support each other and help each other to continue growing as good human beings throughout life.


Quality over quantity applies to friendships as much as anything else in life. While being friendly to all is a great trait, having quality friends who are close to you will often mean the group is much smaller.

, There will be times when deception and lying seem like the right way out of something. Yet, the truth will eventually come out and it is better to take control of bad actions, bad news and bad happenings before your deception or untruthful statements  unravel. Be the better and bigger person and tell the truth and avoid the temptation to cover things up.


The truth always comes out, one way or another. Remind yourself of this.
Mark Twain once said: ""If you tell the truth you don't have to remember anything"". This makes for a simpler, happier and more fulfilling life.

, None of these things read trustworthy. They're the total opposite. Avoid getting involved in gossip, avoid starting rumors and don't succumb to making insidious suggestions about people. Speak plainly, rely on facts and point out the reality to others when they lack the facts but mouth off anyway.


Move away from the gossip clan. Gossiping clans make sure you take turns to dish out garbage about those not in the gossip clan. Once it's your turn, you'd probably hurt someone's feelings while you tell them everything. Remember that the truth will always find a way out, so don't even start with the nasties.
If all else fails, just think about how that person you are talking about would feel and just tell your friends you've got nothing.

, Tell people you may have hurt that you're sorry for making a mistake, for getting them wrong or for being totally out of order. You may like to explain the reason you did something, but that depends on the situation. Sometimes it's just best to say sorry and to own your mistake. Then, do your best to make it up to the other person. Tell them that you are doing your level best to be a better, more trustworthy person now and that you don't follow any of the old ways that involved hurting people.

, Cheating on, lying to or sneaking around someone you care about because you're focused on an initial current thrill will end in pain. If things aren't going well in any relationship, communication is key, not subterfuge and cheating. Talk openly to try to find solutions to the blockages in your relationship. Clarity and a willingness to solve problems are the signs of a trustworthy person.

, It takes time to change bad habits, a poor attitude and bad ways of reacting to others. Earning trust takes time too, especially if you have been a difficult human being in the past. Yet, it will happen, especially as you continue to prove through your actions that you are reliable, honest and of good character.

, When people you care about know they can rely on your word and that you are honorable and honest, you will be given important tasks, you will become the keeper of great confidences and you will be respected. These are worthwhile outcomes to aim for.

, It is important to remember that life isn't a popularity contest. Sometimes people won't appreciate your honesty, your strength against unkindness and your unwillingness to gossip or spread rumors. That's just a fact you must live with, understanding that all people have to come to their own realizations about holding better values in life.

, You do best in life when you begin from strong foundations. Trust yourself and love yourself so that you can relay that inner trust and love to others, trusting and loving them with strength and goodwill. Grow yourself, then you can grow others. Knowing that you do not need others to save you or shape you will aid you in being trustworthy because you don't need to stroke their egos just to feel good. It will also help you when you are occasionally betrayed by someone you trusted (it happens) because you've the capacity, will and resilience to carry on regardless. All courage and strength to you.

Pause and try to see the joke.,
Have an effective comeback.You can make a joke back about yourself, your friend, or anything else, as long as it's also friendly.,
Calmly and confidently ask them to stop.,
Stay calm.,
Shut them down with quick sarcasm.,
Explain your reaction.,
Set a boundary with your friend.,
Don’t blame yourself for your sensitivity.,
Reach out to your friends who don't tease you.,
Speak to an authority figure.,
Find better friends.",How to Act in Front of a Friend when They Are Making Fun of You," If your friends are good friends, their teasing is probably meant kindly. Before you react, listen to what they are saying and think about why they are saying it.


Ask yourself how you feel. Do you feel loved and known? Do you feel like your friend likes you? This is friendly teasing, and it's a good idea to react in a friendly way.
If you feel like your friend doesn't like you, pay attention. That might mean that the teasing is unfriendly.;
, Having a comeback can show others that you have the strength to stand up for yourself in a positive way. Make sure that your comeback is not at anyone else’s expense, including your own. The purpose of the comeback is to stop the teaser from continuing to tease you any further.


You can dismiss their joke by saying, “Thanks but I’ve heard that line before.” Then just walk away or move on to a different topic without any further attention given to the situation.
Avoid teasing the teaser back. Instead of sinking to their level, be the bigger person.
You can agree in a joking way. If your friend says ""Hey sleepy, falling asleep at lunch again?"" You can say ""Yeah, that's me, Sleepy.""If you aren't hurt, but you don't really like the joke, just smile but don't say anything. Your smile will tell your friend that you aren't upset, but it won't give them more material to tease you with.

, If you don't like the teasing, explain how you're feeling. Stay calm and confident while you speak by taking a deep breath, holding your head high, and standing up straight. Smile, and check if it feels natural to smile. Then say ""You're very funny, but I don't feel like being teased right now. Let's talk about something else, okay?"", You can feel upset, but it will help you communicate if you don't lose your temper and start yelling or crying. If you feel anger, take a deep breath and count to ten.In your head, remind yourself to relax: think ""Be easy,"" or ""You can relax.""


It can help to say your own name silently.You should usually let your friends know how you feel, but if you have a friend who is turning out to be a bully, avoid revealing your hurt feelings.
Let them know that you aren't hurt, but that you don't think they're being funny.
If they say something insensitive, you can say ""I feel like if you really thought that, you would ask me about it in private instead of making jokes.""

, Let your friend know that you don't find their teasing amusing. You don't have to act serious—you can just raise your eyebrows, or say something slightly sarcastic, like ""Oh sure, you got me there.""You can change the topic if you know you have something more captivating than your friend's teasing. If you don't, try sighing and saying ""Does anyone want to talk about something more…uh…interesting?""
Tease your friend back for talking about you so much. Say ""You think a lot about my outfits, don't you?"" If they come back with an insult, just smile and say something like ""Whatever you say, personal stylist.""
Tell your friend later in private how you feel. Sarcasm can turn nasty over time—you don't want to communicate that way for too long., If your feelings have been hurt, it will probably show in your face. You might snap, or even cry. If this happens, explain how you feel. Your friend should respect you and listen—if they don't, walk away.


Explain why you reacted. ""It's not what you said—what you said isn't true. I'm hurt that you would say it, though.""
When you address your friend, use ""I"" statements instead of accusing them of anything. It will help you and your friend stay calm.You can say ""I feel hurt when you tease me about this. I never like jokes about this subject.""

, When you are alone with your friend, explain to them that you really don't like the kind of teasing they were engaging in. Draw a boundary by telling your friend exactly what you want them to do. Set a consequence by saying what you will do if they cross your boundary.For instance, you might say ""I don't want you to talk about my family in public, especially when you're making jokes or bringing up things we are struggling with."" This is a boundary.
To set a consequence, explain what you will do if they cross the line again. ""If you talk about my family in a way I don't like, I will not hide that I am upset with you. If you keep going, I will leave the conversation. If you do it repeatedly, I will end our friendship.""
Follow up. If they cross your boundaries, give them the consequences.

, If you feel upset when you’re teased and feel like you’re always the butt of the joke, try to realize that your sensitivity isn’t your fault. It isn’t your fault if friends or family members are too harsh, verbally cruel, and judgmental. Remember that you have every right to stand your ground and tell someone to stop when they’re being mean to you., If you have a problem with a friend who always teases you, let all your friends know that you don't like it. Explain that you feel pushed out of friend group by this person.


Ask your other friends to intervene. Talk to the person you are closest to first. If your closest friend is the one who is teasing you, talk to someone else who likes you and isn't closer to the teasing friend.
Explain that you want to keep hanging out with all your friends, but that the friend who is bugging you makes you feel like it's not worth it.
Reach out to other friends who are being teased. If you stick up for each other, your teasing friends will back off., If your friend or friends are repeatedly teasing you in ways that make you feel bad, even though you have asked them to stop, that is bullying. If they mimic you, or make unkind faces or gestures at you (like eye rolling) it is called ""social bullying"" and it's as real as any other kind.Talk to your parents, older friends, and your teacher or supervisor. If the bullying doesn’t stop, report it to the principal where you go to school, or the boss where you work.

, If your friends are really trying to make you feel bad, they aren't your friends. If you tell your friends how they feel, and they ignore you and cross your boundaries, move on. Friendship is about respect and kindness. Reach out to people you think are nice, or consider transferring to different activities so that you can meet new people.


If your friends reach out to you after you leave them, let them know what you expect before you come back. Tell them that if they cross your boundaries with mean teasing, you will leave for good.

Show extreme loyalty to your partner.,
Show your devotion to a community or cause, not just a person.,
Ride out the bad.,
Participate in his activities.",How to Be a Ride or Die Chick1," A ride or die chick is eternally devoted to her partner and his life choices, no matter what those might be. The term derived from rap music in the 1990s, and it’s often used to refer to African-American women and gangster culture, although not exclusively.


The term essentially means that the ride or die chick is willing to lay her life down in the battle for her partner, participating in all aspects of his life. That means she will lie for him, help him, and stick by him, even if he’s engaged in dangerous and unlawful behavior.Sometimes, ride or die chicks are glamorized by the media, even though they have an outlaw connotation. For example, Bonnie in the robbery duo of Bonnie and Clyde is considered a ride or die chick. Indeed, some define the ride or die chick as a “hip hop spin” on Bonnie and Clyde mythology.On the even more negative side of the equation, ride or die chicks sometimes become witting accomplices in their partner’s amoral activities. Some people consider Adolf Hitler’s wife, Eva Braun, to be a ride or die chick because she committed suicide with the man who murdered millions of people. Don’t forget that Bonnie and Clyde ended up dying in a hail of bullets.;
, Some people interpret the term ride or die chick to mean loyalty to more than just another person or love interest. The term can also mean loyalty to something bigger than yourself.


A ride or die chick in this context embraces a political movement or other social cause. For example, she is willing to risk anything for the cause, even if it means arrest or other problems. The cause comes first.
She sticks by her community no matter what, always defending it, and always being its champion when the community is under attack, real or perceived.
An example of a ride or die chick would be Jane Fonda, who took her opposition to the Vietnam War to an extreme and controversial degree, despite personal consequences to her own career.

, A ride or die chick isn’t just at her husband or partner’s side when things are going great. She’s still there no matter what happens, even if he ends up incarcerated or broke.


The term can equally apply to males. When it does, it’s just called “ride or die.” The key point: These are women (or men) who stand by their partner no matter what he or she does, even if she or he is mistreated along the way.Someone might say, “That’s my ride or die husband for life.” The ride or die chick is the opposite of someone who just marries someone for their money or power and hits the road the second those things vanish.

, The ride or die chick is down for whatever her partner needs her to do. She isn’t just a passive observer to his lifestyle; she’s ready to participate.


The ride or die chick doesn’t have strong boundaries with her partner, and she lets him set the terms of the game. Being mistreated, though, never feels good.
The ride or die chick doesn’t have the power in the relationship. Her partner generally sets the couple’s boundaries and the terms. At the same time, some people consider the ride or die chick to be a liberated woman because she's joining her man in rejecting the rules.
The ride or die chick’s role in the relationship is as the accomplice. The partner’s activities take precedence over everything, and he may reward her for her trouble with money, jewelry or other gifts.

Be nice to friends of your friends.,
Accept that you may not be their “best friend.” Just because you consider someone your best friend doesn’t mean they have to think the same about you.,

If you do come into contact with a friend of your friend (for example, at a party), be nice to them. Don’t accuse them of trying to steal away your friends. You never know, you may even become friends with them, and then you have a new friend and you don’t have to feel jealous.


It may not be easy, but try to be happy that your friend has such a big support system. If you truly care about them, then you should feel happy that your friend has many people they can count on.
Don’t say something to their friend like, “Oh, you’re ’s friend? Well, that’s cool, but you’ll probably never be as close to them as I am so don’t even try.”;
, Yes, it can be a bit hurtful, but you can’t force someone to be your best friend. Friendships have their ups and downs, just like any relationship. There may come a time when they rely on you more, and you rely on them less.


The sooner that you understand that you can’t make people do what you want, the sooner you will be able to relax. If you are able to be more relaxed, people will be more drawn to you, and they will admire your ability to go with the flow.

, This doesn’t mean you have to ignore them or anything like that. It just means that, if you’ve been contacting them a lot lately, following them around, or constantly commenting on their social media accounts, try to give it a rest. Let them find their way to you. If they really are your friend, they will get in touch with you.


When they do get in touch with you, don’t treat them as though they’ve done something wrong. Remind yourself that this is what you wanted, and be happy about it.
If you want to look at your friend’s social media account to see what they’re up to, that’s fine. However, realize that you may see pictures of them doing things with other people, and you may feel jealous. If you find yourself feeling jealous, avoid commenting something clingy on the photo. For example, don’t say, “It looks like you’re having a lot of fun without even inviting me! :(“

, Some people need more space from friends and people than others, and just because they don’t want to spend every free minute of their day with you doesn’t mean they don’t care about you. If you think you may be being a bit clingy, try to back off a bit.If you’ve been going to their house every single day after school, stop for awhile. Wait until they invite you to come or until they ask why you haven’t been coming over anymore. If they do ask, just be honest. Tell them that you wanted to respect their space, but that you’re happy to come over if they want you to.
For example, you can say, “I just felt like maybe I was coming over too often, and I realize that you need to have your own space, too. I’d be happy to come over whenever you want though!”

, When you do initiate something with your friends, try to have an idea in mind. Don’t just say, “I want to hang out with you.” Instead, find something to do that you think they will enjoy and suggest going together.You can also sound very confident and like you will go with or without them by saying something such as, “Hey! There’s this concert that I’m going to on Saturday. Do you want to come along?” This will show your friends that you don’t have to have them around to enjoy something, but that you do like to do things with them.

, If they give you a reason why they can’t go, try to accept this and don’t question whether or not they made it up. If they don’t give a reason, don’t just assume it’s because they don’t want to hang out with you. If you get mad, you’ll just make them feel tense around you because they will feel like they have to agree to do whatever you want in order to avoid making you angry.If you are feeling angry about it, try to let off some steam once they are gone. You could go for a run or write your feelings about the situation in a journal. If you really feel upset about it, you can try talking with your friend about it, but realize that this may not help if you want to seem less clingy.
For example, if they turn you down, don’t say, “I know you’re just making up excuses and that you don’t really want to hang out with me. You’re being a bad friend.” This is an overreaction and it will probably freak your friend out a bit. Instead, say something like, “Oh, ok. It’s cool. Maybe next time.”

, If you have become clingy towards a certain friend because you have noticed them starting to pull or drift away from you, think about letting the relationship go. Friendships do come and go, and sometimes if is easier for everyone if you just let the relationship end and move on with new people.


This doesn’t mean you can’t talk to them about what is going on, but realize that they may not be honest, especially if they are afraid of hurting your feelings. If you have been best friends with someone for many years, you should approach them if you notice they are behaving differently towards you.
For example, you could say, “It seems like we’ve been drifting apart lately. Is everything OK?”

, It may be the case that you have a group of friends that is taking you for granted. Though it may be hard to accept this, sometimes it is for the best. If you truly believe that your friends don’t really care about you, think about finding some new friends that will care about you and how you’re feeling.


Once you find true friends, you will be much happier, even if this means hanging out with less “popular” people.

, Are you constantly asking your friends to do something? Do you try to have a plan to hang out every single day during your free time? If so, you are probably being a bit clingy. Try to remember that nearly everyone can benefit from having some good quality alone time.


Sometimes it can be weird to hang out alone, especially if you’re used to being around people all of the time. Try doing something like reading or even just watching TV for a bit.

, Does your friend initiate contact just as much as you do, or are you the one making all the plans and asking your friend to hang out all the time? If you are the one doing all the work, then you may be being a bit clingy.


If this is the case, try to back off a bit and see if your friends takes over some of the responsibility.

, You don’t have to literally make a count of how many times you call or text someone each day. There is no rule when it comes to what is OK and what is not OK. However, you should try to be conscientious about how often you are calling/texting versus how often they are contacting you.


For example, if you call your friend everyday after school or if you spend your evening sending them text messages, and they don’t seem so eager to talk to you or aren’t really answering your messages, you may be overdoing it.

, Often, we tend to cling to people when we feel insecure in our relationship with them. When we feel insecure about something we tend to become paranoid and overreactive. Do you find yourself constantly worried that your friends are doing something without you?


If you do find yourself being worried about this, then you may be being clingy. Try to remind yourself that you don’t have to do every single things that your friends are doing all the time. It’s even a good idea to do your own thing once in awhile.

, Talking through your worries and insecurities with someone can be more helpful than you think. If you think you have a real problem with clinginess, it might be best to talk it through with a professional counsellor. Your school may have one that is there for exactly this purpose, and you can talk to them about anything that’s worrying you. It can be helpful to talk with a professional because they can be more objective than friends or family sometimes.If you can’t or don’t want to talk with a counsellor, consider talking with a parent or a trusted adult.
Talk to them about how you’re feeling and what’s going on in your life. Tell them that you are worried you are being too clingy with friends, but you’re not sure what to do about it. They have probably been there before and can offer advice about how to handle it.

, Try to remember that friends are not all there is to life even if they do play a big and important part in it. Remember that you have responsibilities at home and at school or work. Make sure that you are taking care of all of those things instead of neglecting them to always be around your friends.


The same goes for your family. Besides your friends, you have a family that cares about you. Spend time nurturing your relationships with your siblings, parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles. These are the people that will be there for you no matter what.
Spending time with family can be a great way to start feeling more secure. In most cases, your family knows you better than anyone else and accepts you all the same. If you have secure relationships with your family members, you can learn how to act that way with friends, too.

, In addition to making sure that you are taking care of your responsibilities and family, find things that you enjoy doing alone. It is good to learn to just be with yourself and feel comfortable with it. If you already have a hobby that you enjoy, then great. If you don’t, try out a few things you’ve been curious about and see what grabs your attention.Many hobbies have their way of making you more confident in yourself. For example, they may teach you a cool skill.

, Although there are many indirect ways of building confidence in yourself, you can also take steps to work on your self-confidence more directly. In order to build self-confidence, you will need to become aware of the bad things you are thinking about yourself. Any time you catch yourself getting mad at yourself or thinking something negative about yourself, try to become aware of it, and remind yourself that you aren’t going to think that way anymore.This also means that you need to give yourself credit when you do something good. If you say something funny that makes people laugh or you do a good deed, let yourself feel proud.

Consider the negative implications.,
Turn the ride or die chick concept positive.,
Study feminist interpretations of the concept.",How to Be a Ride or Die Chick2," Although being a ride or die chick has a positive connotation in some communities and usages, it comes with negatives ramifications that you might want to think about.


For example, if your partner is engaged in illegal activities that put others, himself, you, or your family at peril, you would do him (or her) more of a favor by helping him find another way.
There’s a reason that a person’s ride or die chick isn’t always the person they choose to be their wife; the ride or die chick is part of the ""bad girl/good girl"" binary that some people think is unfair to women.Although Hollywood and rap music have glamorized young death (in music as well as film), it’s really not glamorous at all to see a person you love lying in a casket. In real life, not the movies, this will come with decades of pain, endless jail visits, financial struggles, and fatherless children.
Being a ride or die chick could put your own personal safety at risk, and it could also land you in trouble with the law, depending on the activities your partner is engaging in. Consider whether that’s worth it. Isn’t there another way?, Although often used to glorify women who help men engaged in gangster life or criminality, there are positive ways to embrace the ride or die chick’s liberating allure and steadfast loyalty without the danger.


For example, the term has been used to refer to a woman who stands by her man through a very difficult battle with terminal cancer. She doesn’t run away when things are painful.In more general terms, the phrase means sticking it out when times get tough, whether because of finances or something else. If the struggle is something out of your partner’s control – they lost a job, they have a health problem – that’s different than staying with a man who actively mistreats you. Never stay with a man who puts your life in danger or subjects you to physical or emotional abuse, especially if there are children in the home.
In its most loving definition, the ride or die chick is just a play on the concept of endless love that is found in many marriage vows that say “until death do us part.” The ride or die chick sometimes comes from an impoverished and violent environment or background.

, Although some people consider the ride or die chick to be a liberating and even empowering rejection of the rules, some people don’t perceive the concept so fondly.


Some theorists have argued that the ride or die chick is an exercise in masculinity and patriarchy because the male’s needs are dominant over the woman’s. Others, though, have argued that the term can evolve and even constitutes an act of political rebellion against a culture that has stigmatized African-American love by devaluing the worth of black women.
Some people believe the ride or die chick is setting herself up for a life of depression and pain, as she allows herself to be mistreated and drawn into a life of danger.
Some scholars have recognized the ride or die chick as one of the historic stereotypes of black females. They have argued that the concept objectifies and does not empower women, and that it has contributed to rising female prison populations."

Be fun to capture the personality of a true ride or die chick.",How to Be a Ride or Die Chick3," People have identified many famous celebrities as ride or die chicks. Study them to master the concept. To some degree, ride or die chicks are the “bad” girl, not the good.For example, Shante Broadus, the wife of rapper Snoop Dogg, stood by him despite drug use, infidelity and divorce papers. Eudoxie stood by rapper Ludacris when he cheated on her. Gabrielle Union stood by Dwayne Wade even when he got another woman pregnant.The actress Nia Long has been dubbed a repeated cinematic ride or die chick. In the movie Boyz in the Hood, she played a loyal girlfriend helping her man, who was living a life on the streets of LA.In Soul Food, she played Bird, who was holding down the house while trying to help her criminal boyfriend find a job.
You can also find ride or die chicks in politics. Hillary Clinton famously stood by Bill Clinton after the Monica Lewinsky scandal. Sometimes ride or die chicks stand by their man to the bitter end because they get something out of the relationship: Status, money, fame. But the phenomenon doesn’t only occur with the rich and famous.

, The ride or die chick concept was popularized by hip hop music and has made appearances in other forms of pop culture.


For example, in season 1 of Empire, Andre’s wife is a ride or die chick, when she accidentally killed a man who was about to tell the police that her husband had killed someone. “I’m ride or die,” she told her husband as she helped him bury the body.
""Ride or Die, Chick” is a song that was featured on The Lox’s second album, We are the Streets. A less clean version contains an expletive in the place of the word “chick.”The concept appears in many other songs, including those by artists Jay-Z, Ice Cube, DMX, Ja Rule, Method Man, The Game, and 2Pac. Sometimes the term is accompanied with the “B” word or replaced with the phrase, a “down ass bitch.”
The characters Carmela Soprano and Adriana La Cerva are ride or die chicks who are accomplices in their partner’s criminal Mafia lifestyles. However, Adriana loses her life in the end.
Author J.M. Benjamin has written a paperback novel series that features ride or die chicks.

Make a plan to meet up with her.,

Relax.,
Maintain eye contact.,
Specify what you did wrong.,
Take responsibility sincerely.,
Avoid using ""you"" statements.,
Resist the urge to explain yourself.,
Be quiet.,
Walk away.",How to Apologize to a Teen Girl," Apologies are best articulated when the parties involved are face to face.Apologizing in person means you set aside time out of your day specifically for this apology which will help her believe that you actually mean it.


You could ask her to please meet you briefly at the local coffee shop or library. Or try asking if it would be okay for you to stop by her house so she can be in a comfortable environment for your apology.
Let her know your plan is to discuss whatever you're apologizing for. Try saying something like ""I'd really like to talk to you so I can apologize properly, could you meet me at the library around 3:00?""
Do not text, email, write a note, or use any form of social media to deliver your apology. This comes across as impersonal and when she reads your words without the context of your tone of voice and facial expressions, she can end up misconstruing what you meant.;
, The only thing more awkward than apologizing to someone is stammering over your words as you struggle to think of how to say it. You will be much better off if you go into this conversation with a good idea of what to say.


For example, plan to start out with something along the lines of, “I’m so sorry for reading your journal, it was a violation of your privacy. I promise not to do that again.” Or “I’m very sorry I was so rude to you, can you please forgive me?”
If you’re apologizing in advance for something she doesn’t know about yet, try something along the lines of “It’s very hard for me to tell you this, but I want you to know that I accidentally ruined your favorite jacket, I’m sorry.” Or “I know that you deserve honesty, so I’m telling you that I lied to you earlier, and I’m so sorry.”, Saying you’re sorry to a girl you know is, or will be upset can be quite nerve wracking. Make sure you take the time to calm your nerves before your apology so you can be totally relaxed.


Try listening to your favorite relaxing music. You might also find it helpful to sit in a quiet room, while you work the apology through in your head. Better yet, try practicing your apology in the mirror, the more you reiterate what you want to say, and how you want to say it, the more relaxed you'll be when it comes time for the real thing.

, This is uncomfortable for a lot of people, but during an apology you have to look her in the eyes at key moments so she knows you’re being sincere when you speak those words. Don’t look around the room, fidget with objects around you, or look at your phone while you’re talking.


If she will let you, try taking her hand in yours while you speak. Let her hand be a reminder to emphasize key points in your apology with eye contact., Define exactly what it is that you did wrong. An apology that is too vague will likely make her feel like you don’t really care.


Try something like “I’m sorry I upset you when I teased you in front of your friends. That wasn’t my intention, and it won’t happen again.” Or “I’m sorry I told our lab partner that secret you told me to keep. It wasn’t my business to tell and it broke your trust in me. I apologize for that.”, Take complete ownership of what you did. She wants to hear you acknowledge your faults, and that you’re sincerely sorry for them.

, Many people struggle with delivering proper apologies because they tend to use ""you"" statements rather than ""I"" statements. ""You"" statements get translated as placing blame back onto the person who you've upset, whereas ""I"" statements place the blame on yourself.


For instance, you wouldn't want to say something like “I’m sorry you got upset when I called you that name.” This can make her feel as though she didn’t have a right to be upset in the first place.Instead say ""I'm sorry I called you that name, I know it upset you, I should never have said it.""

, When having to say ""I’m sorry"" to someone, many of us automatically think of the reason behind whatever it is we’re apologizing for doing. We like to justify our actions to make ourselves feel better. A proper apology, however should never include any explanations or justifications. These only act to undermine the apology you’re trying to deliver.


Never include the word “but” when apologizing. For example, avoid phrases like “I’m sorry you got upset when I borrowed your shirt without asking, but I didn’t think you’d notice or care.” Or “I’m sorry about the other night, but I didn’t think you’d get this mad.” She doesn’t care what you thought or why you did the thing that upset her, she just wants to know you’re truly sorry for it.

, Once you’ve looked her in the eye, taken ownership of the specific thing you did wrong, and gave her your most sincere apology - stop talking. She might need a moment to process what you’ve just said, and rambling on after you apologize can take away the magnitude of your apology.


Just be patient and wait for her response with a smile.

, Apologizing is the first step to making her feel better. She may not be completely healed immediately, so give her some space if she doesn’t feel like talking afterwards.


On the other hand, she may have a lot to say to you after your apology. If this is the case, stay put and listen intently. Make sure you keep the same eye contact you gave her while delivering your apology, and actively listen to everything she has to say.
If she accepts you apology, move on. Don't dwell on things of the past. If she doesn't accept your apology, she may need more time. Give her some space and try again in a few days.

, Bonding is a great way to get along with each other! Interacting with other people can be challenging for autistic people, but that doesn't mean that they don't enjoy it. Most often you may need to be the one to make first contact and initiate any discussion, since autistic people may struggle with initiating social interaction.

, For example, some autistic people are sensitive to sound, so don't be surprised if your new friend can't handle loud music or crowded places. In many cases you can work around these limitations, such as meeting up in quieter areas and turning the volume down a little on your music. Usually the autistic person knows exactly what (s)he can and can't handle.



Read their body language, and ask how they're doing. ""Are the flickering lights bothering you? Would you like to go outside?""
Pay attention to their stimming. Stimming can express a range of emotions—joy, excitement, disgust, or overwhelm. If you notice them stimming with an unpleasant expression, that means that something is probably wrong.

, While some very young autistic children don't understand why they are different, most autistic people are well aware of their differences, and they take it in their stride so they can live a happy and comfortable life.

, Autistic people may suffer from a number of things: comorbid conditions (e.g. anxiety, depression, epilepsy), rude or abusive therapists, or parents who treat them like a project instead of a human being. Offering a supportive ear is an incredible gift to them.


If their therapy is trying to make them normal, or they are scared/unhappy about going, then it's probably harmful.Tell an adult who will take it seriously. Your friend might be in danger.
Due to the prevalence of compliance therapies (which emphasize obedience above all else),autistic people are at higher risk for abuse.Get help right away if you suspect that someone is hurting your friend.
Gift them a Service dog. It encourages social interaction.

, Find little things that they are good at and notice them. They will have more confidence with things that they do, and that will help them stand up for themselves in the future.

, Autistic people often have passionate and idiosyncratic interests. While some people may like things such as sports, movies, TV, etc. other people, including some autistic people might be interested in things such as frogs, clocks, writing novels, washing machines, social justice, robots, sarcasm, or pet rocks. Autistic people tend to be especially passionate and knowledgeable about their subjects of interest. Try not to generalize about what any autistic person may like or dislike. Rainman was an entertaining movie, not an educational documentary., The internet is full of autistic bloggers with tips on how to be a good friend to autistic people. Autistic people may feel mistrustful or even afraid of you if you praise Autism Speaks or talk about how terrible it is to be autistic.


Musings of an Aspie, Emma's Hope Book, and Real Social Skills are a few well-known blogs.
Check out autism-friendly organizations. Look for groups that include autistic people in their highest levels of leadership, emphasize quality of life over a eugenic cure, and advocate for acceptance.Avoid fear mongering or dangerous anti-vaccination rhetoric.

, Many autistic people have been treated like burdens and problems by their family because of their autism. Showing that you love the person for who they are, including their autism, means the world to them. Kind words, respect, gifts, and support will mean a lot to an autistic person.

Let your friendship evolve.",How to Be a Good Friend," Don't ever make a promise that you can't keep -- or at least don't make a habit of it. If you say you'll hang out with a friend and a legitimate conflict arises, explain the situation and trust that the friendship is strong enough for the no's as well as the yes's. If you just cannot go, give your friend a gift and tell him or her sorry. Nobody's perfect, and it's okay if you skip out on a promise once in a blue moon, but don't make it a regular thing. If this is recurring over time then you will probably be seen as not trustworthy as you can not be trusted to be committed to someone such as your friend.


When you make a serious promise, look at your friend in the eyes and speak slowly to show that you really mean it instead of just saying it because you think that you should. Do not break any such promise, as that will hurt your friend.It might even break your friendship!

, Being dependable is one of the most important aspects of being a good friend. Your friend will need you for support, especially in hard times. Nobody likes a fake, and nobody wants one for a close friend. It's hard to rely on a person who doesn't behave in a consistent and trustworthy way. We all know well-intentioned but flaky people who say, ""Okay, I will..."" but never follow through. If that's you, know that you're eroding your friends' trust; eventually they'll stop believing what you say.


If you're not sure you can do something, don't agree to do it and flake out later. Instead, be honest about the fact that you're not sure if you can make it.
Your friends should always feel like they can count on you, even when the going gets tough. If you're only there for the fun times, you'll be no more than a fair-weather friend.

, If you want your friends to trust you, then you can't act like you're flawless. If you know you've made a mistake, own up to it instead of being in denial. Though your friends won't be happy that you made a mistake, they'll be very pleased that you're mature and grounded enough to admit it instead of just pretending that nothing is wrong, or worse -- blaming it on someone else.


When you say sorry, you should mean it. Let your friends hear the sincerity in your voice instead of thinking that you don't really care how they feel.

, If you want to be a good friend and to have people trust you, then you have to be honest about your feelings, about your friends' actions, and about how you feel about your friendship. If you're honest about how you feel, that will open up direct lines of communication with your friends and will make them more likely to open up to you. If your friend hurt you, don't be afraid to talk about it; if something is upsetting you, don't feel too shy to open up to your friend about it.


Being honest is different from being so blunt that you're hurting your friends. If you think your friend has a drinking problem, for example, then you owe it to your friend to start a conversation about it. But if you think your friend looks kind of weird in her new dress, you may want to keep your mouth shut.

Be real. Connect with people whom you value on a deep level if you want to have sustainable, long-term friendships. Invest in people you can be yourself around. If your behavior lacks sincerity, your friendship won't last.

, If one of your friends suspects that you're just using them, then they'll drop you like a hot potato. Good friendships don't arise from hoping someone else's popularity or networks will rub off on you. If you're trying to be friends with a person just to be accepted into a certain clique, that's not friendship – it's opportunism – and eventually the shallow nature of your involvement will reveal itself.


And if you have a reputation of using people, then new people won't be too excited to start a friendship with you.
A friendship is about give and take. Sure, it may be really convenient that one of your friends gives you a ride to school every day, but make sure that you do something for that friend in return.

, If your friend tells you something in confidence, keep it and don't talk about it with anyone else, just as you'd expect your friend to do for you. Don't discuss your friend behind his or her back, and don't spread rumors about the confidences they've imparted to you. Never say anything about your friend that you would not be prepared to repeat to their face. Be loyal to your true friends and be prepared to defend them if your new friends, or people you barely know, start gossiping about them.


Part of being loyal is understanding the importance of a long-lasting and stable friendship. Don't throw all that away just to spend all your time hanging out with your new boyfriend or girlfriend or a cool new person you just met.
If you have a reputation for being a blabbermouth or a gossip, then your friends will quickly find out and they'll be hesitant to reveal anything personal to you in the future -- or even to spend much time with you at all.
Don't let others say bad things about your friend, either. Until you've had a chance to hear your friend's side of the story, treat comments that are not supportive as hearsay and rumors. If someone says something that shocks you and doesn't seem like a thing your friend would do or say, then respond with something like, ""I know him/her, and that just doesn't sound right. Let me talk to him/her; find out his/her perspective on this. Until then, I would appreciate it if you didn't spread that around.""

, Good friends show respect for each other by being openly and mutually supportive. If your friend has certain values and beliefs that don't align with your own, respect his or her choices and be open to hearing more about them. If you want your friend to trust you, then your friend should feel comfortable voicing opinions that you may not agree with, or discussing a new perspective with you. If your friend thinks that you'll shoot down any interesting or original idea that he or she may have, then your friendship won't be valued.


Sometimes your friend will say things that you find boring, uncomfortable or annoying, but if you have respect for your friend, you'll give your friend the space to speak, and to do so without judgment.
During times when you don't see eye to eye with your friend, disagree respectfully and be willing to see things differently.

, Though you can't be selfless all the time, being selfless is an important part of being a good friend. Accommodate your friend's wishes whenever you can, provided this is done in a balanced way. Reciprocate his or her acts of kindness with caring deeds of your own, and your friendship will be strengthened. If you get a reputation for being selfish and only being around your friends when you need some help, then people will know you're not looking out for them.


Do a favor for your friend just out of the goodness of your heart, not because you want something in return.
There's a difference between being selfless at the right time and letting people walk all over you. If you feel like you're always helping your friends and get nothing back, then you may have a problem.
Don't abuse generosity or wear out your welcome. When your friend does something nice for you, reciprocate quickly. Pay back money you borrow promptly. Go home when it seems like the time is right.

, Don't monopolize conversations and take the time to truly understand and support your friend when he is talking to you. It sounds simple, but make sure you're listening as much as you're talking about yourself. If you're monopolizing every conversation with your feelings, your friend isn't getting anything out of the relationship. Listening opens space between the two of you and reassures your friend that you care.


If you're just waiting for your friend to finish talking so you can say what you want to say, it'll be obvious right away.
Try to strike a balance of letting your friend talk about half of the time. Though some people are more shy than others, if your friend feels like he can't get a word in when he's around you, it'll be hard to have a thriving friendship.

, To be truly supportive, you'll have to be able to watch out for your friends when they're having a tough time. If you sense that your friend is getting into some sort of trouble over which they have little control, such as taking drugs, being promiscuous, or getting too drunk at a party, help him or her get away from the situation by not being afraid to speak up about it.


Don't assume that your friend can handle it alone; this may be the very time that your voice of common sense is needed to wake them from their fugue. If you see a problem, speak up, no matter how awkward you may feel.
Let your friend know that you can give him a shoulder to cry on during this tough time. If your friend feels less alone, it'll be easier for them to deal with their troubles.
If all your friend wants to do about the problem is to talk, that's fine at first, but you should help your friend find practical solutions to his problems.
For example, if your friend admitted to having an eating disorder and simply promises to start eating more, you need to talk about taking more serious measures to address the problem, like talking to a health professional.

, If your friend has to go to the hospital, visit. If his dog runs away, help to find it. If she needs someone to pick him/her up, be there. Take notes for your friend in school when he or she is absent. Send cards and care packages when you're living far apart. If there is a death in his/her family, attend the funeral. Let your friend see that he can count on you any time.


Just make sure that your friend isn't always in the middle of some kind of crisis, however contrived it may be. You should be there to help out during the hard times, but that can't be the basis of your whole relationship.
Part of being there for your friend in a crisis is providing emotional support, too. Care about your friend enough to help him or her open up and let the tears roll. Hand him or her a tissue and listen openly. You don't have to say anything if nothing seems right; just stay calm and reassuring.
If your friend is going through a crisis, don't say, ""Everything is going to be all right"" if it's not going to be. It's hard not to say that sometimes, but false reassurance can often be worse than none. Instead, let your friend know you are there for him or her. Stay honest, but upbeat and positive.
If your friend begins talking about committing suicide, tell someone about it. This rule overrides the ""respect privacy"" step, because even if your friend begs you not to tell anyone, you should do it anyway. Suggest a help line or professional to your friend. Talk to your and your friend's parents or spouse (unless they are the ones causing the problems) before involving anyone else.

, To be a good friend, you should be able to weigh your friend's situation from his or her perspective and to provide your opinion without insisting that your friend should do whatever you say. Don't judge your friend; simply advise him or her when he or she reaches out.


Avoid giving unsought for advice. Allow venting where needed and be willing to offer advice if it's clear that it's sought. Always ask before assuming you can give advice.
In some cases, a friend could use a little tough love to keep him or her out of a dangerous situation. Use discretion here; you don't want to lecture or overwhelm your friend. Tell him or her how you perceive the situation using factual information, and suggest what you might do in the same circumstances.

, Part of being supportive means supporting the fact that your friend won't always want to spend time with you. Learn to step back and give your friend space. Understand if your friend wants to be alone or to hang out with other people. There's no need to become clingy or needy. If you're clingy and check in with your friend every two seconds if he or she isn't around, you'll start to look like a possessive significant other, and that will not be appreciated.


Don't get jealous if your friend has lots of other friends. Every relationship is special and different, and that doesn't mean that your friend doesn't appreciate you.
Allowing one another the time to hang with other friends gives you much-needed breathing room, and allows you to come together fresh and appreciating each other even more.

, If you want your friendship to last, then you should be able to forgive your friend and to move forward. If you hold a grudge and let your bitterness and resentment build up, then you won't be able to move forward. Recognize that nobody's perfect and that if your friend is sincerely sorry and if he or she didn't do something too horrible, that you should move past it.


If your friend really did do something so unforgivable that you just can't get past it, then it's better to move on than to try to save the friendship when it's doomed. But this should happen very rarely.
If you're angry at your friend but haven't told him or her why, you'll never be able to forgive him if you don't talk about it.

, To make your friendship thrive, you shouldn't try to change your friend or make your friend see the world from your perspective. If you're conservative and your friend is liberal, then accept that instead of trying to argue about it all the time. You should appreciate the fresh perspective your friend can bring to your experiences instead of wanting your friend to see everything from your perspective.


The more you are with one another, the less you idealize each other and the more you accept one another for who you really are. This is what being a truly good friend is really about -- caring deeply for each other, even if you know you're both full of flaws.

, A friend will wait while you do your homework. A great friend stays up all night helping. Remember that if you are a good friend, people want to be a good friend to you. Recognize the moments when you need to go above and beyond to help your friend and know that this will make your friendship grow, and that your friend will do the same for you in return.


If your friend really needs you and keeps saying, ""No, you don't have to do that..."" learn to read between the lines and know that your friend really does need you.

, As the years pass, people tend to grow apart. Maybe you and a friend will move to different places and only see each other every once in a while. Sometimes years may elapse without much contact. If you never stop caring about your friend, speak up. He or she will be happy to hear from you. You were friends for a reason in the past, and you may find the same bond still ties you together.


Don't let your location determine the strength of your bond. If your friendship is meaningful, then it should keep growing even if you're an ocean apart.
Make a goal of having monthly phone or Skype dates with your friend even if you're in a completely different time zone. If keeping up with your friend becomes a routine, your relationship will continue to thrive.

, If you want to be a good friend, then you have to understand that your friendship won't be the same in high school, college, or in the adult world. Sure, when you were fourteen, you might have spent all of your time with your best friend, but by the time you went off to separate colleges or started your serious relationships, you naturally spent less time talking. This doesn't mean that your friendship isn't as strong; it just means that your lives are evolving, and your friendship is taking on a different shape over the years.


Don't try to make your friendship be exactly the same as it was ten years ago. Think of it as elastic, not solid.
If your friend is married with two kids or even just in a serious relationship and you're not, be respectful of the fact that, while your friend really cares for you, he/she won't be on call 24/7 like he/she used to be.
Appreciate the changes your friendship has made over the years, and learn to grow along with your relationship.

Reflect on your beliefs.,
Write down what you believe.,
Keep an open mind.",How to Be a Christian Teen Dealing With Non Christian Friends1," Before you can hold to your beliefs, you must understand exactly what it is you believe. Spend time reading the Bible and listening to sermons to gain as much information about your faith as possible. Think and pray about the information that you get, and decide exactly what being a Christian means to you.If you have questions about Christianity that you are having trouble getting answered, you could try attending another church occasionally.
For example, many Christians hold different opinions about which parts of the Bible are literal and which parts are metaphors. If you are unsure how you feel about a particular story in the bible, reflecting on it can help you determine whether you believe it to be a true account of history or a metaphor meant to teach you something.;
, You can easily be influenced by new information. While this is not a bad thing, it is a good idea that you write down the beliefs that you currently hold so that you can analyze them in the future. This allows you to compare your behaviors and interactions with both Christians and non-Christians to the beliefs that you hold.


Keeping an ongoing journal about your faith would be a great way to do this.
An example might be to write out something like “I believe that Jesus was the son of God and that he died on the cross.”

, Even though holding to your what you believe is important, you should also be willing to hear other points other points of view. These viewpoints may be Christian or non-Christian, but you can learn from them either way. As you get older, your experiences should continue to teach you new things about yourself and your faith.


For example, many people take each story in the Bible as a historical account in their youth, but later decide to view them as metaphors or parables that are meant to teach Christians how to act.

Keep in mind that all people in the world are equal to you.,
Have a smile and try to look inviting.,
Do not behave in a way that may make others uncomfortable, including swearing, being mean, yelling, and saying rude things.,
Refrain from talking extremely loudly, but be careful not to be so quiet that no one understands you.,
Involve yourself by being friendly to people in your class.,
Try to look clean and make good first impressions.,
Find some common ground between yourself and the people you are attempting to befriend.,
Be yourself and show your personality, for as time goes on, it is very difficult to continuously keep up an act.,
Don't gossip or spread rumors about other people, true or not true.",How to Be Accepted by Your Form or Class (Girls)," No one is better or worse than you! Don't try to change yourself, as there will never be another person like you in the future. If the snotty girl in your class beats you down and insists that she is better than you, ignore her and know that she is lying to make herself feel good. Don't let anyone's negativity get to you!;
, Avoid frowning or having a sullen face around others. Being surly causes people to avoid you or form incorrect ideas about your personality. Push yourself to talk to others and start conversations; don't just sit alone and wait for someone to come talk to you! Refrain from excessive shyness; there have been many incidents in which a shy person has been thought to be snobby, when they really were not!

, People tend to avoid those that are embarrassing to everyone as a whole. Be humorous, but know your limits and keep your witty comments within the boundaries.

, Keep your voice at an appropriate and level volume, and make sure you are enunciating your words correctly.

, Hopefully, they will return the favor and include you in their groups and conversations. Avoid appearing like a loner and never sit by yourself. Always look for a good, friendly group to sit with; avoid the snobby groups!


Treat everyone neutrally, even those that you dislike. This way, people will look up to you as a nice person and you will have an excellent reputation all around. You don't have to put on a show and act fake towards everyone!

, People are more likely to remember you if you look like a nice person. They will also remember if you smell bad, so be careful. Daily showers and a nice smelling deodorant/perfume should be enough to leave a good impression. Have decent clothes, but avoid dressing smartly or sloppily.

, Having reason for a discussion goes a long way. Always ask questions about themselves. Normally, people love to talk about themselves, but don't let them talk all the time! Insert a few words here and there, listen earnestly, and focus all your concentration on them. Keep eye contact and don't let your eyes roam around the room. If people feel like you aren't listening to them, they will refuse to talk and that will result in an awkward pause or end.

, Do not tell lies just to make yourself look good - eventually, everyone will find out the truth and, perhaps, refuse to speak to you. People like real people, not fakers.

, This will not make you more popular; it will only make you universally disliked. Refrain from listening to any gossip.

Find out more about the clique.,
Don’t automatically reject your child being in a clique.,
Help your child extend their peer group.,
Support your child’s individuality.,
Encourage your child to use their leadership skills for good.,
Keep an eye out for bullying.,
Discourage your child from participating if necessary.",How to Help Your Child Deal with Cliques1," If your child is in a clique, find out who else is in it. Ask your child, “Who is in your group of friends?” Get as much information as possible. Other questions you might have include:Is there a clique leader?
How long have you been participating in the clique?
What do you and your clique do together?;
, It is normal and natural for children to show preferences for friends or certain types of other people with whom they get along. Cliques can help your child develop a sense of self-worth and self-confidence. In a clique of friends, your child may feel protected and accepted for who they are.Understand that your child wants to feel accepted. A clique is often the solution to this predicament., If your child only spends time with their clique, their ability to make new friends might suffer, and they will not be exposed to as diverse a range of attitudes and lifestyles as possible. They might also feel more obligated to engage in cliquish behavior when they don’t have any friends outside their clique.To help your child branch out and meet all the friends they possibly can, encourage your child to sign up for various extracurricular activities such as sports, plays, chess or game clubs, and so on.
For instance, you could help your child enlist in community-sponsored athletic programs. Contact your local community activity board or recreational department for more information about children’s programs in your area.

, Cliques – for good or ill – tend to impose a conformity of dress, attitude, or behavior on their members. In order to help your child maintain their sense of self, provide positive feedback to your child on a regular basis. For instance, you could say to your child:“I like you just the way you are.”
”It’s okay for you to do things differently than other people do.””I like when you are kind and polite to others.”

, If your child is the clique leader – or even if they are not – you should help them find a voice in the clique, especially if you suspect that they might be led astray by a bad clique leader. For instance, you could tell your child, “Your friends in the clique will admire you for having the courage to do the right thing and treat others kindly.”Help your child empathize with others by reminding them of the time before they were surrounded by a clique, or encouraging them to do volunteer work or even just to do kind things for friends and family members as a way to foster compassion. This will help your child see themselves in others who do not currently have a clique, and make your child more inclined to treat others kindly.

, Cliques are often a locus for bullying behavior. Children within the clique might encourage and reinforce each other’s bullying. Decide what consequences you think would be appropriate as punishment for bullying behaviors. Be sure to keep an eye out for this behavior, which may include:verbal threats or name-calling
physical attacks (kicking, pushing, hitting)
taunting (making faces or obscene gestures)
starting rumors

, People often conform to the behaviors and attitudes of those around them. If your child is getting involved with other children who could have a negative influence on them, or if you have evidence that your child is actually engaging in negative behaviors, discourage them from spending time with the clique.Ideally, you will never have to discourage your child from spending time with a particular individual or a clique of friends. Make sure to have discussions about what makes someone a good person and a good friend. This will better enable your child to decide for themselves when they meet people.
However, if your child’s clique is getting them in trouble, you might have to ask them to find new friends.
There are many ways to discourage your child from participating in the clique. For instance, you could say, “I’d feel more comfortable if you didn’t spend time with that group of friends.”
Get third parties involved, too, such as faith leaders, school guidance counselors, or trusted family friends.Tell them about your child’s clique and recruit them into your effort to discourage your child from participating in the clique.
If your child is unresponsive to your initial overtures in discouraging them, take a more authoritative stance. Say, “I forbid you from spending time with that group of friends” or inform them that you will be revoking certain privileges until they stop spending time with the clique.

"
"
Interact compassionately.,
Discuss your faith calmly.,
Lead by example.",How to Be a Christian Teen Dealing With Non Christian Friends2," By being kind to all of those around you, you set a good example and a high standard for the Christian faith. This will make it easier to interact with non-Christian friends as well. Even if they believe differently, your non-Christian friends will respect the compassion and caring that you show through your Christian faith.


You can let your compassion shine when friends are in need of help. For example, if your friend is going through a hard time and needs someone to talk to, you could make it a point to be there and listen patiently. Say something like “If you need to talk, I am here for you.”

, Different points of view may come up in discussion. It is your job to either walk away from the discussion or treat it with tact and dignity. Avoid yelling, being dismissive of the other person(s), and cutting people off. You should also avoid telling people that they are condemned to Hell for not agreeing with you.


Aggressive and intolerant behavior from any point of view will drive people away from you instead of giving them reasons to hear you out.
For example, instead of lecturing someone about being sinful, you could simply say “I don’t feel comfortable being part of that activity. It goes against what I believe.”

, You can get your non-Christian friends to respect your faith by living out the principles that you believe in. Instead of telling people how they should act (Christian or non-Christian), show them through your own actions. Avoid seeking praise for all of your good deeds and instead allow your friends to see your consistent kindness.


For example, you could take on extra curricular activities like volunteering at a food pantry or mentoring younger children.
When asked why you spend your time helping others, you could respond with something like “It is what I believe to be right as a Christian, and I’m glad to help.”

"
"
Withhold judgment based on different beliefs.,
Avoid combative conversations.,
Honor their free will.",How to Be a Christian Teen Dealing With Non Christian Friends3," Just as you expect your friends to respect your beliefs, you should be tolerant of theirs. You do not have to agree with your friends, but you should avoid talking badly about them or their beliefs. Remain positive and agree to disagree on any touchy subjects.For example, if you say “I'll be praying for you,” to a friend who then responds “Thanks, but I’m atheist,” resist the urge to lecture them. Instead, respond by saying something like “I understand, but I still hope you feel better.”

, Whether you are engaging a friend or a stranger, you should avoid getting into heated arguments about your Christianity (or their lack of it). This only leads to both sides being angry and showing disrespect. If you sense that a conversation is getting to the point that both sides are no longer able to discuss it peaceably, end the conversation and walk away.For example, if you were to be in a discussion with a non-Christian friend and the two of you started insisting that the other was wrong and misguided, it is time to step away from the conversation. Say something like “We obviously disagree. I don’t see any point in arguing about it.”

, You should remember that you have no more ability to control your friends beliefs than they have to control yours. Even if you feel that they are mistaken in what they believe, your non-Christian friends do have the right to exercise their free will. As their friend, it is your responsibility to respect those choices and allow them to be who they are.For example, if you have a friend that prefers not to go to church, you cannot force them to go. You can invite them once in awhile, but be prepared for them to decline your offer. If they do decline, leave the invitation open by saying something like “If you change your mind, just let me know.”

Look for signs that your child is struggling with cliques.,
Talk to your child about their experience with a clique.,
Talk to your child’s teacher or administrator.,
Contact the parents of the kids in the clique.",How to Help Your Child Deal with Cliques2," You might not realize that your child is experiencing conflict with a clique. They might be embarrassed by the way they’re being treated, or feel that they can handle it on their own. However, you can identify a problem by looking for signs that your child is struggling with cliques. If you feel that things have gotten severe, especially if they have panic attacks or thoughts of self-harm, consult a mental health professional. Others things to watch for include:sadness or depression
trouble getting to sleepreluctance to attend school
disinterest in certain activities that they previously had an interest in

, Once you’ve identified signs that your child is suffering at the hands of a clique, confirm the problem by asking, “Do you need help dealing with a group of mean children?” Alternately, you might receive firsthand reports from your child that they are, in fact, struggling to deal with a clique. In either case, find out more about their experience.Ask, for instance, “What does the clique do to you?” They might reply that they are being pushed, taunted, or made fun of.
Listen attentively and make eye contact with the child to show you are interested in them and their feelings.
Ask relevant follow-up questions like, “How did that make you feel?” or “What happened then?”
Let your child know that you’re always available to talk by saying, “I am always here if you want to share more of your feelings.” Also, teach them ways they can respond to the bullies or various taunts. Check in with them and invite them to talk to you whenever they need to find out what is working and what is not. You can also ask if there is anything specific they'd like you to do to help.

, If your child is dealing with a bully in a particular class, contact the teacher in the class. The teacher might be able to offer more information, and should be eager to hear more about your child’s experience. With your child’s teacher alerted to the situation, the clique will be less likely to target your child.Work with your child’s teacher to redress the clique’s unfair bullying.
For instance, encourage staff at your child’s school to develop a school-wide intervention program to prevent bullying behavior by cliques or individuals. This program should include counseling for bullies and victims, staff training on how to identify and resolve bullying, and inclusion of parents in how to prevent bullying in their kids.

, Your child will have a hard time dealing with a clique on their own, and there is only so much you can do as a parent. In addition to teachers and relevant school staff, contact the parents of the other children in the clique. With the parents of the kids in the clique on board, the clique can issue an apology to your child and begin adopting more appropriate behavior.Keep in mind that this approach can backfire, especially with teenagers, and the bully may take things out on your child.

Teach your child conflict resolution techniques.,
Help your child engage in conflict resolution.,
Help your child engage in conflict mediation.,
Help your child avoid being targeted by cliques.",How to Help Your Child Deal with Cliques3," Even if teachers and staff implement programs to end bullying by cliques, your child might still face bullying from other cliques later in life, or if they move to a new school. Teach your child some simple anger management practices, such as:Stopping as soon as they feel angry.They might be able to do this by utilizing a “stop” motion when they begin feeling anger. For instance, demonstrate a stop motion for your child that involves placing their hand directly in front of their face with the fingers pointed up and pushing the hand straight out in front of them. Such a motion can focus the energy and attention on stopping feelings of anger.
Giving themselves space to think. This might mean leaving the space where they feel they are being threatened or bullied by the clique.
Breathing deeply. Encourage your child to close their eyes once they are in a place where they can think. Instruct them to breathe in through their nose for three seconds, then out through their mouth for five seconds, repeating as needed.
Analyzing the situation. Your child should think back on what happened during their interaction with the clique. Tell your child, “Look at the situation as you would if you were a spectator. Be sure that you did not cause the conflict.”
Talking with someone you trust. Talking things through with someone can also help you to get some perspective and feedback.

, The conflict resolution process involves your child and the clique they are in conflict with engaging in dialogue. Through this dialogue, the clique is compelled to cease tormenting your child.For instance, help your child express themselves to the clique they wish to deal with in an appropriate way. Instead of using blaming language and “you” statements (in the form of, “You are rotten”), instruct your child to use “I” statements (in the form of “I don’t like being pushed”).
Encourage your child to focus on the behavior, not the person in the clique who is acting badly.Instruct your child, in other words, to describe the behavior that they don’t appreciate and avoid name-calling or essentializing the people in the clique.
You can also try role-playing the situation with your child a few times to help them find a good way to respond. Remind them that they cannot control what other people do, but they can control how they respond.

, The conflict mediation process involves bringing together two parties, at least one of which has a grievance regarding the other, and helping them understand each other. In your child’s case, you or a third party may have to collect all the members of the clique that is tormenting your child. If you (along with parents of those in the clique and/or teachers) are engaged in the conflict resolution process, you should:Set the ground rules. Once your child and the clique that harasses them are in conversation, there should be no disrespect or name-calling.Both sides should get a chance to talk about what happened from their point of view. Disallow interruptions when someone is talking.
Help the clique and your child see that they would both be better off if they did not fight. Show them, for instance, that they have common interests like using school time as a place to learn and study, and not a place to fight.
Encourage your child and the clique to develop options for how to move forward. Help them evaluate the best option and arrive at an agreement they can all agree to.
In the interest of maintaining a neutral mediator, you might not be allowed to participate in the conflict resolution process. It is possible that only school staff and administrators will be allowed in the conflict resolution process.

, Kids are often targeted by cliques because their style of dress or their hygiene is poor. Encourage your child to engage in good hygiene – especially if they are teens or tweens and might need extra reminders. Remind them, if necessary, to wash their clothes regularly, brush their teeth, and shower.Stay attentive to your child’s wardrobe. If they haven’t gotten new clothes in a while, they might have outgrown their old clothes. Invite them on a shopping trip so they can select some new clothes if you suspect they are in need (or if they tell you directly that they want new clothes).

Decide what kind of snail you want.,
Consider buying more than one snail.",How to Keep a Pet Snail1," Snails can actually be difficult to purchase in a pet store. Because many consider snails pests rather than pets, there are regulations on which snails can be sold where. It is illegal in the United States to import snails from other countries, and your state may even have laws against bringing in species from other states.


Native snails can be easily found in gardens and wooded areas and are probably your best bet for your first pet snail.
Popular snails like the Giant African Snail, Decollate snails, giant Ghana tiger snails, and margies are all illegal in the US.Snails can live anywhere from 3-15 years in captivity. Keep in mind that this is a long-term commitment — if you don't plan on keeping a snail for that long, choose a native species so you can release your pet if you choose.Snails like to feed on crops and gardens and a non-native snail can do a lot of damage to local ecosystems if released.Remember, a snail is not just a slug with a shell. If you want a pet slug, you need to research what a slug, not a snail, needs to be healthy and happy.;
, Snails enjoy stimulation, and having a buddy to interact with will keep your snail entertained and happy. It will also make them more fun to observe.The difference for caring for two snails versus one is minimal, so it will cost you very little in money or time to get your snail a companion.
Try to stick to the same species of snail, as one species may carry different pests or diseases that are harmful to the other.Groups of snails tend to sleep huddled together, which indicates they seek out each other's company."

Buy a plastic tank or container for your snail.,
Cover the bottom of the container with 1-2 inches of the substrate of your choice.,
Decorate the habitat with things your snail can crawl on and hide under.,
Pay attention to the temperature and humidity of the habitat.",How to Keep a Pet Snail2," A snail can live in a variety of enclosures — look for a translucent container with plenty of ventilation and enough space for your pet to roam and explore. Make sure the lid fits or locks tightly in place — a snail can lift 10-50 times its own weight and may lift a loose lid and escape.If you're not sure how big your tank should be, use this calculator to find the sized based on the species and number of snails you plan to keep.
A large ""pet pal"" or ""critter carrier"" makes a good home for land snails, as the sides are clear plastic and the lid provides great ventilation.Glass tanks and aquariums are suitable homes for snails as well, though the heavy glass makes them more difficult to clean and transport.A clear, translucent plastic container from a storage or craft store can work just as well as a tank. Just be certain you drill holes in the lid or top of the sides sides so your snails can breathe.Wash your container before building the habitat inside. Use boiling water and a gentle detergent, then thoroughly rinse the container with more water. Be absolutely certain you wash out all the detergent or you may poison your snail.Avoid wooden or cardboard containers, as they will rot. The snail may even eat through the cardboard., Popular substrates include peat, coir, potting soil, and humus. Look for sterilized substrates with no pesticides or fertilizer, as this will harm your snail.Avoid using sand, pebbles, rocks, shells, or anything brittle that the snail cannot burrow in.Peat, coir, and potting soil are great substrates for snails to burrow. These may be found at pet or garden supply stores.Spray the substrate in the morning and evening to keep it moist. Do not make it so wet that water is pooling in the substrate —it should be just moist enough that it sticks to your hand.Add a little sphagnum moss to keep the substrate moist.Be aware that soil from your yard may have pests or pesticides and could harm your snail., Avoid hard items like rocks, brick, or ceramic — the snail may fall from the side of the habitat and if its shell strikes a hard surface, it may crack the shell and seriously injure your pet.Find plant pot made of plastic or polythene. Place it in the habitat on its side or cut it in half to make a cave. You could also turn the pot upside-down and cut a little opening for the snail to enter and hide inside.Look for organic materials that won't rot quickly, like cork bark or dried tree branches. Check the reptile section at a pet store for a good selection of obstacles for your snail to play on.A shallow water dish will give your snail a place to drink and play and also increase the moisture in the tank. Look for one with low sides and don't fill it too deep or your snail might drown. Try a resin reptile dish., The temperature should be somewhere between 64-86 °F, or around room temperature. Check the soil daily to make sure it hasn't dried out.If your house gets very cold in the winter, you may want to buy a heating mat to keep the heat and humidity up in the habitat. Fix the mat to the side of the tank, covering all but 1/3 of the side. That way if the snail becomes too warm, it can move to the cooler part of the habitat."

Feed your snail raw fruits and vegetables every few days.,
Provide a source of calcium for your snail.,
Always clean food before feeding it to your snail.",How to Keep a Pet Snail3," Snails enjoy a wide range of foods, like apples, mushrooms, tomatoes, bananas, strawberries, carrots, leafy greens, and much more. Try out different foods to see what your snail likes.Snails may also enjoy wet or dry cat or dog treats and turtle food.Put a food dish in your habitat to make it easier to remove rotten food.Don't give your snail salt or salty food. It may kill your snail., Calcium is essential to keeping your snail's shell healthy and strong. Cuttlefish bones are cheap and easy to find at pet shops, and will give your snails ample calcium. Keep a washed cuttlefish bone in your snail tank at all times.Egg shells and calcium supplements are other easy ways to introduce calcium into your snail's diet.Snails can absorb calcium through their bodies and may sit on pieces of cuttlefish, breaking it down with their foot., Any lingering pesticides could poison and kill your snail. Never skip this step, even with organic fruits and vegetables.It is a common myth that organic produce is not treated with pesticides, but this is not true.Make sure you are washing the calcium, too.

Learn to handle your snail correctly.,
Remove any eggs from the soil.,
Clean the tank once a month.,
Give your snail a bath.",How to Keep a Pet Snail4," If the snail is on the side of the tank, spray your hand and the snail with water. Slip your finger under the snail's head, between the snail and the glass of the tank. Use your other hand hand to support the snail's body and gently pull as you slip your finger all the way under the snail's body. Place the snail in your palm.Make sure your hands are wet whenever handling your snail.If you can't get your finger under the snail's head, offer it a bit of food just out of its reach. It will stretch its head up and you can slide your finger underneath.Wash your hands before and after handling a snail to prevent exchanging any diseases.Don't force your snail to move. If it isn't easily detaching from the side of the tank, try to pick it up at a later time.If you have a very small snail, try to get it to climb onto a piece of food or a leaf and transfer it into your hand. Trying to pick up a tiny snail with your hands might actually harm the snail.Be careful not to grab the snail by the shell. If you accidentally pull off the shell, your snail will die., Unless you want dozens, maybe even hundreds of baby snails, you must remove any eggs before they hatch. The eggs are round and white or translucent. You may find single eggs or clusters of hundreds of eggs. It takes about two weeks for eggs to hatch, so check the substrate for eggs every week.Destroy the eggs by bagging them and placing them in the freezer. Make sure they are completely frozen before throwing them out.Do not put unwanted eggs outside, especially if you have a non-native species of snail.If you are worried about eggs, don't use too much substrate on the bottom of the habitat. This will make it easier to find and manage the eggs.

, Put your snail in a temporary habitat and remove everything from the tank. Wash the tank with boiling water and a little gentle detergent. Rinse the tank thoroughly — any residue from the detergent could be deadly to your snail.Wipe down the sides of the tank with water once a week to keep it from getting too dirty between deep cleans.Throw out any waste or rotten food you haven't already removed from the tank.Clean the substrate or place all-new substrate on the bottom of the tank.If you have trouble removing a snail-slime stain from the side of the container, try cleansing the stain with a little vinegar., Occasionally washing your snail with water (about once a month) can help keep it pest-free. Place your snail in a shallow dish of room-temperature water and pour or splash a little water over its body. Do not fully submerge your snail in water or it will drown.Use your finger, soft cloth, or a soft-bristle toothbrush to very gently clean the snail's shell. Do not use anything abrasive to clean your snail.Never use soap or detergent to wash your snail. Use water only."

Catch aquatic snails.",How to Find a Snail," Though snails may be out at any time, they are primarily nocturnal. This is because snails are susceptible to drying out in direct sunlight. Most snails go out searching for food when it's dark out (or at least darker than usual), so that would be the best time to find one.If at all possible, try to go looking for snails in the evening or on dark, overcast days.;
, Snails can live in many different places, but most terrestrial snails live in shaded, damp areas. If there isn't much shade available, many snails will burrow under hard objects that remain cool and damp away from direct sunlight.Some common snail habitats include:


rocks
debris
flower pots
wooden planks on the ground
damp, shaded areasweedy or leafy areas close to the ground

, One telltale sign of a snail is the viscous, sticky trail of slime it leaves in its wake. If you're having a hard time spotting snails, you might have more luck if you search for their slime trails and follow a sticky streak to the snail itself.Slime is usually left in silvery streaks across dry surfaces.
You might see a slime trail on rocks, dirt, pavement, or on vertical surfaces like trees and walls.

, Freshwater snails can live in any aquatic habitat. Some snails do well in polluted waters, but for the most part, snails typically thrive in clean, clear bodies of water.Stable, clean substrates at the bottom of the water are ideal habitats for snails.
Clean, clear water that is not murky or full of sediments will house the greatest range of snail species.
Look for water bodies with high oxygen concentrations to find the most snails. Fast-moving water bodies with a lot of rapids or falls tend to be the most oxygenated habitats.

, While there are many snails that live in standing bodies of water, fast-moving water bodies tend to produce ideal conditions for snails to inhabit. Rivers, creeks, and streams are ideal freshwater snail habitats, with medium- to large-sized rivers yielding the most species of snail., Lakes and ponds are common freshwater snail habitats. However, they do not have the biodiversity or the ease of access that a river/creek/stream bottom has. You may still be able to find snails in a lake or pond, provided that the water is clear enough to allow sunlight and oxygen to reach the bottom., If you're having trouble finding snails in the wild, you might try luring snails out by creating ideal conditions for them. Remember that terrestrial snails like cool, slightly wet environments that are out of direct sunlight.Identify an area that might house snails. You can usually find snails in cool, damp, shaded environments or near food sources like gardens.
Water the area late in the afternoon. Try to dampen the soil and leave a mist on any low lying vegetation nearby.
Return after dark with a flashlight. If snails inhabit the area you've watered, you should see them or their slime trails fairly easily.

, If there aren't any ideal snail habitats in your area, you can create your own by leaving objects in and around a garden or field. As you set up your hiding places, consider whether a given object would provide adequate shade and moisture to a soil-dwelling terrestrial snail.Try laying boards of wood, large, flat bricks, stones, or flower pots near an area you believe snails inhabit.
You can also use inverted melon rinds, but be aware that these may also attract other insects like ants.

, Pitfall traps are an excellent way to catch terrestrial invertebrates. Be aware, though, that pitfall traps catch many different kinds of ground-dwelling insects. Your pitfall trap may catch a couple snails, but it will most likely also catch other critters. This will require some sifting through and releasing other insects.Dig a small hole in the ground that is deep and wide enough to hold a cup.
Add beer or baking yeast to a 5% sugar and water solution in a pitfall trap. Be sure you only leave a shallow pool of liquid or the snails you catch might drown.
Check your trap on a regular basis. You may decide to check every day or you might check the trap multiple times each day, but if you leave your snail for a prolonged period of time it may die.

, Aquatic snails can be a bit more difficult to catch than terrestrial snails. However, with the right tools you should be able to find and catch some freshwater snails near you. One of the most common ways of catching aquatic snails (and other aquatic invertebrates) is by using a kick-net.Purchase or build a kick-net. A kick-net can be easily made by fastening a long, thin mesh to two wooden poles, creating a net that looks like a giant scroll with handles in the folded ends.
Look for an area in the water where there are riffles or falls.
Approach the chosen area from downstream to avoid disturbing any snails you might catch.
You can use rocks to stabilize the net underwater and downstream, then lift submerged objects to ""shake"" snails loose. You can also hold the handles of the kick-net so the net is downstream and walk backward upstream, kicking rocks and submerged objects loose.
Be aware that a kick-net will catch all kinds of aquatic invertebrates. While some of the invertebrates you catch may be snails, there will probably be many other types of unwanted invertebrates present in the net as well.

Pick a tank to house your snails in.,
Add a layer of pesticide free substrate.,
Collect some decorations for your tank.This list is not exhaustive; there is a huge range of items that you can add to your tank to make it your own.,
Add supporting organisms.,
Collect snails.,
Regularly mist the tank with water.,
Feed your snails.,
Clean up after your snails.",How to Set Up a Natural Environment for Pet Snails," This can be any size or shape, but it should be well ventilated, secure and large enough to house the amount of snails and the structural designs that you want to include. Fish tanks work well, or you can use Exo Terra Terrariums which are slightly more expensive but have integrated design features that work well for housing snails.


If you are going to use a fish tank, you may want to consider getting a backing to cover any wires that you may have (for lights etc) and to give added depth to the tank.;
, For this, you can use compost from a garden centre, but be sure to check that it does not have any added chemicals which could harm your snails. Coir substrate is a good option, as it is a safe alternative to compost and is packed in a compact brick format, which is easy to store. Remember, if you are going to plant live plants in your tank, you should make the substrate deep enough to allow them to root and flourish.

, Whatever you do, remember to be respectful of the area that you are collecting from, to be aware of what items are toxic to you and your snail and to clean any found items carefully. Here is the list:


Ceramics or Pottery (e.g. terracotta plant pots)
Groundcover (Mosses)- If you are going to use live mosses, you can collect them from woodland or forest areas, but remember to be respectful of your environment. Never collect too much moss from one single area and be cautious about where you are putting your feet. If you are not looking, you could disturb or damage other habitats whilst you are out collecting.
Bark and Logs- Again, remember to be respectful. There is no need to break pieces of live trees and plants, there are plenty of sticks and bits of old bark that can be found. You can also carefully boil or bake any bits of wood that you find, in order to remove any harmful fungi/ bacteria etc.
Live plants- You can leave these plants in pots, or you can plant them directly in the terrarium/tank. If you do choose this option, remember to pick plants that will survive best in the habitat you are providing them. Low light plants are often best for indoor setups and there are many species available for bottle gardens etc that work very well in snail tanks. Be aware that your snails may eat these plants and you may have to replace them after a while!

, To make your new setup as close to the real thing as possible, it is sometimes nice to add other organisms such as woodlice and earthworms to keep your tank clean and tidy. These can easily be found in your back garden or local green space. This step is not essential, but it does mean that you will significantly cut down the chances of developing moulds or fungi within your tank. These cultures are self sufficient and will maintain their numbers on their own, so you don't have to do any more or less with or without them.

, This is the fun part! Once your tank is fully set up and established, you can go out and collect snails. Snails prefer damp, dark places and will often come out in great numbers at night or after rainfall. When picking up a snail, be gentle. Never pull a snail off an object by its shell if it is stuck hard, or you could injure it. Gently ease your snail off the surface and if you can't remove them easily, don't keep trying. There are always more snails out there to find.

, Snails prefer the damp and will remain in their shells if the environment is too dry. Water any plants that you have when required, but don't overdo it. If you have decomposer species in the tank, they may drown if you overwater and the tank remains permanently soggy.

, Although there are live plants in the tank, your snails may not be eating them, so it is important to give your snails enough to eat. Cabbage and lettuce works well, but beware of Iceberg lettuce, as it is too watery and has no nutritional value - it's not worth feeding them.

, There will be some waste that is not broken down, especially if you don't have support organisms in your tank. Regularly remove this waste to prevent your tank from smelling or looking dirty."

Make a slug home.,
Add leaves, rocks, and twigs and sticks.,
Keep the habitat clean and appropriate for a slug's environment.,
Give your slugs fresh food at least once every two to three days.,
Make sure to discard any uneaten or old food so you do not attract fruit flies, which can kill your slugs.

,
Expect garden slugs to typically live for 6 months to about a year.",How to Keep Garden Slugs as Pets," For a habitat, you can use multiple things, such as a critter-keeper, a photo storage box, a old container, a mason jar, a old aquarium with a lid, and even clear plastic boxes from the dollar store. However, if you do use a plastic box or container, always remember to drill or poke holes in the lid, so your slug can breath. Don't make the holes too big or your slug can, and probably will, escape. 


Make sure to have a smaller back-up habitat if one of your slugs gets sick or to transfer the slug to when you clean the habitat.;
, For the base of the habitat, add a layer of soil or dirt. It can come from a pet store or even from your backyard. Most snails owners usually layer the tank bottom. 


For example, add a layer of garden pebbles or fish rocks to the bottom of the tank. On top of that, add soil or dirt, then add a thin layer of grass or leaves. 
Always remember to add hide-out places, for when your slug gets scared!

, From daily, weekly, to monthly, slugs almost always need their habitats cleaned. Most pet owners also keep their slug's habitat outside because slugs can get loose very easily.


Hourly/daily: Every hour (or two times a day minimum) use a spritzing bottle to spray down your slugs' habitat. This will keep the moisture your slug needs in the habitat.
Weekly: Carefully clean your slug's habitat every two weeks. Place your snail(s) in your back-up habitat and add fresh soil or dirt, leaves, grass, and food.
Monthly: Most pet owners let their slugs loose after about a month. This is not considered a major deal. 

, Most pet owners typically feed their garden slugs fresh fruit and vegetables. Mostly any will do fine. However, if you do notice anything unusual with a certain food, check a snail or slug site.

,,  They don't need as much care as a snail does.

If you're not sure, check images of the snail online or in a book that has images of snails.

, Food should only be placed down in a clean habitat. Get rid of the snail's waste and any polluted soil. Replace with clean, loamy soil.

, Land snails think of fresh green grass as a treat. Leaves also please land snails.


Large leaves such as pawpaw, cocoa and cassava leaves are good to place the snails on before adding the food.;
, Chop the food into small pieces that you think the snail can manage.

Use the snail's size to gauge just how small the pieces of food need to be., For example:


Sprinkle wheat flour mixed with bread.
Sprinkle some water on the soil and wheat feed.
Never crush any eggshell you feed your snail, crushed eggshell is used as a natural repellant by gardeners. The snails find it uncomfortable to walk on.

, When you feed the snail, do so in an enclosed area. Simply stick the food inside the housing or container.


If using a container, make sure that it has sufficient air holes.

, If you place it different might not eat as well.

, Once you stick the food in, you must let the snail be and don't bother it. You may check in now and then to watch what the snail's eating habits are.

Secure your snail’s tank.",How to Play With a Pet Snail," The first thing you should do before anything else is to wash your hands. Washing your hands will make sure that you don’t introduce anything – bacteria or chemicals – to the snail or to its environment.


Use an antibacterial soap.
Use warm water.
Make sure all soap is thoroughly washed off your hands.;
, Before you play with your snail, you need to make sure the room you’re in is secure and snail-ready. By having a room that is secure, you’ll safeguard your snail's life and make playtime a happy time for both of you.


Remove any other pets (specifically dogs or cats) from the room. Dogs or cats might see the snail as something to toy with or even eat.
Inform any other people what you’ll be doing, so they don’t disturb you.
Turn off any loud music or the TV. This is important for the snail and so you can concentrate and won’t be distracted as you’re playing., Night time is the best time to play with your snail. This is because most snails are active at night and sleep during the day. If you try to play with your snail during the day, it might not do very much and may just withdraw into the shell.


The best time for you and your snail is probably between 6PM and 8PM, depending on your schedule and region., The best way to pick your snail up is to let it crawl onto your hand on its own accord. This is by far the safest way for the snail to be carried. Picking a snail up by its shell or body may damage the shell or hurt the snail.


Place your hand flat against the bottom of the snail’s cage near the snail.
Move your hand very slowly in the general direction of the snail.
Let the snail crawl onto your hand., Once the snail has crawled onto your hand, you can slowly lift your hand out of its enclosure. Make sure to lift your hand slowly, as you don’t want to scare the snail or potentially drop it.


After you’ve lifted your hand out of the tank, move it slowly toward the surface of a table.
Place your hand flat against the surface of the table and allow your snail to move around.
Avoid shaking the table or moving your hand suddenly., After you’ve got the snail on your hand and have moved it out of the enclosure or somewhere else in the enclosure, lower your hand down and allow the snail to hop off your hand. This is important, as you’ll want to give your snail the freedom to move as it pleases and to explore new areas.


Lower your hand slowly.
You can lower your hand to a new place in the enclosure. This is probably the best and safest bet.
Consider creating a “playground” tank with new rocks, obstacles, and even snail treats (lettuce, cucumbers, and apples).
Avoid lowering the snail onto the floor. If you do so, there is a chance you or someone else could step on it., After you’ve gotten yourself ready to play with your snail, you should give it the opportunity to move around. Ultimately, your snail will have the best time if it is moving around on its own accord.


Let the snail crawl around your hand.
Let the snail crawl around its playground. If you litter food around the snail’s new playground, chances are it will move around to investigate the food and other new additions.
Avoid trying to move the snail if it is already moving. You may hurt it. In addition, you may scare your snail, which will make it much more likely that the snail will hide from you next time you go to play with it. , If your snail seems to be in a friendly mood, it will be okay to stroke its shell a little bit. Stroking or touching the shell is a great way to interact with your snail and to “play” with it.


Stroke or touch the shell lightly.
Stroke or touch the shell with the grain, rather than against it. , You need to be gentle whenever you play with or handle your snail. As living creatures, they are delicate and can be hurt relatively easily. Make sure to:


Never apply any pressure on to the snail’s shell.
Always move very slowly when handling your snail.
Be conscious of the fragility of the snail., While you should avoid picking the snail up, there are several things you should do and not do if you do decide to pick up your snail. This is important, since if you do something incorrectly, you may hurt your snail.


Do not try to pick up your pet using something sharp.
Do not pick up your snail by its shell. The only time this may be appropriate is if your snail is completely withdrawn into its shell and you need to move it. When you do move your snail this way, make sure to be gentle and to avoid applying any pressure to the shell., When handling your snail, you should make sure to always avoid touching the area around the opening of the shell. This is because a snail’s shell grows at its opening. This makes the area around the opening much more delicate and sensitive.


Always grip the shell with two fingers from the top and rear of the shell., After playing with your snail, make sure to return it safely back to its tank. Returning it to its tank safely is extremely important as you want to make sure not to harm your snail. In addition, if you are too hurried with your snail, the experience won’t be a positive one and your snail may hide in its shell next time you go to play with it.


As with removing your snail from the tank, do so slowly and gently.
Make sure you position your snail up right and in a safe location. Avoid placing the snail on a limb, rock, or in any other precarious position in the tank., After you’ve handled your snail, you need to make sure to thoroughly wash your hands immediately. This is important as snails carry some diseases and infectious agents that are potentially dangerous to us and the people around us.


Use warm water.
Use an antibacterial soap.
Use plenty of water and wash in between your fingers., After you’ve returned the snail to its tank safely, you need to make sure the top or lid to the tank is completely secured. This is important, since your snail may leave its safe enclosure and become lost if you don’t secure the top of the tank.


Place the top on your tank, if there is one.
Make sure that the lid is completely on and there are no holes or gaps in it.
Secure the clips or other fasteners from the tank to the lid.

Look for a healthy snail.Signs that your snail is healthy include a clean appearance and healthy coloring.,
Do not obtain a snail from its natural environment.,
Be sure you’re ready for a freshwater snail.",How to Take Care of a Freshwater Snail1," Healthy coloring varies from species to species. The snail’s shell should be free of cracks. Most importantly, the snail should be active and moving about.


Do not buy freshwater snails that are housed in a tank with many dead or unhealthy snails. Chances are that all the snails in the tank are unhealthy to some degree. Similarly, avoid buying a snail from an overcrowded tank.;
, Snails are commonly found in rice paddies, rivers, and streams around the world. However, these snails are vectors for a wide variety of illnesses which can infect humans and animals.Never remove a freshwater snail from its natural habitat and place it in your aquarium. You run the risk of infecting not just you, but the other fish and creatures in your aquarium.


Even snails that you obtain from a pet store should be handled with care. Always wash your hands after handling your snail or coming into contact with aquarium water. Do not touch your eyes or mouth after touching your snail or other aquarium creatures.

, Freshwater snails are often considered irritating additions to an aquarium. They reproduce quickly and can often overrun a tank. They also eat live plants. If you do not have the time to manage your snail population and keep your tank in order, you should reconsider obtaining a freshwater snail.Many freshwater snails can reproduce asexually, so don’t be surprised if your one snail suddenly becomes five or six.
However, there are many positive aspects to having snails. They can consume decaying plant matter, and can keep your tank clean if housed with fish.

"
"
Ensure your water is appropriate.,
Introduce your snail to the tank gradually.Snails are very sensitive to environmental disruptions.,
Include decor.,
Give your snail enough room.Generally, you can adequately house one snail for every two gallons of water.,
Keep a lid on your tank.Snails are excellent climbers.,
Be careful when choosing tankmates.Certain fish may want to eat your snail.",How to Take Care of a Freshwater Snail2," Freshwater snails prefer water between 65–83°F with a pH of 7–8.Monitor your pH and temperature levels with an aquarium monitor. Aquarium monitors are small devices with outward-facing digital displays that you install inside your aquarium to inform you of your tank’s temperature and pH level.


If you’re having trouble getting your water warm enough, consider investing in either a heat lamp or an under-tank heater. Both are available at your local pet store.
If you’re having trouble getting your tank’s pH levels right, talk to your local aquarist or pet store proprietor. There are various compounds available to adjust pH levels
The water should be completely free of salt, and should never be treated with any copper-based compound.

, Sudden, dramatic changes to the quality or temperature of its water can result in stress. In order to make the transition from its original tank to its new tank as smooth as possible, allow your snail to adjust to the new tank over a long period.


Fill a small plastic bag with water from your snail’s tank. Float the bag in the tank you’re transferring the snail to for about 20 minutes.This will help the water in the bag adjust to the temperature in the snail’s new tank.
Pour a bit of the water in the bag out. Be careful not to pour the snail out with the water.
Fill the bag back up with water from the tank you’re transferring the snail to.
Float the bag in the tank for another 10 to 20 minutes.
Use a thermometer to check the temperature of the water in the tank against the temperature of the water in the bag. If the temperatures are the same, remove the snail from the bag and add it to the new aquarium.
If the temperatures are not the same, float the bag in the tank for another 10-20 minutes until the temperatures are aligned.

, Snails like dark places, and you may see your snails congregating in shaded areas of your tank.If you wish, provide a small overhang or a plastic fish hut (available at local pet stores) that your snail can access. You can also provide darkness with some real or artificial plants.


Your snail might also like to climb on and explore artificial rocks.
Keep in mind that your snail will probably eat live plants, so you’ll have an added expense if you wish to continually introduce new live plants to your aquarium.

, In other words, if you have six-gallon aquarium, you can comfortably house three freshwater snails in it. However, the specific spatial requirements of a freshwater snail depends on its species.Pond snails require two gallons of water per twelve individuals.
Ramshorn snails require two gallons of water per six individuals.
Mystery snails require ten gallons of water per six individuals.
Snails lay their eggs out of the water. If you want your snails to reproduce, leave at least two to four inches of air between the lid of the aquarium and the top of the water.

, They can scale almost any surface, including the vertical glass of an aquarium tank. In order to keep your snail from escaping, keep a lid or cover on it. Some portion of the cover should be composed of mesh to allow air into the tank.

, Loaches, betta fish, and gouramis are notorious for eating snails. Catfish, cichlids, and pufferfish also find snails very tasty. Other fish like Siamese fighting fish enjoy eating snail eggs.Other snails and other freshwater fish (White Cloud Mountain minnows, for instance) make good tankmates for a freshwater snail.

Be patient with your snail.,
Feed your snail food that it likes.Freshwater snails are omnivores and typically eat the algae and food debris in an aquarium.,
Keep the water clean.Check the water’s pH levels and temperature at least once per week, and adjust them as needed.,
Dispose of your snail properly.",How to Take Care of a Freshwater Snail3," When you first introduce a snail to a new environment, it might be shy. The snail might pull its body into its shell for several days as it adjusts to its new environment. This behavior is a stress response, and is normal for a snail that transitions to a new habitat.


You should be alarmed if the snail is contained within its shell and you can see the “door” to its shell (the operculum) is open. This could indicate sickness or death.

, If you don’t have fish in your aquarium, you can feed your snail algae discs. These are small bits of algae that your snail can eat.


Algae discs are readily available online or at most pet stores.
Other foods your snail might enjoy include small bits of shredded lettuce or blanched veggies like zucchini squash.
The frequency you need to feed your snail depends on its species. Talk to your veterinarian with specific concerns about how often your snail needs to be fed.

, Check your filter each day to ensure it is operating properly. Once each week, remove 25% of your tank’s water, and replace it with new water.


For instance, if your tank holds eight gallons, once each week, you should remove two gallons, and add two gallons of new freshwater.

, If your snail dies or if you can no longer care for it, you should use care to dispose of it properly. The best option to get rid of a snail you can no longer care for is to sell it or give it to someone who can care for it. You should never release a pet snail into the wild. Some types of snails are considered pests and can disrupt the ecosystems they’re introduced to.If your snail dies, place it in two sealed plastic bags along with any eggs you might want to dispose of. Freeze the lot for at least 72 hours at a temperature at or below -20°Fahrenheit (-29°C).
Alternately, you can dispose of the snail with a medical or biohazard waste company.

, Toasts don’t just have to be speeches. You may find a poem or a song that you want to perform. You can lead the audience in a song to the couple. Maybe you even have a short video that can be shown on a projection screen. Consider what kind of venue you will be giving the speech at and whether or not a non-traditional toast would be appropriate for the wedding. You may want to ask the couple if a non-traditional toast is acceptable before you start., Quotes can be a good way of expressing what you mean in an eloquent way. Keep quotes short and meaningful. You can begin or end a speech with the quote, but be sure to state how it relates to the couple.You can find quotes on the internet or in wedding planning books. You can also look to your favorite romance novels, romantic comedies, or historical figures for inspiration.
If your friend or the couple has a favorite quote, this might be a perfect choice.

, The best toasts are held together by a common theme or tone. Think about what kind of reaction you want to get from the crowd. Are you looking to be funny? Do you want to inspire tears of joy? Do you want something fun and hip?


Humor is a great way to keep the attention of your audience. If you're having difficulty coming up with your own jokes, find funny quotes from famous comedians or writers.
A sweet and sentimental speech will include stories about how much the couple means to you. Tell a story about a time when they were there for you.
If you want to go a non-traditional route, you can try incorporating pop culture references into your speech. Instead of quoting philosophers, you can quote sitcoms or pop songs.

, Begin by introducing yourself to the crowd, and state how you know the couple. This part should be brief. You don’t need to spend more than two or three sentences explaining your relationship.You can say, “For those of you who don’t know me, I’m Laura. I’ve known the bride since middle school. We first met in Mrs. Johnson’s class, and we’ve been best friends ever since.”

, You should thank the wedding planners, couple, or the couple’s parents for hosting the wedding. You may also state how grateful and happy you are to be there.


For example, you can say, “First, I just want to say what a lovely wedding this is. Thank you so much to Mr. and Mrs. Smith for throwing this wedding for these two wonderful people, and I am so honored to be able to speak here.”

, From your list of memories, choose one or two to share in the speech. This should be a story that everyone can enjoy and understand. This story can be a funny anecdote or a time when the couple had been there for you. You do not want to make fun of the couple, but you may lightly tease them.Be careful not to cross the line between gentle ribbing and being rude. Use your best judgment and your knowledge of the couple to decide what is appropriate.
Avoid choosing memories that might be embarrassing for the couple, and try not to include any inside jokes that might only be funny to a few people in the crowd.End the story with how it shows the best qualities of the couple or how it represents their future marriage. For example, you can end with “I think what this story shows is how Mark and Anna are truly meant for each other. At the end of the day, they’re both incredibly generous people who will always look out for each other.”

, If you want to go a different route than a funny story, you can create a list of memories and advice to the new bride and groom.Come up with at least five different pieces of advice. Add a brief two or three sentence explanation to each step. These can be funny, sentimental, witty, or topical. Choose a theme that is appropriate to the couple. Some ideas include:


""Five things you can learn about love from pop music""
""Ten reasons the couple was meant to be""
""Five things to remember as you begin married life""

, When you are writing your speech, finish on a happy note. Wish the couple luck in their future marriage. Write down how happy you are for them.


You can say, ""I hope and wish for the best for both of you. You two are meant for each other, and I know that your love will be an inspiration to us all.""
This is a good time to include a quote if you found one that you liked.
Save your best material for last. If you have a great joke or a witty line, say it at the end. This is an effective strategy that will make your toast stick in the minds of your listeners., Try to keep the speech under three minutes long.By getting straight to the point, you will write a speech that is far more memorable than a long one.This means that the toast should not be longer than one page written.

, Practice the speech again and again before the wedding. Ask your family and friends to listen as you give the speech. They can give you feedback and constructive criticism to help you improve.


You may even choose to record yourself on your phone or computer. Recite the speech into the microphone. Rewind and listen to yourself. Are there parts that you are stumbling over?Think about whether or not you can have visual aids. If you will have a projector, you may choose to use a few pictures. If you're looking to be funny, you might include a meme made about the couple.

, Either the wedding planner or the couple should inform you ahead of time when you will be giving the speech. If you are uncertain, ask them when you will give the toast. Knowing what to expect can help you prepare.


Traditionally, the maid of honor speaks after the best man, but you will want to double-check the order with the couple., You may or may not have a microphone during your speech. Regardless, speak loud enough for everyone to hear. Say your words slowly. Enunciate all of your words, and take a breath between each sentence.If you start to cry, stop and take a deep breath. Dab away your tears, and begin again when your voice is steady. While crying is natural at a wedding, it can make you difficult to understand while speaking.
Avoid drinking too much before your speech. You do not want to slur your words, and it may mess up your careful practice. Limit yourself to one drink before the speech., If you need notes during the speech, write them down on a notecard or a piece of paper. Do not cover your face with your notes. Instead, hold them below your neck level. Glance down occasionally for guidance throughout your speech. You should try to look up as much as you can during your speech.

, While you are speaking in front of a crowd, you are really talking to the couple. Face them as you give the speech, and make contact with each of them. Remember to smile.

, After you have ended your prepared remarks, make a toast to the couple. Raise your glass, and instruct everyone to take a sip. A toast can be as simple as “To the couple!” or more elaborate, such as, “To my best friends, may you forever be joined in love and affection.”Remember to drink afterwards!


If you want an unusual toast, try to come up with a joke for a toast. For example, you can say, ""Here's to the couple. May you share everything in life--including the housework!""

Make sure that you close the conversation, not her/him.,
Remember to thank them.,
Don't get mad if they won't give your their autograph.,
Don't ask for a phone number or address.",How to Talk to Celebrities," Stay composed. Don't start freaking out and start screaming. You might scare the person away. Just because they're celebrities doesn't mean they enjoy hearing fans scream in their face. Try not to act too suspicious either.;
, Doing this will give you confidence and you will be able to hold your nerves. It will acknowledge your presence and let them know, ""Hey! I'm here and interested!"" Remember to smile; it will make you seem friendly and approachable. Try not to smile so long that it creeps them out, though.

, If s/he acknowledges it with a similar nonverbal gesture, it's your cue to say, ""Hey there. How are you?"" or something along those lines. If s/he ignores you, give it up and walk away. S/he probably does not want to be bothered. If they reply, start your conversation.

, Try to talk about ordinary everyday things, things you would talk about to any other person. Ensure that the conversation has a significant purpose and you're not just chitchatting. Don't bother asking them about the weather or something boring.

, They don't have all the time in the world, and as much as they love their fans, they'd most likely rather not hear your life story. Talk for a couple minutes and then end the conversation. You may want to think of a backup thing to say before you ever meet a celebrity, therefore you won't panic, and will already know what to say. If you really idolize this person, keep the conversation short, but never boring. Try to make it something they remember, considering they probably see hundreds of other fans a day.

, Don't talk for a long time if she/he doesn't seem interested. Example: ""It was really nice talking to you, but I have to go. Would you mind signing this little sheet of paper for me?""

, If she/he obliges, say ""Thank you"" and walk away with a little wave.

, If she/he refuses, say ""Oh well, that's okay. I still enjoyed meeting you. Have a nice day."" A graceful ending is always best.

, They will most likely deny. They may feel like it is an invasion of privacy, and it will make the situation feel awkward.

Ensure others are prepared for the toast.,
Stand up, if toasting in front of a large group.,
Call attention to the fact you intend to raise a toast.,
Be personable.,
Use her name.,
Offer a personal memory about the honored guest.,
Insert comic relief with a light ribbing.,
Address the occasion.,
Keep it short.,

Maintain eye contact.,
Hold your glass at waist height, if standing.,
Raise your glass at the end of the toast.,
Take a sip of wine.,
Set your glass down after the toast.",How to Toast a Girl," Toasting is a group activity, so be sure that everyone's wine glasses are filled, they are paying attention, and whomever is being toasted is present., Standing guarantees everyone can see you, and it helps your voice carry to the crowd. In smaller settings such as a single table, standing is optional.

, Often, this is done by saying, ""I would like to propose a toast to..."" Clinking cutlery against the side of the wine glass also grabs attention and sets the mood.


Wait for your associates, dining partners or event attendees to recognize your intentions and to lift their glasses from the table if they are not already holding them.

, You might mention how you know the woman you are toasting or what she means to you. Don't be overly formal.

, It's best to mention her name at both the beginning and end of the toast, especially in longer toasts. It is fine to use her first name only, unless you are toasting at a formal business event.

, This can be done with a small anecdote or inside comment. Make sure, however, that the story is clear to those who weren't there.

, Make sure you avoid any potentially hurtful comments such as embarrassing anecdotes or nicknames. You don't want to have fun at the honoree's expense., Wish the honoree well in whatever endeavor you are celebrating. Be sincere in your wishes. End with a nod of support or celebration.

, A toast at a large event should be no more than 2 or 3 minutes. A toast in front of a small group might last less than a minute., A sample toast, for example, might begin with, ""I remember the first time I met Karen,"" followed by a short story of your first meeting and a joke about your initial impression of her. Then, you might finish by saying, ""I now want to thank Karen for the past three years and her promise to be my wife. Here's to Karen.""


Those who are very uncertain about word choice might even consult a book or website that offers sample toasts.

, The toast should never be too long that you can't memorize it. Keep your tone natural and easy.

, While you should always begin and end the toast making eye contact with the woman you are toasting, you should look across the rest of the audience throughout the toast.

, If you are sitting, hold it at shoulder level. Make sure you don't widely gesture with the glass to avoid sloshing or spilling your drink.

, Hold it at eye level and in the direction of the woman you are toasting. In a small group you can offer your glass forward, inviting others to touch the rims of their glasses to yours in a show of accord and agreement with what you have stated.

, As the speaker, you may be the first person to drink, and the rest of your group will follow. Take only one drink in merriment. Definitely don't guzzle.

, Doing so will signal that everyone can relax and continue what they were doing.

Make poster boards.,
Ask guests to make and bring signs.,
Make a blindfold (optional).,
Create invitations.",How to Throw a 40th Surprise Birthday Party1," Purchase 40 large sheets of poster board (one for each year of your honoree's life). Decorate each poster board with copies of photos, schoolwork, news clippings, high school sports letters, or whatever memorabilia you can find or collect from each year of the honoree's life. Alternatively, you could just have 4 sheets of poster board (one for each decade) or 8 sheets (one for each 5 years). If you had 40 guests coming, you could assign each guest a poster board and a year rather than doing all of the boards yourself.;
, Ask each guest (or couple) to bring two 8.5 by 11 inch signs on heavy paper (matte photo paper is recommended). The signs could be hand printed or made on a computer using, for example, PowerPoint. The first sign would be a serious, sincere happy birthday sign signed by the guest. The second sign would be a humorous one.

, If your honoree is adventuresome, make a nice blindfold that is attractively decorated with the honoree's name and happy birthday on the front or get a nice happy birthday bandana.

, Make a sign with all the invitation details (date, place, time, RSVP, etc.) Blindfold your honoree with a plain blindfold. After your honoree is blindfolded securely (so that the honoree will not see the special blindfold, the sign or anything else for that matter), position the special blindfold over the plain one for photos. Have the honoree hold the sign with all the invitation details. Take photos of your honoree with the happy birthday blindfold holding the invitation sign. Hide the sign and special blindfold and photos prior to removing the plain blindfold. The photos can be printed or emailed as your invitation.

Recognize your anxiety.",How to Talk to Someone You Barely Know," If someone wants to talk and is open to a conversation, that person's body language will probably give you a clue. Though some people may think of body language as more of a dating/flirting ritual, we all send subconscious and conscious clues about how we feel towards someone with our body's movements, positions, and mannerisms.Being aware of your own body language, as well as the body language of someone you're trying to start a conversation with, will send mutual signals to indicate an interest in talking or a desire to be left alone.


If someone faces you, leans in to talk, or keeps her arms open instead of crossed, that person is probably eager to talk.Smiling, especially a Duchenne smile, is a sign of welcome and positive engagement. To decipher a Duchenne smile (often called a genuine smile), look for narrowed eyes that form wrinkles or ""crow's feet"" at the outside corners of each eye.Direct eye contact is a very strong indication of interest and engagement. If the person you're chatting with is looking you in the eye, she probably is interested in what you're saying, or at least wants to continue the conversation. Conversely, if the person avoids your eyes or moves away from you in some way, she probably does not want to continue the conversation.;
, If someone seems open to having a conversation and you've approached one another, introduce yourself. It may sound obvious that introductions are an important part of a conversation, but how you introduce yourself can convey a lot of subtle information, and could set the pace for the rest of the ensuing conversation.


Shake hands when you first meet. It's a good way to initiate the greeting, as it shows courtesy and respect.Make eye contact and smile while you extend your hand to shake.
Say hello and state your name. Try something like, ""Hi, I'm ____."" If the setting is very casual, you can use a more informal greeting like ""Hey"" or ""What's up,"" but be sure to still say your name.
If the other person does not offer her name, you can ask, ""What's your name?""
Be sure you remember the person's name. Try associating it with someone you know by the same name, or use a mnemonic device to recall her name later. For example, if the person's name is Brenda and she has brown hair, you can use the first two letters of both words to recall brown hair with Brenda.

, Once you've shook hands and introduced yourselves, it's generally a good idea to offer a sincere compliment to start the conversation (if you feel comfortable doing so). It helps put people at ease and lets them know that you're interested in chatting and getting to know one another. The compliment can be based on how the person is dressed (like saying, ""That's a beautiful necklace"" or ""I love your shirt, it's a great color on you!"") or on someone's accomplishments, if you know of any (for example, telling an artist, ""I saw your work at the gallery, I really loved your painting!"").

, After you've introduced yourselves and made pleasantries, it's time to begin the actual conversation. To keep a conversation going strong, it's best to avoid questions that would elicit a short one-word answer. Instead, ask open-ended questions that you don't know the answer to. This allows the other person to expand on things she says and creates more of an opportunity for a genuine back-and-forth dialogue.If the person you're talking to says where she's from, don't ask ""Did you like it there?"" That will only provoke a yes or no answer. Instead, ask something like, ""Wow, I've never been there. What was it like living there?""
Instead of asking where someone works, try a broader question like, ""What do you do?"" It invites an explanation of both the job she works and the place she's employed, which can lead to further questions and discussions.

, Some people are eager to interject in a conversation, asking questions simply for the opportunity to share their own opinion on the subject. This can be off-putting to many people, and it is not very conducive to a meaningful conversation. Instead, try to minimize the amount of time you dominate the conversation, and practice listening to make a real connection with someone (instead of just listening for your chance to interject or respond).Don't worry about what to say next. Be a good listener and take in everything your conversational partner is saying, and you're sure to find something to ask about or expand on.Practice empathetic reflecting skills. This means nodding at what's being said to show you comprehend it, and then (once the other person is done talking) restating it in your own words to show you've absorbed it. For example, if the person says that she thinks blues music is the best genre of music, give a polite nod and say something like, ""The blues certainly have influenced a lot of other genres in American music. I guess blues music is sort of the foundation for most contemporary music.""
Resist any urge to offer judgment. Judging your conversational partner for what she's said when you do not know her can quickly alienate her and force the conversation to a premature ending. Instead, reflect on what the person says and work on picking up on nonverbal communications. Be aware of your own nonverbal signals as well. Don't flinch if someone says they're a Republican and you're a Democrat. Simply ask something like, ""That's interesting. I don't know many Republicans. What informs your beliefs?""

, When it's your turn to speak, what you say may be just as important as how you say it. It's important to be aware of your tone and volume, as well as the way you phrase your responses. The best way to do this is to think carefully before you speak, rather than mindlessly responding to any question or prompt you're given.Watch how long you speak for. 30 to 60 seconds is generally acceptable, but if you go over a minute of consecutive talk time on one single response, you're pushing the other person's ability to maintain focus.Don't overshare. There are some things people simply don't want to hear about, and that is particularly important if you're chatting with someone you barely know. Rather than talking about your medical history or a recent breakup, talk about things that are interesting and relatable.Avoid making it all about you. Instead, try to talk about things that you can both relate to, and use your best judgment when bringing up anything remotely controversial or highly-opinionated.
Use ""I"" statements instead of declarative statements.For example, instead of saying, ""New York is the worst place to live,"" frame your comment around your own experience. In that example you could say something like, ""I understand why everyone loves New York, but I had a really hard time adjusting there. It's very expensive to live in New York, and the people aren't as friendly there as they are here.""

, If the conversation takes a bad turn or if you run out of things to talk about, you may need to excuse yourself. However, if you were really interested in what the other person was saying, or if you want to continue talking to someone you will be working with for the foreseeable future, you may need more of a timeout than an ending. Either way, excusing yourself tactfully is important, and it's of even greater importance if you intend to continue the conversation later.


Excuse yourself politely. Tell the other person you need to get a drink of water or use the restroom. That way you can collect yourself, and if you want to return to the conversation later, you will still have an opening to jump in., If the conversation was going well but you're simply running out of things to talk about, you may find a natural ending point within the conversation. That may be when a moment of silence goes on too long, or it could be an interruption by someone else who'd like to speak with your conversational partner. Whatever seems like a good and natural end point to the conversation you've been having, recognize it and make use of it to prevent the conversation from becoming forced and awkward.

, No matter when or why you choose to wrap up the conversation you've had, it's important to do so politely and respectfully. You can make up an excuse if you want to, but it may be awkward if you're caught in your lie at a later point. Instead, simply wrap up the conversation and offer some words of kindness or thoughtfulness to leave as good an impression as possible.Say something cordial, such as, ""Well, it's been great talking to you"" or ""I've really enjoyed our conversation.""
You can also offer something thoughtful to show that you're not trying to be rude. Say something like, ""Well, you must be busy,"" or if a third person expresses interest in chatting you can say something like, ""I'll leave you two to carry on. It was really great talking to you!""

, Keeping up on the latest local, world, and pop culture news can give you a lot of ammunition when you find yourself searching for something to talk about. Most people have at least a passing knowledge of what's going on in the world, whether it be in politics or sports, and having a shared opinion on something in the news can help break the ice and give you something to talk about.You don't have to talk about serious political positions - in fact, it might be best if you avoid controversial or highly-opinionated subjects.
Try asking someone, ""So have you heard about _____?"" Then ask her for her opinion on the subject. There's a good chance that a simple question like that can lead to other topics of conversation, and you'll also learn a lot about the other person from her responses.

, You may not know the people you'll be talking with, but perhaps you share a mutual friend or two. You can ask that friend what sorts of things the person you'll be talking to is interested in, and use that information to plan out some conversational topics. Or, if you don't share any mutual friends, try looking the other person up online. If you know someone's name you can search for her on social media sites like Facebook. Even if you're not friends and can't read the person's page, you might be able to at least see some of her interests or hobbies, or deduce from her photograph what sorts of things she's interested in.If a person's social media photograph shows her hiking or playing sports, you'll know that she's interested in those pursuits. A photograph of a pet lets you know that she's very interested in animals. A photo with her children tells you that she has a family, and may be interested in talking about the struggles and rewards of parenting.
Don't use social media or the internet to ""stalk"" another person. Simply take a glance and see what you can deduce about a person, if you know for certain that that individual will be at the social event you're attending. Then come up with something to talk about, should the opportunity arise.

, It goes without saying that there's no way to perfectly plan out what everyone will say during a given interaction. But since you have little or no experience talking to the person/people you will be speaking with, it may be helpful to plan out where you would like the conversation to go.Decide how you will open the conversation. People will inevitably ask what you do, so plan out how you can talk about your work in a way that an outsider will understand and find interesting.
Prepare some basic questions to get the conversation going. You will probably want to ask the person what her name is, what she does for a living (or what she's studying, if she's a student), and how she knows any mutual acquaintances you might share.
Anticipate similar questions being asked of you, and know what to say. You don't have to write a script for yourself, but simply knowing in advance that those types of questions will be asked can help you better prepare for the interaction.

, If you're anxious about being in a situation where you have to interact with people you hardly know, you might be feeling understandably anxious. Many people try to avoid thinking about things that make them anxious, which makes sense if you're trying to concentrate at work or on some task in the moment. However, leaving that anxiety unchecked could cause you additional stress, which might increase your feelings of dread about the upcoming social situation. Instead of ignoring the way you're feeling, acknowledge those thoughts/feelings and find a way to work around them.Learn to recognize when an upcoming event is making you feel anxious. If the thought of talking to strangers gives you a fluttering in your stomach, sweaty hands, dry mouth, a headache, a tight jaw, or the feeling that you're grinding your teeth, there's a good chance that you're feeling stressed about the social event.Try to reframe the situation by shifting your focus away from how awkward and stressful the event will be, and instead think about how you might end up having very rewarding conversations that could lead to friendship, professional connections, or just a simply enjoyable time talking to someone new.
Use a calming technique to help you lower your stress levels. You can try deep breathing through your diaphragm, seated meditation, or even a visualization exercise. Try visualizing yourself leaving the social event empowered by your charisma, having had genuinely enjoyable conversations and made new friends or professional contacts. You can also use your calming technique right before you enter the social event to further prepare yourself.

Come to an understanding.",How to Understand Why Your Boyfriend Acts Differently when He Is With His Mates1," If you’re upset when he and his mates ignore you or goof off, let him know. Wait until you’re alone to avoid embarrassing him. Say exactly what’s on your mind in a calm, rational manner. Keep the conversation in the first person as much as possible. Use sentences that start with “I feel…,” “I think…,” or “I wanted…” This will make him fell less under the gun.For example, you could say, “I don’t mean to sound whiney, but it makes me feel left out when you and your mates ignore me. I wanted to talk to you about it now before it comes a regular thing.”;
, Don’t bad-mouth his mates or say anything he could interpret as an insult. He might not even realize he’s offended you. If you leap right into verbal abuse, you could end up making an awkward situation much worse., Verbal communication is only half of the equation. During your conversation, maintain eye contact and lean forward to show your undivided attention. If you normally gesture when you talk, don’t change your habit.

, Tell him the truth about your feelings, but reassure him that you understand the value of friendship. Use this as an opportunity to hang out with your own mates. Chances are, he’ll be okay with your decision."

Ask your boyfriend to limit the group size.,
Include your mates.",How to Understand Why Your Boyfriend Acts Differently when He Is With His Mates3," Listen actively when your boyfriend tells you about his mates. Pay attention to anything you might have in common with them. When you talk to them, say something like, “Oh, you’re Mike! Josh tells me you’re originally from London. My aunt lives there.”, Sitting on the sidelines while the guys kid around only makes you look stuck-up. If you don’t understand a joke one of his mates tells, wait until they finish laughing. Then, calmly say, “Sorry. I didn’t quite get that. Did I miss something?” Smile and chuckle a bit as you talk. This should show them that you’re a good sport and can take a lighthearted joke.Don’t let your boyfriend or his mates get away with picking on you or telling sexist jokes. If they can’t treat you with respect, they’re not worth hanging out with.

, Suggest this only for times when you’re hanging out with them. In a smaller group, it’s often easier to put names with faces. Reassure him that this is only until you get to know his mates better.


If any of his mates are seeing anyone, suggest a double date.

Notice what the other person is doing and comment on it.,
Listen to what some people are discussing.",How to Talk to People at a College Party," Say to yourself that you are the nicest and coolest girl/boy in the party. Have a drink and find someone that you think that you can chat with, then start the conversation with something you just saw or find an excuse to chat.

For example, say something like: ""Oh sorry, I almost fell down on you! My name is ... ""; or, say something like ""Hey Lola/John––oh sorry, I thought you were someone I knew! My name is ... and I was hoping someone I knew would be here."";
, Have some pre-planned topics to talk about, and aim to steer the conversation towards those things, so that you have some fun things to share with others. This might be about hobbies, studies, personal interests, and the like.

Shared concerns about timetables, exam times, subject challenges, etc., might also be a good way to find topics to talk about. Commonalities are a very useful way to discuss things with other people.

, For example, you could ask something like: ""You are not drinking?"" or, ask: ""What are you drinking?"" Then be charming and seek to find out what the other person finds interesting. That's how you can chat and make a conversation with college party people., Go for it if you know what they are talking about and throw in your observations and summaries too.

Do something unexpected.,
Let loose when you laugh.,
Be happy overall.",How to Stand out at Social Gatherings and Parties," Make sure you shower before going to the event! Cleanliness/personal hygiene is crucial. (Girls: Use natural looking makeup; overdoing it will not work.) Use deodorant, brush your teeth, clean your ears, put on a pleasant scent of your particular liking, go to the salon and get a new hairdo, wax your eyebrows, get a manicure/pedicure. Give yourself a fun new look that suits your personal style.;
, Make sure it makes you feel beautiful! This can definitely boost your confidence and make people notice you.

, Be yourself. Be free spirited. Don't be too self-conscious! Be confident. If you're not - pretend you're confident. This may mean challenging yourself in ways you never thought of before, but you'd be amazed by how good it can make you feel once you do it. When talking to someone, don't think about yourself or what the other person might be thinking about you unless they give you weird looks. It can make you more nervous, and it can show. but focus on the other person instead. Ask questions, smile, pay attention to what they're saying, and look them in the eye.

, This is essential. Always having a smile on gives out positive vibes and makes people feel more comfortable around you, and makes you look more approachable.

, If someone talks to you, be interested in what they have to say. Nod occasionally, throw in a ""Yeah"", ""Uh huh"", ""I see"", ""Oh cool"" or anything that suggests that you're actually listening to them and not falling asleep. If you like someone's shoes, tell them! Compliment people. A good thought about someone is worthless unless it is said out loud. However, don't be fake! Don't say you like someone's new hairdo if you think it's obnoxious. Be real and honest. Your thoughts will be valued.

, Don't always expect others to initiate the conversation. If they don't feel any vibes coming from you, chances are they won't be too interested in talking to you either. So, talk to people! Ask how they're doing, if they're having a good time so far, if they ran into any friends, what's new in their life lately, etc. Don't stick to one group of friends the whole time (but don't ditch them either). Move around a little, try to interact with as many people as possible. As for the people you don't know - introduce yourself. Smile bright, make eye contact, make conversation and show them that you are a person with an awesome personality that is worth getting to know. One important rule of making good conversation is not to agree with everything they say. You are an individual. Express your opinions! Also, people love talking about themselves. So, listen to them when they're talking to you!

, Know when to be serious, but cracking a joke once in a while or using your wit can definitely lighten the mood. Share a funny situation you have been in. Laughs are one of the best ways to attract a crowd. This will also make people remember you as a fun person they like being around!

, Jump in the pool, bust loose on the dance floor like no one's watching, crack a silly joke, be witty, play a practical joke on someone, go crazy! This will make people remember you - and you being there could possibly be the highlight of the event! Don't overdo it, however. You might risk looking attention starved or a bit over the top. Be original and tasteful, not foolish and obnoxious.

, A confident person laughs out loud, and a person who laughs out loud gets attention. Think Cameron Diaz, she has a famously quirky laugh. Laughing at jokes or situations shows a confident, lighthearted sense of humor and makes others want to be around you.

, To sum it all up, just be happy! Smile, be sweet, laugh if someone tells a joke. This gives you a happier glow and tells people you're content and up to have a good time.

Create a list of real-life examples.,
Look for patterns of treatment over time.,
Take responsibility.,
Find a partner or confidante to help you identify social goals and achieve them.",How to Stop Being Invisible to Other People1," In order to fix your problem, you first have to understand it. Compile a list that includes moments in which you felt ignored by other people. Include everything from the seemingly trivial (I said “Hi!” and received no reply) to the more obvious examples (I attended a party and no one spoke to me). Try to describe these incidents in as much detail as you can.This list can stay private and, therefore, does not need to appear polished. It is for your own personal reference, so be more concerned about the content than the format or appearance.
Marking down your emotional reaction at the time can also help you to understand the stages of emotion commonly associated with being ignored or ostracized. It is not uncommon for people who are isolated to feel confused at first (am I really experiencing this?), followed by anger and rage when no one seems willing to help improve the situation. Validate and recognize your feelings before they make compel you to commit anti-social acts simply to be noticed.;
, Are you having trouble getting people to pay attention to you at work or at home? In social settings or in private ones? Is there any particular person who appears repeatedly in your example list? Did others start to ignore you after a particular moment in time? For instance, it is documented that workplace whistleblowers can be ostracized by their peers.Don’t discount your behaviors. Watch for patterns in how you act as well. For example, are you comfortable speaking with people, but fail to leave a lasting impression? Or, do you experience anxiety when pressured to talk with others?
Make notations about your pattern observations and then set personal goals accordingly. If your home life is the concern, then tailor your efforts toward an improvement in that area. This will also allow you to see (and celebrate!) positive changes over time.

, To make a change you have to embrace the possibility of improvement, even if it comes at a slow pace. Recognize that your actions are within your control.Feeling invisible can be a self-fulfilling prophecy. If you believe that you are unworthy of notice, you will be.

, This should be a person who you trust and who you admire. Ask them to attend social functions with you in order to observe how you interact with others and to provide advice.

Keep an open mind.,
Stay positive.,
Take responsibility for your attitude.",How to Survive a Boring Party1," Although you may be feeling bored, keeping an open mind and attitude can be helpful. Being open to conversation and other party guests will help you stay engaged and make the party seem a lot more bearable. Always try to stay open to new conversations and the possibility that the party isn't as boring as you first thought.Even if you aren't immediately interested in a conversation, try to give it a chance and see where it goes.
Shutting down and deciding the party is dull will only make your time at the party even more boring.;
, Although you may not be having fun at the party, it's important that you stay positive. Focusing on the negative aspects of the party will only make it seem worse than it is. Staying positive will allow you to have as much fun as possible and make the most out of the party. Focus on the things you are enjoying about the party.
Keeping a positive attitude can help make the party more fun for everyone.
Being negative will only bring the party down even further.

, Even though you may not feel that the party is exciting, you are still responsible for your own feelings of boredom.

Always keep in mind that it's ultimately up to you to make the most out of a boring party.Ask the host if there is anything you can help with.

Learn to say “no.” If you struggle with social invisibility it is very tempting to jump on every opportunity for engagement and recognition.,
Do something for yourself!,
Eat right and exercise.,
Take time off.",How to Stop Being Invisible to Other People2," Acknowledge your feelings and past actions as valid, but decide to take a new path in the future. It is often helpful to think about everything that is unique about you and all of your personal accomplishments. Love yourself and others will love you too!


Keeping a journal of personal triumphs can help you to stay in a positive, forward-thinking mindset. It also gives you good material for conversations. Most people would be more than happy to offer sincere congratulations if, for example, your received a promotion at work. Also, feel free to include statements of gratitude in your journal. There is no one ‘right’ way to chronicle your journey., In your home and/or office, document your life and achievements by posting snapshots of good moments, inspirational quotes, and knick-knacks from your adventures.


If you climbed up to Machu Picchu, let people know by keeping a photo at your desk. This is a sure-fire conversation starter. Studies have shown that taking ownership over a space through personal items can result in an increase of positive emotion., It is very tempting to sacrifice and compromise in order to promote harmony. This ‘people-pleasing’ mentality is pleasant, but also forgettable if repeated endlessly. Pretend as if you are your own personal PR (public relations) agent. As such, you must encourage the positive and respond to negative attacks upon your person.Be direct, not confrontational. People often fade into social invisibility in order to avoid conflict. This is understandable, however, it can cause problems in the long term. Instead, in tense situations, try to remain calm and collected and goal-oriented. Ask your colleagues, ""How can we fix this?” or “Why do you think that?” Other people seeking a skilled leader will then look to you for guidance.

, Resist this impulse. When presented with an opportunity, ask yourself if it fits your present and future personal and professional goals. If that does not help, then give yourself one day to think everything over and to reply. This mindset puts your needs first, a clear signal to others that you are someone of importance., Buy a new outfit with matching accessories. Make a statement of individuality with your clothing choices. For example, pick a memorable or unique piece of jewelry and wear this signature piece for certain special occasions. The process of enclothed cognition means that you will gain confidence from clothing pieces that you associate with strong, powerful people. In this case, a simply necklace can be the best social armor you can buy!, Make sure that you are eating regular, healthy meals. This is another area where you can express your personality and expand your social circle by joining a cooking club or even writing a food blog. Similarly, exercise does not have to be a solo endeavor. Take a class at the local gym, sign up for an outdoor exercise group, or track your progress with a support group online. All of these actions will result in greater visibility for you.


As a bonus, exercise has been shown to trigger the production of endorphins, which in turn stimulate positive emotions.When you feel good about yourself, others will notice and get caught up in that exuberant feeling along with you.

, Every once in a while embrace invisibility and disappear from the social scene. Not only will this make people appreciate you more, you will also get to recharge and reevaluate your goals moving forward. This can also be an opportunity for adventure! Book a trip to a distant locale and practice your social skills by taking on a new, bold persona, even if only for brief time.

Practice positive affirmation.,
Give compliments.,
Display strong body language.,
Avoid hiding behind your phone.,
Be funny!",How to Stop Being Invisible to Other People3," Tell yourself how confident you are. You may not believe this initially, but the more you tell yourself ""I am a confident person"", the easier it will become to feel confident. Your subconscious will believe you are confident if it is told often enough. In fact, Carnegie Mellon University researchers found that self-affirmation stimulates a person’s problem solving ability and can even lead to increased grade point averages while in school., Share your affirmations with others by recognizing their talents. Tell someone, “I really agreed with your point” or “I think that you made a good choice back there.” If you notice a person’s signature jewelry piece or perfume, make a nice, sincere statement about it, such as, “That bracelet is really stunning. Where did you get it?”

, Hold your head up high, keep your spine straight, and walk with purpose. As you walk also try to establish eye contact with others and smile as you do so. People tend to notice someone who emits an aura of self-awareness. They can sense that this person has self-worth, which is to be respected.


Take up space. In a physical manifestation of conflict avoidance, it is easy to give in to the urge to compress your body as much as possible in the presence of others. Resist this urge. Instead, own your territory at the conference table, for example. One way to do this is to spread out your papers for reference and make gestures that occupy the space., It is really easy to fiddle with your phone to defray the awkwardness connected with social invisibility. Instead, force yourself to keep your phone put away. Make yourself interact with a set number of people (or give yourself a time limit) before you can pull it back out.

, Not everyone is equipped with the natural gifts of Robin Williams or other superb comic icons. However, this doesn’t mean that you can’t be funny. Try to figure out your own unique brand of humor. Do you like knock-knock jokes? Or, perhaps you favor biting social satire? Or, droll or dark commentaries? Take some time to explore different types of “funny” so that you can bring your own approach to social gatherings.


Humorous anecdotes are great ice-breakers. Read one of the many online “fake news” sites and gather stories to discuss with others. This is a comfortable way to bring up touchy political issues while stimulating conversation. Other people will undoubtedly ask questions and you get to be the authority of the moment."

Immerse yourself in conversation.,
Take a stand and don't be afraid to disagree.,
Test your boundaries.,
Get involved!",How to Stop Being Invisible to Other People4," Be an active listener and an engaged speaker. By closely listening to your conversation partner (or to any speaker) you are showing them respect, thus rescuing them from invisibility. Active listening creates common ground and leads to a deeper mutual understanding and empathy. Asking questions is one way to move a conversation from passive to active.Try to avoid asking “yes or no” questions and instead stick with “how and why” prompts. For example, if a friend is recounting a recent trip abroad instead of asking, “Did you enjoy it?” you could say, “What did you enjoy the most about it and why?” Ask follow-up questions as well to show that you are still engaged.

, If you have a valid counterpoint, bring it up in a civil way. Indeed, sometimes you can even acknowledge your desire to play devil’s advocate, an angle that often injects a degree of liveliness into a conversation. In addition, seeing both sides of an argument demonstrates mental flexibility, a trait widely admired.

, Perhaps a simple boost of self-esteem is required to get the ball rolling on your path to social visibility. Do something crazy, zany, and outgoing to get some attention with people you will probably never see again.


Keep these spontaneous actions positive. For example, high five a random person on the street or ‘pass it along’ by paying for someone else’s coffee. By doing so, you will have secured your visibility (and noticeably impacted another person) for at least a day. And, Stanford University research studies have shown that paying it forward stimulates social behavior and generosity., Keeping a busy schedule greatly increases your odds of social visibility. Ask your friends, family, and co-workers to suggest activities and events that may be of interest to you. Keep an eye open for new opportunities and, remember, don’t be afraid to try something adventurous!


If you are at work this may mean tapping in to local networking groups. For example, many young professionals groups meet up according to specific age ranges or fields. This will increase your social visibility by giving you an instant commonality with others. Or, your involvement could take the form of service activities such as organizing departmental parties or charity drives.Helping others is always a positive way to draw attention to oneself.
Thematic meet-up groups are another option for almost guaranteed social visibility. These are groups of people who all express similar interests (alumni, outdoors-types, board game enthusiasts, etc.) and who get together at planned gatherings (often organized via social media).

Remember to ask your host if it's okay to play with his pet before doing so., If you see two guests chatting, try to imagine what they might be saying to each other. Insert funny dialogue into their mouths (either mentally or very, very quietly to yourself) as their lips move. Or choose someone you don't know and try to make a creative backstory for him. You could also watch everyone's body language and try to guess their relationships to each other from these cues. Maybe you'll pick up that the girl at the snack table has a crush on the guy who is playing with the dog because she can't stop glancing over at him.

, If the party you're at has gotten a bit slow, you can add some excitement by playing a few simple party games. These games will get everyone moving and talking, adding some much needed life to the party. Try looking over some of these examples to get an idea of which games you might want to play:You can try whispering a word to someone next to you and asking them to whisper a word they associate with it to the next person. It's a lot of fun to see what the original word ends up being.
Try asking everyone to say a certain word without showing their teeth. You can play in teams and eliminate players who show their teeth when talking.
You can always try playing the classic game of charades if things get dull. One person will try to act out a word while the other players try to guess that word.

, If the party is dying and no one is talking, it might be a good time to start up a few conversations. Forcing yourself to meet new people and get them talking can be a great way to bring some life back to a party. You can also try to introduce people to one another and get them going on their own conversations.

By discussing topics that are open-ended, you'll be able to keep a conversation going and help make the party a bit more interesting. Try to avoid topics like the weather, money or traffic. Instead, ask people about their hobbies and interests, what music they like, if they've seen any good movies, and so on.
Keep topics broad at first and then narrow the subject down if the other person is interested.

Pay attention to what the other person is saying. You'll likely find they have mentioned a few things that would be a good topic to focus on.

, Even if you think the party isn't as fun as it could be, you'll likely find someone that you can connect and chat with. Try talking to a few different people or approaching someone you think you'd enjoy a conversation with.

Finding someone to talk with at a dull party can help make it much more enjoyable.

, Inevitably, there will come a time when a certain topic or conversational thread will start to come to an end. Knowing how to jump form one topic to another can help keep a conversation going strong. Keep some of these tips in mind whenever you need to change topics during a conversation:Generally, you'll want the new topic to be somewhat related to the last one. For example, a discussion about libraries could easily transition into a talk about e-readers and then onto new technology.
Don't be afraid to abruptly change a topic if the old one should fizzle out.
Feel free to explore topics that go beyond the usual small talk. For example, you might ask someone what he would do if he were trapped on a desert island.

Develop a friendly tone of voice.",How to Socialize Smoothly," Appearance really is a basis step that is mandatory. Looking presentable will attract more people to you and also give you a booster of confidence. When you know you look good, it reflects onto other people. If you are on a budget, there are plenty of places that sell clothes or accessories that fit into a budget. Try stores like K-Mart, Target, and Walmart. The deals are cheap. Normally look in the clearance of these stores which normally offer things that were overstocked or from last season.;
, Before stepping into a gathering or an event, you need to take a deep breath and remember that they are not going to make you jump off a bridge. This is where appearance comes in. If you express, for example, that you like your shirt, others will tend to like it also. When you feel good and like what you are wearing, it will display well.

, Starting a conversation is normally not very comfortable. This is when ice breakers come in handy. For example you see a girl with a brooch on and you really notice this piece. A good icebreaker would be to go up and say, ""Hey... that's a beautiful brooch! I noticed it when I first walked in and have been meaning to compliment on it."" Something along the lines of this benefits in two factors: One being that it's flattery and also is opening a doorway to conversation. In everyday life we have conversations that first start with something and then end in a totally different thing. So, you could be talking about her brooch, ask her where she got it, if it's a store you recognize talk about it, ask if she collects brooches, etc. These are called loop holes of a conversation.

Asking where he/she knows the hostess
Ask (fake) directions to where the cocktails are if the person you are trying to start a conversation with has one

, Simple questions like that lead to loop holes.

, You don’t need to shout or talk over people to say something confidently. Make your words meaningful. Even if you don’t feel confident, show confidence in what you’re saying and how you’re saying it. Speak clearly and try to avoid fillers like “uh” or “um.”Don’t minimize your words or ideas by saying, “I don’t know, but…” or, “This might be stupid, but…” Even if you feel tentative, don’t show it., Think about what you can specifically relate or contribute to in the meeting. Perhaps you are younger than the others present but can comment on young adult markets or perspectives. Think about what unique perspective you bring, then share it.You might have a different family background, ethnic identity, or education than those around you. Use these to your benefit to add a new perspective.

, There’s no need to ramble on to make sure that you’re heard or that people understand you. Focus on speaking clearly and with fewer words. Make your comment memorable, not time-consuming. Take some time to formulate your thoughts and ideas, then say it in a clear and effective way.For example, skip filler words like “I think…” or, “I have an idea…” and get straight to the point.

Plan out the places you're going to hit up so you'll all know where to meet if you get separated. Make sure you've got everyone's number to make it easy to get in touch if you can't find them in the sea of dancers at a crowded house party.


Make sure you all want to do the same thing. It's less fun going out with someone who wants to hit up the headache fest that is an EDM club when your heart is set on a greasy dive. Party team, assemble.;
, If you're going to turn the night into an expedition into the heart of madness, pack smart. Make sure you have everything you need in your pocket or wallet, including make-up, your keys, protection, some toilet paper, your fully charged cellphone, and plenty of cash for unplanned trips to the taco truck or for splitting a 3am frozen pizza.


If you might be staying out all night, bring gum instead of worrying about a toothbrush. Bring a few Tylenol in case you wake up with a headache.

, Parties can be intimidating for some people, so you want to make sure you'll be feeling confident and excited to be there. Shower, wash your coolest outfits, and take some time getting ready and looking your best. Make sure it'll be appropriate for the party, whether it be a night at the club or a house party. You don't want to be the only one in a zoot suit at a toga party.


Dress for comfort as much as style. You might think an especially short skirt looks great in your dorm room, but are you going to feel comfortable and confident in it 6 hours from now when it's 13 degrees out?If you're going out in heels, pack some flats in your purse, in case you might be walking around more than you'd anticipated. Even if it seems like you're going to be at someone's house all night, what if you suddenly plan to head elsewhere?

, Even if you're not planning on drinking, don't find yourself stuck in the middle of a book party or a boring art gallery opening with a raging stomach rumble. Eat a solid dinner (that means more than chips) any time your plans include partying.


Eating eggs, milk, and pickles has been shown to be an effective method of preventing hangovers. Milk coats the stomach, while eggs contain cysteine, a compound that breaks down alcohol in the body. Pickles contain salts that replenish electrolytes, so you can hop ahead of the game by loading up on some bread 'n butters.

, If you're going out drinking, assign a designated driver to get you home, arrange to stay at the place you're partying, or pre-program the cab service into your phone so you'll be able to make it home safely later.


If you're going to a house party, it may be inappropriate for you to assume you'll be able to crash on the couch at the end of the night when you're exhausted and covered in nuclear-orange Doritos snow. 3am is a bad time to have to figure out where you're going to sleep.

, It's a good idea to let someone like a roommate, or even another person on your dorm floor know where your group is headed. It doesn't have to be a big buddy-system safety precaution. Frame it like you're letting someone know in case they want to come later, just to be on the safe side.

, Sure, you want to hop right on the dance floor because your jam's on, but it's not cool being drenched in sweat right after you get to the party. You don't have to do all your partying within 15 minutes of getting there. Slow down and survey the scene. See who you want to hang out with and who you'd like to get to know.


It takes drinks a while to catch up with you, so it's common for inexperienced partiers to get drunk quickly because they think they're sober. Take it slow. You've got the whole night ahead of you.

, If you're barhopping with friends or at a party with drinking, make sure you drink responsibly and know your limitations. Getting wild can be fun, but getting sloppy is a great way to bum everyone out and ruin the party, or get kicked out. Don't hang out with anyone who would pressure you into drinking, and avoid drinking altogether if you just don't feel like it. Partying doesn't have to involve alcohol or other substances.


Drink one glass of water for every alcoholic drink you have, and try to avoid energy drinks and sodas, the sugar of which can make hangovers worse and drunkenness more unpredictable.
Never leave your drink unattended, and never let anyone you don't know get you a drink in an opened container. Take your drink with you to the bathroom.

, Talk to people, mingle, and have fun. A party isn't the time to spend huddling against a wall with your best friend updating your Twitter feed on your phone and worrying about the way your hair looks. Be in the moment and enjoy yourself.


Set a rule for yourself before you go out if you tend toward shyness. Say that you'll talk to one person you don't know, or that you'll definitely take center stage on the dance floor when a certain song comes on. Be spontaneous.

, Maybe you're at a great party and having a fun time hanging and meeting people, but some joker is keeping you locked in an eternal Dave Matthews doom loop. For shame. Keep an iPod handy or make the decision to take over the stereo with someone everyone will be able to stomach.

, Especially at a house party, you don't want to overstay your welcome. If your group becomes all separated, make sure you know what the game plan is. What happens if someone wants to head to another party but someone else really wants to head home and all you want is to find the bathroom? Discuss contingencies beforehand.


Come up with a good excuse when you first get to the party in case it ends up being a lame event you want to ditch. If you say, ""Yeah, I think we're going to drop by for a little while, but I've got some studying to do and can't stay very late"" you won't need to feel guilty if you feel like leaving after a few minutes because you're bored to tears.

, Make sure that everyone you came with has got a safe route home, either with you or with someone else trustworthy. When you get home, check in with everyone via text. Never leave a good partier behind.


If you're walking late at night, always walk in a group.
Never, under any circumstances, drive after drinking.

, After a hard night of partying, you've earned a good pass out. Make sure you drink some water to keep yourself hydrated and aim for a good 8 or 10 hours in pass-out land.

, Partying can bring with it a whole gnarly host of mutant funks. Take a hot shower to help you sweat out the toxins of too much fun and get the smell of that hippie's clove cigarettes out of your hair.

, If you wake up feeling groggy, get some electrolytes in your system with Gatorade or other sports drinks, get something on your stomach, and sleep it off as best you can.


Try a bullseye, which is a mixture of fresh-squeezed (the fresh is important) orange juice and a raw egg. Kick your hangover rocky style.
Taking Ibuprofen when you've still got alcohol on your stomach may help to decrease the hangover symptoms, but it's incredibly bad for your stomach lining and is a bad habit to get into. Try to avoid taking any kind of pills.

, Pre-gaming with eggs is a good idea and so is post-gaming. Go all out. Get some hashbrowns, pancakes, scrambled eggs, etc. It's the best time to get something good in your stomach, even if you don't feel like it.


If you don't have an appetite, try to eat some toast. The blandness of some dry toast will be easy to get down, and the bread has absorption qualities that'll help sop up any stray booze in your system.

, Working out, going for a jog, or even doing some light physical exercise can help you start feeling better more quickly. Just getting out of the house and going for a walk can make you feel much better if you're feeling partied out. It may seem like sitting inside with the shades drawn is the only way to cure it, but getting your muscles moving and sweating some will help your body process the toxins and get it out more quickly.

Have a TV night.,
Organize a swap meet.,
Ask people to come over after an event.",How to Socialize Without Spending Money2," Between the price of tickets and the cost of snacks, seeing a movie in theaters can be pricey. Instead of spending a lot of money going out, have friends over for a movie night. Have people bring over DVDs or take advantage of your Netflix account.If you're into seeing movies as they come out, newer movies are often available to rent online. You can rent the newest releases using a service like Amazon, so you can see new movies shortly after they hit the theaters.

, Board games are a cheap way to entertain guests. If you're broke, but want to do some socializing over the weekend, bust out a deck of cards or some of your favorite board games. Have friends over for a game night.If you're low on money for snacks, make some baked good or other snack foods using the ingredients you currently have in your kitchen.
You can also encourage friends to bring over their own snacks and drinks for the night.

, Going out to eat is fun, but it gets pricey. If you and your friends want to get together for a meal, why not offer to host a potluck? Everyone can bring their own dish and you can all share. This will cut down on spending for everyone involved.Instead of going out and buying ingredients to make a dish, go through your fridge and pantry. Challenge yourself to make something without spending any money.
If you really want to make the night about saving money, you can make a rule that no one buys ingredients for their dish. This can be a fun challenge that will keep everyone's spending in check.

, If there's a show you watch regularly, you can have a standing invitation to have your friends over each night the show airs. You can also host a party where you marathon watch your favorite TV shows on Netflix. Staying in and unwinding in front of the television allows you to socialize without spending too much money.As with a movie night, invite everyone to bring their own drinks and snacks. Try to whip appetizers and sweets using only the ingredients you currently have in your kitchen.

, A swap meet can be a fun event where everyone saves money and reduces clutter in their home. Encourage everyone to go through their closets and find clothing and other items they no longer need. Then, you and your friends can all trade items. This can be a fun way to socialize, cut down on clutter, and gain new things you may need.Encourage people to bring drinks and appetizers to the event. This can make it more fun and prevent you from having to spend on refreshments.

, If all your friends are going out to an event, but you can't afford it, this can be disappointing. However, you don't have to feel left out just because you can't, say, afford a movie ticket or a ticket to a concert. Make your place the spot for the after party.For example, say all your friends are going to a concert. If the invitation is extended to you, say something like, ""I can't really afford that right now, but thanks for the invite. I would love to see you guys, so if you want to come hang out at my place afterwards, that would be great.""
Oftentimes, an event will get out early. Your friends will probably want to stay out and socialize, but bars and other places can get pricey. People will probably appreciate you giving them somewhere to go afterwards.

"
"
Eat before you go out.,
Avoid bars.,
Pay attention to hidden costs.,
Encourage friends to be understanding of your money issues.",How to Socialize Without Spending Money3," Oftentimes, you go out without the intention of spending money but end up getting hungry. Social events often revolve around food. You may, for example, go to a free concert thinking you won't spend a time, only to be tantalized by the smell of the hot dog stand. You may go hang out at a friend's place and end up pitching in for pizza even though you planned on not spending money. Eating before a social event can help you resist this temptation.Have a big meal before you go out. Stick to healthy foods that won't leave you hungry later, like whole wheats, fruits and vegetables, and lean proteins.
This can also be helpful if you're trying to lose weight. You will fill up on healthy foods and won't waste calories on junk food.

, If you do end up spending a little money socializing, try not to do so at a bar. Bars are notorious for having high prices. The cost of alcohol at a bar is much greater than it would be simply buying alcohol at a store. If your friends want to get drinks, suggest you have drinks at someone's place rather than out at a bar., Even free events can have unexpected costs, so watch out for these. Try to eliminate hidden costs when you can. You may, for example, have to pay for parking at a free concert. You can eliminate this cost, however, by taking public transportation., It's not easy having to budget while wanting to be social. Your friends may sometimes struggle to understand the issue. Try to encourage them to lighten up and spend.If your friends are trying to pressure you into spending money, say something like, ""I know you guys want me to have fun, but I'm really trying to save right now.""
It can sometimes help to explain your financial situation. For example, ""I'm trying to pay off my credit card right now"" or ""I really need to save up for that new car.""

Affirm good ideas.,
Ask questions.,
Further a point.",How to Speak Up in Meetings2," You don’t have to add anything mind-blowing or groundbreaking when you want to speak up at a meeting. You can agree with someone or tell them that you like their idea. Everyone likes to feel understood and complimented, so your comment may go far with them.For example, say, “I really like what Heidi said” or, “I think that’s a great idea and we should start working on it, Rea.”

, Speak up by seeking clarification for things that are unclear. You can ask someone to expand on their idea or take it in a different direction. Questions can also help to further develop the understanding of the topic. Asking questions gets you engaged and involved.Say, “Can you clarify that?” or, “What do you mean by that?”

, You don’t have to come up with creative ideas on your own to contribute to a meeting. Speaking up is as easy as saying, “Everyone seems to agree on this, let’s move forward.” If you want to add something to what another person has said, say, “To build on what Sheri said, I’d like to add…”You can even say, “Were you going to say something, Kai?”

"
"
Take notes during the meeting.,
Set a goal.,
Pay attention to your body language.,
Raise your hand.,
Offer to take the next steps.",How to Speak Up in Meetings3," Taking notes during a meeting can help you to come up with ideas for how to chime in and it may also help you to feel more confident. Taking notes will also show that you are engaged even if you are not speaking. You will also find it easier to remember what was said during the meeting.

, If you want to speak up but never seem to get a word in, set a goal to speak. For example, try to speak up at least once at each meeting, or make a comment once each week. Wait for a pause and then jump in. It may feel weird at first, but give yourself time to adjust. Soon, you’ll feel more comfortable making your voice heard., If you’re looking down and not making eye contact, turning away, fumbling with your notes, or appear nervous, people may not take you seriously. Use your hands to gesture, instead of keeping them in your pockets or crossed in front of you. If you’re standing, point your feet straight ahead and lean slightly forward with your feet hip-width apart. This shows that you’re confident and engaged.Even if you don’t feel confident, your body can fake it and command attention in the room.

, Raising your hand is the easiest way to join a conversation no matter what the format is. If you struggle to know when to speak up, raise your hand. This indicates to others that you’d like to speak and want to go next. Especially if someone is currently speaking and you want to add or comment on it, briefly raise your hand to indicate you’d like to go next or add something to the discussion.Raise your hand and make eye contact with someone to make sure you’ve been seen.

, If someone brings up a point that needs further research or action, speak up and offer to follow-up on it. If a topic needs to be furthered for the next meeting, be the one to take it on. This can give you some time to prepare and also nudges you to participate in the next meeting.Offer to do some follow-up work and present it in the next meeting. This way, you can be prepared and have a slideshow or handouts.

"
"
Prepare what you want to say.,
Acknowledge your pre-meeting stress.,
Face your negative thoughts.,
Take some deep breaths.,
Care for your body.",How to Speak Up in Meetings4," Have some topics or ideas ready to raise in your meeting. Jotting down some notes can help you know what you want to say. Bring a notebook with you so that you’re prepared to say what you want to confidently. Prepare some examples and ready yourself for questions.For example, if the meeting is about increasing productivity, write down some ideas that can help encourage people to be less distracted.

, If you’re feeling nervous, that’s okay. Don’t pretend like you’re not. Instead, embrace these feelings to show that you’re ready to bring your best. Remember that it’s normal to feel nervous or stressed, but you can use these feelings to propel yourself to get excited.Say to yourself, “I’m a bit shaky, but I can bring this energy to my presentation.”
Practicing accepting unpleasant emotions will help them to diminish over time.

, Challenging your negative thoughts is important because they are contributing to your fears. You might question yourself or feel like whatever you say will be inferior to what other people say. If you have negative thoughts about your abilities, start to fight back against them. Take those “What if…” thoughts, self-criticisms, and fears of making mistakes and challenge them. What would you do if the worst outcome did happen? If you’re feeling self-critical, ask yourself what evidence backs up your criticisms and if you can find positive thoughts to replace them instead.For example, if you’re thinking, “I’m going to mess this up,” ask yourself, “When is a time I succeeded even when I was nervous? How can I do that again now?”

, To relax your body, try breathing from your diaphragm and not your chest. Get into a comfortable position then put one hand on your belly. Take a breath in through your nose and notice your hand and stomach move as you inhale. Exhale through your mouth and notice your stomach emptying of air. Do this three to ten times until you start feeling very relaxed.Do some relaxation to calm your nerves. Try some meditation to reduce stress. Relaxing activities can be healthy outlets for your stress and are best practiced regularly., If you have a big meeting and are feeling anxious, take good care of your body ahead of time. Get plenty of sleep the night before and wake up feeling rested. Eat healthy meals and limit your caffeine intake, as caffeine and other stimulants can increase feelings of anxiety.If you normally drink coffee each day, don’t automatically cut it out that day, as this can lead to withdrawal symptoms. However, don’t drink more caffeine than you normally would.

For this reason, it's very important that you always look neat and well-groomed.Wash your hair regularly and get it cut often so that it looks neat.
Always wear clean clothes.
Bathe every day to avoid smelling badly.;
, People generally find attractive people less creepy than unattractive people. While you should not go to great lengths to change your appearance just to satisfy other people, you may want to consider taking some small steps to make yourself more attractive.People tend to find under-eye bags creepy. If you have these, there are a variety of ways to minimize their appearance, including reducing your alcohol and sodium intake, treating your seasonal allergies, sleeping on your back, removing your makeup before bed, using sunscreen, quitting smoking, and applying a cool compress to your eyes.Bulging eyes are also generally considered creepy. If you're a woman, try applying dark eye shadow to your lids and curling your eyelashes to help them appear less bulging., The way you dress is the aspect of your appearance that you have the most control over. Because people tend to associate anything out of the ordinary with creepiness, try to keep your clothing neutral and on-trend.Steer clear of clothing that doesn't match or doesn't fit you well. It's also best to avoid anything that looks like it should be worn as part of a costume, like a cape.
Don't wear clothing with slogans that promote violence or dehumanize women, as this may make people think you are potentially violent, and thus creepy.There's nothing wrong with wearing clothes that express your personality, but if you're really concerned about other people thinking you're creepy, be careful about wearing anything too unique. If you're unsure whether an outfit will make you look creepy, try asking a trusted friend or relative what they think.
You don't need to be extremely fashion forward to not look creepy. A simple pair of jeans and a t-shirt is usually a safe choice.

, People typically find it creepy when others talk about morbid topics, especially for extended periods of time. It's best to avoid these topics altogether, unless you are sure that the person you are talking about will be interested. Some topics to avoid include death, torture, and sexual fetishes.People tend to assume that individuals whose professions or hobbies involve death are creepy, so if you enjoy taxidermy or work as a mortician, you may want to avoid bringing these topics up with new acquaintances. If it comes up, you can laugh and acknowledge ""It's a little creepy!"", and then talk about a more cheerful topic.
There are also some less obvious topics that many people find weird. The best example is clowns, which give lots of people the creeps.
While talking about sex is not always creepy, taking about it constantly or at inappropriate times definitely is. If you're ever unsure whether it is appropriate, avoid bringing it up., Getting too personal too fast will definitely make you seem creepy. It's important to respect people's privacy, especially if you don't know them well. For example, asking someone how much money they make is typically considered rude. Asking a more obscure question, like what blood type the person is, is just plain creepy because you have no need to know that information.Even if you know someone well, be careful about asking obtrusive or rude questions. If you ever want to ask something but you're not sure if it's appropriate, consider prefacing the question by saying something like, ""I'm sorry if this is a weird question"" or ""Forgive me for asking.""

, Most people do not appreciate uninvited sexual advances. To avoid being seen as a creep, it's best to avoid advancing on someone you've just met. If you are really interested in the person, try getting to know them first instead of just trying to pick them up.Men are much more likely to be considered creepy when they make uninvited sexual advances on women than vice versa. In fact, women tend to think that ""creepy"" men pose some kind of sexual threat, and may be afraid of them.
Compliments are okay, but try not to go overboard. If you have just met a person, try only offering one compliment instead of several. You can decrease your chances of the compliment being interpreted as creepy if you avoid staring at the person before offering it and if you try talking to the person and getting to know each other a bit first.

, When people are at work, busy, or ""trapped"" (e.g. working a shift at a coffee shop), it is not the right time to flirt.


Don't catcall; this is creepy.Don't assume that a friendly waiter or barista is flirting. Their job requires them to be polite, and they are ""trapped"" because they need to work and stay polite.If you absolutely want to date them, leave your phone number with the check, so there is no pressure.
Do not flirt with people who are much younger than you. If you are an adult, don't flirt with minors, no matter how ""mature"" they look or act.

, If they are interested (open body language, genuinely smiling or laughing, touching you, etc.), then you can continue flirting. If they show signs of discomfort (closed-off body language, looking away, plastered-on smile, fake laugh, avoiding eye contact, frowning), then they are not interested.Apologize for making them uncomfortable, and stop. Flirting with someone who clearly doesn't like it is one of the fastest ways to be seen as creepy.


Some people are shy. If they are smiling, then gently proceed. If they look upset, stop right away.
Start small. Talk to them, flirt, and see how they respond. Then amp it up if you are getting a positive response. Sending an unsolicited photo of your genitals to a stranger is the exact opposite of what you want to do.Some dating guides tell people (usually men flirting with women) to push the other person's boundaries. This is bad advice, and may scare them and get you pepper sprayed. Always respect someone else's comfort level., If someone says something like ""I need alone time,"" ""don't touch me,"" or ""stop it,"" stop right away. This is a mark of good manners and shows that you are non-threatening. Non-creepy people know how to take ""no"" for an answer.If someone looks like they want to leave a conversation, give them an opportunity to do so. Trying to make them stay can make you seem creepy.Some people, especially women, disabled people, and abuse survivors, may be afraid to express boundaries. Pay attention to their body language. If they're uncomfortable, it might be good to give them some space.

, Dispel the notion that you deserve a girlfriend, or that you are owed sex. Recognize that potential partners are people, not rewards earned by being a ""nice guy.""Work on becoming a better listener, accepting rejection, and respecting the other person's thoughts and feelings. Responding with anger or disrespect when someone won't date you is a hallmark of creeps.Potential dates are not your enemies.If you have to fight them in order to get to them, you're doing it wrong, and it's time to quit.If someone turns you down, it isn't a black mark against you. Maybe you aren't their type, they're too busy for a relationship, or their sexual orientation is incompatible. It doesn't mean that there's anything wrong with you, or that the universe is out to get you.

, Unpredictability is a hallmark of creepiness, so do your best to act in a normal and expected way. People will not want to be around you if they are never sure how you will behave.Avoid jumping out at people or trying to surprise them.
Avoid sudden outbursts, especially if they could be interpreted as violent. If you feel an outburst coming on, say ""I need some air"" and leave to cool off.
Always try to gauge the appropriateness of your behavior by assessing the atmosphere and watching how others are behaving. For example, if you are giving a formal presentation, you would be expected to stand up straight and look at the crowd, so people might find it creepy if you were sitting down and looking at the floor., Masking your agenda can make you come off as creepy to others.Do your best to be open and honest about your intentions, and be assertive instead of passive-aggressive.


For example, a guy who pretends he just wants to be friends with a girl, and suddenly tells her that he likes her, may startle her and make her uncertain how to act.This guy would be better off flirting with her, continuing the flirtation if she responded well, and then explaining his feelings. This way, she is not caught by surprise, and has had time to get used to the idea.

, Racism, sexism, et cetera are often viewed as creepy.Making derogatory comments about groups of people will make them not trust you, and feel unsafe around you. Treating everyone with dignity, without making snap judgments, will help others view you positively.


Don't talk down to others (including women and disabled people), and don't use nicknames like ""sweetie"" or shortened names (e.g. calling a woman ""Jessie"" when everyone calls her Jessica). Save them for people you are close with, if they like it.
Avoid stereotypes such as ""that's women's work,"" ""Muslims are violent,"" or ""bisexuals are cheaters."" Work on being open-minded and accepting of others, and challenge any negative stereotypes.
Know basic manners around disabled people. Respect their personal space, offer help before jumping in, don't ask about their abilities to feed/clean/toilet/have sex,and treat them like adults (unless they are literal children).

, Honest mistakes do happen, and you may accidentally creep someone out. If this is the case, you can improve their opinion of you by acting like a mature, upstanding person. Take direct responsibility and apologize.Instead of saying ""I'm sorry, but...."" say ""I'm sorry, and..."" This makes it clearer that you aren't trying to make an excuse, just offer an explanation, without diminishing any harm done.
For example, ""I'm sorry if I made you uncomfortable by complimenting your dress. I thought it was a nice dress, and my intent was to make your day a little better, not to make you uncomfortable. But clearly, that's not what happened, and I'm very sorry. Can we start over?""

, Your facial expressions are just as important as the words you use when communicating with people. When these deviate from what is considered normal, they can cause people to feel uncomfortable. Do your best to express genuine emotions in your facial expressions.The reason that many people find masks creepy is because they obscure facial expressions. If your facial expressions don't seem appropriate to other people, they will have the same reaction as they would to an expressionless mask.If you feel that you are not able to show emotions with your facial expressions, pay close attention to the way that others look in specific situations and try to mimic their facial expressions. Practice in front of a mirror if you need to.

, Creepy people tend to incite a vague fear of physical violence in other people, so you should do your best to make sure you do not give off this impression. Never make any gesture that could be interpreted as violent, even if you are just kidding.Examples of violent gestures include pointing your finger at someone (including yourself) as if it were a gun, cracking your knuckles while staring at someone, or pretending to slit your throat with your finger. There are many others as well, so always take a moment to think about how other people might perceive you before you make any gesture.
Shouting at people may also make them worry that you will turn violent. Keep your volume moderate, even when you are upset.

, People often get uncomfortable when others stare at them, and they may worry that the staring person has sinister intentions. To avoid being seen as a creep, don't stare at people for extended periods of time, whether you know them or not.Taking unwanted photographs is just as creepy as staring, if not more so. Asking for permission does not reduce the creepiness at all.On the flip side, people may also find it creepy if you don't make eye contact while talking to them, so it's important to find a healthy balance.If you have a disability that makes eye contact hard (e.g. autism), look at their forehead, eyebrows, nose, or chin. This is close enough.
If you tend to get lost in thought, stare in a direction where there aren't people. This way, they won't think that you're staring at them.

, A lot of people will get creeped out if you touch them while having a conversation or stand unnecessarily close to them. Help people feel more comfortable around you by giving them a little space.You do not need to touch someone in an inappropriate way in order for it to be perceived as creepy. Even an innocent touch can seem strange, especially if you do not know the person well.
When you're talking to someone, avoid cornering them and making them feel claustrophobic.
If you're going to touch someone, let them see it coming, so they aren't startled. This way, they can also decline if they don't want to be touched.

Introduce yourself.,
Share some information about how you came to the party.,
Ask a friend to introduce you.",How to Mingle With Strangers at Parties1," Select a party-goer and approach them. Tell them who you are. You might, for instance, say, “Hi, I’m Mike,” then shake hands with them. Ensure your handshake is neither too limp nor too hard., If you’re attending an office party, you might say, “I work in accounting.” If you’re attending a party with a friend, you could say, “I came with my friend Maven and I don’t know anyone else here.”, You don’t always have to mingle with strangers at parties alone. If you are attending the party as a guest, rely on the person you are attending with to introduce you to others. For instance, when you and your escort arrive at the party and they start mingling with people they know, they should say, ""Allow me to introduce my friend, Reginald."""

Prep yourself.,
Pre-party.,
Display value.,
Get in the zone.,
Talk to her!,
Flirt hard!,
Dance with her.,
Give her space.,
Make your move.,
Have a game plan.",How to Meet a Girl at a Party," First things first: wear your favorite clothes. If you just bought a new shirt put it on. Just wear clothes that make you feel comfortable, confident, and make sure that in your head you KNOW you look good in them. Prepping also involves smelling good, so take a shower, shave, and put on your favorite cologne. While getting showered and dressed, play your favorite music so you will be energized and in the party mood. This will help you clear you head of stresses and get you pumped to go out and meet women.;
, Before you arrive at the actual party, get some friends together (preferably at your place) and start socializing. Have some drinks to loosen yourself up before you walk into the party. Make sure there's music at the pre-party to get you and your friends on the same level. Be careful not to drink too much though! You do not want to show up too drunk to the actual party.

, Show up with a group of friends and/or have your friends greet you at the door. Make sure you're excited to see everyone you know at the party and they will be excited to see you too. Girls notice a guy’s presence when he walks into a room and people jump up to greet him. It conveys a high social status and a girl just might become attracted to you before you even say hello.

, Scope out the party and feel the vibe. Then, be above that! You need your energy level to be at its highest. Run around to different groups of friends and strangers and start conversations. You will look fun and sociable. Girls will notice this and they will be more relaxed around you if people seem to like you. If you're lucky, someone from on of the groups you interact with will introduce you to that cute girl you've been checking out.

, Do not act shy or nervous. Do not just stand around looking at the girl you want to talk to every few seconds. Girls can smell insecurity from a mile away and it’s a major turn off. Find any excuse to talk to her (use your environment, talk about someone you both might know, notice something about her).

, Flirting can involve any type of playful teasing. Challenge her to a drinking game or invite her to be your partner. This will open up tons of doors for flirting (tease her if she misses in beer pong, blame her for losing a game in a playful way etc.). Continue having fun with her as much as possible and do not stop building the attraction. If she laughs and playfully punches you while you flirt this is a GOOD thing! Avoid any normal “interview” conversations such as “where do you live?” and “what do you do?” Keep the conversation fun and entertaining. Tell her a cool story, tease her a little, make fun of some of the drunk people at the party etc.

, If you two haven’t been lightly touching each other during your flirty conversations this is a good way to get physical. Make sure you have some dance moves because it can be a real turn off if a guy can’t dance. Now you don’t need to be a pro, but if she likes how you dance, the attraction will be amplified even more. If you two are really digging each other at this point and you feel it, you can go right to making your move.

, This means do not stick around her all night. Let her have fun with her friends, and show her that you’re having fun with your friends as well. Following her around all night shows that you’re clingy and needy which is extremely unattractive. Also, giving her space will give her time to think about you and miss you. During this time, stay calm, cool, and in control. Do not be jealous if you see other guys talking to her. Act like you already have it in the bag and she will notice. This step can go in any order of the list after you have begun the flirty conversation with her and you can do this multiple times throughout the night (a good opportunity to meet other girls too!).

, After giving her a little space, let her come back to you (and if she doesn’t, just make eye contact, smile, and start the conversation back up). If she’s giving you the eye and has all her attention on you, wait for the right moment in the conversation such as a pause after something funny or flirty while looking at each other and kiss her. If you are afraid she is not the type of girl that hooks up at a party or if her friends are keeping her eye on you, grab her phone number.

, Parties can be short lived. Count on the police breaking it up and having a place to go after with her. Also, know where you are sleeping. Secure a room in the house or have a place to crash close to the party so you can bring her back. If that is not your intention, simply tell her you will call her at the end of the night and kiss her goodnight.

Find people who look lonely or overwhelmed.,
Talk to groups of two.,
Talk to the life of the party.",How to Mingle With Strangers at Parties2," If you see someone alone in a corner looking at their phone, they might want to mingle but not know quite how. Approach them and ask some questions to get the conversation going. For instance, you might say, “Great party, right?” or “Hi! Do you know anyone here?”, If you find two people talking together, they’re probably either a romantic couple or just two random people who started talking to each other. In either case, groups of two are easy to mingle with. Join their conversation or kick the conversation off by asking, “So, how do you two know each other?”, This person probably knows many of the other party-goers, and can help you mingle with strangers by introducing you to them. Talking to the life of the party is easy because they are extroverted and will carry most of the conversation.Identify the life of the party by looking for certain personality traits. The life of the party often has a boisterous laugh and attracts many people to them. They might also have a sophisticated storytelling capability that inspires or amuses others.

"
"
Hover around the periphery.,
Ask an engaging question.,
Look for an opening to jump in.",How to Mingle With Strangers at Parties3," Approach a group of three or more people who are involved in a conversation. Hang around the outer edge of the group and listen to what they’re saying., While someone is talking about something of interest, ask them to elaborate a bit. For instance, if the speaker is telling a story about traveling down the Mekong River, you might interject with a question like, “Is the water deep?” or “Did you go with a group or were you alone?”The best questions will show the speaker that you’re interested in what they’re saying, and will enable them to talk more about their experience.

, If someone in the group is sharing a story that you can relate to, or discussing an experience similar to your own, listen attentively. After they’ve concluded, share your own feelings or tell a related story. For instance, if someone is talking about their trip to the Eiffel Tower, you could jump in by saying, “Ah, yes, did you go to the top? The view is amazing.”"
"
Engage in small talk.,
Compliment others.,
Discuss topics relevant to the party.,
Allow your conversation partners to respond.,
Respond appropriately.,
Give detailed answers.,
Exit gracefully.,
Move around.,
Avoid negative comments.",How to Mingle With Strangers at Parties4," After introducing yourself, inquire about your conversation partner. Most people love to talk about themselves, so ask them about their work, their interests, or what they like to do for fun. For instance, you might ask, “So, do you have any weekend plans?”Seize upon commonalities, if any emerge in the course of conversation. For example, if someone intends to see a movie you’re interested in seeing, exclaim, “Ah, yes, that film looks interesting! I intend to see it as well!”

, After introducing yourself to someone at the party, you could try using flattery to create good feelings between you and the other person. For instance, you might say, “Wow, I love your earrings” or “That’s a sharp suit. Where’d you get it?”, This can encompass a range of different conversation subjects depending on the circumstances of the party. For instance, if you’re mingling with strangers at a Halloween party, you could say, “Wow, I love your costume” or “So, tell me about your costume.” If you’re at a party for the opening of a museum exhibit, ask your conversation partner, “Have you ever been here before?” or “Are you familiar with this artist?”Talking about the food or venue in a positive way are also appropriate.

, Good conversation should be a give-and-take experience. Don’t ramble on endlessly. Share your feelings or ideas, then allow someone else to jump in. If your conversation partner hasn’t said anything in a while, ask them a question or solicit their opinion just to ensure you., If someone tells a whimsical or lighthearted joke or story, laugh or respond with an equally lighthearted comment. This will make the conversation enjoyable for everyone involved., If someone asks you how you know the host, you could answer with a plain answer like, “We work together.” Instead, try to spice your answers up with a story. For instance, you might reply to the same question about the host by saying, “I met her on my first day of work. She had all these pictures of pigs spread out on the light table and was looking at each one carefully with a magnifying glass.”Include funny or memorable details in your story. Smile and laugh when appropriate.

, There are several ways to end a conversation. You could declare your intention to get another drink or some food. You might also make an observation like, “It’s rather warm in here,” then exit the conversation.Finally, you could drag someone else into the conversation to “replace” you. For instance, you might say, “Shirley, come over here and listen to what Gina was saying about bees. It’s truly fascinating.”
There’s no right or wrong time to end a conversation, but if you’re bored or if someone is talking your ear off, you should think about leaving.

, Mingling requires moving around, meeting lots of people, and not getting stuck in one place. After exiting one conversation, find or start another., When mingling with strangers at a party, do not criticize the host, the other guests, or the venue. This will get a bad reaction from many people. Plus, since you’re talking to a stranger, you could be talking to a relative or close friend of the host, who might be deeply offended by your comments.For the same reason, avoid subjects that focus on pain, misfortune, or tragedy.
Gossip or controversial topics are also taboo.

"
"
Enjoy yourself.,
Speak and act with confidence.,
Think of the party as a judgment-free zone.",How to Mingle With Strangers at Parties5," Have fun and smile at the party. Show interest in the conversations you’re having with others. If you are having fun, others will too, and the time you spend mingling with strangers will be a success.Even if you don't know anyone, walk into the room with a smile like you know at least half the people there. Chances are you will get smiles in return.

, When mingling with strangers at a party, square your shoulders, look people in the eye, and smile as you introduce yourself. Speak in a calm, measured tone. Don’t rush your sentences and keep your voice at a natural volume., When mingling with strangers at a party, remember that you’re not under the microscope. Instead of thinking negative thoughts like “Everyone is studying my every move. If I say or do the wrong thing, I will be ridiculed and ostracized.”Many other people are likely in the same situation you are.
When meeting strangers, think of them as your friends.

Swap contact information with people you are getting to know again.",How to Make the Most of a High School Reunion Weekend," Use social networking tools like Facebook or Myspace, email or use some other means of communication that is easy and accessible for everyone.


As you get older you may find many social barriers have been forgotten and people you rarely associated with are now great friend material.;
,, This is especially helpful if you plan to spend time with these friends outside of the sanctioned events for the weekend.


Try to stay in the same hotel as your good friends. Coordinate which hotel ahead of time and try to book as far in advance as possible to get the room size and amenities you will need for a weekend. Helpful amenities may include shuttle services, in-room refrigerator for snacks and drinks, and a seating area with couch for entertaining.
If you and a friend are traveling from the same town you can coordinate flying the same flight or riding together.
People who live closer and aren't flying can pack extras such as food and drinks or other items that may be cumbersome to travel with by air.
Ask for connecting rooms or rooms on the same floor as your friends that are also traveling to the reunion.
Arrive early on your check in day. By arriving late you may risk losing the room with amenities you were hoping to book.
If your reunion is putting a strain on local hotels, you should call to confirm your reservation. Don't forget to pack a copy of any reservation confirmation before you leave home.

, Also discuss what other plans or family obligations they may have while in town.


Just because it is your high school reunion doesn't mean you must only do sanctioned events.

,


A reunion is a great way to have many of your oldest and dearest friends in town at the same time.
Plan an afternoon or evening out with your closest friends. Try going out for breakfast or brunch with your friends if it's more appealing than the picnic planned.
Just one small gathering with your oldest friends is a great way to break up the hustle of a busy weekend with large reunion events planned.
If anyone still lives in the town, consider grilling out, gathering for cocktails before or after and event or just looking through photo albums.

, Encourage your friends to do the same.


Make sure you coordinate how you will share and swap photos after the event.
Consider a photo site that you and your friends can access and share.
Let your friends know ahead of time if embarrassing photos should be tagged on social networking sites. Perhaps agree the photos should only be seen by a certain group unless they are tame. Some people have jobs that discourage the posting of photos involving alcohol.

, Drive around town with your friends and enjoy the memories. Don't forget those secret party spots and hang outs that were popular only to your group. Take pictures and enjoy remembering those sites with your friends.

, This is great if you have a very witty group of friends. This can be just as fun as taking photographs. Use a small notebook that can be taken everywhere and encourage your group to write ideas, thoughts and those funny one-liners.


Avoid rude remarks about other classmates, though. You don't want the book in the wrong hands. Remember, this is a high school reunion, not high school.

, Encourage everyone to send in good photos of people. Try to avoid the embarrassing ones. Remember, you'll want everyone to be comfortable and have a good time. Have the slide show featured at an event and have the pictures made available online.

, Combine the video with some still photos and music for a great documentary of your weekend. Send these to your friends that star in the project.

,


Have your closest friends over for cocktails. By having a suite with a couch or extra chairs you can be more comfortable.
Sit around in your pajamas with your oldest friends and catch up at night once the events have ended.
Ask for a room with a refrigerator to keep beverages cool or keep a cooler with ice on hand.
Stop by the store for light snacks and munchies on your way into town.
Buy or bring cups or plastic glasses for beer or wine since it may be difficult to find glassware after hours in your hotel.
Remember bottle openers and the corkscrew for the wine.
Pick up wine from any popular vineyards in your area or beverages that are popular to your area for sharing. You can try the cheap beer and old favorites from high school if your group is particularly nostalgic.

,, Invite friends to drop by but give them a time frame so your schedule isn't compromised.

, You can have this framed and send as gifts for the holidays or sometime after your reunion.


Look through old photos and try to recreate a ""Then"" and ""Now"" picture. Try to take the image in the same order. It will be fun to frame these side by side for comparison of how everyone has changed.

,, It's alright if you go solo and spend the weekend with your friends.


Many events won't appeal to children and your activities will be limited depending on your access to childcare.
If you're worried about your spouse being bored you can give them the option of attending.
Most events are planned for the returning students and not child appropriate. Don't impose on other classmates by dragging your kids to every event.

, Make the event a roadtrip if you and other friends are traveling from other states.


Load your MP3 player or create CDs with your favorite music from high school.
Coordinate picking up any friends along the way or meeting at a midpoint and riding together
Someone from farther away can fly to your town and drive with you the rest of the way. You'll need to coordinate flights and getting them back to the airport. This is especially helpful if your high school isn't near an airport or if your friend can find a cheaper flight to your town.
If you are traveling somewhere with nice weather and it's in the budget, consider renting a convertible.

, If your friends want to go out for a nice brunch or a night out on the town, you should be prepared.

, Don't forget mobile uploads. Play your favorite music from your high school days while you're getting ready or your friends are visiting.

, It will be easier to coordinate.

, Don't try to overdo it or show off. Chances are you will look back at the photos and cringe.


Depending on your town and the planning committee the events may range from very casual to semi-formal.
Make sure you pack for these scheduled events as well as hanging out and doing things with your friends.
Since most of your photos will be with your better friends it is better if you are all observing the same dress code. You don't want to be the only one in shorts or khakis if everyone else is in cocktail dresses and suits.
Make sure you are packing the appropriate attire if there is an event or restaurant nearby that you are interested in breaking away and visiting with your friends. If it's something very specific you should let everyone know ahead of time to pack the appropriate attire or footwear. A trip to a local amusement park may require serious walking shoes whereas a local fine dining restaurant may require something more sophisticated. At least discuss bringing the appropriate items in case you are able go. It would be a shame for everyone to miss out on something because someone didn't bring the right outfit or shoes.

, Share ideas, recipes and work out tips. If you live near a high school friend you can buddy up for work outs and dieting.

, Don't try to impress those people you wanted to impress in high school. Being self-confident is impressive enough.

, Take a group and go on a tour or a mini-road trip to a nearby attraction.

,, Events may have changed, been moved or replaced by other events. Go over the details with your friends to avoid any surprises before you make any plans.

, Not everyone is still a party animal so remember to drink in moderation. You'll want to remember the reunion and not be the laughingstock.

, If you don't have business cards you can print up your own with your basic contact information, your married name, your web address or any url to your social networking sites.


Married women should include your name as FIRST MAIDEN LAST so that your new contacts won't have questions about spelling or keeping everyone's married name straight.
By having something to hand out you can also coordinate the sharing of photos.
Pass out business cards and network with old classmates. Just remember that it's a reunion and not a convention. People will be put off if you spend all weekend trying to ""work"" them.
Unless they press and ask questions you should limit chatting about work to one or two sentences. Don't spend all night taking about your job.

Study famous monologues.,
Use monologues at the appropriate time.,
Learn the difference between a monologue and a soliloquy.,
Always use monologues to show change in a character.,
Give your monologue a beginning, middle, and end.",How to Make a Monologue1," From Hamlet's famous inner turmoils to Quint's harrowing WWII story in Jaws, monologues can be used in drama to add depth to a character. Monologues give us an arrow into characters' insights and their motivations. It's less a plot device (though it should always serve to move the plot forward) than a character study that happens out loud. Get familiar with some of the classic monologues of theatre and film to study the form. Check out:


The sales speech that opens David Mamet's ""Glengarry Glen Ross""
Hamlet's monologues
The ""I could have been a contender"" speech in ""On the Waterfront""
The ""I ate the divorce papers"" speech from ""Goodbye Charles,"" by Gabriel Davis
Masha's ""I'm telling you this because you're a writer"" speech in Chekhov's ""The Seagull""
Draped-in-a-flag Bill the Butcher giving the ""Honorable man"" speech in ""Gangs of New York"";
, A play written for the stage or the screen will be a complicated series of dialogs, actions, and silences. Knowing when to allow a monologue to surface in the plot will take some practice. You'll want to have most of the plot essentials and the characters figured out before worrying about monologues. They should emerge organically as the script dictates.


Some monologues are used to introduce characters, while some scripts will use monologues to allow a taciturn character to suddenly speak up and change the way the audience feels about them.
In general, a good time in the script to use a monologue would be at moments of change, when one character needs to reveal something to another character.

, For a true monologue, another character must be present to hear the speech. If not, it's a soliloquy. The soliloquy is a classical technique not commonly used in contemporary drama, but is still sometimes used in one-person plays and experimental theatre.


Inner monologues or voice over narration are a different category of exposition, more like a dramatic aside to the audience than a monologue. Monologues need to assume the presence of other characters who hear the action, providing an important interaction that can be the fuel for or the purpose of the monologue.

, A good opportunity for a monologue is anytime a character is undergoing a significant change of heart or attitude. Allowing them to open up and reveal their inner tension is a benefit to the reader and plot.


Even if the character is not changed significantly, perhaps their decision to speak up is a change in and of itself. A taciturn character driven to a long monologue is revealing, when deployed properly. Why have they spoken up now? How does this change the way we feel about them?
Consider allowing the character to change as they speak over the course of their monologue. If a character starts in a rage, it might be more interesting for their to end in hysterics, or laughter. If they start out laughing, maybe they end up contemplative. Use the monologue as a vessel for change.

, If you're going to take the time to put the rest of the story on pause to let one character speak at length, it's safe to say that the writing needs to be structured just like any other piece of writing. If it's a story, it needs to have an arc. If it's a rant, it needs to change into something else. If it's a plea, it needs to up the ante over the course of its pleading.


The beginning of a good monologue will hook the audience and the other characters. The beginning should signal that something important is happening. Like any good dialogue, it shouldn't sputter or waste space with ""Hellos"" and ""How are yous."" Cut to the chase.
In the middle, the monologue should climax. Build it to its maximum height and then bring it back down to lower the tension and allow the conversation between the characters to continue or end entirely. This is where the specific details, the drama, and the tangents in the monologue will occur.
The ending should bring the speech or the story back around to the play at hand. After dwelling on his failures and fatigue, Randy the Ram's heartbreaking speech to his daughter in ""The Wrestler"" ends, ""I just don't want you to hate me, ok?"" The tension of the monologue is relieved and the scene ends on that note of finality.

"
"
Find the character's voice.,
Use a variety of tones.,
Use stories to build character.,
Use exclamation points sparingly.,
Let silence speak also.",How to Make a Monologue2," When we finally get to hear the character speak at length, it should come as no surprise to hear the voice the character uses and the way that they speak. If you're exploring their voice as you write, don't explore it in a long and important monologue, explore it elsewhere in the script.Alternatively, as a freewrite, consider allowing your character to spout off about any number of subjects to develop their voice. Bret Easton Ellis's novel American Psycho features many short exposition chapters in which the main character, Patrick, monologues about various aspects of consumer culture: stereo equipment, pop music, and clothes. Supposedly, Ellis wrote these as character sketches and ended up using them in the novel proper.
Consider filling out a questionnaire for your character, or a character profile. Giving thought to the character in terms of things that won't necessarily be in the script (like your character's room decorating choices, their music playlists, their morning routines, etc.).

, A monologue that starts in one place and ends up somewhere entirely different will make the tension more dramatic, the characters more compelling, and your script much better. A good monologue should be alternatively funny, harrowing, and touching, pointing on no one emotion or no one state by itself.


In the film Good Will Hunting, Matt Damon's character has a great monologue in which he takes a snarky Harvard student down a notch in a bar. While there's humor and triumph in the monologue, there's also a deep sadness and anger that's palpable in his words.

, Monologues can be a great opportunity to pause the main plot of the story and allow a main character to reveal something in their past, to tell an anecdote or a bit of ""background"" about themselves. When done well and at the appropriate moment, an illuminating or surprising story provides color and texture to the main story, giving us another way of seeing the plot at hand.


Quint's story about surviving the USS Indianapolis disaster provides us deep layers into his character. He doesn't wear a life vest because it reminds him of the trauma. The story doesn't necessarily move the plot forward, but it adds tremendous depth and pathos to Quint, who was basically a macho archetype up until that point in the story., Don't mistake drama and tension for ""screaming."" No one wants to see a play or a film in which everyone screams at each other all the time, so learning to work up to the emotional pitch of dramatic moments is the real trick to creating tension and avoiding the shrillness of inexperienced writers writing fights.


Real fights are a roller coaster. People get tired and can't yell their innermost turmoil for much more than a sentence. Use restraint and the tension will be even more palpable if we suspect someone might boil over, but they don't.

, It can be tempting for writers who're just starting out to over-write. To create drama, it's often tempting to add too many characters, too many scenes, and too many words. Practice stepping back and allowing only the most essential components of speech to come into play, especially in a monologue. What's going unsaid?


Look at some of the monologue sermons from the play/film Doubt. When the priest sermonizes about ""gossip,"" there's a lot of particular details that are left out because he's in front of a whole congregation of people. The message delivered to the nun he's in conflict with, however, is pointed and palpable.

Try revising a dramatic monologue to make it comedic.,
Aim for complexity.,
Make it funny, not goofy.,
Write from one pole to another.",How to Make a Monologue3," How might you rewrite one of Pacino's monologues from Scent of a Woman to make it comedic? What if you had to rewrite Quint's story in such a way as to suggest that he might be a liar? Comic writing is difficult because it has much less to do with the content of the writing and much more to do with the presentation of them.


As an exercise, try rewriting ""angry"" monologues to play them up for humor. Comedy and drama share borderlines, making this more do-able than it may seem.
Gabriel Davis is a modern playwright with a great talent for humor and witty scenarios with humor built into them. A woman who eats her divorce papers? A man who decides to have a bar mitzvah at the age of 26? Check. Check out his frequent use of monologues for comedic effect.

, A good monologue won't necessarily be all funny or all serious. Like you want to vary the anger-level of a fight scene, putting funny content into an otherwise tragic situation will leaven the drama with a laugh and help to make the audience feel something complicated. That's what good comedy does.


The films of Martin Scorsese are often notable for combining extremely funny moments with moments of high tension. Jake LaMotta's monologues while preparing to go on stage in Raging Bull are simultaneously humorous and heartbreaking.

, Successful comic monologues generally won't involve toilet humor or bodily functions, unless the other aspects of the drama somehow dictate it. Building in a sense of irony, sarcasm, and some sort of complexity into the humor will make it much more successful and interesting to the general audience.

, Before you write a monologue, decide where it will start and where it will end, even going as far as to write the first and the last sentence; have some idea of how long you'd like the monologue to be, and then filling in the middle space.How would you finish the following first and last lines of a potential monologue?


Your dog is dead. / Wipe that stupid grin off your face!
What is your mother's problem? / I'm not going to Skype with a cat in the room.
Where's the godforsaken half-and-half? / Forget it, forget it, forget it, I'm taking the horse.
Come on, just this once. / I'm never going back to church.

Ask for input from your organization's members.,
Avoid democratic decisions for the rules.,
If someone threatens to quit because they don't agree with the rules, side with the rules and let the person quit.,
Some organizations don't need rules.,
Only create rules you know can be enforced.,
Only create rules you can follow.,
For more immature organizations, offer rewards for following the rules.,
Once you have created your rules, be proud of them and follow them.",How to Write Rules for an Organization," People tend to stop reading the rules part of the way if the list is too long.;
, Creating an organization centered around an online game? Use the rules of the game as guidance for your organization's rules.

, In this case, posting the same rules twice, making universally illegal activity against the rules, or adding rules from different sources without altering them may be considered redundant. To solve the second rule, merely make a ""No illegal activity"" rule.

, If you start making rules like, ""All profit goes to me"" or ""Obey my every command or get kicked out for a month"", you aren't going to get very many people to join.

, If you don't make enough rules, or if there are few punishments for breaking the rules, people will just break the rules. You must also ensure that these rules are enforced.

, The ""let someone off with a warning trick"" does work. Sometimes, people have no idea that they are breaking a rule, and simply need to be told to stop.

, If people begin taking advantage of what the rules say, they need to be written more soundly.

, They might have a few good rule ideas that will keep your organization running with few problems. If they come up with bad ideas, you don't have to add them to the rules.

, Sometimes, the majority may not have the right idea. Either way, it is important to be impartial and think of what rules benefit your organization.

, Unless, of course, they have a point. If someone wants to cause trouble by getting a rule removed, they shouldn't be able to.

, In many cases, the members of an organization have a shared understanding and mutual respect, and don't need to be tied down by regulations. If this is your organization, don't bring rules up.

, If you are running a virtual organization, and one of your rules is not to do something in real life, there is little chance that you know someone would break that rule.

, If your organization is boys-only and you are a girl, for example, you would be breaking a rule.

, Everyone likes positive reinforcement. However, don't make the reward so great that the rules are the only thing your members are focused on, or so little than no one will try to get it anyway.

, Rules are rules for a reason.

This will help you to get clearer about your own thoughts and feelings, and cut down on the possibility of a dull moment in the conversation.For a job interview, research the company ahead of time. If your questions are about specific aspects of the business, it will show you are a serious candidate who has really considered what it would be like to work for them.
If you are meeting someone whose work you admire, take the time to find out more about them so you can ask relevant questions and dig deeper than the average fan.;
, Have a clear answer to the question, ""what do I want from this meeting?"" When you have your own goals in a meeting, you are more likely to be perceived as someone who is mature and competent. It can also help to ""ground"" you in situations where you may be nervous.Your intention should be something within your control. If you are applying for a job, the intention ""I want to get this job"" doesn't give you a specific course of action. Instead, try setting an intention like, ""I want to emphasize these 3 qualifications that I think make me the best candidate."" This is something that it is within your power to do, and will be more helpful as a guide for you during the meeting.

, An elevator pitch is a short summary of who you are and what you do -- and it is not just for elevators! It should be no more than three or four sentences, and it should be able to roll off your tongue with ease.Practice in front of a mirror or with friends until the pitch feels natural and not rehearsed.
Be ready to adjust your pitch for different people and situations.

, How you look really matters when meeting people.You'll want to choose your outfit based on the context of the meeting, so how you dress for a job interview will be different for how you dress for a punk show.

Dress to either stand out or blend in. Great first impressions can be made both ways, and your answer to this question will depend on what your intentions are and your own comfort level. Either way, pay attention to the details of your outfit.How you look isn't just your clothes: it’s also your car or house. Give them a good cleaning if there's a chance the person you want to impress will see them.
Pay attention to your mood. You could be dressed to the nines, but if you are having a terrible day, it will probably show. If it’s possible, avoid having to make first impressions when you are really feeling low., In a job interview or an encounter with someone you may never meet again, the first impression might be your only shot at connecting with the person you are meeting. In other cases, like meeting your co-workers on the first day of a new job or moving to a new town, you may want to simply be friendly and let your capabilities demonstrate themselves in the coming days or weeks., If you have the ability to do so, either suggest a place and time that works best for you, or come to an agreement with the person you are meeting about what works best for you both. Keep in mind that the environment of your first meeting can have a big effect on our mood and stress levels. If you are preparing for a date, pick a place where you think both you and the person you and your date will feel comfortable.
Pick a time of day that allows you time to prepare before hand and relax a bit afterward, so that you aren't rushing from one thing to the next.

, In many business situations, a handshake is important, but there are different customs for greeting in different cultures. If you're unsure about how formally you should greet someone, err on the side of formality. Its better to appear overly polite and professional than to assume a higher comfort level than the other person is ready to allow., Smiles can have a remarkable effect on people, even to the point of allowing them to overcome their own racial and gender biases.They also decrease your own stress levels -- even if they feel ""forced"" at first., Whether you're aware of it or not, your body language is communicates tells things about us to others. You want to appear confident, comfortable in your own skin, and like someone will at ease around. Make appropriate eye contact.
Be aware of any nervous habits you have and work on breaking them.

, Active listening is a skill for really engaging with what others are saying, allowing them to feel like their thoughts are heard, understood, and respected. If you are planning what you are going to say next while another is talking, you probably aren't listening very closely. Focus on what they are saying and ask questions that will allow them to elaborate on their thoughts. , When you are speaking, pay attention to their interest level and be ready to adjust your approach to keep them engaged.

If they are distracted by something that seems interesting, see what has grabbed their attention and remark on it. Don’t try to force them back to you. Move with the flow and share whatever they are interested in together.
If there is nothing obvious distracting them, and they just seem to be elsewhere, this might be a sign you are talking too much. Try asking them a question.

, If you have a great connection with someone during a first encounter, don’t be afraid to say “goodbye for now.” If you really connect, ask to exchange contact info and send a follow up text or email about how nice it was to meet them."

Focus on connecting with at least one of your partner's family members.,
Be helpful.,
Find a quiet space when you need a moment.,
Avoid using alcohol or other substances to cope with stress.,
Focus on the positives in the situation.",How to Manage Your Partner's Family Gathering with Social Anxiety," Whether you're meeting your partner's family for the first time or the tenth, it's important to be open about the anxieties you have. Make sure that your partner is understanding of what you're feeling and facing.Assess if you and your partner have similar personalities about social situations and family gatherings. Are you both more introverted? Or are you the introvert and your partner is the extrovert? By understanding each other's personalities in social situations, you and your partner are less likely to have misunderstandings about one another's behaviors in social settings.
Don't shy away from explaining to your partner how your social anxiety affects you physically and emotionally. Use this an opportunity to educate. For example, say something like, ""My social anxiety can make me feel light-headed and dizzy when I'm in front of a large group of people. Sometimes I feel like I can't breathe until I'm alone for a minute.""
Ask for your partner's support and reassurance. Make sure that your partner understands that you need words of encouragement rather than judgment. Consider saying, ""I know that you may not fully understand my anxiety, but your words of encouragement and support will help get me through it."";
, Have an ""out"" if things get too anxiety-provoking at the family gathering. While it may be tempting to just stay home or not go, having a plan in place ahead of time will make the event seem less stressful. Consider rehearsing lines with your partner of how you might say that you need to politely leave or end the conversation with the various family members.If you're going to your partner's family's home, consider talking beforehand about a set time to leave. For example, let's say that the party starts at 7pm, and you will likely want to leave by 9pm. Find a possible compromise between you and your partner about when to leave and how to get home if things change. Make sure to ""check in"" with your partner throughout the night about the time you discussed.
Another option could be a body language signal that you both use to help or ""rescue"" each other when a conversation is too stressful or irritating. This can help to teach you and your partner to help each other in awkward situations, rather than ignoring or getting frustrated with each other.
Find a reasonable excuse to, at least, leave the room or the party if things are too anxiety-providing. For example, you can say that you need ""some air and want to sit outside"" for a moment, or a more classic excuse of just ""needing to use the restroom."" If you need to leave the party altogether, focus on being polite regardless of the reason you give for leaving.

, Find healthy ways to cope with stress and social anxiety. Maybe you have a ritual that makes things easier, or a go-to activity to help you feel better. Consider these healthy activities to reduce anxiety:Exercise. Got for a walk. Get outdoors. Go to the gym.
Write down things that you know you are capable of, and things you've overcome. Find inspiration to believe in yourself through your words. Journaling can help to externalize and let go of negative thoughts.
Do yoga or meditation. Find solace and peace through a mind and body connection.
Consider if medication or therapy could be beneficial, if you are not already doing these things. Many people find relief through anxiety medication or ongoing therapy.
Use self-affirmations. Tell them to yourself out loud when you're alone. Consider these: ""I am confident in social situations"" or ""I feel calm and can hold a conversation."", With social anxiety, you may feel hesitant to engage in conversation. Focus on listening, instead of talking. Many people are more interested in talking about themselves. Use these techniques to show you're engaged when possible:Avoid darting your eyes away from the family members you're talking with. Maintain eye contact and nod your head. Focus less on how they may be judging you, and instead think about what is interesting about them.
If they start asking questions about you, consider redirecting the conversation back to them. Let's say one of guests ask you about your family. You could keep it brief and say, ""They're doing well. I hear that you're thinking of moving, what's that process been like for you?""
While you may want to use your phone, tablet, or other devices to distract yourself, avoid doing this when someone is in the middle of talking to you.

, Learn to ask questions about other people as a way to reduce the focus on yourself. I may be feel less stressful for you in social situations when you don't have to talk.Ask open-ended questions about their interests, rather than questions that lead to ""yes"" or ""no"" responses. For example, consider asking, ""Have you seen any good movies lately?"" or ""Are you a sports fan?""
Try to remember what they say, and refer back to this information later when you continue conversation with them or others that have similar interests.

, If you're at a large family gathering, it may feel overwhelming to be around a lot of people. Consider identifying one person or a small group of two or three people that you focus on getting to know.Consider talking with your partner about who might be a good match for developing a conversation at the event when your partner is busy.
Find common interests or personalities traits with that family member. Try to look more at the commonalities rather than the differences.
Getting on the good side of at least one family member of your partner's family will be particularly helpful over time, as you may be obligated to attend some social functions in the future.

, If you have social anxiety, you might feel less anxious if you're busy doing something, rather than having to engage in small talk. Depending on the social gathering, see if you can help the host or other family members with tasks that need to be done.For example, if it is an event with lots of food that needs to be prepared or placed out for guests, ask to help with food preparations or setting out the food.
If there is an older adult that needs assistance, ask if you can help them with getting food, or walking them to a different area of the event. Identify others who may be in need, and consider assisting them.

, If you have social anxiety, it's likely that you may need more quiet time to yourself away from others. While you may not want to go find a place to hide as soon as you arrive at a family gathering, it's okay to take breaks while you're there.Maybe you need a moment to yourself to reduce your anxiety or prevent a panic attack from starting. When you begin to feel your anxiety level heighten, ask to be excused for a moment.
If the event takes place outdoors such as at a park or someone's backyard , consider walking around the area on your own to catch your breath.
If the event is in a small or cramped space, consider saying that you need to get something from the car or that you need to go check your car. Then you can possibly sit alone in the car until your feelings subside.
If the event is in a large home or building, consider finding a room that's empty or a bathroom that's not being used.

, While it may seem like drinking would lighten the mood and make you feel less anxious, it could also have the opposite effect. Consider staying away from things that could change your behavior, possibly for the worse. If you're very anxious, avoid depending on alcohol before, during, or after the event to deal with your feelings.If you feel like you need alcohol in order to handle social situations, you may need to find other, healthier ways to cope with the anxiety you're feeling. Dependence on alcohol or other possibly addictive substances when you are anxious or depressed can be a dangerous mix.
For behavior health and substance use treatment options in your area, contact SAMHSA's National Helpline at 1-800-662-4357 or https://www.findtreatment.samhsa.gov/. A trained specialist can assist you with options for help such as treatment programs or counseling.

, When you're anxious, it may be easier to see the negatives of the situation, but there are usually some positives in any given situation. It's important to remember that you are strong and capable.Consider thinking about your partner, and what they have done to be supportive throughout the event, even if very small things.
Focus on the people who are caring, loving, and gracious, even if you may disagree about certain things or feel uneasy at times.
Make sure to remember that you succeed just by coming to the event. Even if it's a small victory, make sure to remember it.

,How to Introduce Yourself1,
"
Make eye contact.,
Smile.,
Use appropriate body language.",How to Introduce Yourself2," Eye contact shows that you're engaged in the interaction. Eye contact is one way to connect with another human and show that the other person has your attention. When you make eye contact, it shows that you are open and engaged.If you're not comfortable looking straight into someone's eyes, stare at the point between the eyebrows; she won't notice the difference.
If you’re in a group setting, make periodic eye contact with those around you.

, It is important to keep a genuine, bright smile when you meet a new person. Be genuinely happy to meet someone new and to share a positive experience and it will help create a genuine smile. Including the upper part of your face in your smile creates a more genuine and less fabricated smile., Your body language should communicate that you are confident and at ease. Stand with your head high and your back straight, being careful not to slouch. Mirror the body language of people around you. Also mirror the pace of speech and tone of speech of those near you to built rapport."
"
Exchange names.,
Offer a handshake or other culturally appropriate greeting.,
Ask questions.,
Close the conversation.",How to Introduce Yourself3," If the introduction is formal, say ""Hello, I'm ."" If it's informal, say ""Hi, I'm . Immediately after you've stated your name, ask for the other person's name by saying ""What’s your name?"" in a pleasant tone. When you learn the other person's name, repeat it by saying ""It's a pleasure to meet you, Pedro"" or ""Nice to meet you, Caroline.""


Repeating the person’s name will help you remember it, and give the introduction a more personal touch.

, Most cultures have a form of physical contact to accompany a greeting. In the United States, it is often a handshake. Be sure to keep the handshake brief and not to loose (floppy) or firm (bone-breaking).


Be aware of cultural differences. For instance, it is considered rude to firmly shake hands in China.It is often appropriate to greet with a hug, especially if you’re meeting a friend of a friend or an in-law. Hugs show more openness than a handshake. Women more often than men may prefer a hug to a handshake.
In many cultures, it is culturally appropriate to greet with a kiss. In South America, for instance, all women are greeted with one kiss, and in France, women are greeted with one kiss on each cheek. If you are unsure of the appropriate greeting, follow the other person’s lead or watch how other people greet around you.

, It’s important to show interest in the other person. Ask where she is from, what she does for a living, or ask about any common bonds you may have. Ask about what she loves to do and the passions she has in life. Show that you are engaged and interested in what she has to say.


You may tell a little bit of your background in order to engage conversation and share about yourself. Telling someone where you work or that you love rock climbing is appropriate and may lead to more conversation topics.
Don’t take the opportunity to talk only about yourself. You will come across as selfish or uninteresting .

, After you've met someone for the first time, you should end the conversation by restating that you enjoyed meeting. If the interaction was formal, say something like ""Mrs. Castro, I'm delighted to have met you. I hope we can talk again soon."" If your conversation was informal, you can say ""It was great meeting you, Harold. Hope to see you around.""

"
"
Greet the audience and state your name.,
Share some relevant information about yourself.,
Communicate effectively.,
Move your body.",How to Introduce Yourself4," If you're giving a speech, it's important to state your first and last name. As you say hello and give your name, remember to speak clearly and confidently.


Say, ""Good morning, I’m Chelle Arnold"" or ""How is everyone doing today? My name is Lisa Carroll"".

, After you provide your name, share why you and the speech are relevant, making sure you provide your credibility. The sort of information you share will depend on the audience and the subject you'll be talking about. If you're giving a speech about the importance of eating organic foods, tell people that you're a scientist, chef, or environmental professional. If you’re giving a speech about child development, be sure to include that you are a child psychologist.


Provide any other relevant information. For instance, you can provide a brief background of your credible experience. “My name is Erica Lafaurie and I am a professor of environmental science at Berkeley. After I conducted my research in the Amazon rainforest, I realized how important it is to share ways to protect this land.”

, From the very start, make sure your voice is loud enough for everyone to hear you. Avoid mumbling by enunciating your consonants crisply. You can even ask the audience if you are speaking loudly enough for all to hear. People will not be able to understand you or respect what you are sharing if they cannot hear you.

, Stand with good posture, and move freely while you speak. Stand up tall, move your shoulders back instead of slouching, and keep your hands free, using them to gesture when necessary. If you don't have to stand behind a podium, then walk around to show the crowd how comfortable you are and to make yourself look less stiff.

"
"
Say your full name.,
Give a one-sentence description of what you do.,
Respect people’s space.,
Follow up with a question.,
Say goodbye like a professional.",How to Introduce Yourself5," Make sure you provide your full name so that the person can remember your name. You can say, ""Hi, my name is Mark Salazar,"" or ""Hello, I'm Angela Grace,"" and they'll be more likely to remember you.

, If you're at a networking event, then it's likely that you'll be talking about what you do to a variety of people. So, what do you say when a new connection asks, ""What is it that you do?"" Do you launch into a ten-minute story about your career path? Do you reel off a list of your accomplishments in your field? Absolutely not. Unless you're having a more lengthy conversation, you should be prepared to give a one-sentence description of what you do that gives the following information:Who are you, professionally? Are you a teacher, a project manager, or a health care professional?
Who do you work with? Do you work with children, cross-cultural project teams, or micro-finance organizations?
What do you do? Do you help second-grade children develop their writing skills, do you help cross-cultural teams meet complete their goals while keeping their budgets, or do you help microfinance organizations expand their market base in developing countries?
Now, put your sentence together. State who you are, who you work with, and what you do.

, If you have items, don’t place them on recruiter’s or presenter’s tables. Respect their space and don’t overwhelm them. You can also disrupt their materials, such as knocking over a poster or messing up pamphlets. Wait to be asked to exchange business cards, resumes, etc., If the person has asked you what you do first, don't just walk away and praise yourself for a job well done. Instead, ask the person what he or she does in return. This is not only polite, but shows that you have a real interest in this person's career path and want to build a meaningful connection.

, Don't just wave and say, ""Nice meeting you"" and walk away from the person. Anyone you meet at a networking event can have the potential to help you in the future, so make sure that you make eye contact, repeat the person's name, and exchange business cards or any other pieces of relevant information before you walk away.

Officers.,
Major Committees.,

Meetings.,
Quorum.,
Rules of Order.,
How To Amend Charter.,
Amendments.",How to Write a Club Charter," It should have at least the following components:;
, Define, as clearly and succinctly as possible, the purpose of the organization in an opening paragraph. Call it ""Preamble For The Charter of ( organization name )"", or ""Mission Statement of ( organization name )"", or something similar which clearly identifies your organization's reason for existing.

, This is the official name of your organization, by which it will be known legally and in any legal documents you may generate in the future.

, Define the organization's structure, spelling out the principal functions, responsibilities, and term of office for each officer.

, Here, list only the permanent committees required to run the organization, i.e. ""Membership Committee"". Spell out their roles succinctly. If a committee is temporary for a specific timely function, leave it out, and make a reference similar to: ""The President may, from time to time as deemed necessary, appoint temporary committees to carry out the purposes of this organization. They shall serve only for the purpose or time appointed.""

, Spell out term lengths for officers, qualifications, how chosen (i.e., by Nominating Committee, or popular vote). Be sure to list their responsibilities.

, Spell out your meeting schedule. I.E., 1st and 3rd Tuesdays of each month; or weekly on Tuesdays, or whatever your plans are.

, Describe the purpose (and sometimes the order) of meeting.

, Describe what constitutes a quorum for voting on actions and issues coming before the group. (FYI: A ""quorum"" is the minimum number of members required to be present to constitute an ""official meeting"" of members.)

, Rules of Order: Either attach a copy of Operating Rules that you write for this specific organization, or state that ""All meetings will operate under Robert's Rules of Order (as amended)"". Then make sure that your organization has a copy at all meetings for reference.

, Describe how and why your Charter may be amended and what percentage of a vote it will require to amend. Typically, this would be by 2/3rds or 3/4ths of a quorum.

Introduce yourself.,
Be bold with introduction gestures.,
Look the other person straight in the eye.,
Carry yourself with confidence.",How to Make a Distinct Impression," With good diction, and a calm voice, say your full name to the person you are meeting. Even if you have met them before, it is always good to stir their memory. If you're meeting someone you know very well, greet them and say their name. Use polite sayings such as ""nice to see you,"" ""it is so great to meet you,"" ""how are you,"" ""I've heard so much about you,"" etc. It may seem formal, but it's polite, respectful and it makes others feel important.;
, Usually, this is a handshake. Most likely, the other person will offer his or her hand first, but after a few seconds if they cease to do so, out reach your hand. Always be assertive in that sense. If you're going to shake hands, don't give a weak, wobbly fingertip. It portrays you as timid and frail. Grasp the hand thoroughly, but don't crush their bones. Many think an immensely firm handshake makes a good impression, but all it makes is a painful one. Be firm enough so that they know you're confident, but not so firm you make them wince.


You may also adjust this with the person you meeting. A strong, eccentric man may require something more stable, while a frail, eighty year old woman something softer. However, a handshake is not the only introduction gesture. Cheek kissing, friendly embrace, and pats on the back are also vital motions, more often used with people you are familiar with. For you girls, cheek kissing can be especially awkward. Not every man does so, or every woman, but if they pull you in for such, don't be surprised. You never want to look like a deer in headlights. Let them kiss you, smile, and so on. Usually, they will shake hands with you and then pull you in. Hugging should be quick and soft. Don't strangle a person, but show them you care and carefully wrap your arms around them, then let go. Many men shake hands and then pull in to pat each other on the back. It's a sign of respect, and sort of brotherhood/friends. Whatever the gesture, always act prepared and willing, even if you're not.

, Looking at the ground or someplace besides their eyes signifies insecurity, and generally announces to the person your are meeting that he/she is not important. You may feel uncomfortable doing so, but trust me, not looking someone in the eyes when they're speaking is a huge mistake. If it really bothers you, concentrate between their eyes, it looks the same from their point of view anyway.

, Never seem, as mentioned, like a deer in headlights, even when you feel like one. Smile, and have a happy, friendly demeanor, yet seem strong and memorable. You want someone to remember you, and shying away doesn't make an impression in their mind. Stand up straight, speak to them, and seem interested. Nod, feed them back commentary, ask them questions. Don't look for someone else while you're speaking to someone at a function. Do not bite your nails, play with your hair, or do anything else that makes you look nervous/insecure. Humans feed off insecurity. The way you do everything and anything subconsciously sends messages to the person your meeting.

Just listen to someone's problems.",How to Help Others," Talk to a family member or friend and ask what they most need help with and offer your services. By offering before they need to ask you, you are showing that you care about them.Remember to follow through with whatever they've asked of you. Simply asking won't actually help them.
Make a routine of asking around your circle of friends and family for what they need. Before long, helping others will simply be second nature to you!;
, Often what people need is simply someone who will listen to them with kindness and without judgement. When someone is telling you about themselves, or a hardship they are going through, don't simply leap in with your own feelings, thoughts, and stories.


Practice active listening. When you're listening to someone, stay focused on what they are saying. Look at the speaker and let go of distracting thoughts. If your mind wanders, the other person will notice and they won't feel like you are paying attention.Try to avoid making judgments on the person you're listening to. Not only will that close up the conversation, but it will make the other person feel as if they can't trust you with their thoughts.

, When someone is busy or stressed chores and jobs often slip through the cracks. Find out from your family and friends what they're too busy or stressed to do for themselves and set aside some time to do the chore or job for them.


Do something like, make a meal and bring it over to their house during a particularly busy or stressful time, so they don't have to worry about feeding themselves. This is a particularly kind thing to do for someone who has just had a loved one die, or become seriously ill.
Offer to watch your younger siblings, or friend's children for free to give the parents a much needed break.

, A lot of times people can feel cut off from their friends and family and very alone. Just let a friend or family member know that you're thinking of them and that they are important to you. It doesn't have to be a big, grand gesture, something small will do fine.


Write a nice email or letter and include some reason why you like the recipient. Maybe reminisce about something fun or silly the two of you did. If they've recently had a family member die or fall ill (or are struggling with depression) tell them why they are important to you.
Make up a care package. Maybe put in some home-baked goods or some little things that they might enjoy. If they like to knit, maybe include a skein of a colorful yarn in the package.

, Volunteering is great way to help out others in your community. Look around for a homeless shelter or soup kitchen and spend some time there doing whatever needs to be done. Not only will this help others, but you will get a new perspective on your own life.Work at a battered women's shelter and help women and children who have had traumatizing experiences get back on their feet.
Try tutoring homeless children at the local shelter so that they can stay in school and not fall behind because the economy has been difficult for their family.
Volunteer for hospice and really listen to the stories of the people who are going through their final days. They will give you more perspective on the blessings and the hardships you will encounter in your own life.

, This can be anything from a monetary donation to a charity or items like clothing that are needed by a local food bank or shelter. If you don't have money to spare, look through your unused items and see what you can part with that is in decent condition.


Donate foods like unopened spices, healthy non-perishable goods like canned soups, or beans.
Give toys to the local shelters and food banks. Many of the children who take refuge there don't have any toys of their own.

, Instead of getting lots of new presents every birthday or present giving holiday (like Christmas), have your friends and family make monetary donations to charities or some important cause.


You could even set up a fund that they can donate into. For instance, creating a fund to help low-income children go to college.

, If you see someone on the street who is struggling to carry all their groceries, or who needs money for a bus fare, give them a helping hand or some money. It usually doesn't take much to help another human being out.


Keep in mind that they may not always need help. If someone says something like, ""No thanks."" or ""I can handle it."", then just insisting may annoy them. You won't always be able to tell if they really do need your help, but it's best to back off if others are angry or in a hurry. However, if they refuse your help, you should ask one more time, and if they still refuse, then walk away.

, This is a simple website where you answer questions to donate rice to people in need. They work through the UN World Food Programme. Every time you answer a question, ten grains of rice are donated. There are a variety of categories, including vocabulary and geography.

, wikiHow is always looking for new good editors and writers.

, When doing this, you want to be sure they are giving to good charities. For example, one of the sections of this one donates to Autism Speaks, which is generally considered to be a charity that does more harm than good. However, the other sections are perfectly legitimate charities.

, This is an extension where every time you open a new blank tab, a customizable dashboard with a small ad comes up as your default new tab page. The advertisement money is then apportioned to charities based on percentages of user votes (one new tab is one vote.)

, This will show a person that you actually care and you are trying to figure out the cause of the problem that person has.

Prepare talking points beforehand.,
Practice before your interview.,
Introduce yourself immediately.,
List your accomplishments.,
Set your own challenges.",How to Introduce Yourself and Impress People1," Recall past interviews and questions you were asked during them. Expect similar if not the same exact questions to be put to you now. Consider the exact position you’re applying for now and how that may effect the line of questioning. Prepare answers and talking points to address the following topics:How your previous experience (whether it be other jobs, education, or volunteer programs) may have prepared you for this specific job.
What skills you have in general, but more specifically those that are strongest and those that are most relevant to the job at hand.
Instances where you’ve solved problems in the past that demonstrate your ability to succeed under stress.;
, Rehearse your talking points. Ask friend or family to role-play with you. Record yourself and play it back to identify any points that aren’t communicated clearly. If you find yourself forgetting key points, write a cheat sheet to study right up to the point you’re called in for your interview., Once the interview begins, frame an introduction that instantly communicates exactly what you want your future employers to know about you right from the get-go. Set yourself apart from other candidates by painting a distinct picture of yourself in just a few words. When asked to “tell us about yourself,” reply with a brief description loaded with relevant, impressive facts. For example:“I graduated fourth in my class, with honors, from Such-and-Such University.”
“I was a manager at Such-and-Such Company for x-number of years, where I was responsible for a staff of x-amount of people.”
“I’m a self-motivated freelance writer with credits in these publications . . .”
“I’m the president of my student body, for which I’ve organized these events and fundraisers . . .”

, If possible, use examples of work-related feats you’ve pulled off that speak directly to the position you’re applying for. Otherwise, talk about achievements that you’re genuinely proud of from other areas of your life. Share the skills that you excel at, as well as the pride you take in your performance.For instance:“I’m quick to identify areas that need improvement. At my former job, I implemented a new system for work-flow that increased our output despite a shrinking workforce and increasing workloads.”
“I’m a great multi-tasker. I went back to school and graduated at the top of my class while working full-time and raising a child as a single parent at the same time.”
“I take leadership roles very seriously. I’ve been the captain of my sports team for the last two years as well as the president of these school clubs.”

, Consider the specific position you’re applying for. Tell the interviewer exactly what experience you hope to get out of it beyond a simple paycheck. If you’re truly passionate about the work you’ll be doing, share that passion. Even if you’re not passionate about it, tell them what you aim to achieve for your own personal satisfaction. Let them know why this job is so important to you, like:“I care very deeply about the environment. Being able to participate in this outreach program and educate as many other people as possible about the dangers we face is extremely important to me.”
“I’m a voracious reader. I’m really excited about working in a bookstore, sharing recommendations with customers and colleagues, and expanding my own horizons.”
“I believe very strongly in giving back to the community, and although I wouldn’t be saving lives like a doctor or nurse, being able to help this hospital run as efficiently as possible in the kitchen would still be very fulfilling to me.”

Keep your introduction simple.,
Listen to others.,
Ask for help when needed.,
Admit to your mistakes.,
Shun the spotlight.,
Be positive.",How to Introduce Yourself and Impress People2," Introduce yourself by name.If your position within the company is going to be directly related to the person you’re talking to, let them know how. For instance, if the other person is in the shipping department and you’re going to be filling orders and dropping it off with them, go ahead and let them they’ll be seeing a lot of you. However, if you’re going to be their supervisor, leave that unmentioned. Most likely they’ll already know this through other superiors, so avoid coming across as being “superior.”

, Keep your grand tales of past success and future plans to yourself at first. Learn as much as you can about your company and fellow staff by allowing other people to fill you in. Ask questions about how things are done and how they think things should be done. Show that you value them as a source of knowledge and guidance based on their experience.


""How does the average workday/workweek break down here, schedule-wise?""
""Is there anything I could do to improve communication between our two departments?""
""Would you find it more helpful if I turn in my signed invoices for the week all at once or one by one as I sign them?""

, Don’t bluff your way through situations where you find yourself lost. Show your superiors that you mean to do the best job possible by wanting to know exactly how to do things. Pay your fellow coworkers a compliment by relying on them as trusted guides who can teach you.Be sure to do this even if–or especially if–you’re in a supervisory role in a new setting. Even if you have plenty of experience in your particular field, expect to be unfamiliar with odd details that are unique to this new company. Earn respect from your team by showing respect for their years of service and knowledge.

, If you screw something up, alert people to the fact so it can be remedied as quickly as possible. When you’re debating about the best way to accomplish tasks, offer your opinions, but concede when someone else offers a better plan. Prove to your supervisors and colleagues that you’re worried less about looking good than about getting the job done.Practice this honesty with workers under your supervision as well. Gain their respect by freely admitting that you too are capable of mistakes. If they know you screwed up but hear you deny it, they’ll trust you less.

, Show everyone that you’re more concerned with performing your job well than receiving attention for it. Even if you’re largely responsible for a successful project, stand back and share credit with those who assisted you. Build a team spirit while demonstrating that your primary goal is to help the company as opposed to yourself alone., Refrain from speaking ill of others. If someone’s slacking off on their job, speak with them directly about how it’s effecting others and how their performance can be improved. Otherwise, keep your negative opinions about coworkers to yourself. Show by omission that you don’t need to tear other people down in order to build yourself up."
"
Keep your introduction simple.,
Be confident.,
Refrain from bragging.,
Share your anxieties or discomforts.,
Listen.,
Think the best about the other person.",How to Introduce Yourself and Impress People3," Introduce yourself by name. Unless any further info is needed immediately, leave everything else unmentioned. Remember: unlike a job interview, there’s no rush here to advertise all of your best qualities right up front. Allow the other person to learn about you organically, through a give-and-take conversation. If the situation calls for it, add a relevant fact to further identify yourself when you first meet, like:“Hi, I’m ___, the birthday boy’s best friend.”
“Hi, I’m ___. Your daughter’s in the same class as my son.”
“Hi, I’m ___. Your brother and I work in the same office.”

, Impress people by not worrying about whether or not you’re impressing them. Stay true to yourself instead. Of course, we all have different sides to ourselves, so be the “you” that’s most appropriate to the situation. For example:If you’re meeting a new study-partner, keep the focus on your schoolwork and school-life in general.
If you’re meeting people for the first time after moving to a new area, play up your role as the recent transplant experiencing culture shock.
If a mutual friend has invited you (as well as a bunch of other friends of theirs who are die-hard fans) to a sports game that you’re unfamiliar with, stay true to your outsider status instead of pretending to be an expert.

, Feel free to talk about things in your life that you’re proud of if the conversation turns that way, but keep it in check. Earn the other person’s respect with your actions in the here and now instead of demanding it by talking about all the things you’re achieved in the past. Prove to them that you’re confident of your own self-worth and don’t need other people’s admiration to bolster it.If the conversation turns to your job, tell them where you work and maybe a very general description of what you do, while leaving any fancy job titles unmentioned.If they recognize you as an All-State athlete, play down your own accomplishment and credit your team and/or coach for making it at all possible.If someone else mentions how you rushed into a burning building last week to save a pet cat, show or feign embarrassment and then switch topics rather than gloat over your own bravery.

, If you find yourself uncomfortable for whatever reason, mention the fact lightly. Show your self-confidence by freely admitting that you’re not perfect. Make the other person more comfortable by showing them that they’re free to do the same. This way you’re more likely to take command of the situation instead of being at its mercy.If you have trouble remembering names (especially if you’re being introduced to many people at once), fess up and apologize that you’ll probably forget them by the end of the night. If they know this, they’re more likely to repeat their names for your benefit later on.
If you’re uncomfortable at large parties or gatherings, say as much if it’s crimping your style. Let the other person know that your best self is better seen in more intimate settings.
If you’re on a first date and haven't dated for a while (or at all), share this with your date. Assure them that any odd behavior on your part is due to a lack of experience, and not a reflection on them personally.

, Build a real conversation between yourselves instead of just talking at each other. When they tell you something, respond directly to their comment. If you have a personal story that’s relevant to what they’ve said, be sure to tell it in a way that clearly shows your story is a response, and not just an opportunity to switch subjects and talk about yourself. Ask follow-up questions when they tell their own stories to show that they have your interest.""I never thought of it that way. I'll have to watch that movie again with that fan theory in mind.""
""That sounds like a pretty stressful vacation. Would you go back there again if you had the chance?""
""The same thing happened to me once, or almost the same thing. Only in my case ...""

, Ensure that you’ll make a good impression by persuading them that they’ve done the same with you. Don’t undermine your own introduction by judging theirs unfairly. Assume they mean the best, even when they make a faux-pas. Always give people the benefit of the doubt until they give you a very real reason not to."

Know how your face naturally rests.,
Ask other people.,
Learn to use the muscles of your face.,
Know your nervous habits.",How to Have a Pleasant Facial Expression1," Resting facial expressions aren’t always a direct correlation of how you’re feeling. Many people simply have a serious disposition. This creates an uninviting demeanor. Take a picture of your resting face and look at the expression.


Would you be comfortable starting small-talk with someone who shared your expression?
If you were on a bus and asked to introduce yourself to someone, would this expression be one to interact with?;
, Looking at a picture of your face will produce biased feelings. The best way to get a sense of your true resting facial expression is to ask others. If comfortable, ask strangers. Your family and friends have grown accustomed to your face and can typically sum it up with, “it’s just your face.” Asking strangers what kind of emotion you convey through your face will give you the most truthful reactions., The easiest way to do this is to learn to wiggle your ears. Look in the mirror and start practicing. You’ll likely notice that you raise your eyebrows, squint your eyes, and open and close your mouth a lot. These all use different facial muscles. Keep practicing until you can wiggle your ears because this shows awareness and control over your facial muscles.


Knowing how to make small adjustments to your face will help you control muscles to create a pleasant expression.

, Nervous habits can prevent you from showing a pleasant facial expression. Biting your nails, or having a nervous facial tick can be seen as unprofessional because you look uninterested and distracted.


If your facial tics, including nose wrinkling, eye blinking, squinting, grimacing, or mouth twitching, are a constant and uncontrollable issue, it is possible to reduce them overtime through hypnosis."

Practice at home.,
Look engaged.,
Soften your eyes.,
Keep your mouth relaxed.,
Become pleasant within.",How to Have a Pleasant Facial Expression2," Look in the mirror and practice your facial changes at home. Take note of the way you notice your mood change as you change your face. Remember which tricks make you feel most pleasant so that you can practice them during the day to keep a pleasant expression.Take a pen and clench it in your teeth—imitating a smile. Do you notice yourself feeling happier?
Now take the pen and hold it in your protruding lips—creating a frown. It will create the feeling of being unhappy.
Practice vowel sounds. A long “e” forces a smile, “ah” imitates the expression of surprise. Both of these induce pleasant feelings.

, Notice the tilt of your head. Having a slight tilt to your head is a subconscious sign that you’re engaged and paying attention. This encourages a pleasant disposition.Avoid constantly checking your watch, phone, or how others are reacting.

, You want to have eye contact and crease your eyes. Creasing your eyes is different from squinting—it’s a good thing to practice in the mirror. The most inviting eyes are fully open yet relaxed., Neutral lips or a frown-shaped pout is much less inviting. Keep a small parting of your lips to relax your facial muscles and convey warmth. With your mouth relaxed, turn the corners of your mouth up.

, If you’re forcing a pleasant expression, it can often be picked up on by other people. They’ll become suspicious. The best way to avoid this is to actually feel what you’re portraying. Take time out of each morning to think of reasons you have to be pleasant. Take a moment to appreciate them and carry this feeling throughout the day.

Smile when appropriate.,
Focus during uncomfortable situations.,
Have confidence in your appearance.",How to Have a Pleasant Facial Expression3," Smiling has a two sided effect: you look more pleasant, and you feel more pleasant. Smiling makes others more comfortable because it gives you the appearance of being comfortable. When you smile, you tighten the muscles in your cheek which decreases the flow of blood to the cavernous sinus. This cools the blood flowing into your brain which leads to pleasant feelings., If you notice yourself in a non-pleasant situation, remember to keep your face pleasant. Simply placing the muscles of your face in the pattern of pleasant emotion elicits the feeling. In other words, facial expression influences your mood., Constantly fidgeting with your clothes or adjusting your hair every other minute will take away from your pleasant expression. People will read that you’re uncomfortable and begin to doubt your expressions. Carrying confidence to back up your pleasant expression will give you a demeanor that makes others comfortable and engaged.

Work well with a team.",How to Have Great People Skills," Part of communicating effectively is asking great questions. A good question typically is an open-ended question that a person can respond to in a variety of ways. Questions can also provide clarification for something that is unclear. Asking questions shows that you are interested in furthering a discussion.Some good open-ended questions at work include, “What can we do to improve?” and, “What changes would you like to see?”
If you want to ask personal questions, ask, “What activities do you enjoy?” and, “What was it like when you hiked the trail?”;
, If you have something to say, say it. Don’t guess about how people will react or question if what you have to say is valuable. If you have a want or a need, make sure you can express it in a meaningful way. If you’re trying to express it in a subtle way and it’s not received, you need to be more overt, even if it feels uncomfortable. Recognize that your opinions, thoughts, and feelings are worthwhile and can be shared.For example, if you’re talking to a very chatty person, say, “I’d like to say something now.” If you’re in a meeting, say, “I have something to contribute to our discussion.”
Being assertive also means knowing when to say “No.” If someone asks you to do something you just don’t have time for, don’t feel obligated to oblige. Say, “I can’t fit that in today, I’m sorry.”

, If you know someone who you consider to have great people skills, ask them for advice. Ask for ways to improve how you interact with other people. You can also look to them for what they do right in social situations. Notice what characteristics you admire about them, then try to replicate them in your own social interactions.


Observe how they treat people, the way they listen or validate others. You can also pay attention to how they speak and use their voice and words to make people feel comfortable.
For example, they may appear open and jovial when they introduce themselves to new people. Take on a similar persona and see how people respond to you.

, Learn how to make friends easily. Put yourself in situations where you can meet lots of people and build friendships. Join groups, clubs, and sports teams. Attend activities at your school or workplace intended to foster relationships like lunches or conferences. These will give you opportunities to meet other people and instantly give you something to talk about in having a shared experience. Continue to talk once the activity ends by exchanging phone numbers or email addresses.Do activities that put you in contact with others, like taking your dog to the dog park.
Invite people to spend time with you. For example, say, “Would you like to go to lunch?” You can also invite people to the movies or other activities. This shows you want to spend time with them.

, Conflicts are inevitable, yet the way you handle them can show people a lot about you. Aim to resolve conflicts peacefully, especially in the workplace. If you sense that something may become a conflict, resolve it quickly without causing offense. Don’t avoid the conflict and instead, seek to resolve it collaboratively. Listen and respond to the person, even when you disagree. Then, seek to create a mutually agreeable solution.Show people that you can handle conflicts maturely by listening, not raising your voice, and wanting to find solutions.

, If you’re nervous or stressed, manage these emotions. Take a moment to collect your thoughts or take a few deep breaths. Do things that help you feel calm. If you need a moment to think, ask for a question to be repeated or ask for clarification.Go into a situation feeling relaxed, not nervous. Do some calming exercises like meditation or yoga beforehand.

, Eye contact is a great way to connect with other people. It signifies who you are speaking to and shows the other person you are listening when they are speaking. However, don’t stare somebody down. It’s appropriate to make eye contact and look away occasionally.Try to keep your eye contact the same as the person you are speaking to. For example, someone who shies away from eye contact may feel uncomfortable if you make constant eye contact with them.

, People may be able to get an idea of who you are and what you’re about to do even before you open your mouth. This is because even the way you sit or stand is communicating something to other people. When you work on your body language, consider things like posture, gaze, gestures, and body position. For example, if your arms and legs are crossed, people might assume you are closed off or not engaged.When interacting with people, lean in when they speak to show you are listening. Turn your body toward them and communicate openness by keeping your body open.
The phrase “Fake it ‘til you make it” rings true for body language. If you’re feeling nervous before an interview or a date, use your body to display confidence. Keep your head up and shoulders back., People appreciate it when they feel understood and enjoy when other people are listening to them. Show your listening skills by showing interest in what the person is saying. Avoid interrupting them and wait until they have finished speaking to say something.Focus your attention on really listening when the other person speaks. Don't try to think of what you will say in response.
Favor your right ear when someone is talking. The right ear is connected to the left side of the brain, which can help to discriminate emotional and social nuances.

, Many people are concerned about what they’re going to say or how they will say it. Instead of putting the focus on yourself during the conversation, show an interest in the person you are talking to. Nod your head, smile, and make appropriate facial expressions to what they’re saying.One way to do this is by reflecting what they say to convey understanding. For example, you can say, “I hear you saying that you’re frustrated with what’s expected of you.”

, Listen for the unsaid things going on in interactions. For example, most people notice when a meeting feels tense, even if nobody is raising their voice. Learn to hone your observational skills and gain clues as to how other people are feeling. Notice if someone is feeling left out, then include them in a discussion. If someone looks nervous, help them feel calm and at ease.When you tune in to how another person feels, you can better respond to them. The other person may also feel validated and know that you care.

, Maybe your boss pulls you aside or an attractive person comes up to flirt with you. If a conversation comes up that you’re not prepared for, be calm. Let the conversation unfold naturally and don’t think too much about what to say.If you’re caught off guard, say so. For example, say, “I wasn’t prepared for this meeting so I don’t have that information with me right now. I’d be happy to get it for you within the hour.”

, If you make a social blunder, learn from it. Perhaps you spoke too loudly or interrupted someone in the middle of something important. To improve your social skills, learn from your mistakes and don’t repeat them. If you have a bad interaction with someone, come up with solutions to improve it for next time. For example, if you lost your temper, find ways to stay calm (like deep breathing) when you speak to them.


If you feel embarrassed by a mistake you made, remember that it will likely be forgotten. The important thing is to not make it again.

, Especially if things are becoming tense, crack a joke or say something funny to ease the tension. Humor is a great way to make people feel comfortable if others are feeling nervous or tense. Whether you’re meeting somebody for the first time or are in the midst of an intense meeting, humor can help.Say a joke or comment on something that’s relevant yet humorous.
People will begin to feel comfortable around you because you tend to lighten the mood.

, Greet people with friendly, “Hello!” and stop to chitchat with people you see regularly. This is especially useful at a workplace or office. Even if you are not friends with people, show them that you are friendly and warm. If you have nothing to say, give a compliment or make small talk about the weather or television shows.Even if you don’t like someone, it doesn’t hurt to say a friendly, “Hello” or, “How are you doing?”

, Be the person people want to work with when joined on a team. Be able to explain your ideas and express your feelings in a way that others won’t feel threatened. Show respect for other people and their ideas, even if you disagree with them. Make sure that all people feel included and valued in the work.Show good leadership, yet don’t dominate the group. Make sure everyone has a place and can participate in the process.

Stop smoking.,
Apply whitening strips.,
Consider braces.",How to Improve Your Smile1," Unfortunately, many people don't put the proper time and effort into it. Give yourself at least two minutes to brush your teeth, focusing on the molars and parts of your teeth that are otherwise hard to get to. Try dividing your mouth into four sections, and spend 30 sections on each. Be gentle but thorough with your toothbrushing.


A whitening toothpaste is recommended if you want to maximize your smile.
Flossing once a day is a good thing to consider adding on to your toothbrushing routine.;
, Dentists are trained professionals who specialize in maximizing the brightness of smiles. If you haven't seen a dentist in a while, it's a really good idea to go as soon as possible. Make a regular habit of seeing a dentist at least once every 6 months.


Dentists can be expensive. Although basic check-ups aren't too pricey all things considered, oral surgeries are best approached with some insurance at hand.

, Smoking is one of the most injurious things you can do to your smile. Your skin will pale out, and your teeth will get yellow. This damage is usually gradual, but can sometimes completely destroy a smile if left unchecked.It's never an easy thing to stop smoking, but your body will thank you in more ways than one if you do.


Ask your doctor about a smoking cessation aid if you feel you need one to go through with it. This can take the form of a skin patch, or medication designed to turn you off of smoking.

, Whitening strips effectively bleach your teeth to become a brighter shade of white. Buy a box, and apply them twice a day for a couple of weeks, or until the box runs out. Improvements should be noticeable within a few days, and will last for a few months before you have to start the process over again. It's not a total solution for teeth whitening, but it can have a significant impact on your smile if yellowness is a concern of yours.You can get your teeth whitened at a dentist's office as well.

It may be expensive, but the effect it'll have on your smile will be worth it.


If you feel self-conscious about wearing braces, there are ""invisible"" alternatives you can use instead. This is a good option if you feel anxiety towards wearing traditional braces.Braces can be worn at any age. Although they're commonly associated with adolescence, there are lots of adults who decide to get them later on in life.A winning smile looks great at any age.

, When they say ""hi"" back to you, smile and introduce yourself.


You might also add how you know them, or how they might know you. For example, ""Hi, I'm Johnny. We were in film class together last semester."" This helps avoid embarrassing situations or that awkward silence when they don't remember you.

, Presumably you would like to get to know this person to whom you've just introduced yourself. If you have something in common, talk about that. You could say, ""Are you still a fan of Richard Linklater,"" or ""I'd love to talk with you for a few minutes, why don't we get out of this hailstorm!""

, If they look at you strangely and hurry away, don't chase them. Not only is it kind of creepy, it could get you into trouble. If they smile and start talking with you, congratulations, you've successfully greeted somebody and made a new friend, too!

Visit a specialist website.,
See if there’s a free trial.,
Sign up for an online account.,
Search through the online database.,
Use a search engine.",How to Find Out the Date Someone Got Married1," The quickest and easiest way to find out when somebody was married is to visit a website of a company that can search through marriage records for you. There are a number of these online agencies. You will find them by looking for “marriage record checks” or “background checks” in a search engine.Before employing any agency to find out information, be sure you do some research on the company.
Look for one that has positive feedback and a good reputation.;
, Online agencies will charge you for their services, but in some instances you may be able to utilise a free trial period, or have one free trial search. If you only want to look up the records for one marriage, you may be able to take up an offer and do the search for free.


Remember that results are not guaranteed, even if you pay. Using a free trial will give you an idea of the service you can expect.
Some of these databases will not go right up to the present day.
Make sure you know they cover the approximate year you think the wedding occurred in before proceeding.

, Few agencies will allow you to search without signing up for an account. You will need to provide your personal details and agree to a payment option. These agencies are often used by people such as private investigators, so membership is generally based on subscription. In some cases you will be able to pay on a pay-as-you-go basis.


In the UK, a subscription could cost you £15 a year, or 3 months for £5.

Practice self-acceptance.,
Believe in yourself.,
Focus on your strengths.,
Trust that it will work out.,
Get social support.",How to Develop Poise1," If you have self-confidence, then you will have poise; the two dovetail. Accepting yourself increases your self-esteem and can help you develop confidence and poise.Make a list of your strengths and things you want to improve, including personality characteristics and appearance. Go down the list and verbally accept each part of yourself. Say, “I accept that I am talkative. I accept that I sometimes have a temper.”
In general, you can use a self-affirmation such as saying to yourself, “I accept everything about myself. I accept who I am, what I look like, my past, present, and future.”;
, How you think about yourself affects your actions and your ability to be poised.To develop self-confidence, learn to believe in yourself. This means believing that you are a positive person who has interesting things to share. This also means doing things that make you feel confident about yourself.


Visualization is a helpful way to believe in yourself. Close your eyes and imagine yourself as complete confident and poised. Where are you? What does it feel like? What you are thinking about? What are you doing?Think positive thoughts about yourself. If you find yourself worrying or thinking negatively, re-frame the situation.You could practice by purposefully thinking, ""I can do this. I can accomplish anything I put my mind to. I believe in myself.""
Try power poses. Our body language can actually shape how we feel about ourselves.Power poses generally involve making your body bigger (taking up more space) instead of smaller (which indicates a lack of confidence). Try spreading your legs slightly apart and putting your hands on your hips. You can find more power poses online.

, Paying attention to the positive aspects of yourself can heighten your ability to have confidence and poise in social situations, which can increase the likelihood that you are accepted by others.Make a list of your accomplishments. Did you get an A on a paper? Are you great at swimming and you once won a medal?
Think about how you can use your strengths to increase your poise.

, Whatever the situation you are in, the way you think about it can influence the outcome (for better or worse).Those who believe that something negative will happen may actually influence that outcome to occur. For example, if you are worried that you will say something silly or wrong in a meeting, this thought can increase your nervousness, which may cause you to stumble over your words. Thus, you create the outcome that you are fearful of.


Instead of thinking about what might happen or the worst case scenario, focus instead on what you actually want to happen. Instead of thinking, ""Oh no, I hope I don't stumble over my words,"" consciously think positive thoughts such as, ""I want to speak clearly and effectively. I will focus on being poised and feeling confident. I can do this."" These positive thoughts are much more likely to reduce negative feelings and increase the likelihood of a positive outcome.

, Supportive relationships can help to empower you and increase your overall self-confidence. Through others, we can develop a sense of connection, belonging, and acceptance.


If you are feeling low or not confident in yourself, talk to a friend or family member about it. Chances are, they will help you identify the good things about you and turn your mood and thoughts around. This can be very validating and can increase your self-confidence if you know that others support and believe in you.
Take a look at your relationships and ask yourself if those who you spend time with are supportive of you. Our social connections should bring us positivity and lift us up in times of stress. If people are putting you down or making you feel worse about yourself, these connection are not likely to help you become more confident. Consider distancing yourself from damaging relationships and focus on connecting with supportive individuals.

Consider the message you want to get across by smiling.,
Be natural with your smiles.Being able to tell a sincere smile from a false one is deeply engrained in most of us.,
Smile according to the shape of your face.If you want to find a look that's perfect for you, you can actually try to condition yourself into a smile that better suits the look of your face.,
Wear lipstick.,
Tilt your head while smiling.,
Practice in the mirror.If you really want to perfect your smile, there's nothing you can do better than to give yourself some practice.",How to Improve Your Smile2," Smiling is something you do physically, but a truly great smile must be felt as well. This is something many people overlook when they're trying to improve their smile. People smile when they want to show affection, amusement, confidence and pride. All of these expressions have their place in a successful life, and will benefit you in different ways. A confident smile, for example, will be great for professional situations, while an affectionate smile may earn you new friends along the way.


It's been widely documented that people will make assumptions on everything from intelligence to career success based on someone's smile., Think of a smile you thought didn't seem quite right. If you're not relaxed and feeling the smile sincerely, it will probably show on your face in some way. Let your face relax, and try to get in the proper mood of smiling.


Give yourself an honest break with smiling if you find yourself fixated on it. You're not going to make any progress with it if you're feeling tense. Giving yourself a minute to relax is sometimes worth far more than an additional minute of effort.

, Longer faces work well with open smiles that show teeth. Wider smiles from ear to ear are great for boxier face shapes.


Keep in mind that re-teaching yourself how to smile can be a very frustrating process, especially if you're trying to act natural while you're at it.

, A moderate brand of lipstick can brighten the look of teeth and attract eyes to your smile.If you wear lipstick and want a better smile, work lipstick into your solution. You can get a lot out of it if done correctly.


Red lipstick is a standard choice specifically because it is eye-catching. The colour contrast will brighten your teeth. Less bold colours may work better for darker skin tones. It's most important to find a colour that matches your skin, and from there you choose a bolder shade than you're regularly used to.
It's important not to overdo it with lipstick or any type of cosmetics. Going overboard has a cartoonish effect.

, Not everyone has a perfect, symmetrical smile. One way you can make your smile more flattering is if you tilt your head nonchalantly to the side. This can be very endearing if done subtly, and any visible imperfections you have will be lessened as a result., While it's a good thing to make a regular habit of smiling whenever, smiling in the mirror gives you the opportunity to see how your smile actually looks. From there, you can tweak your smile until you've got one that matches what you want. Don't be worried about perfection. If you feel a natural smile coming out, chances are that's the best one to suit you and your personality.

Stretch your smile.As it goes with the rest of your body, you can literally train your smile to become better.,
Erase smile lines with a pursed smile.Everyone should know that a smile is more than teeth and a mouth; it's got to do with the whole face.,
Exercise your cheek muscles.You cheeks cannot be underestimated when it comes to forming a smile.,
Commit to a regular exercise routine.,
Smile often.",How to Improve Your Smile3," One of the go-to exercises to make this happen is by stretching your mouth. Done repeatedly over time, this will make your mouth more limber and ready for expression.


First off, stretch the corners of your mouth to the sides. Keep your lips together while you do this, and hold for 10 seconds per rep.
After your 10 second hold, open your mouth to expose the fronts of your teeth. Hold for another 10 seconds.
Open your mouth further to the point where about half of your teeth are showing. Hold for another 10 seconds.
You can repeat the steps in reverse to close the smile back down gradually. A full rep of this exercise will take about a minute, and can be repeated as many times as you like.

, Smile lines are a natural result of age. Luckily, they can be reduced with this simple exercise. Pucker up your lips as though you were about to kiss someone. Next, holding that position, try to smile as much as you can. Hold it until you can feel an ache around your mouth. This will mean that the muscles are responding to your exercise.


It's recommended you only do this exercise once per day, in order to prevent straining the muscles of your face., Cheeks influence the control you have over your smile. To start, smile as widely as you can while keeping your lips closed. Holding this close-lipped, ear-to-ear grin, try to wiggle your nose around for at least 5 seconds. Repeat this easy exercise 10 times in a row. All told, it shouldn't take more than a minute to do all of it.

, Because these mouth exercises are fairly easy to do, there's no reason why you shouldn't be able to work them into a morning routine. Given that the faces you'll make will be fairly silly, it's probably something you'll want to do while you're still in bed or in the shower. Nonetheless, for the best effects, you should try to remember to follow through with these exercises at least once per day.


Remember to look at your smile regularly as well. You won't be able to see any difference if you're not taking some time to look at the very thing you're trying to improve upon.

, If you mean to train your body to do something, it stands to reason you should do a lot of it. Making a frequent habit of smiling will help improve your smile in a lot of ways. For starters, the muscles you use to smile will be put to use. More importantly however, if you make a regular habit of smiling, it will come more naturally to you. Even if you have to fake it until you make it at the start, you'll eventually find yourself smiling a lot more than you first thought possible.


If you're just smiling by yourself, try giving yourself the widest smile possible to maximize the effects of the exercise."

Mind your manners.,
Find small talk topics to get started.,
Be aware.",How to Greet Someone2," The polite way of greeting somebody you have just been introduced to is to say, ""Good evening, Jessi. It is nice to meet you.""


Offer to shake their hand, and when accepted, use a firm but not crushing grip.
Ask, ""How are you?"" This helps break the ice, and gives them an opportunity to greet you as well. Just remember that invariably, when asked how they are doing, people will say ""fine"" no matter what's going on in their lives for real. Be prepared to move on to the next topic. Notice something about them, what they're wearing, or if your host has indicated what your new acquaintance does, talk about that.

, To continue the conversation, you can also make small talk about the weather, family, how far you traveled, where a good spot for lunch might be, and other topics of general interest. Don't try to impress. Simply be affable, personable, and approachable. Keep it simple.

, If the person you are talking to is constantly looking over their shoulder, or checking their watch, it's a pretty good sign they're not interested in the conversation. Gracefully excuse yourself, and go refresh your drink.

"
"
Be confident.,
Be aware of hierarchy.,
Speak briefly about the business at hand, and move on.",How to Greet Someone3," Greet your new acquaintance in a friendly but professional manner.

, If you are greeting a colleague or peer, you can be more informal. ""Hi, Dan, it's a pleasure to meet you. I've heard great things about you, and am looking forward to working with you.""


If you are meeting somebody much higher up in the food chain or an honoured and respected member of the community, consider an honorific rather than their first name. ""Hi, Mr. Campbell. It's a pleasure to meet you,"" is much more professional and will make a much better lasting impression than saying, ""Hi, Bill. How's it hangin'?""
Consider greeting somebody at a much more junior level than you, in the same way. ""Hello, Mr. Crawford. It's a pleasure to meet you,"" carries with it the expectation that they will keep a professional attitude in their dealings with you.

, Nobody likes being pigeon-holed into a conversation they can't get out of, and it's especially important in a business setting. You don't want to have the reputation of somebody that doesn't know when to be quiet!

Check your state's marriage certificate index or repository.,
Go to the county records office.,
Request the marriage records.,
Look for church records.",How to Find Out the Date Someone Got Married2," The records of marriages are held by your County, and the way the information is kept and made available can vary from place to place. If your state and county has online marriage indexes, you can search through this online database to find information on the marriage. Not all states have these indexes, but if they do, it may allow you to find the person's wedding day without going to an office.Visit http://websearchguides.com/marriage_and_divorce_records.htm#partII to see if your state has a marriage certificate index.

, If you haven’t been able to find the information you are looking for online, the next step is to visit the country records office or courthouse in person. To do this you will need to know where the marriage took place, so that you can go to the relevant office. Marriage licenses, which show the date of marriage, are given by the county clerk and a search can be conducted at the County Recorder's office.You need to go with as much information as you have about the marriage in question.
This should include at least the names of the couple and the place of the marriage.
If you know approximately when they were married, this could help narrow the search.

, Once you are at the right place, you will be asked to fill out the paperwork required to request information on the marriage. You may be asked to pay between $10 and $50 to perform a search.You may be able to conduct the search online, through your county clerk website.
You may or may not need to submit a credit card number to conduct the search online.

, The US did not require civil registration of marriages until the twentieth century. If you are looking for information on an earlier marriage, it’s a good idea to try and check church records, which in some cases go back to the 1600s. To find the church records you will need to know where the person lived, as well as the denomination of the church they attended.


Church records are generally kept in churches and their archives, at historical and genealogical societies, and in libraries.
If the church doesn’t hold the archives, the headquarters of the denomination may do."

Become educated in a variety of topics.,
Listen.,
Focus on the positive.,
Use assertive communication.",How to Develop Poise2," Interacting comfortably with others shows confidence and poise.It is much easier to come up with subjects to discuss if you are educated in a variety of skills and topics.


Go to the library and read a variety of books. Read up about history, science, sociology, psychology, or anything else that you are interested in.
Scan the internet, and read reputable websites to keep up with current events.
Read a newspaper (either online or in print) and be educated about current events in your community as well as the world. This way, you can start a conversation by asking, ""Did you hear about ____? What do you think about it?""
Learn new hobbies and activities. Some examples include learning how to: play an instrument, dance, do yoga, rock-climb, skydive, surf, snowboard, ski, scuba-dive, paint, draw, or sing. This way, when you meet a new person you have plenty of activities to discuss. Chances are, the other person will have some similar interests.

, When attending social gatherings, be a ""listener"" rather than always driving the conversation. People love being listened to and gravitate to people who take the time to listen to them.


Relax, breathe and pretend you're talking to someone you've know all your life.
Ask questions and be interested. Focus solely on the person and his or her experience rather than on what you are going to say next. Be present in the moment.
Ask open-ended questions rather than closed-ended ""yes"" or ""no"" questions. This will help increase the likelihood that you have a positive and continued conversation.
Use active listening skills, which help to build understanding and trust. One way to show that you are listening is to restate what the person has just said. You can do this by saying, ""I am hearing that you are upset at your brother. Is that right?""You can also give feedback and validate the person. Say something like, ""That sounds really tough. It sounds like you are hurt, and that makes sense given the situation.""

, If you talk about negative things too much you may seem like a complainer and someone who lacks poise. However, if you focus on positive subjects people may notice your elegance and charm.Ask positive questions such as, “What’s going well for you? What have you been doing that’s fun lately?”
Generally avoid conversations about politics and religion unless you share the same mentality and openness toward these subjects.

, Assertiveness is generally being respectful and open about your feelings and thoughts while maintaining tact and composure.Assertive communication is warm, welcoming, and friendly.


One way to be assertive is to be understanding of others and their situations, while still respecting and communicating your own needs and desires. For example, you might say, ""That is a great idea. How about we also do this?""Show you are assertive through your body language. Give appropriate eye contact (not staring, but not avoiding, look around every once in a while). Be relaxed in your body; Do not make your body too small (hunched shoulders) or too large (hands on hips).
Do not use aggressive forms of communication such as putting people down, calling them names, or raising your voice.Saying how you feel or think when you know it might hurt other people can also be a form of aggressive communication; some things are better left unsaid (negative comments about how someone looks or acts, for example). These types of speech and actions may show that you are aggressive, and can indicate to others that you are losing your cool.
Some cities offer ""finishing schools"" where social skills are taught.

Stop and take deep breaths.,
Observe.,
Practice what works.",How to Develop Poise3," Part of being poised is maintaining your composure in difficult or irritating situations. Instead of reacting automatically in a negative way such as storming out of the room or yelling at someone, maintain your poise by stopping and take a breath or removing yourself from the situation in an elegant way (i.e. excusing yourself to go to the restroom).If you are alone, you can try a deep breathing exercise to calm yourself down. Breathe in through your nose deeply and out through your mouth slowly. Focus on your breathing and your experience of it. Your body should begin to relax and once you feel calm you can stop the breathing exercise.

, Being mindful of what you are reacting to is an important component of keeping your composure.If you observe what is happening, you can being to change how you react to the situation and be more poised.


Ask yourself, “What am I reacting to? What am I thinking and feeling about this situation? Is this something that is a pattern from my past? Am I upset about this situation or does it remind me of something else that happened and struck a chord with me?”
Look at the bigger picture. Observe the situation from afar as if you were in a helicopter viewing it from the sky.What is the bigger picture? Will this situation matter in 1 month, 6 months, or a year? You may find that you react to situations that do not affect your life in the long-term.

, Having a plan on how to deal with difficult emotions is one surefire way to maintain your composure in difficult situations.Identify ways to cope with difficult emotions that work for you.


For example, if you notice that you tend to get angry when people do not agree with you on a topic, you may develop specific coping mechanisms for dealing with this situation. This might include taking deep breaths, counting to ten, or reminding yourself that others can have different opinions and it doesn’t mean that they think you are dumb or don’t like you.

If your bunkbed is in the corner, then you only need to make one wall. If not, then on the opposite side of the bunkbed, place another board or mattress or, if you have a nearby piece of furniture, move it to the opposite side of the board.;
, Find a large sheet or a blanket and drape it over the bunkbed and walls of the clubhouse. Drape it so that it hangs down the front of the bunkbed, where the opening is.

, Take a chair and place it under the blanket near where you want your entrance to be. This way there is a small hole where you can enter the lower bed of the bunkbed, and inside, you'll be surrounded by the sheet or blanket and the walls you made.

Gather some cardboard.,
Frame the clubhouse walls.,
Strengthen the corners with cardboard tubes.,
Add two tubes to the ceiling.,
Make the roof.,
Finish the roof.,
Optionally put some walls in.",How to Make a Clubhouse5," You'll need a large amount of cardboard, so with your parents help, try to find as many cardboard boxes as you can, the bigger the better.


The more cardboard you collect, the bigger the clubhouse you can make.

, Find your largest cardboard box and open it up so it's in box form. Cut the top flaps of the box off. Then cut out the corners of the box, including the bottom. The corners should be about five or six inches on both sides.


Place the corners in a square shape with the dimensions that you want for the clubhouse.

, If you don't have any cardboard tubes, you can substitute them with flat cardboard folded into long and skinny square tubes and then taped to keep their shape. Cut the tubes down so that they're the same height as the corners. Then use tape to attach the tubes to the insides of the corners.


This will strengthen the structure so that it doesn't fall apart.

, First, get or make two more tubes. Cut the tubes down so that they are the same length across as two sides of the clubhouse. Then cut notches in the ends of the tubes so that they can be placed on top the corner tubes without falling. Tape the tubes to the corner tubes so that they run parallel to each other across the length of the clubhouse.

, Get two flat pieces of cardboard that are roughly as long on one side as the length of the roof tubes. Tape the two pieces of cardboard together along one edge. Then tape the other edges to the tubes so that it forms a triangular roof for the clubhouse.

, Measure the dimensions of the ends of the roof, the triangular holes on either side of the clubhouse. Then cut out two pieces of cardboard of the same dimensions. Tape those cardboard triangles to the ends of the roof to make the roof of the clubhouse completely enclosed.

, You can either tape rectangular pieces of cardboard to cover all the open areas of the clubhouse except the front, or you can cover the back and then make windows on the sides. You make windows by taping rectangular pieces of cardboard that don't go all the way up the sides of the house, leaving gaps which work as windows."

, Make it something catchy - it is almost useless making a brilliant club with a boring name! Make sure that the name is relevant to your club's theme, to avoid confusion on the part of prospective applicants and even your own members.

, Type it up or even just hand write it. Post it up on the wall of your meeting spot. Make sure it is large and noticeable, so there is no confusion over rules when the time comes that one is broken.

, Each member should sign the constitution to show their agreement to follow the rules. When a rule is broken and the member refuses to take the punishment, you can point to their signature to show that they promised to follow rules.

, The point of a constitution is to actually follow the rules. The president of the club should make sure all rules are followed and all punishments are given. You can also have a certain member of the club make sure the rules are followed. This person should be fair and should not let people get away with breaking rules.

, Maybe you have a very tight crew that could join, maybe it's just random people you want to get to know better, maybe it's just family! Use this to write down who you want in your club not who you know can be in it.

, Start with the leader, then a deputy, then a secretary, treasurer, and clean up crew. The leader will organize and oversee activities. The deputy will fill in for the leader while she's gone. The secretary will record info and fill in members who miss meetings. The treasurer will keep track of money if needed. You don't need a clean up crew (instead everyone could pick up), but if you have one, they would be the first on the scene to clean up.

, The ideal meeting place is accessible to all of the members and probably closed in so you don't have to cancel meetings on the account of weather. Pick a place you all like and where you won't be disturbing other people.

, Are you meeting once a week? Every day? Once a month? Make sure it's on a schedule where all the members will be able to attend most or all of the time.

, Why are you meeting? Is it to mull over the week's happenings? Is it to organize a fundraiser? Write down a list of meeting reasons or themes and theme each scheduled meeting to mean something!

, This is optional, and is for the treasurer. If you need to buy things for the club weekly, plan a way to earn money and spend it wisely. Figure out the cost, a way to earn money (I prefer the lemonade or craft stand myself), and how you'll divide up the money.

, This way, your club is represented by something and it also gives you something to decorate club posters and fliers with!

",How to Start a School Club," If you go all willy-nilly like for an example ""Okay, so we're just gonna call this club Club of Awesomeness, have it in the morning, and move on"", that's showing people that you don't care about the club. It tells them, ""This is a club that randomly popped out with no given thought whatsoever. Please risk everything and join."" What specific time? Place? What's it about? For the time and place, decide on a room to hold the club in with your friend, and speak with the person in charge of the room. Agree with them on a time, but make it during school hours-and not during lessons or work times.



Plan out how the club will run. At many schools, students start planning the club before the summer vacation. This will give time to plan the club events, fundraisers, and other necessary things to make the club flow steadily upon return to school.;
, For example, if the club is about your school, i.e what you can do to improve it, what isn't going well, etc., for example, Cayuga Elementary School, you could call it ""Cayuga Elementary Club"". Think about what it will look like presented to other people, and how it relates to the topic.

, Choose a person (either you or your friend) to type it on a computer, print it out, and then discuss it together. Don't forget to check it for errors.

, You can't start a club with only one member. Every club has certain positions that need to be filled by responsible people, defined as loyal, intelligent, and hardworking. A club containing people like this will definitely succeed. Also starting to talk with the responsible friends will help in the planning of the club so that one will not have to do it by oneself beforehand.

, Speak to the teachers of both your classes, your friend's class (if he/she is in a different class), and your members' class/classes. If all of them agree on your plan, you may speak to the principal. If the principal agrees, move on to the next step.

, A club adviser is not an adult/teacher that is supposed to babysit a club; they are a trusted mentor. They also need to possess an interest in the club's activity or goal. So find the perfect one that would take an interest in the club. So that they would love to be involved making the club more active and prosperous.

, Even with the best team, you still need approval. If the club commissioner which approves clubs gets the wrong idea about your club on the form,and they did not interpret the information on the form correctly, the club will unfortunately be rejected.

, Once summer vacation starts, communication may cut off. If it does happen it is best to give officers some work to do during the summer. Like planning for fundraisers. This will help if the club officers did not know what to do and goof off during the summer.

, Make sure there is a high level of communication between the club officers. Without good communication, there will be infinitely many problems occurring. For example: deliveries of fundraiser items are late. Associating with others beforehand makes it easy for an alternative or a solution., Once the club is approved, all of the work rests in the hands of the club's officers. The first thing is to get people to join.


Create a flyer/sign-up sheet.







, On the first day of your club's start, make sure that the people in your club acknowledge the motive of your club and different requirements needed in the club. This will provide a clear view for the club members.

, Now that a club has started, it is not over yet. All of the hard parts may have passed, but there is still the maintenance of the club, without which the club won't stay viable.

After the meeting, make sure that they know when the next one is.",How to Start a Book Club at School," Would it just be you and your friend? If so, it's probably not a good idea. If you think it would really be successful, however, read on.;
, This can be done through e-mail or verbally. However you do it, make sure you're very mature and professional about it. Make sure they know that this is something that you really want to make happen.

, Ask around; without one, you can't do it. It is against school rules in every school district to have a school-sponsored gathering without an adult in authority to keep things under control.

, Keep in mind the age group and reading capabilities of your school; even if you love Shakespeare, that doesn't mean that the rest of your elementary school will. Try to find something modern and hip. Harry Potter is overdone, so why not try such books as Maximum Ride, Daniel X, Alex Rider, Artemis Fowl, Hunger Games, etc.? All these are series, to retain interest, and have a modernized, adventurous feel.

, How long do you think it will take them to read your designated book? I recommend every one to two months, respectively; you don't want to rush or discourage them. Also, you don't want it to clash with other meetings or athletic practice. Keep it short, too; an hour or so.

, Don't just assume that they'll want to just talk about the developing relationship between Max and Fang; bring in themed treats, play games and do activities that relate to the books you're reading.

, Go way public. Put up posters around school and at your local library, add something to the school's morning announcements, send a mass e-mail. Emphasize what you'll be doing, and you'll be sure to find some loyal members. Also, make sure they know what book they need to have read.

, Make sure that this isn't just a social hour, it's a book club.

, You don't want people to show up at the wrong time, or not at all.

, Or if you want new members, and if your allowed to, give out some flyers in school or advertise your club by stapling the posters to trees or telephone poles (if permitted).

, These can include a photo of themselves, full name and other simple things. ID cards/badges are used to enter somewhere, for instance, if you want to enter a hideout, you would need an ID to let the other members know it's you - not someone in disguise. It is bad if you lose an ID, but if you say your name they would probably make a new one for you.

,, You don't want to tell them secrets and let them give them away to everyone.

Remain focused.",How to Make a Themed Club with Your Sister," In order for your club to be successful, it should be based on a subject that you and your sister are passionate about. If you're interested in gaining a few members, it may be best to select a topic that you know others can relate to. For instance, if you both love baseball and know that there are other fans in your school, you could start a baseball-themed club. Note that you may have to make compromises, as you and your sister may have different desires. For example, if you want a cat club while your sister is interested in a dog club, mix the two ideas together and form an animal club.


There are a variety of subjects out there that would make a good theme for your club. Examples are arts and crafts, astronomy, books (or a specific book club), singing, baking, and so on.;
, Once you have decided what your club will focus on, it's time to choose a name. Rather than picking a popular name, you and your sister should come up with a unique one that will grab people's attention. It may take a while for you both to come to an agreement, so write down all your ideas and see which ones you like best. You can also create a motto or slogan together, making sure that it's catchy enough to stay in people's memory once they hear it. For inspiration, do research on popular clubs and see what makes their name special.


If you and your sister have trouble agreeing on a name, you could try to combine both of your ideas together.

, Find a place where both you and your sister can hold meetings, ensuring that it's big enough for both of you. Make sure that it doesn't have too much traffic and that you have permission to use it. Examples are a spacious closet, your basement, the dining room, or even your room. If you're planning on recruiting members, it would be wise to find a suitable place that accommodates everyone. If you cannot find an area that's large enough, you may want to consider holding your meetings outdoors, although you should keep an eye on the weather.


You could also get permission to hold your club at school in an empty classroom. The club meetings could occur during lunch or after school hours.

, Make sure that your decorations match the theme that you've picked. You can go to the store and purchase inexpensive supplies - such as banners and stickers - or you could create them on your own by printing out images or drawing. Use your imagination, but make sure to include your sister's ideas as well. Before decorating the clubhouse, be sure that you have permission to do so.

, If you want others participating in your club, the best place to find potential members is your school or neighborhood. Ask your friends, neighbors, and classmates if they want to join your club. Since your club is new, it may be best to only accept a few members at a time so that you don't have to deal with too many people. Expect that not everyone will be interested, and be polite if they reject your invitation. They may want to join in the future, so it's important that you appear kind and welcoming to them.


Be accepting and kind. Allow people to join your club, despite their age or social status. Unless if they are a threat to others (ex: a bully), you should be warm to everyone and not judge them at a first glance. This will help boost your club's reputation and encourage more members to come.
As your club grows, you can invite more people to join your club. However, in the beginning, it's best to start small and figure out whether running a club is really what you want to do.
Gather your members' contact information, including phone numbers or email addresses. That way, you can update them on any cancelled or upcoming meetings. You can also ask them necessary questions, such as whether they'll be able to bring certain supplies or if they have any allergies.

, It's important that every club have a leader who will make important decisions for the benefit of the club and its members. If you and your sister are planning to be the presidents of the club, make sure that you split the leadership role equally. You both should have the same amount of power, and be sure that you talk with one another before making major decisions. However, if you plan on having someone else be the president, make sure that you select candidates who have good traits and the potential to help the club succeed. You should allow your members to cast in their votes before giving the role to someone.


Be sure to listen to the members' ideas and opinions. Remember that you may need to make compromises in order to satisfy everyone.

, It's best to have rules posted in the club to make sure that everyone behaves well. Have a discussion with your sister before writing necessary rules, making sure to cover important topics (ex: Will cursing be permitted? What happens to members who are consistently late to meetings?). Do your best to have as little as possible so that people don't feel like their freedom is restricted. The purpose of the rules is to keep everyone safe and happy, not to show your authority and power over your members. Remember to be fair.


As time goes on, you may find that you need to add a few more rules. Don't hesitate to do so if the need arises, but be sure to inform members of the new changes.
You may need to decide on consequences for those who continue breaking the rules. For instance, if someone disobeys a rule, they may receive a warning. However, after three strikes, they might be temporarily banned from the club.

, Once you have a few members, ask for their schedules and see what times they are available. Then, you and your sister can decide on the frequency and duration of your meetings. Meeting once or twice a week for about thirty minutes to an hour is an ideal amount of time. You should also plan out what will occur during the meetings. It's best to have activities and discussions planned ahead of time in order to keep your members' interest. If they find that the meetings are poorly planned and boring, they may refuse to come and waste their time.


Using a planner or a calendar, write down the activities you and your sister want to do during each meeting, making sure that your members will like them as well. That way, you have time to gather any necessary supplies and set them out for your members.
The day before every meeting, send out texts or emails to your members, reminding them to come if they wish. This will prevent them from forgetting.

, Snacks and drinks are a necessity, as they'll keep your members satisfied and prevent them from leaving early because of hunger or thirst. Talk with your members and assign them certain dates when they'll have to bring food to the club. At the end of every meeting, remind them who is providing snacks at the next meeting so that they don't forget. Be sure to take everyone's allergies and preferences into account so that you don't upset or harm someone.

, Once you have had plenty of meetings, you may be able to tell which members are dedicated to the club. There will be those who come to almost every meeting and others who might not take it as seriously. You can give trusted members roles to play so that they feel important in the club. For instance, one of them could be in charge of making sure people bring snacks. Another person could be a secretary, who takes attendance during meetings and performs other tasks. Be sure that the roles you give members not only make them feel important but also benefit your club.

, Running a club can be difficult, especially since planning may require much time and patience. It can be easy to slack off and give into laziness, but if you really want your club to be successful, you and your sister should try to stay on top of tasks. Work together and help each other stay focused. It may help to ask trusted members for their assistance and perhaps assign them certain tasks, such as searching for new activities on the Internet.

Decide what your club is about.,
Make a name for your club.,
Think of a meeting spot.,
Organize your members.,
Think of a secret handshake/password.,
Conjure up a question that you want answered.,
Observe and investigate.

,
Jot down (in your club notebook) what you discover or find.,
Make sure you don't let anyone catch you.

",How to Make a Secret Agent Club (Kids)," What sort of secret agent activities do you want to investigate? You might want to look for lost pets, missing items, or have general secret missions. Perhaps you want to train others in doing detective work.
, Need help? Take a funny word, and make it stand for something. For example, you could name your club the B.D.E! Committee, which would stand for BEST DETECTIVES EVER! Educating Events.

, Is the field at recess fine, or should you make a clubhouse?


A secret room for your club might be fun.

, Who's the leader? Who's the co-captain? Who's the rookie? There are a lot of jobs you could make also. Event organizers make up missions/contests and pitch them to the captains. Helpers can teach new members the ropes. Guards can guard the members, rookies, and captains as they are having a meeting or starting an investigation.

, (A fun thing to do is make up a contest where people make up their own handshake or password and others vote who's is the best).

, Is there any rumors at school that there's a ghost haunting a bathroom or something mysterious? Think up a way to get to the bottom of it.

,, It may help to look over it later.

Name your club!,
Start asking people to join.,
What will you do at your meetings?,
Make a secret handshake, a club song or a code.,
Make ID for your members.,
Are you a serious club?",How to Make Awesome Clubs (for Kids)," You might want to have a vote on the best name at your first meeting.


It's a cool idea to use the initials of the members of the club in the club's name. You could even mix up your names like John and Edward Grimes did when they decided to call themselves 'Jedward'.;
,


Try to get at least three people in.
Have your current members ask their friends if they're interested.
Why not ask people you don't usually hang out with to join the club? You'll meet new people and you'll have more fun if there are lots of people in the club.
It would be really neat to ask someone who hasn't many friends living nearby or seems lonely.

,


Some activity suggestions are singing and playing games.
Is your club about something specific? If your club is a dance club, for example, you could read magazines about dance, watch dance movies, try out new moves or make up new routines. Find something you all enjoy.
Choose an activity which everyone can take part in.

, Make them simple.

, Put jobs, ranks and names on them.

, If you're really enjoying your new club make some rules so that it can keep going.


Decide on a day, place and a time to meet up every week or fortnight. You could take it in turns to host the meeting in your own houses. After school on Friday or Saturday morning are good times but make sure that nobody has lessons or practises at these times.
Make rules like 'No bad language', 'Be kind' or 'If there is a meeting everyone has to be invited. Having secret meetings or only inviting some people is wrong and breaks the club ethos' (an ethos is what you believe is right).

"
"
The first step is finding willing members.,
Once you have a member or two, you need a meeting place.,
Create a special binder for your fan club.,
Sort out a meeting time, for example - Every Friday, 4:00 to 5:00.,
Give everyone a special position (president, vice pres., secretary, treasurer, etc.),
At your first meeting, organize a folder to store every member's contact information.,
Know what you want to do at the club.,
An interesting add-on would be to organize day trips to Pokémon-related places, for example, a Pokémon Sleepover, a Pokémon Cinema Visit or a Pokémon Battle Championship.

,
A Newsletter would be a good way to keep in touch, and a Club Website would be great to showcase your club and what you're about.,
Once your club is expanded you can start to get a bigger place to meet, like a tree house or a private place.

",How to Make a True Pokemon Fan Club," Ask anybody you know who likes Pokémon - brother, sister, friend or cousin - and ask them if they are interested.;
, It can be anywhere private - your bedroom for a small club, or a hall for a large club.

, You can draw a pokeball on it and store important papers in it (meeting papers, sign up, check in, etc.)

, Pick a day when everybody is available, and time that is suitable. If you go to school, keep that in mind.

, You should be the president because you founded the club and let everyone else compete for other spots in your clubs high members area.

, You may want to include a Basic Rule Book, and a Uniform - for example, a certain color t-shirt with a Club Badge.

, Ask everybody what they personally would like to do. At the beginning of each meeting, you could share Pokémon News. Another example would be to bring a Pokémon Game (like Pokémon Platinum) and a console (like a Nintendo DS) and host Pokémon Battle Championships, and award the winner with a prize.

,, Advertising your club with posters and flyers is a great idea to expand your club.

Consider what you'll do together, such as making cupcakes from scratch in each other's kitchens, then selling them to neighbors or in the local farmer's market and donating the profits to a favorite charity. Or, you could just make cupcakes for fun, experimenting with different kinds of cupcakes. You might also consider making your own cupcake newsletter and maybe even a book on cupcakes some day.
, You'll need someone who organizes the meetings, someone who plans the meeting content, someone who gets ingredients or craft materials for activities, and so on. You can share the roles if you prefer, rather than making one or two people do all the work., Always know what you are doing. If you don't know what you are doing it will start to get boring. Always do something different each day you meet, such as:

Making cupcakes
Making up new kinds of cupcakes
Writing out recipes, sharing them online perhaps
Making a photo board of cupcakes you've all made
Making crafts that look like cupcakes, and so on.

, This might be a cupcake show that includes the neighbors or other people. Award prizes for the best cupcakes, using members of your club as the judges., Help people to join by making your club known. Include when the club meets, what happens there, and where you are meeting., Pass them around your neighborhood or place them up on lamp-posts. Always be sure to have your parent/guardian when you are hanging up your posters."

Make sure everyone wants to be in a book club.If you’re a parent and trying to start a book club for your child, ask your child if they wish to participate in the book club.,
Decide who can participate.In a book club for kids, all the kids should be of about the same age and reading level.,
Choose the size of the book club.If the book club is too large, not every child will get to participate.,
Advertise your book club.If your child has enough friends or classmates to make a club of adequate size, there is no need to advertise the club.,
Decide where to hold the book club.The location where you host the book club depends on your situation.,
Start out with an organizational meeting.An organizational meeting is an initial meeting between the kids in the book club and their parents or guardians.,
Explain the rules of the club.Rules should be laid out for both parents and kids.,
Explain the structure of the book club.Decide with the other parents and kids how often you want to meet, and choose the days and times that work best.,
Set the goals of the book club.State at the outset what the overall vision or mission of the book club is.,
Choose a theme.A theme is a central topic or idea that all the books in the club revolve around.,
Choose the book or books you’ll be reading.It’s a good idea to decide at least one month ahead of time what book the club will read next.,
Structure the discussion.Every club meeting should have two discussion leaders.,
Offer encouragement to reluctant readers.,
Don’t be too formal.The book club shouldn’t feel like a literature class.,
Add something extra.After reading a book, you could allow time for the kids to do a fun craft related to the book they read.",How to Make a Book Club (for Kids)," If you’re a teacher or someone else with access to a larger body of kids, ensure that at least a few of them are interested in participating in the book club.;
, If you’re a teacher or leader of a youth organization, you might have to make multiple book clubs -- one for second and third-graders, one for fourth and fifth-graders, and so on.


Alternately, you might make two clubs at each grade level, one for advanced students and one for average readers.
Book clubs work best with kids in second grade and up., If the book club is too small, the same children might be reading the whole time and become weary of the tedium.


Five to eight kids is usually the best size for a book club.

, However, if you do not, you could advertise the book club in your town.


Ask your librarian to add the book club announcement to the library’s website and newsletter.
Alternately, you could print a colorful flyer or two and put it up on the library’s community bulletin board, or on other boards in locations the kids frequent, including the YMCA, roller skating rink, or arcade.
If you’re starting a book club for kids at your school, you could encourage children to sign up using fliers on the library windows, or ask the principal to add them to the end-of-the-day announcements.
Include all the relevant information when designing your flier or announcement. Include the date of the initial club meeting, the location, and the age ranges of the kids your want to join.

, Whatever location you choose, ensure it is well-lit, quiet, clean, and conducive to conversation. Ensure your location will accommodate all your readers and any adults in attendance.


If you’re a parent, you could choose to hold it at your house each week.
Alternately, you could share the responsibility of hosting it among the parents of the children in the book club.
If you’re a librarian, you should hold it in a smaller anteroom or children’s room.
If you’re a teacher, you could hold it in your school’s library or a classroom.
If your initial location doesn’t work, you can always change it later. Don’t feel like you’re locked in to a certain location forever.
If holding the book club at a house, it’s nice for the host to provide snacks for the kids.

, This meeting will provide space for the children to get to know each other before the club begins reading.


Allow time for the kids to talk freely, but provide a structured activity to draw out kids who might be shy, too.
Have all the children sit in a circle and introduce themselves. They should say, “Hello, my name is . . .” and list three facts about themselves.
Provide board games and snacks for the children. This will help them associate the book club with good feelings and happiness.

, For instance, maybe you want to insist that each child also has a parent present during the book club (you don’t want it to become daycare, after all). In reference to the actual book club, you might set a rule that says only one person can talk at a time. Other rules might include:Be respectful to everyone in the book club.
Raise your hand if you want to speak.
Treat the book club location with respect.

, Explain the book club’s process. The process you choose depends on the children’s ages and reading level.


If children are very competent readers, they might read a book outside of the book club, then talk about it in a guided conversation during the book club. In that case, the conversation will be guided by thoughtful questions from an adult monitor or group leader.In other cases, especially when children do not read as well, or if the books are shorter in length, the children will read a book together during the book club. In this case, each child will read a page or two, and the monitor will stop to help explain confusing plot points or vocabulary. At the end of the reading, the group leader might ask questions to encourage the children to talk more about the ideas in the book.
Alternately, you might allow every child to read their own book, or one of several books on a given theme, then talk about each book in turn during the book club., You might target the book club to a specific age group or a particular set of students, such as students who have trouble reading.


For instance, you might say, “This book club is designed to help kids in fifth and sixth grade become better readers.”

, For instance, you might choose “oceans” as the theme for a given month. In this case, all the books you read would be about animals, adventures, and curiosities of the ocean.


If the book club reads one book or two books each month, you could choose a theme that lasts around three months.
If your book club is more advanced and reads one book each week, your theme might last only one month.
After completing one themed cycle of books, ask the club members what theme they’d like next.

, Let the kids vote on the book they want to read first. Have a few choices ready to offer the children.


Read a variety of books. Switch it up frequently and read both fiction (mysteries, young adult novels, and science fiction) and nonfiction (historical works, books about science, and so on). Drop some poetry in there once in a while, too.Encourage kids to look for the book(s) at local libraries.
If you don’t know what books the kids might like, ask your local librarian for advice, or ask the kids directly during the first organizational meeting what they like to read.After deciding on the book(s) you’ll read, reserve copies of the book at your local library.
If you reserve the book(s) at a bookstore, be sure that the parents of the book club members pay you back.

, The team should include one book club member and one of their parents. Together, this team should guide the discussion (but not dominate it) by asking questions and determining who can talk. This helps maintain order and ensure everyone gets a chance to speak. Facilitators should prepare leading questions before the meeting in order to ensure the discussion is productive and thought-provoking. Good questions include:


What was the setting?
What kind of book is this? Is it a true story?
Why did a certain character choose a certain course of action?

, Presumably, children who enroll in a book club already enjoy reading. Sometimes, though, kids might be forced to attend by their parents and might not enjoy reading. There are a variety of reasons children might not like to read. If a member of the book club does not like to read, you can offer encouragement by trying one of several methods:If the child is bored by reading, find out what he or she likes to read and try to introduce more books that the reluctant reader would like to the club.
If the child lacks confidence in his or her ability, don’t force them to read at length (or at all) during the oral reading period. Alternately, if the book club is one in which the children are reading individual books, steer the child toward a book that is easy to read.
Encourage children to take their time when reading or formulating questions and answers.

, Let the kids lead the conversation. Keep them focused on the book and ask leading questions if there is a lull in the conversation, but don’t be afraid to let them take off with their ideas.


If kids don’t like the book, prod them to explain why they don’t like it.
Other questions you could ask include, “Which character was your favorite?”
If you want to include a questionnaire for the kids to fill out after reading each book, keep it short and simple, and make it optional. For instance, you might create a questionnaire asking simply, “Did you like this book? Why or why not?”

, For example, kids who read a book about oceans might then partake in a craft that lets them design a little sailboat out of tongue depressors, or use colored construction paper to make a crab, lobster, or whale.


Don’t make crafts too elaborate. The focus should remain on the book and the conversation about the book.You could also invite guest speakers to talk about the topic of a book. For instance, if you read a mystery book one week, you could invite a police officer or detective to talk about how the book relates to their work.
Give the kids some neat bookmarks with pictures on them. If you’re a librarian, distribute free pens or pencils with the library’s name and logo on them.

Advertise your station and launch date to the public and the school.,
Throw a launch party.,
Start broadcasting.",How to Create a School Radio (UK)," Ask a member of staff, deliver speeches, talk to the headmaster, and so forth. However, it's not enough to just ask. You will also need to demonstrate why this is a good idea, along with suggestions for raising the funds for the technical equipment needed.


Do a short poll among students to ascertain the level of interest in a school radio. Knowing this will bolster your argument for it.
Find out whether it's possible to borrow, hire or purchase used equipment to make the radio happen on a budget.
Explain what benefits you think the students––and teachers and other staff––will get from having a school radio. This might include being able to make announcements, provide interesting ways to get across messages, provide work experience, teach students to think and work together, and so forth.
Provide a brief overview of what you perceive a likely structure as being. This will help to demonstrate that you've thought well beyond just the ""nice idea"" of having the school radio.;
, You will need a Station Manager, Assistant Manager, Technical Team, Production Manager (mixing, jingle making and audio processing). And, of course, you'll need plenty of presenters.

, Will it just be during school hours? Will it be only during breaks during school time? Will it be after school or on weekends? Address this early on, perhaps even when selling the idea to your school, so that you have realistic expectations. The more hours on air, the more work that has to be done and the more people rostered on and not doing other things such as studying and sports, so bear this in mind.

, This will allow you to play copyrighted music. Call up the communications authority in your area to find out what the prices are and what you need to do to fill out the paperwork.


In some places, a school license is available for a discounted price.

, A package may be a good idea if you have a high budget and don't have so much technical experience. However, if you are on a lower budget try buying the kit separately and putting your own kit together. Or consider hiring it. It might also be possible to get secondhand gear from auctions sites or actual live auction houses. Call around to see what's available.

,


Set up your automation; install any software you require on your PCs.
Put together playlists for the day.
Sort out a schedule.

,


Use Facebook and Twitter to promote the station.
Have an email account for listeners to contact you during the show or after.

, Have a fun party, which can also be part of a first broadcast. Invite the whole school and use it as an open day event as well.

, Now you're ready, so get yourselves on air. Keep the station maintained well and on air. To do this, you'll need to practice good management, have teaching staff advising and overseeing finances and managerial issues and helping where needed. Otherwise, try to do as much of this yourselves, as the experience is invaluable.

"
"
First, create and organize a club.,
Those who know about the club and want to join must fill in an application with questions of your choice.,
When inviting others to join, remember to politely request that they not tell anyone else that isn't in the club!,
For all the official members make ID cards for them.,
Once you have gathered enough people (maximum in this case should be up to 15 people) gather them to have your first meeting.,
Have everyone at the first meeting sign a contract.

,
Arrange another meeting a few days later or the next day.,
Have a third meeting.,
Find a place at your house/location that is YOUR TERRITORY that you can use as a fort.,
Are your members ready?,
Double-agents should be taken out of the club!

,
Enjoy your new, long-lasting club!

",How to Ensure a Lasting Spy Club (for Kids)," Get a piece of paper out and write down all the names of people your age or 1-2 years younger (older not very preferred often) that are interested/probably interested in becoming a part of your club. Then notify everyone who's applied and ask those who you would like to have join your secret group.;
, Personal, uncomfortable questions should NOT be answered, like, ""Who is your crush?"" or ""What's the name of your married uncle's wife, aka your aunt?"" Those are unnecessary and often are considered private or personal!

, Don't care about double-agents unless you have enemies and you believe there may be a double-agent working for them. Only members of the organization know who else is in it and can't even tell ""Santa"" (if they believe in him) or their siblings/parents!

, You can cut out a piece of thin cardboard and paste small pieces of paper with their info on it or you can print out pre-made cards with their name, code name, and maybe even photos!


The ID cards must require the following:

Full Name (if they wish that their REAL first/middle name not to be printed on it, please follow and consider their request!)
Code Name
Age or Date of Birth
Their position (optional)
Their photograph, a drawing of them, or at least the organization/club logo
The head spy's signature to authenticate the card and make it obvious it is real



, Explain that there may be emergency meetings if necessary and that there will be meetings bi-monthly. (Or weekly or monthly, maybe even daily! Whichever you choose.) Discuss information about spy identification cards (ID membership cards) and any uniforms or essentials they must wear/bring/carry. Take questions and answer them full in detail. They may take notes. Discuss everything important to the club and don't forget; how to sneak around quietly and without anyone knowing! (See Tips)

,, This one is unofficial but the entire club will be creating a spy kit! The spy kit's optional but recommended for extra fun. It MUST include a few band-aids (in case someone gets a cut) and a roll-around bandage, in case anyone sprains their wrist or whatever. It can also include 2-3 back-up walkie talkies (turn off when in no use or when around enemies/targets!) and even a few water bottles, depending on how many members you have. Depending on the amount of items (and the sizes of them) you may need either a hiking backpack, a small backpack, a dark-colored tote/book bag, or something like a satchel. Many boys wear satchels like girls wear book/tote bags! Also, maybe a few disguises can be put in, but consider the size of the carrying pack/case! Is there enough room to put in a black hoodie? Maybe a wig? Sunglasses? Other shoes? Hair accessories for girls? Those are the only recommended clothing items. Other items may be too... ""fantastic"". (Fake.)

, You will have a file with the first ever mission, but it must be a LEGAL training mission. Maybe an obstacle course and a relative or friend not in the club can help you train the other members! Make sure it breaks no state/national laws and violates no one's security/privacy. Let the ""victim""/""target""/""enemy"" know what you are doing and approve of it and are HAPPY to help with it! Involve them and let the ""target"" know everything, the time the mission will start and so forth.

, This should be the third meeting. That comfortable, roomy walk-in closet in your bedroom that you used for nothing? Well, that can make a GREAT secret spy fort/HQ! Make sure your parents allow ALL of your members to come to your house during meetings or accomplished mission parties. The parties should be small and take place mainly in your room only!

, Put them up to the test! Don't eliminate anyone from the club unless they are horrible. Then they should be trained furthermore.

If you're in high school, the teacher will probably be required to supervise activities for safety purposes. Have answers prepared for the following questions:Will the teacher be actively involved and how often will his or her presence be required? You could respond, ""The teacher will need to be present for all meetings and that the teacher must sign off on any club activity that takes place away from school.""
Will he or she need to supervise equipment and activities? ""The teacher will need to be present for all club activities.""
Are there any safety risks in the club itself? You could respond, ""No, it's a chess club.""
How will the student body be made aware of the club? You might respond, ""Social media or flyers."";
, You should keep in mind that many teachers have interests outside their academic discipline and may welcome the opportunity to step outside their traditional box. Above all, however, you should look for a teacher with whom you have a solid student-teacher relationship with. A good personal relationship is helpful, but not strictly necessary. Have two or three back ups., This may be as simple as going on the school's website to see what extracurricular activities the teacher already sponsors. If you're in college, it might mean googling your professor to see what they themselves are involved in outside of research and teaching. In any case, knowing what your potential sponsors have on their plates is a good way of saving you--and them--time if you realize they already have way too much on their plate to sponsor another club., While teachers sometimes keep office hours, if you know your meeting might take awhile, it might be in your best interest to set up an appointment. If you know you have a free period, or a period where you don't have to participate the entire time, then you can ask for permission to meet with a teacher during that time. If you have that teacher for a class, you might just ask them while you're in class. Just don't disrupt class to do so., You'll want to present the club as completely as possible. You do not need to write down a presentation as this should be an informal meeting, but you should bring all the paperwork with you. You'll want to be on time and completely prepared with the answers that your sponsor might have. Though they may ask a question you weren't expecting, you should try to cover all the bases before the meeting. Your teacher may ask the following questions:""Do you have the necessary paperwork?"" You should be able to say ""yes"" to this.
""What's my role?"" You could respond, ""To supervise all activities of the club.""
""What are the planned meeting times?"" You could respond, ""During the normal club period,"" or ""On Tuesdays after school.""
""Are you planning to have any off-campus matches or events?"" You could respond, ""Yes, we'd like to go to the School Chess Association Tournament.""

, Though you may be disappointed, getting upset or angry is not going to help you along with the club. Remember that teachers talk to each other and if you react poorly to a rejection from one teacher, other teachers may not want to sponsor you either. Instead, calmly thank them for their consideration and move on to your next choice for a sponsor. If they say yes, thank them as well, and follow up with some reassurance that you'll do your part as well. You'll also want to get them to sign any necessary paperwork.Ask the teacher, ""We've been working on putting together a chess club. Would you be willing to sponsor it?""
If the teacher says yes, say, ""Thank you. What do you need to know about the club? And can you sign these forms?""
If the teacher says no, say, ""Thank you for hearing us out,"" and then ask them if they know of anyone who would be willing to sponsor the club.
Don't forget to follow-up with the teacher and the administration once you've submitted your form. If they give you a time-frame for an answer, don't hassle them before that time has passed.

, Will you do projects? Will it be a space for sharing experiences? Will you participate in a competition, such as a quiz bowl? What are the logistics of any and all of these, including additional paperwork beyond the school's paperwork, deadlines, and potential meeting times., If other students aren't interested you may have a hard time getting support for starting a club. You'll want at least 2 or three other students to support you as you try to start a club. You might try feeling out interest through your social media accounts, or by checking with your friends at school., Before you get too far in the process, you'll want to know your school's requirements for the formation of clubs. Do they have a formal process for assigning sponsors? Do they allow some clubs to have a class period to meet or do all clubs have to meet during a delineated time or after school?If the student handbook isn't very detailed, it may be a good idea to ask a counselor or administrator about setting up a club. They will likely have the information you need, and can give you guidance about which teachers may be up to sponsoring your specific club.You'll want to find out what paperwork you need and fill it out as much as you can before speaking to the teacher. The less work the teacher has to do, the easier it will be for them to say yes.

, As with many things in school, older students often know a bit about policy and getting things done at a particular school. If you are a part of a new club or you know some students who have formed a club, ask them for the details of the process. Ask them, ""What would you have done differently if you had to start over on the club?"" or ""What were the obstacles you had in starting your club?"""

Smile, smile, smile.,
Greet everyone you see.,
Look out for people who look in need of an act of kindness.,
Compliments go a long way.,
Promote Optimism.,
If it's a friend, be random.,
Remember the homeless.,
Volunteer.,
Appreciate and notice what others do for you.",How to Brighten Someone's Day," Whenever someone sees a smiling face, it reminds them that they may have reasons to smile themselves, and it will create a happier mood. Or, it makes them more depressed as they see you grinning like a loon when they have nothing to smile about whilst they cope with depression or deal with a difficult situation such as the death of a loved one. The simplest of human interactions, the gesture to a fellow human of a slight perking of the lips, is one of the strongest messages of goodwill at your command. Whether you walk with a smile on your face all day or just smile at a certain person who catches your eye, a frank, open smile will not only cheer up, if they weren't really that down, the recipient (and maybe get you a smile back) but you will notice that smiling actually makes you feel happier.;
, This will make people feel that they have been noticed and accepted in their environment and brighten their day.

, Once you start looking, you might be surprised, because the sad, the lonely, and the hopeless are everywhere: alone on a park bench, sobbing into their coffee, or just looking a little miserable. Even a smile will help, but if they really seem upset then go over and ask if they're okay. Offer a hug or a tissue. Many strangers will not wish to open up to stranger and sadly, may think you are invading their privacy or interfering and not minding your own business. Remember if someone has a genuine problem such as recently having been diagnosed with terminal cancer, your asking if they are ok will not necessarily help.


Surprise people with small cheery gifts. Homemade cupcakes or a box of doughnuts for an early morning are sure to bring a smile to someone's face. Be careful that the person who's day you intend to brighten with sugary, calorific food is not depressed due to their being over weight or being advised they are in an at risk group for diabetes.
Pay for the person behind you. Whether there's a reason why you want the specific person behind you to get a free meal (for instance, they're a soldier that you support) or you just have some extra money for brightening someone's day, at the drive-through offer to pay for them to the server. This random act of kindness may brighten someone's day but be aware you may be paying for someone who is perfectly happy already and couldn't be any brighter, or, a criminal of some kind. You just don't know who you are 'helping' when you give at random. You might take away the opportunity for a hard working single dad to treat his kids with his own earnings for the first time after years of unemployment, but, go ahead and do it if it makes YOUR day brighter thinking, not KNOWING, you've brightened someone else's day.
Take advantage of special occasions. For instance, on Valentine's Day, take advantage of all the roses to get a big bunch, then either send them to someone or go around giving a rose to anyone who looks in need of it. Hay fever may be an issue here so take care.

, People like it when you notice things about them because more than likely, they put a lot of thought into it. Be careful not to inadvertently point out something the person may not be proud of. For example, don't compliment weigh loss if in fact the person has lost weight due to ill health or a miscarriage. Compliment what people do to be safe, not their appearance. A heartfelt, 'good work' is never going to offend.

, If something goes, or is going wrong for someone, twist it and show them the positive. Tell them how it would be worse if it went the other way. For example, a colleague misses out on a promotion to the bosses son, you can promote optimism by saying, ' you probably would of struggled to spend all the extra money that promotion would of earned you anyway'.

, This can really brighten up someone's day, with all the random ramblings and outbursts.

, Is there a certain homeless person who you often see in the streets? How many times have you walked right past a homeless human being? They may not be among the pillars of the community, but every life, including murderers and child rapists, has a right to live, and whether it's money or a hot meal, homeless people will appreciate anything you have to give. Often, money is more appreciated than food as it can be spent on drugs. Next time you see a homeless person on your way to a takeaway or the supermarket, get them something - a burger, a jumper, and even food for their pets. If you don't want to spend money, just rummage around in your house: old blankets, clothes, and shoes will always be appreciated. Try making something such as a knitted scarf and hone your skills at the same time.

, For kindness on a larger scale or with an overall purpose, try volunteering. Whether it's at the local animal shelter or nursing home, the satisfaction you get will be well worth the time you put into it, but do remember the object of the exercise is to brighten someone's day, not your own.

, Thank people, no matter how trivial what they've done for you seems to you. Recognize their efforts in their line of work. Say please when you ask for things and show courtesy in all your interactions with others.

Know when to bow.,
Assume the bowing stance.,
Bow with your waist, not your neck.,
Avert your gaze to show respect.,
Finish the bow.",How to Bow Politely1," Bowing is typically used in Asian cultures to show respect, honor, or gratitude. A silent bow often replaces the phrase ""Thank you."" In Asian cultures, you should bow from the hip with your head pointed down. Polite bowing is still common in many Asian countries, but it is not practiced as strictly in America.


Bowing is prevalent to varying degrees in many East Asian countries, but it is most prominent in China, Korea, Taiwan, Japan, and Vietnam. Various nuanced bows are used to express apologies, gratitude, sincerity, deference, and remorse, among other things.
The handshake has become a common greeting in many East Asian cultures, particularly in business circles. Bowing may not be appropriate when you first meet someone—especially if he or she is a peer—but it can be a versatile way to convey more complex emotions. A slight bow to show courtesy is usually welcome.;
, Stand straight with your feet together, forming a V with your heels. Clench your hands at your sides, but not too tight.

, Bend at the waist, but keep your back straight. Open your hands as you bend. Bring your feet together., If you are bowing to an elder, a superior, or someone you respect, look down at their feet when you bow. If you're bowing to someone who does not fit into any of these categories, feel free to look them directly in the eye.Bear in mind that if you look someone in the eyes, it may be taken as a sign of disrespect. This is especially the case when bowing to older, more traditionally-minded people, especially those who grew up steeped in an East Asian culture. Carefully consider the situation, and be mindful of who you are bowing to.

, Straighten up, close your hands, and split your feet back into the V. Feel free to make eye contact with the person to whom you bowed.

Know when to bow.,
Put your left hand behind your back.,
Bring your right hand to your waist.,
Keep your eyes lowered.,
Stand up in one fluid motion.",How to Bow Politely2," Bowing evolved as a traditional sign of respect and acknowledgement in many Western cultures, but it is much less common than it once was. You may still bow to show respect, or to add a dramatic flourish to a situation, but the gesture will appear a bit outdated. That said, bowing is still generally regarded as a polite gesture.


Bowing in western culture is often accompanied by an air of mock formality, and perhaps a degree of ironic self-consciousness. The European-American ceremonial bow is largely an anachronistic gesture, so bear in mind that you may not be taken seriously.
Try owning the mock formality of the bow by playing with nuance and taking the gesture to the extreme. Bow very slowly and deeply to show sarcasm—something like a slow clap. Bow very quickly and politely to convey mock deference.

, Bend your arm at the elbow, and rest your hand (palm out( at waist-level. Alternately, press your left hand across your abdomen.

, Bend your arm at the elbow. Hold your palm against your body while you tip your upper body forward. The lower you bend, the more respect you show.


If you are wearing a hat, remove it and hold it by the brim in your right hand. If you are in a situation that calls for extreme deference—say, a funeral, or the performance of a national anthem—tuck your hat under your arm until the moment passes.

, Do not raise your chin to maintain eye contact—this may be taken as a sign of disrespect. This is, however, a tradition that evolved from a highly stratified feudal society, so do not expect most 21st-century people to take offense if you make eye contact or bow ""incorrectly"".

, Straighten your back. Drop your hands. Raise your eyes to meet the gaze of the person to whom you bowed, and proceed to speak with them.

Bow in a corporate setting.,
Consider curtsying if you are wearing a skirt or dress.,
Bow for an audience.",How to Bow Politely3," Bow to denote respect, as you would in a non-corporate situation, but be especially mindful of the rank of those to whom you bow. Japanese culture is highly hierarchical, meaning that that older people have higher social status than younger people, men usually have more status than women, and senior executives demand more respect than junior executives.Japanese businessmen often exchange business cards before bowing or shaking hands. Make sure that your business card clearly states your rank—this will determine who your negotiating counterpart should be.
If you are bowing to someone who ranks higher than you in his/her respective company, make sure to avert your gaze to show respect. Bear in mind that higher-ranking individuals may not bow back—bowing is often a one-way gesture in practice., Cross your legs and ankles while standing, then bend your knees slightly. Lift the fabric of your dress out to your sides. This is a traditional European and American way of showing deference, but its use has declined sharply over the past century.


Curtsy in any situation that might call for a bow. As with bowing, the curtsy is still regarded as a polite gesture, but it will come across as a bit outdated.

, In Western culture, it is common to bow after a speech or performance to acknowledge the applause of the crowd. As your audience claps (or snaps, cheers, etc.), put your right hand on the center of your chest. Breathe in deeply. Bend your back. Briefly bow your head, then stand back up.


Do not bow for too long, nor too quickly. Bow for 3-5 seconds, but do not let it drag on.
Stand still. Do not shuffle about while you bow.

",How to Curtsy," Bend your head forward slightly, as if giving a respectful nod. Maintain this head position throughout the curtsy.;
, Take the edges of your skirt between the thumb and first two fingers on each hand, with the pinkies extended. Gently pull the skirt out to each side. If the skirt of your dress is too narrow to pull out, just keep your hands down by your sides.

, Place your right foot a couple of inches behind the left, resting on the ball of your foot. As you do so, shift most of your weight onto the front foot.

, Lower yourself down into a curtsy, bending the knees outward, rather than forward. Keep your back straight as you do this -- do not lean forward and do not stick out your behind.

, Don't bob straight back up -- slowly and gracefully return to an upright position, lowering your hands back to your sides and raising your head as you do so.

, A court curtsy is a deep form of curtsy used to show respect and deference to members of royalty, usually from European countries. A court curtsy is similar to a simple curtsy, except it involves dipping much lower in order to show greater respect.


To perform a court curtsy, extend your right foot behind your left, resting on the ball of the foot. Keeping your back straight and your head lowered, bend your knees outward.
Keep lowering yourself down until your right knee almost touches the ground. Stay in that position for a second or two, then slowly raise yourself back to an upright position.
This type of curtsy may not sound difficult, but it actually requires a lot of practice to ensure it is performed smoothly, without any jerky movements., A ballet curtsy - also known as a révérence - is an elegant curtsy performed at the end of a performance or class to show gratitude to the audience, the pianist, or the instructor. Perform a ballet curtsy using the following steps:


Begin in first position. Extend your right leg out to the side, pointing your toe. As you do this, extend your arms outward into second position.
Transfer your weight onto your right foot, while extending your left foot a couple of inches behind. Rest the left foot on the tips of your pointed toes.
Keeping your back straight, bend your knees outwards into a curtsy. As you bend, bring your arms back to first position and bend your head slightly.Then, maintaining the same foot placement, stretch the legs upwards, raising the arms into fourth position. Lift your head and stretch out your neck and back as you do this.
Reverse the movements and repeat on the opposite side to complete the révérence. If you need to recap on the various ballet positions, see this article for guidance.

, The ""Texas dip"" is an elaborate curtsy performed by debutantes from the state of Texas during the International Debutante Ball. It involves lowering yourself into a deep curtsy, then leaning forward until your head almost touches the floor, allowing your gown to balloon all around you.


To do the ""Texas dip"", raise your arms out in front of you at shoulder height, then extend them out to the sides as you cross your left leg behind your right.
Keeping your back straight and your arms extended to the sides, bend your knees and lower yourself down into a deep curtsy. When you can go no further, gently drop down onto your behind.
Once sitting, lean forward until your forehead nearly touches the floor. At this point, some debutantes will turn their head to the right to avoid getting lipstick on their gown!
Keeping your back bent, raise your head to look at the audience - and don't forget to smile!
Finally, grab your escort's hand and slowly and gracefully raise yourself back to a standing position.,,,, British ladies lower themselves an inch and then bob up again. Hold that for three seconds.

Take note of your dog’s diet.,
Write down questions and concerns about your dog’s health.",How to Prepare for Your Dog's Annual Vet Exam," Depending on your dog’s age and health, the annual vet exam could take a long time. For example, if your dog has a chronic disease (e.g., diabetes) or multiple health problems, it may take longer for your vet to examine your dog and perform testing. Or, if your vet suspects a new health problem during the exam, your dog may need additional testing during the appointment.


When you schedule the appointment, choose a date and time when you will not have any time constraints.;
, When you call the vet’s office, ask if you will need to bring medical documents or samples (fecal, urine) with you to the appointment.If you know ahead of time what you will need to bring, you will be better prepared for the exam.

, Blood work is part of a dog’s annual vet exam. Fasting helps ensure the test results are accurate and not affected by what your dog eats before the blood draw. Also, certain blood tests, like a bile acid test, require a dog be fasted for 12 hours before the blood sample is taken.


Fasting can involve withholding only food or withholding both food and water. If you need to fast your dog, your vet’s office will give you specific instructions on how to perform the fast.
A bile acid test is a way to detect liver problems in dogs., Because annual vet exams involve the assessment of many aspects of your dog’s health, the cost of the exam could be high. When you schedule the exam, ask the receptionist for an estimate of the exam’s cost. The actual cost may be different, but knowing an approximate cost beforehand will prevent sticker shock when the exam is over. Approximate costs for an annual vet exam are listed below:Office visit (cost of appointment and physical exam): $45‒$55
Vaccinations: about $20 each
Heartworm test: $45‒$50
Fecal exam: $25‒$45
Geriatric screening (for dogs seven years or older): $85‒$110

, For your dog’s annual vet exam, your vet will test your dog’s feces for intestinal parasites. Prior to the exam, you will probably need to collect a fecal sample. This sample should be fresh—less than twelve hours old.A fresh sample will provide the most accurate results, since the eggs and larvae from some intestinal parasites can become unrecognizable in old fecal samples., Although picking up dog poop is never fun, collecting a sample will help you prepare for your dog’s annual exam. Pick up a sample with a doggie bag or a pooper scooper. If you use a doggie bag, turn it inside out so your hand is on the outside of the bag. Pick up a sample, use your free hand to turn the bag right side out, and tie a knot at the top of the bag.Doing it this way will keep your hands from getting dirty.


If you use a pooper scooper, pick up the sample with the scooper and empty the sample into a plastic bag. Tie a knot once the sample is in the bag.
It’s okay if you pick up grass, leaves, or other material on the ground when you collect a fecal sample.You do not need to collect a large sample. One or two pieces of feces should be enough.

, If you collect the fecal sample more than twelve hours before your dog’s annual exam, you can keep it fresh by putting it in your refrigerator. First, transfer the sample to a sealable plastic bag. Then, place the sealable bag into another bag to prevent your refrigerator from getting dirty.If you don’t want to transfer the sample to the sealable plastic bag, simply place the doggie bag inside the sealable bag. This way, the sample will still be double bagged, without the mess (and stink) of transferring the sample from one bag to the other.
Place the fecal sample as far away from the foods and beverages as possible. After you take the sample out, clean that area of the refrigerator.
If the thought of putting dog poop in your fridge doesn’t sit well with you, collect the fecal sample within 12 hours of the appointment and do not put it in your refrigerator.

, As with a fecal sample, a urine sample should be as fresh as possible. Ideally, collect the sample within a few hours of the annual exam. The urine should be in a sterile, sealable plastic container. If you decide to collect the urine yourself, try to stop by your vet’s office before the appointment to pick up a sterile container.


If you are not comfortable collecting the sample, the staff at the vet's office can collect the sample during the appointment. To keep your dog from peeing before the appointment, do not let it go outside unattended and do not let it stop to sniff the bushes when you arrive at the vet’s office., If you are not able to pick up a sterile container from your vet’s office, use a plastic container that you have at home. Make sure it is a container that you do not plan to use again.Examples of plastic containers are empty butter containers or a small food storage container.


Wash the container with soap and water before you use it to collect the urine sample.Let it dry completely.
To keep the urine from spilling out, select a container with a lid.

, It will be easier to collect a urine sample when your dog’s bladder is full. Usually, dogs will need to urinate after they wake up in the morning and after they eat. Dogs also urinate during walks or when they exercise.Pick a time when your dog is most likely to urinate.


Having your dog on a leash will also make it easier to collect the urine sample.

, While you are out with your dog, keep a watchful eye on its movements so you know when it is about to urinate. When your dog starts to urinate, slowly and gently position the plastic container in the urine stream, near your dog’s back end. It is important to be slow and gentle so you don’t startle your dog.You will need to collect only about one tablespoon of urine.It’s not a problem if you end collecting up more than that.
After collecting the urine and putting the lid on the container, wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water.
Don’t worry if your dog stops peeing before you are able to get a sample. The staff at your vet’s clinic can collect the sample during the annual exam.

, If you are not going to your vet’s office within one hour of collecting the urine sample, keep the sample cool by placing it in your refrigerator. It can stay fresh in the refrigerator for up to twelve hours.If you place the urine sample in the refrigerator, keep the container far away from foods and beverages and clean the area after you take the container out of the refrigerator.

, If you are taking your dog to a new vet, bring your dog’s medical paperwork with you to the appointment.Important paperwork includes vaccination history, results of previous heartworm tests and fecal exams, and any treatment your dog has received (e.g., surgeries, treatment for chronic diseases like diabetes). Also, bring paperwork that lists medicines your dog has taken or is currently taking, such as preventative medicines (e.g., flea and tick, heartworm).


The more information you can provide the new vet, the better they will be able to examine your dog and assess its health.
If you are going to a vet that has seen your dog before, they will already have your dog’s medical history.

, During the annual exam, your vet will want to know about your dog’s diet. Before the exam, write down everything your dog eats, including treats and supplements. If you occasionally feed your dog table scraps, write that down as well.What your dog eats can affect its health, so your vet will need to know the details of its diet.

, The annual vet exam is a great time to discuss questions and concerns about your dog’s health with your vet.For example, if your dog isn’t moving around as well as it used to, or is getting older and you’re wondering if you need to change its diet, bring up these topics with your vet. The more information you receive from your vet about your dog’s health and wellbeing, the better you will be able to care for your dog.

A bargaining unit is a group of employees who perform similar work. Generally, the union is the sole negotiator for all employees in the unit, even those not in the union.Unions also represent members in workplace disputes with supervisors.Common disputes occur around discipline and termination. A union may pay for a lawyer to help the employee arbitrate a dispute.Ask around and talk to a co-worker who is in the union. Ask if she or he has ever had to file a complaint with the union and how it was resolved.
Also ask if they think they are getting good value for the dues they are paying.;
, If your workplace has a union already in place, then you should call Human Resources to ask how to join. Alternately, you could ask a co-worker if she knows who the union representative at your workplace is.


Whether or not HR has a form depends on whether the collective bargaining agreement provides for HR to deduct union dues.If the agreement does not, then contact your union representative.

, Get the “Dues Withholding Form” from HR or from your union representative. You will need to include personal information (name, address, and job title). You will also need to provide your Social Security Number so that union dues can be deducted from your paycheck.Make sure you have the right form. Multiple unions are often present at large employers (such as universities). Some unions may exist for hourly workers and a separate union may exist for salaried workers. Each has its own form.
A typical form looks like this.

, Union membership isn't free. You will have to pay dues on a schedule, typically monthly. There should be a dues schedule that HR can give you.


The amount of union dues varies by workplace. Generally, you can expect to pay between $200 and several hundred dollars a year.Union dues fund a variety of activities, for example office support and organizing costs.Money is also used to pay fees for attorneys who help with negotiations and accountants who analyze the employer’s finances.You are probably already paying into a union. Although a unionized workplace will be open to employees who do not join, bargaining agreements often require all workers to pay a percentage of the union dues.This is called an “agency fee.”

, Complete the form accurately and completely. Unless you request that your application be withdrawn, you should be enrolled automatically in the union.


Keep a copy for your records.

, If HR automatically deducts your dues, then you do not have to do anything to pay your dues. However, if HR does not automatically deduct dues, then you will be responsible for paying them yourself.


Each union has different methods of payments. Some require that you send the money to a designated delegate. The delegate then sends back stamps for you to paste into a booklet, signaling that you paid your dues.Other unions require you to pay online.You will be given an identification number and password. Once you log-in, you can then pay the dues.
Be sure to ask your union representative about how to pay, and contact her with any questions.

, Active participation is crucial to a successful union. You may vote on issues and in elections, as well as join committees.Committees are commonly formed around education, consumer affairs, veterans, and women’s issues., A union engages in “collective bargaining.” That is, it negotiates wages and benefits for all members of the bargaining unit.On average, unionized workplaces provide higher wages and greater benefits than non-unionized ones.Other benefits may be just as important. For example, collective bargaining agreements can limit termination to “just cause” only.The contract will then define what qualifies as “just cause” and will also provide procedures for contesting the termination, such as arbitration.
Collective bargaining agreements also can provide job protection for workers based on seniority. Collective bargaining agreements can stipulate that, in the event of layoffs, those who were hired last should be fired first.

, If there is not a union already present in your workplace, then you should search for national unions in your industry that you could join. You will need to organize the workers in your workplace, and national unions like the Service Employees International Union or the United Food Commercial Workers union will have resources and staff who can help you.


Search on the web for “union” and then your industry, such as “food preparer” or “call center customer service rep.”
Also contact your state or local labor council, who may be able to point you in the right direction. You can find the nearest council by visiting this website and selecting your state.
Belonging to a national union is beneficial as the national union has more resources and experience in collective bargaining. If no national union exists, you can still go ahead with your union drive. The process is largely the same.

, Under federal law there are 3 ways to form unions.


1) 30% of people sign cards, then there will be a NLRB verified election or
2) Card check- If over 50% of the eligibles sign a card then the employer can waive the secret election and begin negotiating with the union.
3) If 50% sign a card and the NLRB finds that the employer is engaging in behavior that will make a fair election impossible then the NLRB can mandate the creation of a union.

, Before you can organize your workplace, you should talk to your co-workers about any problems they are having: low wages, unsafe working conditions, poor vacation policies, etc.Find out if your co-workers share your same concerns. Do they have additional concerns, such as an overall lack of dignity or respect?
Be sure to talk only on breaks and away from the workplace. It is not illegal to discuss forming a union, but management can derail the organizing drive much easier if they catch wind of it early in the process.Your employer cannot retaliate for your concerted activity to improve wages or working conditions.So long as you are working to improve the conditions for yourself and other employees, your discussing the formation of a union is legally protected.

, Identify those individuals who share a common set of core concerns. Ideally, the committee should be representative of the workplace in terms of age, gender, and race.Aim for a committee that is about 10% of the workforce.Once you have a committee, you can meet with a union organizer from the national union you are trying to join. The organizer will help you learn the ins and outs of labor law and help develop a plan for organizing the workplace.The specifics of the organizing plan will differ by workplace. But you will first need to “map out” your workplace by identifying who works where and with whom.You will then work to identify which issues matter the most to which workers.You will target your union drive to workers based on their concerns.
The organizer can also help the committee come up with ways to counter management’s arguments against the union., Now that the committee has been formed, committee members should reach out to the remaining co-workers and discuss the key issues they are worried about. Listen respectfully to people's concerns and ideas.


At this point, management will likely hear of the union and begin to discourage workers from joining.
Consider drafting a petition that lays out the core issues the union is being formed to address. Ask workers if they would like to sign it.Remind co-workers that it is against the law for management to retaliate for union organizing., Once the committee believes that it has majority support, you should hold a card check drive. During this process, employees will be given cards to sign, indicating that they want to join the union. If a majority of employees sign the cards, then you can approach management and ask that the union be recognized.


A sample card looks like this. You will get cards from the umbrella union (such as the UAW or the AFL-CIO).
Management may choose to recognize the union if a majority of employees sign a card. However, management can also require that an election be held, and this is the option most companies choose., If your employer refuses to recognize a union, then the only other option is to be certified through an NLRB election. You will start the process by getting the RC Petition, Form NLRB-502 and the Certificate of Service, Form NLRB-5544.


Complete the Petition and the Certificate of Service. You can complete these PDF forms online and then save or print them off.
The NLRB prefers that you submit documents electronically.You will complete the forms in PDF and then upload them at this website.

, You must give your employer a copy of the RC petition, as well as a blank Statement of Petition Form, NLRB-505, and a copy of the Description of Procedures in Certification and Decertification Cases, NLRB-4812.

Educate yourself.,
Free yourself from ignorance about other cultures.,Eat new foods with an open mind and excited spirit.",How to Become a Person of Culture," A cultured person can be someone who is an eclectic reader, who watches well-written classic films, and who has a refined appreciation for art. Also, to be cultured is to be educated about the world and its languages, to understand world politics, and to be well-read in world history. Above all, a cultured person is one who is interested in culture and engages in it.;
, A large part of culture comes from books, as they have existed for a longer time than most other media. The obvious thing to do would be to read classic books, but if you're a first-time-reader, this will be daunting and uninteresting.


Choose a genre that you have genuine interest in, such as fantasy or romantic fiction. Research the best books of that genre as judged by book enthusiasts, and read them. You may want to look up books in other genres that interest you while you're at it. If there is a genre you are not sure about, try it, and you might actually enjoy it.
After you feel you've become reasonably well-read in one genre choose another. Also, read some classic or recommended books. You might understand and enjoy some books of past cultures by reading books of the present culture.
Subscribe to magazines that include articles about literature, plays, and music. Read articles from these magazines once a week or twice a month or whenever your schedule will allow. Follow leads presented by the articles you read. Every once in a while you might find articles that will inspire you to pursue a subject. For instance, if you read a great article about Mozart, take the article to a store where you can buy compact discs and ask the counter attendant to direct you to some Mozart CDs that you might like. Buy or borrow a few of them from the library. If you read an article about an artist who sounds interesting, look online to find out which museums feature paintings by this artist. Then plan visits to those museums. Scan your newspaper for local college or high school theatrical productions that you can attend.

, You can write poetry, short stories, books, and even plays. Being cultured means to respond to culture, and the best way to do this is to create your own.

, It is very important to not only read books, but to watch films regularly. There are many films, and you may be unsure about which ones to see.


Word-of-mouth is the best way to become aware of which contemporary films to watch. You may remember your friends talking about a certain film. Go to the video store and scan the shelves to find names of movies you may recognise.
Look up reviews about a film on Wikipedia before you watch it, just to make sure you're not wasting your time (if you're pressed for time). However, remember sometimes critics' opinions are not always right.
It is important to do your research. If you don't understand a certain film, then look it up on Wikipedia or somewhere on the internet. Sometimes an old movie will contain references to other classic films. As a result, you can learn about other works. When you watch these type of films, you will soon be able to appreciate more of them than you could previously.
Don't restrict yourself to English-language films. There are many other films out there worth watching, they are just in different languages.

, While TV shows can be time-consuming to watch. If you watch only one episode of something each day, less of your time will be spent viewing programs. There is much to be learned from TV shows. Television is as significant a medium as any, and it often provides social commentary.


Look up good TV programs that you think you might enjoy. There are many types, ranging from situation comedies to drama. Wikipedia usually has information on popular TV shows. You can look up ratings or just ask around.
Don't forget to be open-minded. TV shows you thought you might not like might turn out to be your favourite show. It has happened.
If you really like a TV show and you think you'd watch it again, then buy the DVDs.
Watch TV channels like Discovery andThe History Channel. This is a painless way to get involved in topics such as the origins of impressionist art or the history of English kings.

, Many people are very narrow-minded when it comes to music, but a person of culture admires even the niche music genres.


For example, while it is important for a person to listen and enjoy songs with non-cliché lyrics, it is also important that one is able to enjoy music without lyrics at all, just for the mood it can set, or the story it can tell without of words.
The ability to appreciate classical music is not as daunting as it seems. Just listen to some famous musical pieces, and you will most definitely understand why.
Be very open-minded. There is a lot of music out there which may not fit into any genre, but you may enjoy it. Don't reject certain forms of music just because you have never heard them.
Listen to albums, not just singles. You might develop an interest in songs that never gained much popularity. Yet, this is not to say you won't enjoy the memorable ones.
Listen to bands. Many bands have been around for a long time, in spite of this fact, some of their music is still fresh. This will give you access to older music, and you'll be able to hone an appreciation for it.
Listen to music from other countries and in other languages. You'll be surprised.
Learn a musical instrument. Once you listen to some good music, it will be natural for you to try to learn an instrument and create your own.

, Although this was considered mostly part of the ""nerd culture"", the popularity of video games is growing and it is becoming an undeniable part of modern culture. It is important to give any cultural medium a try, and video games are no exception.


If you don't like ""shooting"" games, there are many other types of video games that you may like. Do your research and you'll find there's a lot more variety than you originally thought. Role-playing games, RPGs, especially open world RPGs, are good to lose yourself in. However, some people prefer simpler games like platformers.
Don't worry if you actually enjoy video games. That's a good thing. It doesn't automatically make you a nerd, it just adds more complexity to your personality.
Video-gaming is quite an expensive hobby, so make sure you try them before you buy them.

, Don't forget that past culture, such as '80s music, was once present culture. Those who paid attention to it may now understand its cultural significance, while those who ignored it, do not. The digital age is very important and a huge milestone for society. We are living in historically profound times. Don't let it pass you by.


While you may feel like you already know a lot about the Internet, learn about the history of the Internet, and check out memes and viral videos so that you have a greater understanding of it.
Set your homepage to Wikipedia and read an article each day about something which seems ""cultured"" to you. In a very short time, you will know quite a bit more than you know now.

, Art is a universal language. It is sometimes considered the most potent form of communication. Whether it actually is, is up to you.


The only advice that can be given here is to do research and engage in art by going to galleries (which, contrary to popular belief, are free).
If there is one art form you particularly like, such as dancing or sculpting, then become practised in it.

, The best way to do this is by immersion...

, Reading about other cultures as opposed to experiencing them is like colour being explained to a blind person. Travelling introduces you to the many differences and similarities between cultures, and opens up your mind. A lot of the prejudices we have about a culture (good and bad) are grossly misplaced, and the only way to find out the truth about social practices is to experience them.

, Ask your friends what their hobbies are. Most of them will be art forms or sports. As a cultured person, it is important to experience as much as possible, so next time your friend goes water-skiing, ask if you can come along.

, Go to the zoo, visit museums, even go camping to learn more about wildlife.

, Nowadays with the Internet, almost all information is accessible. You should take full advantage of this and learn all those things that you never understood before. You should aim to be reasonably educated in these topics:


World history. This is probably the most important cultural asset for you to acquire, since it provides pathways into other domains of knowledge and contextualizes its discoveries.
Geography. Again, a person of culture should not be ignorant of where countries or famous landmarks are.
Basic Sciences: Physics, Mathematics, Chemistry and Biology. Unless you want to follow a career in the sciences, a refined knowledge in the sciences isn't completely necessary. Instead, make sure you have a sound understanding of the sciences at a high school level.
Economics. This is very relevant in understanding today's world.
Psychology. A note about misconceptions: there is a huge misconception that Psychology is not a science, or that it is bogus. Read up on experimental methodology and actually educate yourself about it before believing those claims. Psychology is of extreme importance in today's society, becoming increasingly more so as the world becomes more complicated.
Art and Architecture
Philosophy

, Develop a natural curiosity. Delve deep into things you don't understand.


Part of becoming cultured is learning about other cultures, not just your own. Try to free yourself from ignorance and media-fed stereotypes you have about other societies/religions.
Always try to empathize with all parties while learning. It is very important to challenge your prejudices. No one is inherently good or evil; instead you should aim to understand the motives for actions. Otherwise you will not understand other cultures.
Think for yourself. Don't let others dictate your opinions.

Don’t feed your cat before the blood test.,
Ensure your cat is not dehydrated.,
Do not play with your cat before the blood test.,
Minimize your cat’s stress.",How to Prepare Your Cat for a Blood Test1," Your vet will probably recommend that you not feed your cat for about six hours before the test. This will prevent buildups of fat droplets in the blood that appear after eating. These fat droplets can interfere with the test’s outcomes., Your cat should not be dehydrated before the blood test, or it could alter the results. Shortly before your cat gets its blood drawn, provide it with a water dish. If it is dehydrated, it will drink from the dish., Getting your cat excited and active just before it gets its blood test might throw off the test’s results. Therefore, wait until your cat’s blood test has concluded to frolic and play with your cat., There are several ways to minimize your cat’s stress. You could bring it to the vet’s office in a carrier, where it will feel safe and secure. You could also talk to your pet in a calm, reassuring voice. For instance, you might say, “Don’t worry, good cat.” When you take your cat out of its carrier, stroke it gently and reassuringly. Move your hand from its head down to its back as you pet it.The presence of other animals might upset your cat. You might want to leave your cat in the car if the waiting room is crowded.

Ask your supplier.,
Do research in your area.,
Contact every clinic you find.,
Be clear and concise when you ask the vets.,
Don't give up your search.",How to Locate a Vet That Will Treat a Pet Opossum," Where did you get your opossum? Any breeder, pet store or animal shelter that gives you your pet should be able to tell you who their veterinarian is. If you got it from a previous owner or from another location though, this may not work out for you.;
, Google (or use your preferred search engine) every vet clinic in your area. You can also use your local phone book to find as many offices as possible. If you're having trouble, you can ask around - who do your friends go to? Local pet stores, breeders, and shelters?

, Phone, email, or even Facebook are all good ways to come in easy contact with every vet in your city. Ask every vet you find whether or not they have the knowledge and experience to deal with an opossum. If you know exactly what's wrong with it (if you need it 'fixed' or if it has a certain illness or injury, etc) then be sure to mention that that's what you're looking for. If you just want to know there's someone available, all you need to know is whether or not they'll be able to help.

, For example ""Hi, I have a pet opossum. I was wondering if you have any veterinarians working at your clinic who have the knowledge and experience to treat one should the need arise?"" If the receptionist says no, ask if they have any suggestions of who to phone next. Vets like to help each other out, as it's all about the clients!

, You're bound to find a vet that knows opossums without too much effort, but it it does take long, just keep going. This is your pet, finding a vet for them is very important.

Keep a record of frustrations caused by your vet or their office.,
Ask the vet to meet with you in person.,
Express your concerns effectively.",How to Handle Problems with Your Veterinarian1," If you’re beginning to sense a problem—of any type—with your veterinarian, or any registered vet technician or other member of the staff, you should keep a written record. Note the date on which anything concerning took place, along with a brief description of the incident. If the concern is over a fee dispute, keep all receipts and other records of billing and payment (invoices, etc.).


For example, if you’ve noticed a non-registered staff member prescribing medicine for animals, keep a record of when these incidents took place and which staff members were present.;
, Regardless of the type of problem, it’s best to express your frustration and explain the problem face-to-face. In the best-case scenario, the problem between you and your vet was simply a miscommunication.Arrange a time when you can visit your vet without your pet, and ask to speak to them privately in their office.


This approach should be implemented whether your problem with the veterinarian is related to billing, an interpersonal conflict, an argument with a staff member, or a minor misdiagnosis of your animal.
If you’ve kept a written record of past concerns or problems with the veterinary office, this is the time to bring it up and show it to the vet.

, When you speak with your veterinarian, keep the conversation professional and civil. Present the objections or problems that you’ve had with them or a member of their staff without becoming angry, and without jumping to conclusions. Let the veterinarian speak for themselves and respond to your claims. If necessary, you can show the vet the record of problems that you’ve been keeping to legitimize your frustrations. When expressing your concerns, say something like:


“I wanted to speak with you because I’ve noticed that my credit card is being billed for a different amount than appears on each invoice.”
“I’m concerned about my animal’s health; several of the medications you’ve prescribed have made its condition worse, rather than helping.”

"
"
Ask your vet what to do.,
Do not feed your pet.,
Withhold your cat’s medications.",How to Prepare Your Cat for a Blood Test2," The preparation required for a special blood test varies depending on the circumstances. Since your vet is the pet professional most familiar with your cat’s health history and personality, your vet would have the most useful insights regarding how to prepare your cat for a special blood test. Kick off the conversation by asking your vet, “How can I prepare my cat for this blood test?”When your vet gives your special instructions regarding how to prepare your cat for its blood test, write them down in a pocket notebook. Refer to them the day before the blood test, and follow them carefully.
It may or may not be okay to provide your cat with water during this time. Ask your vet for more information.

, Your vet will probably ask you not to feed your pet during the 12 to 24 hours prior to the blood test. During this pre-test period, keep all cat food and food bowls out of your cat’s reach and line of sight., Your vet will probably ask you to not administer any medication to your cat on the day of its blood test. This will ensure the blood test produces the most accurate reading possible."
"
Discuss with your vet how to give your cat a blood test at home.,
Adopt a positive attitude.,
Gently restrain your cat.,
Handle your cat throughout.,
Warm your cat’s ear.",How to Prepare Your Cat for a Blood Test3," Your vet will determine how often your cat needs its blood tested. They can also determine the best location for you to test your cat’s blood. Additionally, your vet will be able to provide directions for preparations that might apply to your specific cat., Cats are empathetic creatures and can sense if you are worried or nervous. Your cat will reflect your mood, so if you are anxious, your cat will be too. On the other hand, if you are calm, cool, and collected, your cat will likewise feel at ease.To adopt a positive attitude when preparing your cat for a blood test, think positive thoughts. For example, you might think to yourself, “I can do this” or “I am helping to maintain my cat’s health.”

, After assembling your materials – the blood testing meter, test strips, bandages, and whatever other materials you employ when testing your cat’s blood – position your cat in such a way that it will not wriggle or escape during the blood test. You might try the “burrito method,” whereby your swaddle your cat tightly like a newborn in a blanket or towel.Alternately, you could try the “knee catch.” Using this process, kneel, then back your cat up so that it sits between the space between your knees. Grip your cat gently between your legs and place one hand around its chest to prevent it from dashing away.

, Before, during, and after the blood test, keep your cat in your lap, where it will be most comfortable and relaxed. This will reduce the cat’s anxiety and prevent it from struggling during the test. If your cat is struggling, anxious, or scared, its blood sugar levels will spike, throwing off the blood test results., If you’re pricking your cat’s ear to draw a blood sample, warming the ear can encourage blood flow and make it easier to draw a sample. To warm the cat’s ear, pack a few tablespoons of uncooked rice or rolled oats in a sock. Tie the end off in a knot. Microwave the sock for 20-30 seconds. Apply the sock to your cat’s ear for one or two minutes.Before placing the sock against your cat's ear, test it by placing it against your wrist. If it is hot, wait for it to cool. If it is warm, apply it to your cat's ear.
You might also warm the cat’s ear using a warm, wet washcloth placed in a resealable plastic bag. Alternately, wrap the ear around a pill bottle filled with warm water.

"
Have your veterinarian investigated by your state veterinary medical board.,
File a written complaint against your vet.,
File a small-claims suit against the veterinarian.,
Contact a relevant government agency or attorney if you don’t live in the United States.",How to Handle Problems with Your Veterinarian2," If you cannot resolve the problem with your veterinarian and you feel that the issue is of a serious nature (such as medical malpractice), you can look into setting up a peer-review board to investigate the veterinarian. Not every U.S. state has a peer-review procedure in place, so you’ll need to speak with the state veterinary medical board and see if this is an option.Each U.S. state has its own veterinary medical board. They are all listed online—including a contact person’s name, address, office phone number, and office email—at the American Association of Veterinary State Boards website.If you live outside of the United States, or in a U.S. state that does not have an established peer-review procedure, you can seek out and contact the veterinary board where you live.

, This is a formal procedure, and you’ll need to follow your specific state veterinary licensing board’s protocol. Look online for the website for your state’s Board of Veterinary Medicine, and search for their specific complaint procedure. You’ll need to fill out relevant paperwork, and also write a complaint detailing names, dates, and factual negligence or malpractice performed by your veterinarian. Include copies of relevant supplemental information including invoices, forms, medical records, and witness statements.Your state’s Board of Veterinary Medicine will only be able to address matters related to veterinary licensure and malpractice. If you have an interpersonal conflict or fee dispute with your vet, the Board will not intervene. If the Board supports your claim, they have the power to revoke the vet’s license.Send the paperwork and the written report via email, fax, or US Post Office to the Board’s office. You should follow this up with a phone call the next day (or a week later if sent by the Post Office) to make sure that your complaint was received.
In California, for example, you would submit a complaint (including the legal form and written complaint) through the state’s online complaint system. Then, the Veterinary Medical Board would review the complaint and, depending on the severity of the allegations, ask for further narrative statements and medical records. The Board will appoint an analyst to review the complaint file, determine if the vet is at fault, and may close the case or issue a fine and citation (among other options).

, This is a separate procedure from the complaint to the Board. A small-claims suit is relatively easy to file: you’ll need to visit your local courthouse and fill out a few sheets of paperwork. Since you’ll need to present your own claim in a small-claims court, you’ll also need to have detailed medical records from the veterinarian, copies of veterinary bills, and witness testimonies, if applicable.If the court supports your claim, the court will make the veterinary office reimburse you for your “out-of-pocket” veterinary expenses. If your animal has died as a result of the vet’s malpractice, the office will also reimburse you for the animal.

, If you live outside of the U.S., the process for filing complaints and contacting veterinary licensing boards will work differently than it does for Americans. You’ll need to contact a government agency which deals with veterinary medicine and malpractice—look at the state or province level first, and if that fails, look at the national level. You may also decide to contact an attorney to help you pursue a legal recourse.


For example, in England, if you feel that your veterinarian has engaged in professional misconduct or otherwise been negligent towards your pet, you can contact the Royal College of Veterinary Services (RCVS)."
"
Politely inform the veterinarian that you are leaving their services.,
Look for a new veterinary office.,
Visit several local veterinary offices.,
Choose the veterinarian that suits you and your pet the best.",How to Handle Problems with Your Veterinarian3," If you and your veterinarian were unable to resolve the problem between you, you should stop using their professional services. Although you do not need to alert your vet that you’ll be looking elsewhere for veterinary services, it would be polite to inform them via email or voicemail. This message should be short and to the point.


For example, send an email or leave a voicemail saying, “Due to our mutual inability to resolve the problems , I’ve decided to take my pet(s) elsewhere for their veterinary services.”

, Beginning to search for a vet can be an arduous process. It’s best not to put this off, even if your pet does not need a vet appointment soon. Accidents and emergencies can happen any time, and you should have a go-to veterinarian for your animal’s sake. You can start by searching online to find veterinary offices in your area. The American Animal Hospital Association (AAHA) also has a listing of AAHA-accredited veterinarians on their website.Also ask pet-owning friends, family, and co-workers in your local area for their veterinary recommendations, and find out which vet they take their animals to.

, Call many different offices in your area and let them know that you’re currently looking for a new veterinarian. Ask the office if it would be okay for you to come in for a visit to decide if you would like to be a client. By visiting more than one local office, you’ll be able to compare several and determine the best office for your animal. While you’re there, it’s probably best not to mention your problem with your previous veterinarian. When you’re in each new veterinary office, pay attention to important factors:The facility should be clean, well-lit, and modern looking.
Find out how many vets are on staff. A larger number means that vets will be able to cover each other’s shifts in case of illness or vacation.
See if the vet seems personable and easy to communicate with.

, After you’ve visited a few local veterinary offices, you can decide which will be the best to take your pet to. If you’re having trouble choosing between two or more veterinary offices, ask the vet and staff some of the following questions:“How do you monitor animals kept here overnight?”
“What is your protocol for managing animals in pain?”
“Does this office refer its animals to relevant specialists?”
“Do you have licensed veterinary technicians on staff?”
“Is your practice accredited by the AAHA?”
“What types of medical equipment does your office use; is all equipment kept up-to-date?”

Pet your cat to keep it calm.,
Use treats.,
Try a towel.,
Get a friend or family member to help you.,
Make sure the symptoms are easy to see.,
Use a good quality camera.,
Choose a location with good light.,
Position your cat in a comfortable position.,
Zoom in on the symptoms.,
Take photographs over a period of time.,
Bring the photographs to the vet.",How to Photograph Your Cat's Symptoms for the Vet," Your cat may be feeling anxious or uncomfortable due to its condition, making it difficult for you to get it to stay calm and still for photographs. Try petting your cat in its favorite spots to keep it calm, such as its head or behind its ears. You can also say calming words to the cat, such as “good kitty” or “let’s be calm now.”You may position your cat in a comfortable spot in your home so it can relax. Then, pet it and say calming words to get it to settle down.
Choose a spot your cat likes. For instance, if your cat likes hanging out on the couch, try the couch. Your cat is less likely to be calm in an unfamiliar place.;
, Another way you can get your cat to stay still for photographs is to use treats. Give your cat a treat to nibble on while you take the photographs. This way, it will stay in one spot and be distracted while you snap away.You can use dry cat treats, tuna, chicken breast, or catnip.

, If your cat is really uncomfortable with staying still, you can try towel wrapping it. Use a large towel to do this. Place your cat in the center of the towel and wrap it up like a burrito. This will keep your cat calm and still while you photograph its symptoms.If your cat’s symptoms are on its body, not on its head or feet, you can try draping the towel over your cat’s head instead. This can help to keep your cat calm while you photograph the symptoms on its body.

, It can be a challenge to keep your cat calm for photographs on your own. To make it easier for you, ask a friend or family member if they can assist you. Try to choose someone who is comfortable around cats and who knows your cat well. This way, they can pet and soothe your cat as needed.


Alternatively, you can have your friend take photos while you soothe the cat.

, To make taking the photographs easier, check that your cat’s symptoms are easy to see. If your cat has a skin issue, for example, make sure you can see it by parting its fur so you can get good photographs of it. If the symptom is harder to see with the naked eye, you may need to position your cat so they are easier to photograph.


For example, if your cat has a wound on its stomach, you may need to position your cat on its back so its stomach is exposed and you can get good photographs of the wound.

, Invest in a good quality digital camera to take photographs of your cat’s symptoms. This will result in high quality photographs that will be of use to your vet. Look for a digital camera that has a zoom feature and a decent lens. Make sure the camera has a flash option to light the symptoms, especially if they are hard to see with the naked eye.Avoid using a film camera, as the quality of the photos may be poor and it will take too long to develop them.

, To ensure you get the most useful photographs possible, pick a location indoors that has good light. Set up a lamp by a chair and photograph your cat using the lamp light. Or go into a room with fluorescent lighting so the symptoms will show up clearly in the photographs.If you want to take the photographs outside, choose a time with bright sunlight or daylight. A bright, cloudy day is often ideal for outdoor photography.
Try your phone’s flashlight feature, too. This can be a great, portable tool to direct light wherever you need it.

, Get your cat to sit down or lie down in your lap. Make sure the symptoms you are photographing is exposed and easy to see. Use one hand to part your cat’s fur, if needed, while you take the photographs. Angle the symptoms into the light so they are visible.If your cat’s symptoms are in a hard to see spot, ask a friend or family member to hold your cat while you take the photographs. This may make it easier for you to position yourself in a good spot to document the symptoms.

, Use the zoom feature on the camera to get up close to your cat’s symptoms. Zoom in on the symptoms and take several close up shots. This way, your vet can get a good idea of what the symptoms look like in detail when they look at the photographs.You may take a mixture of zoomed in shots and wider shots, especially if your cat’s symptoms are a skin issue that looks different or varies close up.

, If you notice a shift in your cat’s symptoms over a period of time, such as within a few days, document this in photographs. Take multiple photographs of the symptoms from day to day so your vet gets a sense of how the symptoms have changed or developed over time.


For example, maybe your cat’s skin issue appears to be getting more inflamed or red in certain spots on its coat. Or maybe your cat’s eye issue appears more severe in the morning or at night. Document these changes for the vet.

, Once you have taken photographs of your cat’s symptoms, bring them to your vet appointment. You may bring your cat in as well so the vet can physically exam it and refer to the photographs as needed. Make sure you bring a variety of photographs, such as close ups and photographs from different days or periods of time. This will help to vet make a diagnosis and figure out what is causing your cat’s symptoms.


Another option is to email the photographs to your vet in advance. This way, your vet has them on hand when you go in for your appointment.
Some vets will request that you take photographs of your cat’s symptoms, especially if they shift over time. If your cat is put on a certain medication and has an adverse reaction, for example, your vet may ask you to take photographs of the reaction and bring them into your next vet appointment.

Approach the wounded animal slowly.,
Apply pressure to the bleeding wound.,
Keep pressure on the wound for 10 minutes.,
Bind the compress to the wound.,
Take the cat to the vet if it shows signs of internal bleeding.",How to Give First Aid to a Cat After a Fall1," Even cats with a typically mild temperament can become aggressive when in pain. A wounded cat may claw or bite you. To reduce the risk of this happening, speak soothingly to the cat as you approach. Walk slowly, and do not make any sudden moves towards the cat. The cat may interpret these as hostile.Even if the wounded cat is your own, it may still lash out due to fear and pain. You should still proceed with caution in this scenario.;
, Using a relatively clean piece of material such as gauze, tissues, or a clean cotton rag, apply steady pressure to the wound. Be careful not to press too hard on the wound, especially if it’s on one of the cat’s limbs. You don’t want to risk breaking the cat’s leg; just press hard enough to slow down or stop the bleeding.If the cat is bleeding severely and you don’t have time to get cloth or gauze, you’ll have to use your bare hands to apply pressure.

, Continue to apply a steady pressure to the cat’s wound for at least 10 minutes; this will give the wound time to form a clot and stop actively bleeding. While applying the pressure, resist the temptation to lift up the gauze or cloth and see if the wound is still bleeding. Lifting up the gauze could rip the clot off. If blood soaks through the layer of cloth or gauze you’re holding, you can add another layer.

, After the bleeding has stopped or slowed, you no longer need to apply constant pressure. If the bleeding wound is on one of the cat’s legs or its head, you can bind the gauze or cloth compress so that you no longer need to keep your hands on it. Use another strip of gauze or a long piece of cloth to firmly bind the blood-soaked compress in place.Be careful not to tie the compress on too tightly. This will cut off blood flow and could cause serious problems for the limb.

, Internal bleeding is more difficult to spot, although a cat which has suffered a fall may be bleeding internally. You can’t treat internal bleeding through first aid, so you’ll need to take the cat to a veterinarian for treatment. Signs that a cat is bleeding internally include:Pale gums and vomiting or coughing up blood.
A distended stomach, coupled with extreme lethargy.

Inspect the limb.,
Wrap an open fracture gently.,
Place the cat in a plastic or cardboard box.,
Take the animal to the veterinarian as soon as possible.",How to Give First Aid to a Cat After a Fall2," If you suspect that a cat has a broken limb, look at it closely, but avoid moving the limb, as this may worsen the severity of the fracture. You can determine if a limb is broken internally (a closed fracture) by the cat’s inability to use it properly, or if the limb is twisted or bent at an unnatural angle. If bone is sticking out through the skin, the animal has an open fracture.If a cat has broken ribs, the chest cavity may appear misshapen or flattened in one or more spots.

, If a cat has an open fracture on one of its limbs, prevent dirt and bacteria from getting in the wound by wrapping it loosely with sterile gauze or a clean cloth. If you tighten the wrapping you’ll only cause the animal more pain, so leave the wrapping loose.Do not try to apply a splint to the fractured bone. Although a veterinarian or animal specialist may do this at a pet hospital, it shouldn’t be part of your first aid treatment. In applying a splint, you risk worsening the fracture or forcing the bone through the animal’s skin.

, The cat will need to stay as immobile as possible, in order to avoid worsening the fracture. To facilitate this, place the cat inside a rigid, large plastic or cardboard box. The box will keep the cat from hurting itself further, and should keep the fractured limb relatively motionless.If possible, line the inside of the box with towels. This will keep the cat relatively comfortable, and also prevent it from sliding around the inside of the box.

, Fractures—especially open fractures—are dangerous, painful, and can lead to death in some cases. Call ahead on the road so that the vet knows you’re coming.Explain that the situation is an emergency, and that the cat will need immediate treatment.

Keep the cat as immobile as possible.,
Slide your cat onto a home-made “stretcher”.,
Keep the cat’s head lower than the rest of the body.,
Take the cat to your veterinarian.",How to Give First Aid to a Cat After a Fall3," If your cat is motionless after its fall (or seems unable to stand or move) but does not show any visible wounds or broken bones, it may have serious internal damage. If you move the cat excessively, you only risk making that damage worse.Unless the cat is in danger where it’s laying (e.g. in the middle of a road), let it stay put.

, This can be any material that’s sturdy enough to support and carry your cat. For example, you could maneuver the cat onto a piece of cardboard, a sheet of stiff plastic, or even your jacket if no other material is handy. This will allow you to transport the cat without moving it much.When moving the cat, try to keep its head and neck immobile. Don’t let the animal’s head flop around, or it may damage its spine.

, The cat may be in shock from the fall, and may be bleeding internally. Either way, it’s important that the cat’s body maintains blood flow to the head, otherwise the cat’s brain may be deprived of oxygen. Try to keep the cat’s head lower than its abdomen and legs.You can do this by angling the “stretcher” to lower the cat’s head. If the cat is laying on the seat of your car, position the cat so that its head is pointed down the sloping angle of the seat.

, A veterinary office will have the medical technology needed to fully inspect the cat and determine if it has internal injuries, broken bones, or a damaged spine. The vet can also give the cat pain medication, and make sure that its circulatory and respiratory systems are working properly.If you have the opportunity, it would be wise to call ahead and let the vet know you’re coming. That way, they can clear room in their schedule and be ready to receive the cat when you bring it in.

Evaluate the cost of services.,
Decide if interpersonal conflict impacts your pet's care.,
Look for signs of substandard care, neglect, or abuse.",How to Know when to Find a New Vet1," If your veterinarian is charging more money for services that could be received elsewhere for cheaper, then you may want to switch veterinarians. Shop around for the best price for quality services. It may be that there is another veterinarian that will cost you less and will give your pet great care.However, sometimes services are cheaper because the quality of care is sub par. Be sure to make sure that a veterinarian that charges less is not giving less care for a cheaper cost.;
, Sometimes pet owners will not get along with their vet because they have incompatible personalities or some sort of conflict is created. If this is the case, whether it is just a personality conflict or you do not like something about your veterinarian's personality or treatment style, then you should consider finding a different veterinarian.


Sometimes personal conflict can be worked out by simply having an honest and open conversation about your issues. This can clear up a conflict that is based on a simple misunderstanding., The clearest reason to switch veterinarians is if your current vet is giving your pet substandard care or maltreatment. If you witness incidents of animal abuse or neglect from your veterinarian or anyone that works in the veterinary office, then it is time to switch veterinarians immediately.


If you are able, voice your concerns to the veterinarian and tell them that the poor treatment of animals is why you are moving on. This may be helpful in prompting the practices to change for other animals they are treating in the future.
If your veterinarian is giving neglectful or substandard care, you can report it to your local veterinary board or your state veterinary licensing board.You can also contact the American Association of Veterinary State Boards or the American Veterinary Medical Association about mistreatment."
"
Assess your pet's veterinary needs.,
Identify if your veterinary needs have changed.,
Determine whether your veterinarian if giving you all treatment options.",How to Know when to Find a New Vet2," You may need to change your veterinarian simply because they cannot treat your pet's specific needs.

In many cases, it will be your general practice veterinarian that suggests that you need a specialist or a different veterinarian because they cannot treat your pet successfully.For example, you may need to switch veterinarians because the one you have is not trained to treat your specific type of pet.

, If your pet comes down with a specific condition that is rare or difficult to treat, such as a rare cancer, you may need to seek out a new veterinarian that has experience and expertise treating that condition. Have a conversation with your current veterinarian about their experience with the specific condition your pet has. If they are unsure about treatment or inexperienced, consider looking for another veterinarian.Being able to find a veterinarian that can treat rare diseases will depend on where you are located. For instance, small towns may only have one veterinarian. If your veterinarian is the only one in your area, then you may need to trust that they will do research on conditions they have no experience treating, that their preexisting knowledge of your pet will help them with planning treatment, and that they will give your pet the best care they possibly can.

, With many illnesses that happen to pets, there are a variety of treatment options that could eliminate the illness and get your pet well. While it makes sense that your veterinarian would have a treatment that they would recommend, it's also important that they give you all your options so that you are fully informed when making care decisions. If your veterinarian doesn't give you all treatment options, then you might want to find one that does.Although it is not a pleasant reality, in many cases you need to base your treatment decisions on cost. If your veterinarian only tells you about treatment options that are very expensive, and not about less effective but much cheaper options, then you may be put into a situation of financial difficulty that could have been avoided.

"

Explain your problem to the vet. You can say, ""I love how you care for my dog. But if we can't come to a compromise on a payment plan, I will need to look for other care.""

, If a payment plan is not an option, you may be able to find another way to pay for your pet's veterinary care. Ask your vet if the office is willing to accept services in lieu of payment. You can use your skills to deduct money from your bill. Offer to walk dogs. Many of veterinary offices have dogs who are being boarded while receiving treatment. The office might need help walking them during the day or evening.

After completing a residency program, a vet can take a standardized test to become board certified (specialized) in exotic animal medicine. Ask your vet if they have this certification.
Vets are required to take a certain number of hours of continuing education. The number of hours varies by state. Ask the vet if they take continuing education courses that focus on exotic animal care.

, To ensure that your exotic pet receives excellent care, you should want a vet with a lot of experience working with exotic pets.

You’ll be able to tell a lot from how your vet treats your pet and talks to your vet. Ultimately, if your vet does not act kindly and warmly toward your pet, you should look for another option.


Consider if your pet is excited to see your vet or if your pet is scared of your vet.
Think about whether your vet handles your pet in a cold and business-like manner. Ultimately, you want your vet to be kind, friendly, and loving to your pet.
Listen to how your vet talks to your pet. Good vets will very often talk to your pet when they come into the room. They’ll compliment the pet and offer positive reinforcement to the pet. This has the effect of calming your pet – making the experience much less stressful., Spend a little time observing how your vet treats you. You’ll be able to tell a lot about your vet by how they act around you and communicate with you. Think about the following:


Is your vet happy to answer any questions you may have about your pet’s condition?
Does it seem like your vet is unrushed or unhurried when talking to you?
Do you get a positive feeling from your vet. In other words, do you feel as if they are a warm person who enjoys doing what they do?, One thing that you should also consider when evaluating a vet is whether the vet and their office is responsive to your needs.

Identify signs of deer on your property.,
Plant deer resistant plants and trees around vegetation the deer are targeting.,
Scare deer away from your property.,
Make or purchase contact repellents.,
Hang bars of soap from trees or stakes.,
Take advantage of deer's fear of predators.,
Remove bird feeders from your yard.,
Improve or add fencing.",How to Get Rid of Deer," You want to determine which pests are causing the damage before you proceed with implementing your strategies to get rid of deer, and it's important to know which areas or plants the deer are targeting so you know where to focus your efforts.


Look for plants with jagged, ripped edges on their leaves or scored marks on tree trunks that go down past the bark. Deer rip vegetation off plants with their mouths as they don't have sharp front teeth, and deer will rub their antlers against trees to remove the velvet or to mark their territory.
Scan the lawn for deer droppings and footprints. The droppings are bean-sized and shaped, typically around ¾ inch (2cm) long. Deer prints are a distinctive cloven hoof print.
Check for deer bedding. These are oval depressions on the ground where a deer has laid down to rest. The depressions are typically 1.75 by 4 feet (0.5m by 1.25m) in size.;
, You may be able to deter deer from snacking on their favorite plants if you mask them with less appealing plants and trees.


Incorporate plants and shrubs that are poisonous, have hairy or furred leaves, spines, or that are strongly aromatic. Examples of deer resistant flowers include foxgloves, black-eyed susans, carnations, poppies and lavender. Deer also dislike lilac bushes and evergreens.

, You can startle deer using flashing lights or loud noises. You will need to change the method you use at least every 3 weeks if not sooner, as deer will quickly adjust to any 1 method.


Blow a horn or whistle outside if you see deer in your yard.
Hang up old CDs and aluminum foil from trees or shrubs, or on a line hung between posts or stakes. The flashing lights from the CDs and rustling noise of the foil can help deter deer.
Use a commercial electronic deer repellent. These are devices that are usually motion controlled which you can set up in your deer problem areas. They either emit loud ultrasonic and sonic noise, flashing light, or a combination of both. There are some motion-controlled sprinklers available as well that douse the deer and other pests with water when they get close to your plants.

, A contact repellent is usually a liquid that you spray on a targeted plant, shrub or tree. The liquid tastes and/or smells bad to deer, so they stop eating the plant.


Mix together an egg spray. Make a mixture that is 20 percent egg and 80 percent water. Pour into a spray bottle, and spray affected vegetation. The smell of decay from the egg deters deer as they associate decay and rotting smells with predators. Apply every 30 days, or after rain.
Prepare a spray of diluted hot sauce. Spray it on your plants and trees. The capsicum from the peppers tastes bad and irritates deer, causing them to stop eating the plant.
Purchase a commercially prepared product. Check to make sure the product is safe to use for vegetable and fruit bearing plants if you are using it on a garden or fruit trees.

, The strong scent may keep deer out of your yard.

, Deer are likely to steer clear if they suspect a predator is nearby.


Scatter human or dog hair on the ground around targeted plants and trees or the perimeter your garden.
Get an outside dog or dog decoy. Deer are afraid of dogs.
Hang mesh bags filled with human hair clippings, feather meal or blood meal. Place bags 3 feet (0.91 m) (.91 m) apart and refill the bags monthly.
Buy an area deer repellent made with blood meal or predator urine. Common deer predators include bobcats and coyotes.

, Bird feed or corn you place out for other animals will also draw deer to your property.

, Although not foolproof, a tall, sturdy fence can help prevent deer from entering your property.


Make sure the fence is tall enough. Deer can jump 9 feet (2.7 m) (2.74 m), so a fence should be at the very least 8 feet (2.4 m) (2.44 m) to successfully deter deer. If you don't want a tall fence, try putting in 2 fences that are 4 to 5 feet (1.2 to 1.5 m) (1.23 to 1.52 m) high placed about 3 feet (.91 m) apart.
Start the fence at least 1 foot (0.30 m) (.30 m) underground so deer cannot get through underneath the fence.

Decide where to hang your bat house.,
Plan on installing your bat house before spring.,
Build a frame for your bat house.,
Hang your bat house 12 feet (3.66 m) to 20 feet (6.10 m) above ground.,
Attach the rails on the bat house to the building or pole with 2 inch (5.08 cm) screws.

",How to Hang a Bat House," You may mount a bat house on a pole or on the side of a building.


Select a location that faces south or east. Bats like a warm climate, so when hanging a bat house, it's best to provide the house with plenty of sunlight.
Choose a spot away from security and porch lights. You don't want your bat house installation to be affected by artificial lights.
Pick a spot near the edge of a forest or tree grove because bats live in forested areas. To ensure the safety of your bat house, don't hang the house within 20 feet (6.096 m) to 25 feet (7.062 m) of a tree branch. Bats are prey to larger birds that perch in trees.
Select an area near water, if possible. Bats live near water, and hanging bat houses 1/4 mile (402.34 m) from water will make it easier for bats to find the house.;
, Bats return from warmer climates during the spring, and if you mount a bat house before they return, they are more likely to use it during the summer. If you are evicting bats from a building, set up the bat house 2 to 6 weeks before you move them out.

,


Measure the width of your bat house with a measuring tape. Bat house installation entails building rails to mount the house.
Add 6 inches to the width, and cut 2 rails out of 1 inch (2.54 cm) by 2 inch (5.08 cm) wood to that length with a saw.
Drill holes in the rails and matching holes in the bat house with a drill. You will mount a bat house on the frame before you hang it.
Spread glue or caulk between the bat house and the rails.
Use a screwdriver and 1.5 inch (3.81 cm) screws to attach the bat house to the rails.

, When you mount a bat house, be sure to use a long ladder.

Decide if you have the time to commit to hospice care.,
Figure out if your pet is in serious pain.,
Avoid prolonging your pet’s life unnecessarily.,
Consider euthanasia.",How to Get Veterinary Hospice Care for Your Dog1," Hospice is an alternative to euthanasia if your pet has been diagnosed with a terminal condition or there is nothing else to be done for your older pet. Veterinary hospice helps you meet your pet’s needs so they can live out of the rest of their days instead of getting put down.The goal of hospice care is to keep your pet comfortable.;
, Veterinary hospice care is not a service where you send your pet to live in a type of ""dog nursing home."" Hospice care is in-home care where you are the main caregiver. The veterinarian teaches and instructs you, but you manage all aspects of your pet's care.


Vets can make house visits to provide emergency medical care or do a check up if the dog is unable to travel to the veterinarian office. However, the vet will not administer medication or shots, help you clean wounds, or deal with other issues.

, Since you are in charge of your pet's hospice care, you should look at your life and decide if you have the time and energy to devote to your pet. You should think about your family, too. Would they be willing to help you out, or will you be the one caring for your pet?


You should also decide if you have the money to devote to this care.
Hospice care can be a wonderful way to say goodbye to your pet, but it can also be emotionally difficult for you. Decide if you can handle giving your dying pet hospice care during their final weeks or months.

, You should only choose hospice care for your pet if they are not in serious pain. If they are in serious pain, you should instead discuss other options, like euthanasia, with your vet. Try to figure out if your pet is in pain, and decide the best course of action to minimize their suffering.Your pet may not whimper, whine, or cry if they are in pain. They may not stop eating or drinking, either. You may not notice any common signs of pain.
Instead, your pet may experience respiratory signs, like panting a lot or having trouble breathing and gasping.
Your pet may experience behavior changes, like hiding away and not being as social. They may not want to move.
Your pet may become more picky about the food they eat.

, Losing a pet is difficult. Pet hospice care can help make your pet’s last days and weeks more comfortable and dignified, but you should make sure you are not prolonging your pet’s life because you can’t let go. Talk to your vet about whether or not pet hospice is a good idea for your pet.Take into consideration your pet’s suffering, life expectancy, and quality of life. You want to make sure you are thinking about what is best for you pet, and not what is best for you because you can’t let go.

, Euthanasia is a procedure where your vet helps your pet have a gentle and humane death. The pet is sedated, and then given medication to end their life. Your vet can advise you on whether or not this is the option for your pet.Euthanasia is a good choice if your pet is primarily suffering and no longer enjoying life.

Talk to your veterinarian about hospice care.,
Educate yourself.,
Design a hospice care plan.,
Consider the costs.",How to Get Veterinary Hospice Care for Your Dog2," For veterinary hospice care, your vet will help you make the decision to keep your pet under hospice care. The vet will help teach you about what is required during hospice care, including diet, medication, and other care requirements.Every veterinarian does not specialize in pet hospice care. You can ask your vet for a recommendation for a vet who provides hospice care in your area. You may also search online or contact animal agencies, such as the Humane Society or the ASPCA. They can help you find a vet or a hospice center in your area.
Pet hospice care is an intensive commitment for you. You will have to be an active participant in your pet’s care and provide continuous supervision. You will be the caregiver for the animal, not the vet.

, Part of veterinary hospice care is education on the particular ailment your pet suffers from. This education includes symptoms, the way the pet will decline, and any other processes at the later stages of the disease.Your vet will work with you to help educate you on your pet’s condition and how best to care for them.

, You and your veterinarian will work together to design and implement a hospice care plan for your pet. This plan will cover how best to meet the specific needs of your pet. The plan will also take into consideration your family’s needs and wishes.For example, the hospice care plan will outline how to recognize pain in your pet and the treatment for their specific type of pain.
The treatment plan will also cover how to deal with any bodily fluids, how to manage incontinence, and how to change bandages or care for wounds.
Your treatment plan will also cover any nutrition information.

, Hospice care can be expensive. Hospice vets often make house visits to check on the sick pet, which costs more than a regular vet visit. The medications and pain management treatments may be very expensive, too. You should talk to your vet about how much hospice care will cost as you make the decision.If you have to have someone come to your home to walk your dog, sit with your cat, or feed your pet a special meal, you have to consider that cost, too.
Some pet insurance plans may cover some expenses related to hospice care, such as veterinarian visits and care. Consider looking into pet insurance plans to find one that can fit your needs."

Make sure your pet receives proper nutrition.,
Keep your pet hydrated.,
Maintain your pet’s quality of life.,
Clean your pet.,
Prepare emotionally for your pet’s death.,
Consider at-home euthanasia.",How to Get Veterinary Hospice Care for Your Dog3," One important aspect of pet hospice care is pain management. Your vet will help you learn the signs of pain in your pet, especially the ones that may not be obvious. They may instruct you to give your pet oral pain medications, or you may be taught how to administer medications through injections.You may also be instructed to eliminate as many environmental stressors for your pet as possible to reduce their pain.

, Part of hospice care is making sure your pet gets everything needed to meet their specific nutritional needs. This includes a diet you’ve discussed with your vet. You may have to buy a special food to feed them.Your vet may also suggest vitamins or supplements to give your pet.

, Hydration is very important for your pet. Hydration helps reduce sensitivity to pain, along with helping them not feel sluggish, helping maintain appetite, and helping to reduce constipation.You can hydrate your pet by encouraging them to drink water. If your pet doesn’t want to drink, talk to your vet about how to keep your pet hydrated.

, Quality of life for your pet includes making them happy. This might be through spending a lot of time with the family, letting them play with toys they can play with, or going on short walks.Your pet should stay mobile and active though they are in their final days. They just may need to go slower and for shorter durations of time. You may also need to get ramps or other mobility aids for your pet.
Keeping your pet moving can help them going to the bathroom independently as long as they can.

, One important thing while your pet is in hospice care is to keep them clean. Many pets in hospice care are incontinent. If this is the case, try diapers or special beds to help keep your pet clean. Urine and feces on the skin can lead to infections and sores.Keep coats clean and free of mats.
Wipe nose, eyes, and mouth of any discharge. Use a warm, damp cloth in long, gentle strokes to clean your pet.

Ask about surgery.",How to Diagnose and Treat Pyothorax in Cats," One of the primary symptoms of pyothorax is your cat having issues breathing. When a cat develops pyothorax, pus fills the chest cavity. In turn, the lungs cannot expand, which makes it difficult for the cat to breathe.Your cat will likely have its mouth open, and it will breathe in quick, short breaths. Breathing may be painful, as well, and you may notice that it uses its sides more in breathing.If you notice blue or yellowish gums, it's time for an emergency visit to the vet, as that denotes a severe lack of oxygen.;
, One symptom of pyothorax is your cat isn't eating properly. In fact, you may even notice your cat has lost some weight before other symptoms become severe.If your cat ever stops eating, it's a good idea to take them to the vet, as it's usually an indication of an underlying problem.
It's possible your cat may have other related problems, such as vomiting and dehydration., You may notice your cat is running hot due to a fever. In addition, your cat may exhibit other common signs of fever and sickness, such as low energy and depression., Because your cat is having trouble breathing, you may notice it's sitting in odd positions. It may take a ""bulldog stance,"" with the front legs wide apart. You may notice the cat has trouble sleeping because it has to keep sitting up to breathe easier. It may also take a hunched-over position., One common cause is any penetrating wound on the chest, including bites from other animals and stab wounds from foreign objects. It can also happen if your cat swallowed something that penetrated the area internally, leading to infection. If you know your cat has had one of these issues recently, it could have been the cause of the pyothorax.Pyothorax can occur after a cat has had a fight with another cat, especially if their chest area was injured.
However, other infections that you can't see can lead to this problem, too.

, Often, a cat will be treated before the problem is properly diagnosed. That is, when a cat comes in with breathing problems, the first thing the vet will do is establish that it is having respiratory problems. Then, the vet will take emergency treatment measures to stabilize your cat before moving on to other diagnostic tools.In some cases, the case may be mild enough to proceed to other tests first.

, X-rays are often needed so the vet can determine exactly where the fluid is. It may be on both sides of the chest or just one. Your vet may also be able to determine if the cat has a foreign object in its chest, as well as determine if something else is the cause of the infection from the x-rays., If your vet cannot determine the cause, they may want to check for Feline Leukemia and Feline Immunodeficiency Disorder. These diseases can lead to infections, and they will need to be treated, as well.Your cat may also receive blood tests to determine if other things are out of balance, such as electrolytes., Once the cat is out of danger, the vet will often take a sample of the fluid. The fluid will be tested to determine what kind of infection the cat has, making it easier to decide on an antibiotic., The vet will give the cat oxygen to help with the breathing. Next, the vet will give it medications such as sedatives to help calm it down before moving on with diagnosis and treatment.Cats with severe respiratory problems are an emergency situation, so stabilizing breathing first gets it out of trouble. Then the vet can diagnose and treat what caused the problem.

, When a cat has pyothorax, the first treatment after stabilizing its breathing is to get rid of the fluid causing the problem.Initially, the vet may use a needle to drain some of the fluid and relieve the pressure. However, once the cat is out of immediate danger, the vet will likely place tubes in the chest to flush and drain the chest over several days.Often, hospitalization is required for this procedure. Your cat can come out of the hospital when its chest cavity stops reforming the pus, and the cat is interested in eating on its own.
Your vet will likely give your cat pain medications for this procedure., Typically, your cat will begin intravenous antibiotics at the clinic or hospital. These infections can run deep, so your cat will need extensive antibiotics, even when you bring it home. At home, you should be able to give oral antibiotics., In addition to treating the infection, your cat may need other secondary treatments, such as intravenous fluids. Your cat may also need to be force-fed by the vet for a few days if it is not interested in eating., If other interventions have failed, including chest tubes and antibiotics, your cat may need surgery. The point of the surgery is to discover if a foreign object is in the chest, leading to the infection. The object is removed to help with recovery."

Choose your area.,
Choose your time.,
Search for visible signs of deer.,
Look for places deer would be attracted to.,
Be as quiet as possible.,
Continue searching.",How to Find Deer1," Walk into legal hunting grounds where there are woods. If you're hunting or tracking deer on someone else's property, ask where deer tend to bed and where the most common place to see deer is. This will help you decide where to start.


Typically, deer prefer covered areas to make their beds in. Look for ditches and hollows with dense cover or thickets crowded with brush. They often bed along stream bottoms or on southward-facing slopes to keep warm in the sunlight.;
, Deer are mostly nocturnal, but they can also be seen out in the daytime. However, since they usually sleep during the day (and it is hard to see them at night), the best times to search for deer are early in the morning or at dusk when the sun is going down. These are their normal feeding times and the time you will be most likely to catch a glimpse of them., There is often evidence of deer all around you if you know where to look for it. Keep an eye out for indicators that deer have been in the area like tracks or droppings.


Deer droppings are usually small, jellybean shaped pellets that are dark brown in color.Sometimes the droppings appear as a bunch of separate pellets, sometimes as a bunch of pellets clumped together.
You can also try staying stationary in an area that is known to often be frequented by deer so that you can simply wait and watch/listen for the deer.
Make sure you are moving through the woods as quietly as possible to avoid spooking any deer that might be nearby.

, Deer usually bed in areas of thick brush; these are good places to begin your search. You can also search for edible vegetation that deer feed on like wild grasses, greenbriar, dandelions, or acorns.

, Deer have very keen senses of sight and sound. Try to be as silent as you can while you are tracking through the woods. If you are too noisy, they will hear you long before you notice them and you will miss your chance., Follow the tracks and keep searching for signs of deer until you encounter the animals. This takes patience, but is worth it in the end.

"
"
Find deer tracks.,
Look at the features of the tracks.,
Determine if tracks are fresh or old.",How to Find Deer2," If there is moisture or snow on the ground, this will make it easier to locate tracks. Deer tracks are easiest to spot in snow or soft dirt/mud that is malleable to the touch and will reposition into a track when an animal steps on it.

, When you find deer tracks, you can use them as evidence to help you determine how many deer were present and how big they were. Deer tracks have two “toes” and a marking at the base of the track. Deer have cloven hooves which means they're split down the middle. Deer tracks normally look like the image below. Generally, the bigger the track, the bigger the deer.


Remember, if you see larger tracks accompanied by small tracks, you may be following a doe with a fawn. You do not want to kill a mother deer as this will orphan the fawn.

, If the tracks seem frozen over or are messed up by other tracks, they are most likely old. If there has been a recent snow and there are uncovered tracks in it, they are probably new.

"
"
Clear the area ahead of time.,
Build the stand.,
Prepare your area.,
Wait for the deer to come to you.",How to Find Deer3," It is important to prepare the area where you will build the stand well ahead of the time you plan to begin hunting. This will ensure that your scent is clear of the path by the time you want to hunt. You should clear away some of the noisy ground brush so that you will be able to access your stand without making too much noise., There are several different kinds of hunting stands to choose from. Decide which one works best for you and the area in which you want to hunt. Both types of blinds should be built in areas of heavy deer traffic to increase your chance of encountering a deer while you wait. Be sure to do plenty of scouting around the area before you choose the location to build your stand. Look for deer beds and signs of grazing.


Ground blind/stand. A ground stand requires less work to construct than a tree stand. You can actually build it out of natural materials. Try to find a tree to rest against and then use sticks, leaves, and brush to build up a natural cover that blocks your lower body. Make sure you pick a slightly elevated spot so that you can see animals that approach.Tree stand. A tree stand is a good idea if you are in a heavily wooded area. But make sure there is plenty of leaf cover or branches surrounding your stand, otherwise your silhouette will be noticeable. Use all safety features for the stand (like a climbing harness during construction) to make it completely secure and be cautious when entering and exiting the tree stand. One misstep could mean disaster if you fall.

Make sure you follow all of the manufacturer’s directions when constructing the tree stand. If you skip a step in the building process, it could easily make your tree stand unsafe and dangerous for you to use., Install a rest for your rifle. Some models are designed to wrap around the hunter while they are seated; these are ideal for use in tree stands. Make sure all pieces of your blind/stand are silenced in whatever way possible. Cover your seat with fleece, lubricate any moving parts, encase chains in tubing, and bring a piece of old carpet for the floor of your stand. All of these things will help reduce the noise while you wait.

, Deer travel all day, so you may be waiting for a long time.Bring a book or something to keep yourself occupied. Bring plenty of food and water to last the duration of your hunting excursion. Be prepared to exit your stand when necessary to stretch, or take care of other personal needs. Occasionally moving around will make the waiting more tolerable.

"
"
Find the location of the deer when it was shot.,
Search for directional signs.,
Kill the deer when you find it.",How to Find Deer4," When you initially shoot the deer, try to watch closely for the path it takes when it runs after being shot. Once it runs away, go toward the place you last saw it, probably the spot where it was shot, and look for signs of the deer. There should be at least some blood here, so it should be fairly simple to locate. .

, Try to figure out which way the deer when by looking for visible signs. Try to find evidence of blood on the ground or on nearby brush. There may also be broken branches and other disrupted vegetation as a result of the deer’s hurried exit. If there are tracks and blood, follow them. Keep looking for the next sign of blood or the next set of tracks as you make your way toward the injured deer.


It is easier to track deer in the snow but it is still possible to track them out of it. You just need to look for signs of blood and disrupted/broken brush or vegetation.

, If you hit the deer in the gut, it is likely the deer will not die for a while as it will bleed to death. Be cautious when pursing a wounded animal; they are more unpredictable and can be dangerous. If you can, stay back and shoot it again in a fatal place when it has stopped to rest. You are aiming for a quick, humane kill.

Introduce deer to a new diet slowly.,
Purchase formulated deer food mixes.,
Feed deer the right foods if you cannot find formulated deer mixture.,
Do not feed deer a corn diet.,
Cut down tree branches to feed deer.",How to Feed Deer1," It takes deer take 2-4 weeks to adjust to a new diet, so start feeding them gradually. Slowly introducing new types of food into a deer's diet will help their digestive system learn to process it. Deer typically eat woody vegetation that is found in forests, so feeding them foods that are rich in fats and carbohydrates can be extremely harmful.


Begin introducing new foods by combining supplemental foods with deer's natural diet. Start by including a small amount of the new food, and gradually incorporate more and more, ultimately replacing their natural diet. In winter, their natural food supply will decrease significantly (if not completely), so it is recommended to begin this transition before winter hits.;
, These mixes can typically be found at feed mills or pet supply stores. Deer feed mixes are usually a mix of alfalfa, oats, soybeans, molasses and several vitamins and minerals. This type of food is easiest for deer to digest, which is what makes it ideal for supplemental feeding., You must be careful when feeding deer supplemental foods, as they have a sensitive digestive system. If formulated deer food mixtures are unavailable, oats are the next best supplemental food for deer. Oats provide deer with a healthy mixture of fiber and carbohydrates without disrupting their digestive system.A wide variety of fruits and vegetables – including apples, grapes, cherries, pears, carrots, and snap peas – are eaten in nature by deer. Therefore, it is safe to feed deer these fruits.
Acorns are another safe food source., A deer's digestive system is complex, and corn happens to be one of the worst types of food for them. Unfortunately, many deer end up extremely sick or dead because animal lovers believe that corn is good for deer. When deer are offered a sudden supply of corn, they aren't able to adjust to the high carbohydrate diet, and they end up dying., In nature, deer eat twigs and other natural forest vegetation. To provide them with more of their natural food source, cut down branches that are out of their reach. This is one of the safest and most natural ways to keep deer fed throughout the year."
"
Feed deer during the winter months.,
Offer supplemental food to deer year round.,
Do not suddenly stop feeding deer.",How to Feed Deer2," Since deer's natural food source is made up from woody vegetation, it becomes harder for them to find food during the winter. This is the reason many people choose to feed deer. If you decide to feed deer during the winter months, be careful to feed them the proper types of food and slowly introduce it into their diets.


Begin introducing food slowly so that it does not harm the deer. Begin combine supplemental food with their natural diet of woody vegetation. This combination of new food into their natural diet will provide a smooth transition for their digestive tracks.
Set up feeders or troughs in your yard. Set the feeders or troughs up as far away from your home as possible.
If you have the means, you can keep your feeders or troughs full at all times. If not, you should stick to a set feeding time. The deer will become accustomed to eating your food, so try to keep the feeding on a regular schedule. Early morning or sunset are good times for feeding.

, Many people choose to supply deer with food only during the winter months, as this is when their natural food sources are the most scarce. But if you have the means, consider providing supplemental food to your deer year round. This will allow deer to adapt to the supplemental food so that it doesn't shock their system. This will also teach dear to combine their supplemental and natural food sources.

, When deer are fed by humans, they can easily become dependent and stop foraging for food naturally. If you feed deer and then suddenly stop (even if you've simply run out of food temporarily), the deer may go hungry or start bothering you for more food.


You should slowly wean deer off of supplemental food so that they can begin foraging for food on their own again. Take the food away slowly and not all at once."

Make sure it is legal to feed wild animals in your jurisdiction.,
Find a location where deer will come for feeding.,
Feed deer on your property.",How to Feed Deer3," Feeding wildlife is often regulated by local laws and wildlife commissions, and the laws vary from state to state. Some states allow feeding between certain dates and prohibit it between other dates. Check online to find out your local laws. Some states also have laws that dictate how much you are allowed to feed deer., Many local wildlife organizations set up feeding sites for deer – these are public places that deer come to feed. You can bring food to these sites to help feed deer without taking on the responsibility of feeding deer in your backyard. These organizations typically know the proper times to feed deer and the proper amount of food to put out at one time., If you plan to feed deer on your property, make sure you're feeding them the proper food, and not giving them too much of it. Set up feeders or troughs as far as possible from your home so that the deer don't come near your house.


Each deer should eat no more than 3-4 pounds of food per day.Try not to interact with the deer, as this can make them less fearful of humans, and more likely to become prey.

Consider planting trees to feed deer.,
Get involved with your local wildlife agency.,
Allow hunters on hunt-able land.",How to Feed Deer4," This is a more natural way to feed deer and will reduce the amount of daily maintenance your feeding project will require. You'll also be helping the environment! Apple trees, maple trees, and aspen trees all make great food for deer, so consider planting some of those trees on your property., Getting involved with your local wildlife agency will allow you to help deer and other local wildlife the best way possible. Dealing with professionals is a great way to make a difference and actually help animals, long term., If you live on hunt-able land, allow hunters to use your land during hunting season. Many rural areas are overpopulated with deer, which is why they face food shortages. Hunting keeps deer populations in balance with their available habitat, and minimizes the negative impacts on deer habitat, farmers, residents, and motorists.

Start with Pedialyte.,
Feed them KMR.,
Feed them Esbilac.,
Avoid milk.,
Gather additional supplies.",How to Feed a Baby Raccoon1," Pedialyte is an electrolyte drink used to hydrate human babies that are sick. If your baby raccoon has been left alone for too long, you will want to start by feeding him Pedialyte, and hydrate him before moving on to a milk replacement. Pedialyte is sold in most drug stores., When it comes to actual “food” for your baby raccoon, the very best choice is KMR, or kitten milk replacement, which can be found at most pet stores. This formula for baby cats will most closely resemble raccoon milk., Esbilac is your second best option. This is a meal replacement formula for puppies. Like KMR, Esbilac is available at most pet stores. This milk replacement formula for baby dogs will be a suitable alternative to raccoon milk., Cow’s milk, goat’s milk, soymilk, and most other milk products for humans will make the baby raccoon sick. Administering these products can lead to severe dehydration, malnutrition, and possibly even death.Use human infant formula, only in an emergency.

, In addition to the Pedialyte and KMR, you will need a few supplies. You’ll want to gather up an eyedropper, a pet bottle (or a human baby bottle with a premie nipple), a blanket, a washcloth or feather, and a hot water bottle."
"
Make sure he’s warm.,
Check for dehydration.,
Determine how much to feed him.,
Feed him with an eyedropper.,
Feed him with a bottle.,
Stimulate waste removal.,
Integrate solids.",How to Feed a Baby Raccoon2," A baby raccoon will not be able to digest food until he is the proper temperature. If your baby raccoon has been left alone outside, he will likely need to be warmed before he can eat. Wrap him in a soft blanket and lay him next to a hot water bottle, until he feels warm to the touch., If the baby raccoon’s skin “tents up” when you pinch it, or if his eyes are sunken, he may be severely dehydrated and should be taken to a vet immediately. If he only seems mildly dehydrated, proceed by offering him rehydration solution (or Pedialyte)., The amount you feed your baby raccoon will be based on his weight, so first you are going to have to weigh him in grams. (A kitchen scale or postal scale you have at home will work fine.) Once you know his weight, plan to offer him 5% of his body weight in milliliters (or ccs) at each feeding.60 gram = 3ml per feeding
100 gram = 5ml per feeding
200 gram = 10ml per feeding
Offer him food 7-8 times per day.

, It will likely be best if you feed your baby raccoon with an eyedropper at first, so that you can control the amount of fluid he gets. Hold him on his belly, or slightly upright, and express the milk into his mouth little by little.You may have to clamp your hand around his muzzle to maintain his grasp on the eyedropper.
Never hold the raccoon on his back (the way you would hold a human baby).

, Once you have practiced feeding with an eyedropper, you may be able to move on to feeding with a pet bottle. (These are available for purchase at most pet stores.) As with the eyedropper, lay him on his belly, or slightly upright. Once you have inserted the nipple of the bottle into the raccoon’s mouth, massage his back from his neck to the base of this tail to encourage a “purring” response and stimulate sucking., This step is crucial to the survival of your baby raccoon. Mother raccoons normally lick their babies to stimulate urination and defecation. As a surrogate raccoon mother, you will need to stimulate the urethra and anus of the raccoon using a warm washcloth or feather. This must be done before and after each feeding, until you see the baby raccoon eliminating waste on its own., When your baby raccoon’s teeth begin to emerge, it is important to start incorporating solid foods. You can begin by mixing a bit of crushed kitten food with his formula. Move on to feeding dry kitten food, cooked eggs, soft fruits, and oatmeal."
"
Offer hydration solution first.,
Make a homemade “hydration solution.” In an emergency, you can make a homemade rehydration solution.,
Heat solution to body temperature.,
Stimulate urination.,
Integrate milk replacement.",How to Feed a Baby Raccoon3," When you encounter an abandoned baby raccoon in the wild, it is very likely that he is dehydrated. Before you can offer him any food, you must offer a hydration solution (or Pedialyte). Offer this in an eye-dropper or pet baby bottle.Look for plain, unflavored, unsweetened Pedialyte.

, Mix ½ teaspoon salt + ½ tablespoon of sugar + 2 cups of water. Warm this mixture slightly to dissolve the sugar and salt. Use this only until you can get to the store and purchase Pedialyte., Take your bottle of rehydration solution and submerge it in a container of hot water, until the solution warms to body temperature. Your baby raccoon is more likely to drink it if it mimics the temperature of his mama’s milk. It will also be more easily absorbed into his system this way., Using a warm washcloth or feather, you will need to stimulate the anus and urethra of your baby raccoon until he begins to urinate. Continue to offer rehydration solution until your raccoon is producing light yellow urine., When you feel that the baby is adequately hydrated, begin to integrate milk replacement formula (KMR or Esbilac). Start slowly, including small portions of milk replacement into his rehydration solution, and work up to full formula.3 parts rehydration solution, 1 part milk replacement for two feedings.
2 parts rehydration solution, 2 parts milk replacement for two feedings.
1 part rehydration solution, 3 parts milk replacement for one or two feedings.

Look for red or white spots on the wattle or comb.",How to Diagnose Illness in an Emu," Normal emu excrement is soft, but not runny or watery. Runny or water excrement, or diarrhea, is often a sign of disease in emu. While changes in diet will cause diarrhea, there are many diseases that may require treatment that also cause diarrhea. These include bacterial infections, avian influenza, fowl cholera, staphylococcus, as well as many other diseases that affect emu. You will need to see a vet or check for other symptoms to determine the cause of diarrhea.Many baby emu chicks will experience normal diarrhea. As long as they seem otherwise healthy, you don’t need to administer treatment.If the diarrhea is green or very watery, the emu might have Newcastle Disease or Chlamydiosis.;
, Significant reduction in normal feed intake could be a symptom of Equine Encephalitis. Equine Encephalitis is a fatal disease for emus, so it is important to vaccinate them (though there are no FDA-approved vaccines specifically for emu.) Care needs to be taken when handling sick or dead emu so that the other birds don’t catch it. As it is passed through mosquito bites and can infect humans (though rarely), it’s a good idea to use insect repellant while working with emu, or in general, when outdoors in affected regions., Significant weight loss can be a symptom of fowl cholera, as well as a sign of tuberculosis. If this is the case, you should check with your vet.Healthy weights in emu range from 90 to 150 pounds. You can use a platform scale and do scale training to get your emu to stay on the scale long enough to weigh them.Platform scales that can handle the weight of an emu can cost anywhere from just over a hundred dollars to over a thousand.It might be a good idea to get a textured-surface scale so that your emu finds it easy to walk on it without slipping.

, Nostril discharge can be a symptom of Newcastle Disease (which can affect all types of birds), infectious bronchitis, avian influenza (Bird Flu), as well as several other diseases affecting emu. Sneezing can be the symptom of Newcastle disease, avian influenza, among other conditions, though not of infectious bronchitis. Again, the best course of action here is to see the vet or look for other symptoms to determine the disease., Coughing can be a symptom of fowl pox, Newcastle Disease, Avian Influenza, as well as many other conditions. Rales, the sound of abnormal breathing, is another thing to look out for in these conditions. In fact, rales accompanies most respiratory infections., You can check this by parting the feathers. The skin on an emu's head is normally a mix of black, tan, blue, and white, and the rest of the skin is pinkish. Bluish-purple skin can indicate a lack of oxygen. This symptom appears frequently with Avian Influenza and Newcastle disease. Blue discoloration of the skin, or cyanosis, also occurs with Aspergillosis.If you suspect a bird is sick, it is best to use gloves when examining it., For outside lesions, they will be fairly obvious covering the beak area. This is a symptom of fowl pox, which can affect a large variety of poultry, including emu. If you find these, you need to quarantine the sick birds, as there is no treatment. Prevention is better, and can be maintained through mosquito control and vaccination, especially if fowl pox is common in an area. For lesions in the mouth, it is best to leave this to a qualified veterinarian.In order to avoid damage from claws or beak, grasp the emu from behind at the wings. Then lift it up and back slightly. A hood can also be used to limit damage., If it is lying on the ground (known as prostration) or twisting its neck, it could have Newcastle Disease. In general, if the bird isn’t standing or moving about properly, you should check with a vet. Neck twisting also occurs with Aspergillosis., If the bird has conjunctivitis, it might have Newcastle Disease or Chlamydiosis, as well as a number of other conditions. See if it has other symptoms of one of these diseases to try to confirm a diagnosis. The best bet is to check with a vet., Swollen joints or footpads are often a symptom of staphylococcus or fowl cholera. A swollen face or wattle can be present in a number of conditions, so it is not evidence for a definitive diagnosis, but can aid you in knowing that something’s wrong with the emu. , This is a common symptom of avian influenza that does not appear in some other conditions. So, it can be a telltale sign of avian influenza. As avian influenza is a rare threat to human health, it is important to contain it.


You must report a suspected outbreak to the state veterinarian’s office."

Carefully wash yourself after handling a fox.",How to Catch a Fox," For the vast majority of foxes, standard ""boxy"" live traps of a suitable size work quite well. These traps resemble a long rectangular box with trap doors at one (or either) end. The fox, lured in by bait, steps on a pedal, which releases the trap door(s) and locks it in.


Live traps are available to buy or rent at most hunting goods stores and also online from specialty retailers. For the medium to medium-large traps suitable for catching foxes, prices usually range from about $40-80.;
, Set your trap in the ""open"" position and carefully place your bait in the designated space in the center. You have a wide variety of options when it comes to picking your bait — for instance, you may want to use pork, ""wet"" cat food, fish, chicken, or other meat. If you're a hunter, you may alternatively want to use game meat (bobcat and beaver work especially well).The scent of the bait you use is important. Foxes have strong noses that they use to sniff out food sources, so, if possible, try to use bait with a strong, appealing odor.If you're using cat food, try to use one with a strong fishy scent — foxes love this.

, Though it's possible to see foxes at almost any time of the day, the animals are usually nocturnal predators.For this reason, once you set a trap, you'll want to be very patient, waiting at least one night for results. Check on your trap in the morning to see if you've caught your troublesome fox. Don't be surprised if you find a raccoon, skunk, rat, possum, or other small mammal in the trap — these animals can also be attracted to the same sorts of baits that foxes like.


Don’t let the trap sit out for more than a day or so without checking on it. Doing this can cause a trapped fox to suffer from hunger or exposure.

, If you don't have a live box trap and don't want to bother renting or buying one, this free alternative can also work well. To make a hole trap, dig a deep, steep-sided hole near a tree, a stump, or another natural obstruction so that the fox can only enter the hole from one side. Place your bait in the bottom of the hole and cover the top of the trap with branches and leaves to obscure it. If the hole is steep enough, the fox will fall in while looking for the bait and be unable to climb out until you come back for it.


Many sources recommend placing a leg snare trap at the bottom of the hole to ensure that the fox is truly stuck once it falls into the hole. If you're thinking about doing this, be sure to check your local jurisdictions first. Since leg snare traps can potentially injure or maim the animal, they're not always legal.In addition, you may want to consider whether such a trap is compatible with your personal ethics.

, Foxes aren't stupid — the wily creatures will sometimes be able to tell when a trap is a trap and will avoid it, even when there's bait in it. To counter this, try the strategy of step-baiting. The first night, put your bait outside the trap, but near it. If you notice the next morning that the bait is gone, the following night, put it just inside the trap, but not near the pedal that springs the trap doors. If the bait vanishes again, try putting the bait in the middle of the trap the third night. Often, this gradual progression will trick a fox into thinking that a source of bait is ""safe"" until it's greedy enough to fall for the trap.


If you're still having trouble, the fox may be smelling your scent on the trap. Try carefully washing the trap with hot or boiling water to remove your scent. You may also want to try sprinkling some fox urine (available at many hunting goods stores) around the trap — foxes can be territorial, so another fox's scent can cause it to investigate the trap closely., Even if your end goal is to kill the animal, it's important not to allow the fox to suffer in the process. Causing unnecessary suffering to an animal is cruel, immoral, and unfair. For this reason, you'll want to stay away from traps that injure the animal in the act of trapping it. For instance, steel-jawed leg traps can break the fox's leg when they snap closed on it and wire snares can cut off circulation to the animal's limb, causing it to die. In general, traps that work by suddenly gripping or snapping shut on part of the animal shouldn't be used. In addition, to being inhumane, these sorts of traps can also be illegal and carry stiff fines for their use, depending on where you live., If, for whatever reason you manage to seriously injure a fox while trying to catch it, you will probably want to euthanize the animal (or call a professional to do it for you). Releasing a maimed animal back into the wild can cause the animal to suffer for days before it eventually starves, dies of disease, or is killed by a predator. Quick, relatively pain-free euthanasia is almost always a better alternative in this case.


Humane killing methods are generally those that cause instant (or near-instant) unconsciousness followed by quick death without giving the animal a chance to panic or suffer. Different animal welfare groups will have different definitions of what a humane killing method is, but, in general, methods like shooting the animal in the head, stunning it with electricity and then cutting its throat, and using pain-free gases are considered humane by most authorities., Once you've captured a fox, you'll want to be very careful about the way you handle it, even if it appears securely confined to its trap. Carry the trap away from your body, holding it only by a safe handhold that's well out of the fox's reach. Never stick your fingers into the cage, shake the cage, or purposely agitate the animal. Foxes caught in live traps are likely to be scared for their lives, which means that they have the potential to lash out and bite or scratch you, even if they appear docile on the surface.


Note that foxes can carry a variety of diseases including rabies, a deadly viral disease for which there is no cure besides receiving a vaccination after being bit. If you are ever bitten or scratched by a fox, contact a doctor right away. Though rabies is rare in foxes, it can lead to a long, painful, and ultimately fatal illness, so it's always better to be safe than sorry., One option when you've captured a fox is to take it somewhere far away and let it go free. This method has the benefit of causing no immediate harm to the fox. However, it's important to note that, because foxes are territorial creatures, they will sometimes return to their original location even if they have to travel a long way to get there. In addition, because of competition from other predators and differing habitat conditions, there is always a chance that a fox released into the wild away from its home will eventually die anyway.If you do decide to release your captured fox into the wild, be sure to do so safely. Orient the trap away from you, then carefully open the trap door to release the fox. Don't pursue the fox once it leaves the trap — it will likely be agitated and can potentially react with hostility, though this is rare.

, For many, having a professional deal with a captured fox is much preferable to the prospect of doing it on their own. Nearly all local animal control agencies will be willing to take a wild fox off of your hands, saving you the hassle of deciding what to do yourself. If you don't know how to contact local animal control services, in the U.S., try contacting the ASPCA, or the Humane Society (whose contact info is available on their respective organization websites) for instructions.Understand that, unfortunately, many animal control services will humanely euthanize the fox after you give it to them. This is because, as noted above, foxes are known carriers of rabies and other diseases., If the fox you've just caught has been causing you serious trouble, you may want to kill it to make sure you're rid of it for good. In this case, be sure to consult your local laws before killing the fox to ensure you're not doing something illegal. In the vast majority of cases, killing a fox to protect your property or eliminate a nuisance will not be considered illegal.However, some states and jurisdictions may have rules that can limit your ability to kill foxes, especially if you need to kill many foxes, want to kill them for commercial purposes, or need to kill them during an ""off-season"" time.


For example, in the state of North Carolina, the laws governing foxes vary greatly from county to county. For instance, in Gates County, fox trapping season lasts only during the month of January and you are limited to a maximum ""bag"" limit of 30 foxes. On the other hand, in Forsyth County, there is no fox trapping season or bag limit.
If you do opt to kill a captured fox, always use one of the humane killing methods described above.

, No matter what you plan to do with your captured fox, it's important to know the signs of danger so that you can respond to them quickly and decisively, should they occur. Many of the signs that an angry fox will give off are similar to those used by dogs. For instance, if the hair on its back is standing up, its tail is straight, or it is growling, snarling, or baring its teeth, the fox is angry and may react with hostility. In this case, always leave matters to a professional.


It's also a very good idea to know the signs of a rabid fox. If the fox is stumbling as if it were drunk, seems partially paralyzed, is hurting itself, or is acting extremely aggressive or unnaturally calm, it may be rabid.In this case, you definitely need to contact a professional — rabies is a very serious disease and should not be treated lightly.

, Foxes are sometimes trapped or hunted for their soft natural pelt. The fur of a fox can potentially be very valuable — it's not unusual for a real fox fur coat or boot to retail for several thousand dollars or more. If you're an experienced skinner, you may want to consider humanely killing the animal, then skinning it and treating its hide so that you may sell it to a fur vendor. However, note that the act of killing an animal for its fur is usually more tightly-regulated than the act of killing it to rid yourself of a pest, so, as always, consult your local laws before proceeding.


Don't try to take a fox's fur if you don't know what you're doing. Knowing how to skin an animal is a difficult skill that can require lots of practice to perfect. Attempting to skin a dead fox when you've never done so before may end up in the fur being ruined, making the fox's death a waste.

, Even if you don't come into direct contact with your captured fox, you'll want to carefully give your hands and arms (and, if necessary, your body and clothing) a thorough washing after handling its trap. Like many wild animals, foxes can be quite dirty even if they don't appear so. They may, for instance, have small amounts of blood on them from a recent kill or may have tiny traces of fecal matter in their fur. In addition, they may carry parasites like fleas or ticks (especially cat fleas).Because you have no way of knowing where exactly a fox has been, it's usually best to be safe.


You'll also want to wash your trap as well to avoid the possibility of future contamination. Scrub all of its surfaces with hot water and soap, then use a hose to rinse it. Finally, dry it with a towel or rag to prepare it for future use.

Choose material that is soft and easy to wash. Blankets make ideal material for this purpose and the older they are, the softer they're likely to be.,
Create a pouch for a joey.,
Create a pouch for a wombat.,
Create a pouch for a possum.",How to Create Substitute Pouches for Marsupial Rescue," If they're threadbare, simply cut off any holes or scraggly bits.


Other good fabric includes polar fleece the inner side of windcheaters, sheets and jumpers.
A pillowcase lined with something soft and warm such as a jumper is ideal.
Consider sewing up the bottom of a jumper if using one. This allows the joey to pop her head out of the head hole, as she'd do from a pouch.;
, Select a pouch size that will allow the joey to move around a little but still feel snug inside. To recreate the sense of suspension that a joey would feel in her own mother's pouch, place the pouch inside a larger bag or breathable sack and suspend it from something while still keeping it close to the ground to allow for ease of exit and entry by the joey. However, do not have the bag touch the ground (you may need to make an adjustment once the joey's weight is taken into account).


When the joey is not yet actively leaving the pouch, it can be suspended higher but be sure to monitor growing changes and the desire to leave the pouch.

, Make a pouch from suitable material. Line with a small blanket piece (or small blanket), then place the whole pouch inside a wooden box. The box should have a lid, especially as the wombat gets older.


You could place an electric pet blanket under the wooden box for extra warmth but be careful not to overheat the wombat. Wombat joeys have better temperature control than kangaroo joeys. Do not use a human electric blanket, as these are completely unsuitable and risk burning the animal or starting a fire if urinated on or chewed. Talk to your vet about options.

, Use a sock or a small woollen hat. Once the possum becomes active and tries to emerge from the pouch, you can keep her in the pouch by pinning the top together with a safety pin. That way she won't get lost or cold when you're not about to supervise.


Use Ugg boots for little possums.
Once the possum grows older and can come and go from the pouch with greater ease, keep the sock or hat opening open using wire. The pouch should be kept inside a cat cage or similar size cage now though, to prevent her from wandering too far away.
Hanging baskets can work well for possums. Simply arrange them so as to create a closed nest.

Try commercial scare products.",How to Deter Foxes1," Deterring foxes is a game of percentages. Each step you take will greatly reduce the number of infiltrators, but there's no magic bullet that stops every one. Regular upkeep and planning will give foxes less reason to approach in the first place, an important first step:Clear all food scraps and enclose compost.
Cover standing water at night to prevent drinking.
Stop using fertilizers made from blood, bone, or fish.
Gather excess fruit and vegetables instead of leaving it on the plant.
Keep shoes and other small objects inside. Foxes like to use these as playthings.;
, Check first to make sure there are no animals already living there. Walling them in to die may be illegal, and could attract scavengers.

, Most commercial repellents are scent-based, which confuses the fox and prevents it marking your land as its own territory. If you can't find a fox repellent, look for one targeted at dogs.You may need to try a few repellents before you find one that works on your foxes. Check the ingredient list to make sure the second one you buy is actually different:Aluminum ammonium sulphate — a scent-based repellent
Methyl nonyl ketone — a different scent
Capsicum (pepper spray) — extra-spicy taste. Typically less effective, as the fox has to eat it.

, Repellent usually can't discourage a fox when it's already next to the hen house or your prize vegetables. Spray it in the following locations instead, or mix with sand and sawdust and sprinkle it:Apply directly to scat, without removing it. Fox leave scat in the open to mark territory, and may return to the same spot if it is cleared. (If children play in the area, apply fox scat disinfectant as well to protect them from diseases.)
Apply to soil above buried food, compost, or deceased pets.
Apply to suspected entry points onto your land, or along the tops of walls and fences.

, A fox that has an unpleasant experience eating something in your yard may not want to visit again. Try leaving out food scraps covered in hot sauce or bittering agents., You may use human urine, or male predator urine from a garden store. This generally works best for deterring prey animals, not predators, but some people have reported success. As with any deterrent, results will vary based on individual foxes and how desirable your land appears.

, Many livestock owners use guard dogs or guinea fowl to scare away predators. These are often effective at chasing off foxes, if you can stand the noise.

, There are many products marketed at the frustrated gardener or farmer. Most haven't been thoroughly studied, and receive a wide range of reviews from users. You might have best results with a product you know has worked for your neighbors. Common examples include:Devices that squirt water when an animal approaches.
Ultrasonic devices that make a high-pitched noise.
Devices that flash light at the fox.

Use narrow, steel mesh as fencing.,
Bury an L-shaped fence to prevent digging.,
Prevent jumping and climbing.,
Consider electric fencing.",How to Deter Foxes2," Hardware cloth or ½"" x ½"" (1.25cm x 1.25cm) welded wire mesh should make up the bottom 2 feet (0.6 m) of fence, plus all buried sections. Unlike chicken wire, the fox cannot get his teeth around this mesh to tear through it.


For extra protection, use two layers of mesh.

, Foxes are excellent diggers. Bury the wire barrier at least 8 inches (20 cm) deep, or up to 12 inches (30 cm) if the soil is loose or sandy. Bend the mesh at a 90º angle and extend it outward 8 inches (20 cm), so the fox can't find a way past if it digs downward.Weigh down the horizontal layer with bricks or rubble before you cover it with soil, to make digging even harder.

, A large fox can jump or climb an impressive height. An ordinary fence should be at least 6 ft (1.8m) high to keep out foxes. You can get away with as low as 5 ft (1.5m) if you bend the top of the fence outward to form a long overhang.Try an overhang that bends outward at a 45º angle and extends 19 inches (50cm)., This is one of the most effective ways to deter foxes.Foxes usually examine the fence before trying to climb or jump. If they come into contact with an electric wire, the painful shock will usually discourage them from trying. Run three wires for best results: one at fox head height, one along the top, and one in the middle. You'll also need an energizer that produces about 5,000–7,000 volts.This will discourage most jumpers, so you can risk building a lower fence.
If there are hedgehogs in your area, the lowest electric wire should be at least 6 inches (15 cm) off the ground to prevent accidental death. Other small mammals are usually fine.Electric fences are not recommended in areas with young children.
The fox must make a connection between the electric wire and the ground to get a shock. If your fence isn't grounded, run a ground wire about an inch (2.5 cm) apart from the middle and upper wires.
Alternatively, use electric netting.

Secure the floor.,
Cover chicken wire and holes with hardware cloth.,
Install multiple bolts.,
Give birds a high roost.",How to Deter Foxes3," Foxes are excellent diggers and can tear or squeeze through relatively small holes. Use one of these flooring designs to protect your animals:Wooden floor: use thick wood and place a layer of hardware cloth underneath it.
Dirt floor: Sink a wall of ½"" (1.25cm) or smaller wire mesh or hardware cloth 12 in (30cm) deep around the perimeter. Extend the wall horizontally, 8–12 in (20–30cm) outward, so the fox can't dig underneath it.

, Foxes can chew through chicken wire. Cover it with galvanized steel hardware cloth, or mesh with holes no larger than ½"" (1.25cm). Check regularly for holes in the walls and floor, and cover these as well. Secure with construction staples.Even a small hole could be torn to make a larger one, or could be the entry point for a smaller predator.


Also cover any weak points in construction, such as the edge of loose boards.

, Foxes can operate a twist catch and other simple locks. Use bolts instead, with a latch to secure them. Ideally, install two or more locks to protect your animals if one breaks or if someone makes a mistake while locking it., If you're protecting birds, give them a perch at the top of the coop to reach in times of danger. This may not stop a fox indefinitely, but it could give you time to respond to a commotion.

Consider waiting until the kits mature.,
Loosely block entrances with repellent.,
Replace daily.,
Block permanently once the foxes have left.",How to Deter Foxes4," If a fox is raising a family in your yard, consider allowing it to stay until the kits are old enough to travel. They should be able to leave safely at nine weeks old, when they start hunting with their parents. This usually happens in late spring or early summer.The first time you see kits out of the den, they're probably around four or five weeks old. Give them another month before you drive them out.

, Most dens are in enclosed spaces, such as crawlspaces or rock shelters. Soak rags or straw in commercial fox repellent, and place them in the path of the entrance. Pile it high without blocking the fox's access., If there are foxes living in the den, they should move the repellent out of the way frequently. Check daily and replace with fresh repellent if necessary.

, If a batch of repellent is still blocking the entrances after two days, the foxes have probably moved on. Block the entrance with a more substantial barrier, such as bricks or cinder blocks.

Find your state’s regulatory board.,
Read the laws.,
Apply for the appropriate license.",How to Catch a Deer1," Most states have either a Department of Wildlife or a Department of Natural Resources. The appropriate governing body that handles hunting and trapping in your state may go by a different name, though. Find the website for the department and look up information related to trapping deer in your area.;
, Many states forbid the trapping of deer, and using any type of trap to catch a deer can result in stiff fines and penalties. Other states, such as Minnesota, prohibit the use of any type of bait to hunt or catch deer, making most traps ineffective. Read the laws governing trapping deer in your state carefully, including licensing, methods, seasons, antlered vs. antlerless zones, etc.

, Once you know how to catch deer in your area lawfully, apply for the appropriate license. Deer fall under the big game license in nearly every state. The application will require your name, address, and other standard information. A licensing fee will also be associated with the process.

Contact your local animal shelters.,
Contact local wildlife rescue organizations.,
Attend an exotic pet show.,
Search online for prairie dog breeders.,
Purchase from an exotic pet store.,
Look for reviews and references.",How to Buy Prairie Dogs1," Injured or orphaned prairie dogs are occasionally turned over to shelters by wildlife services. Shelters also occasionally have domesticated prairie dogs that are surrender by their owners for a variety of reasons. Go online to get contact information for the shelters in your area and give them a quick call.


If you adopt from a shelter you will generally have to agree to get your prairie dog spayed or neutered by a certain date, if it hasn’t been done already. You may need to pay an adoption fee.;
, Many areas with prairie dog populations also have wildlife organizations established to protect the area’s animals. These groups often maintain a rehabilitation center as part of their operations or they work cooperatively with local vets. The animals that they sell are often rehabbed after injury or abandonment.Many wildlife rescues, as well as animal shelters, now list their available animals online either on their main website or an adoption listing service. Adopt-A-Pet is a good site to see pics of rescued prairie dogs. You can search by location as well.Getting your dog via a rescue or a shelter is a humane option as it frees up more space for another animal to be taken in and cared for. Many of these organizations will also require that you surrender the prairie dog back to them if you change your mind.

, These shows are held all over the world and feature dealers who are selling (or simply showcasing) their exotic pet collections. To find a show near you go online and search your location and “exotic pet show.” However, be prepared to pay a premium for your dog as dealer often charge higher purchase prices.


Whether you buy from a dealer in person or online, make sure to ask about how they come upon the animals that they sell. Some prairie dogs are legally trapped while others are caught in less regulated ways and could have suffered as a result., There are a handful of breeders online who make a living raising and selling prairie dogs. You can find a listing by searching for “prairie dog breeders” online. Before you buy, carefully discuss the details of cost, care, and transport. Request to see photos of the particular dog that you are purchasing as well, which can help ensure that you receive a healthy animal.Make sure that you buy a young, hand-raised dog. It is best if you can have the dog in-hand before it is 10 weeks old as this is a critical bonding time for you both.
Breeding conditions are often a subject of some controversy. Check online or with animal rights organizations (such as the SPCA) to make sure that your breeder is not under investigation for animal cruelty. For example, one prairie dog breeder (U.S. Global Exotics) had animals seized due to inhumane treatment., These establishments often stock animals directly from breeders. Therefore, the best selection is to be found directly after breeding season in the spring. If you purchase a dog from a pet store you can expect to pay right around $150. Most stores offer some sort of guarantee for health as well.The price point is dependent on location too. In Japan a pair of healthy prairie dogs in their prime can sell for thousands of dollars., No matter which seller you choose, try to dig up some information on their past transactions. Talk to people who you know own prairie dogs and ask for seller references. Investigate your potential seller online to see if they have any negative reviews and why. This is particularly important as prairie dogs can have some serious health problems that are difficult to detect until post-purchase."

Buy a drop net.,
Clear all debris.,
Lay the net out flat.,
Place a post at each corner.,
Attach the net to the corner poles.,
Knot blasting caps into the rope.,
Run a coated, insulated power wire to the power source.,
Bait the area.,
Wait for a deer.,
Drop the net.,
Handle with extreme care.",How to Catch a Deer2," Different types of drop nets should be used for different animals. A drop net for a deer is commonly tested to 600 lbs. and made of knotted, twisted nylon. Another common feature of certain drop nets is a metal center ring that allows the net to be released and dropped down a center pole.


Depending on the type of drop net, the system may also require additional poles to tie off the corners, blasting caps to release the net, and lead-in wire to connect to the blasting caps.

, Before setting up a drop net, clear all of the debris from the site where the deer might harm itself. Items you should clear away include stumps, limbs, stones, etc.

, After clearing the site, lay the net out flat. Place each of the four corners in position, then stretch the net out tight.

, You will need four eight-foot tall posts, so that you can place one at each corner of the net. The posts should be a minimum of eight-feet tall to make sure that the antlers of a full-grown buck can pass beneath the net.


To help support each post, it helps to drive nearby stakes into the ground to attach a tie-down rope on each side of the post. If the posts are near trees, you can attach the tie-down rope to a tree as well.

, A drop net will have a cable thimble at each corner of the net. Feed rope through the thimble and tie off one end to the drop net. Pull the net taut and tie the other end of the rope to the first corner post. Repeat for all four posts.


You can use standard-sized ski rope at fifteen-foot lengths. Any extra give in the rope is perfect for knotting the blasting cap into the rope, which upon detonation will sever the rope and drop the net.
You can use a come-a-long or another ratcheting device to help take up any slack in the rope to make sure the drop net is tight.

, At about 6-8 inches away from the end of the net, knot a blasting cap into the ski rope. Repeat this step at all four corners.


Use electronic blasting caps with at least twelve-feet of wire lead to each cap. This will allow you to run the wire leads in series from one cap to the next, making it easy to blast each cap with a single power wire to the power source.

, Whether you have a detonator or a 12v battery (such as a car or truck battery), you will need to run a coated, insulated wire from each blasting cap to the spot from which you will wait and drop the net.


The easiest way is to run wire leads in series between the blasting caps, ending at the corner closest to your hiding spot. You can then run the final wire lead down and connect it to a single power wire that you can run all the way to your battery or detonator.

, Place bait toward the center of the drop net in order to attract the deer. The center of the net also means the net will has the maximum time to fall without the deer running out from under it. Shelled yellow corn is a recommended type of bait.


Pre-baiting the area for a week or two beforehand can make the area more attractive for deer as they will continue returning to the area for food instead of having to stumble upon your bait the first time you place it.

, Several professionals should be on site to help handle any deer, but only one person should wait in a blind to drop the net. Everyone else should wait away from the site in a car to avoid scaring the deer off by allowing to it see or hear more people than necessary.

, Once you have everything set and a deer has started feeding on the bait, you can use the detonator or the battery to detonate the blasting caps. This will sever the ski ropes, releasing the net from its attachment to the corner posts and dropping it down to catch the deer.


Wait until the deer has its head down while it feeds to reduce its reaction time and ensure the net has time to fall.

, Deer are powerful animals that can kick and gore with their horns as they try to escape. Research teams have proper staff on hand to tranquilize and sedate a deer before the team even attempts to handle the animal. The team will then typically blindfold the animal to keep it in a less frightened state during handling as well.


For purposes of ear-tagging or otherwise handling the deer, professionals quickly approach the deer, grasp the deer over the back in a bear hug, tackle the animal down to its side, and hold the front legs close to the body while avoiding the hind legs.This allows another team member to quickly tag the ear of the animal.
Wear protective coveralls as well as a helmet with a face mask to help avoid injury.In addition to the immediate physical threat, deer can carry ticks that spread Lyme disease as well as other disease risks for humans. Take every precaution when handling a live deer.

Purchase a Clover trap.,
Place and pre-bait the trap.,
Set the trap.,
Check the trap every day.,
Handle the deer with caution.",How to Catch a Deer3," A Clover trap is a netted trap that is large enough for a deer. The trap consists of a metal frame covered on all sides but the bottom with a linked netting. A trip wire runs parallel to the back wall that releases the front netting, allowing it to fall and trap the deer.You can purchase a Clover trap or make one on your own. Ensure that you use netting that won’t risk harming the deer as opposed to covering the frame with chain link or chicken wire., Before actually setting the trip wire, you should place the trap and pre-bait it.Place shelled yellow corn around the entrance and inside the trap for several days before setting it. This gives the deer time to find the bait and feel out the trap. Any deer will return to the trap for more food with less hesitance regarding entering the trap.

, When you notice that the bait you’ve been placing toward the back of the trap is getting eaten, then you’re ready to set the trap. Place more bait and set the trip wire connected to the net door of the trap. Place the bait beneath the trip wire at the back of the trap. This ensures that the deer will release the trap when it lowers its head to reach the bait., One of the greatest benefits of the Clover trap is that you don’t have to sit in a blind waiting to release it, but you still have an obligation to check the trap often. Even though the netting on the trap won’t harm the deer, it does leave the deer open to attack by predators, so you should check the trap at least once a day., You should hood the deer first before attempting to handle it because the animal will be more sedate when it can’t see the human presence.Researchers who handle deer inside Clover traps are trained professionals.It is not recommended that you try to handle the deer due to risk of injury to both yourself and the animal.


Most Clover trap designs are collapsible, making it easy to push the trap downward. This will force the animal to the ground without any room to kick, making it easier to hood and safely handle the deer.If a professional handler must actually enter the Clover trap with the deer, the professional will bring the deer down to its side with a bear hug maneuver from the deer’s back and pin the deer’s front legs to its body while avoiding the hind legs.Protective coveralls and a helmet with a face mask are highly recommended, as is leaving any direct deer handling to a trained professional."

Assess your ability to provide long-term care.,
Understand the potential behavioral dangers.,
Consider buying a pair.,
Be aware of the costs.",How to Buy Prairie Dogs2," Before you decide to share your life and time with a prairie dog, it is a good idea to research about them on the internet. Or, visit a pet store and talk with the employees. Make an appointment with an exotic pets vet and come with some questions to ask. You will find that prairie dogs can make great pets, but have particular requirements regarding their care.For example, you might ask the store employee, “How often are the prairie dogs purchased here returned for ill health or other problems?”

, In 2003 the CDC and FDA banned the sale and importation of prairie dogs due to concerns about the spread of Monkey Pox. This ban was lifted in 2008, but some sate and local restrictions remain. Contact the FDA and CDC for clarification regarding which exotic animal laws could impact your ownership., Your prairie dogs will require a sizeable cage (at least 2'x2'x4') as well as nesting materials. They will need you to supply a regular diet of vegetation and grain supplements. It is also best if you set-up a lamp to provide vitamin D. All of this takes effort in the immediate sense so you want to be prepared for the added responsibility., Prairie dogs typically live between 5-10 years. Therefore, your purchase should be seen as a lengthy commitment of care. Ask yourself if you can envision feeding and watching out for your dog years down the line., Prairie dogs are typically well-natured, if feisty, little creatures. However, they can cause a fair amount of pain and physical damage with their bite. Their front teeth are extraordinary sharp and can cut through even a thick pair of gloves. You’ll want to decide if you are comfortable working with these occasionally outbursts.Think about what you will do when bitten. Your immediate response may be to fling your hand, but you can kill your prairie dog in the process. It is better to carefully pry the dog’s jaws open.
Sexual maturity often triggers violent impulses in prairie dogs. Plan to spay or neuter your dog by 9 months to avoid these issues., Prairie dogs are very social animals and they yearn for the interaction provided by living in a group. You might want to buy two dogs at once to keep them in good spirits and create a more pleasant ownership experience. This is especially the case if you will not be able to provide consistent interaction throughout the day with your dog., As with any animal, the costs associated with care can quickly add up. The purchase itself will be around $150 and spaying or neutering can run between $50-200. Then you need to budget for the cage and materials purchase, food, vet treatment, possible medicines, treats, and toys. Make sure that you have the funds to sustain care into the long term as well."

Create a care schedule.,
Develop an “it isn’t working out” plan.",How to Buy Prairie Dogs3," Prairie dogs love to get into trouble and they also love to chew things. Make sure to hide all of your electrical cords. Put up any toxic chemicals. Ensure that the cage is not in an area that is heated by the sun and could cause burns., As you look for a seller, make sure to locate a veterinarian in your area as well. You will most likely need one that caters to exotic animals and perhaps they will have a specialty in prairie dogs or rodents in particular. If you wait until your dog needs to be treated, there could be a delay in care.an exotic animal veterinarian can also treat or monitor your prairie dog for some common concerns such as heart disease and obesity., Be prepared to spend at least one hour every day interacting and playing with your prairie dog. If you leave them in a cage you risk them becoming anti-social and depressed. You will need to spend at least double that amount of time in the first week or so as your dog adjusts to its new environment., Carefully consider the possibility that prairie dog ownership may not end up being for you. If this is the case, what will you do? Will you return the dog to the charity that you purchased it from?Be aware that you can’t simply turn your prairie dog loose in the wild. Domesticated dogs are ill equipped for surviving in the wild and will often perish if uncared for."

Find a 12 by 15 inch wooden board.,
Raise the board off the ground with 1-inch runners.,
Place the trap in a wet area in your yard.",How to Catch Snails1," You can make a simple snail trap with wooden boards that you buy new or repurpose wooden boards you have lying around for the trap. Look for wooden boards that are at least 12 by 15 inches (31 cm by 38 cm).If you have a lot of snails in your yard, you may go for larger wooden boards to catch more snails.;
, You will need 1-inch runners to raise the board off the ground slightly. This will make it easier for the snails to crawl underneath the board and get “trapped.”Make sure the board is evenly lifted off the ground with the runners. You may need to use one runner on each end or under all four sides of the board.
You can use 1-inch pieces of wood or stable objects that are at least 1-inch in height as runners, such as flat garden pots or pieces of plastic.

, You should position the wooden trap in areas in your yard where you notice there are a lot of snails. Snails often gravitate to wet or damp areas in the yard, such as by a wet garden or a water feature.You may create several traps and place them throughout your yard so you have a higher chance of catching as many snails as you can.

Get a deep plastic bowl or a plastic bottle.,
Fill the bowl with beer or a yeast solution.,
Place the trap in your yard.,
Replenish the trap every day.",How to Catch Snails2," You can make a trap to catch snails using a plastic bowl that has deep, vertical sides. The high sides will ensure the snails cannot crawl out once they have fallen into the trap.Alternatively, you can use a 1 liter plastic bottle to make the trap. Use scissors to cut off the top third section of the bottle, which contains the narrow opening. Invert the top section and insert it into the bottom section so the narrow opening is upside down, facing into the bottom section. You can then tape the two pieces together or piece holes in both pieces and secure them with wire.
The shape of the plastic bottle trap will ensure the snails cannot crawl out or escape once they fall into the trap.

, Snails are attracted to fermented yeast and will eagerly head for a bowl of beer. You can fill your trap halfway with fresh beer to attract snails and cause them to crawl into the trap. Fresh beer of any kind will work, though darker brews like Stout or Guinness may be more effective.If you do not have access to beer or do not want to waste good beer, you can create a yeast solution to put into the trap. Combine two cups of warm water with two tablespoons flour, one teaspoon sugar, and ½ teaspoon of yeast. Mix the solution well and add it to the trap until it is half full.

, Once you have added the beer or yeast solution to the trap, you should place the trap in your yard. You can bury the trap in a wet spot in your yard, making sure the rim of the trap is raised 1 inch (2-3 cm) above ground level. This will ensure you catch snails only, rather than other bugs in your yard.Beer traps are most effective at attracting snails within an area of only a few feet so you should choose a spot in your yard that is full of snails or a spot where you have seen snails hanging around before.
You may cover the trap partly with a stone or a small tarp that is raised just enough for the snail to crawl beneath and fall into the trap. This will prevent the trap from filling with water when it rains, as diluted beer or yeast is not as effective at catching snails.

, You will need to maintain the yeast trap by filling it with fresh beer or fresh yeast solution every day. The trap will not be as effective if the beer is old or diluted due to rain water.The liquid in the trap may also evaporate after a few days outside so you should try to top up the trap with fresh beer or yeast solution once a day.

Remove the snails from the trap.,
Keep live snails in an enclosure.,
Dispose of any dead snails.",How to Catch Snails3," If you are trying to keep the snails in your traps alive, you should remove them from the bottom of the wooden trap by hand. Hold the snails by the shell and gently pull them off the wooden trap so you do not come in contact with the slimy mucus on the snail. This will also ensure you are move the snails to a different area safely.Keep in mind if you use a beer trap, the snails will likely all be dead in the trap due to drowning. You may not want to use this trap if you would like to catch snails live.

, Garden snails can make great pets for kids, as they are quiet, low-maintenance, and they are not expensive to feed or maintain. You will need a glass or plastic enclosure that has deep walls and a lid to keep your pet snail.The snail may retract into its shell when you pick it up but if you place it in an enclosure that contains substrate and moss, it will often come out of its shell on its own.

, If you have any dead snails in your trap, you should dispose of them so the trap stays clean. You may scrape any dead snails off of your wooden trap with a shovel or a garden tool or crush any live snails with your foot. You should then set the trap back up so it can catch more snails.If you are using a trap made with yeast, you should fish out the snails and crush them. You should then replace the beer or yeast solution in the trap and set them up again so you can catch more snails.

Try to choose a sheltered area protected from wind and direct sun.
Choose a spot with sturdy ground rather than wet or marshy areas.;
, Foxes will dig down to try to get out of the fence so it must extend below the surface.


A concrete floor will work even better to keep the fox from digging under the fence, but it can be tough on the fox's paws. Make sure to cover a concrete floor in dirt or mulch.Another option is burying chain-link fencing under soil or mulch. This will keep the fox enclosed even if they dig down.

, The fenced enclosure needs to be covered to keep the fox from climbing out.

, A larger dog house will work well as a place for your fox to sleep and hang out. Fill it with blankets, hay or straw, or something else warm for it to sleep on.

, Foxes are very active and love to have toys to play with. Try out different toys and see which your fox likes best. Your fox might like:


Tunnels made for dogs
Balls
Dog or cat chew toys
Fabric toys
Even sticks make great toys!

, Make sure to use very heavy bowls. Because just like dogs, a fox can flip light bowls over for fun.

, Find a way to give your fox some shade. Secure a tarp over the top of the cage or include a sizeable covered area.

, Foxes can make a mess of your house so make sure to prepare as you would for a new puppy/dog or kitten/cat. You may wish to cover electrical cords, clean up the area, and try to minimize the number of places your fox could hide, such as behind sofas.


Some foxes can learn to live inside but a fox is still a wild animal so expect that it will be difficult to have a fox indoors.
Even foxes that live indoors most of the time will need an outdoor enclosure. Foxes love to run and play so they need outdoor space. It is generally not recommended to leave your fox at home unsupervised so you'll need an outdoor enclosure for when you go out.

, Foxes can sometimes be trained to use a litter box just like cats.


A covered litter box may work best, foxes love to dig.
Any size litter box intended for cats can work.
Sometimes foxes cannot be trained to use a litter box because they are wild animals. Consider this before choosing a fox for a pet.

, Use heavy bowls for food and water so that the fox does not flip them over.

, Acquire some toys for your fox to play with inside.

Even if your fox has outdoor toys you may want additional toys for inside so that dirty toys are not brought inside your home.

, Get a nice pet bed for your fox. Some foxes like to sleep in your bed with you, but others prefer their own bed. Foxes can behave a lot like cats in this area.

, Foxes shed in heavily summer months, so they need to be brushed regularly.

, Pet foxes are illegal in many places. Where they are allowed, foxes are considered exotic pets and may require a license. Make sure to obtain one before you purchase or adopt a fox.Check for state laws and local laws. Even if your state allows pet foxes your city may not.
Get information about state rules on this website.

, Locate a veterinarian in your area that is willing to treat a fox. Having a vet for your fox is a must. The fox will need vaccines, fixing, regular check-ups and period medical treatments just like your other pets.


Not all vets are qualified to care for a fox, and many are not willing to care for exotic animals. Make sure to find one who is.
Find a veterinarian before you obtain the fox. It can be very difficult to find a vet who is able and willing to work with animals that are not normally used for pets.
Annual appoints are best to keep track of health.
Keep track of all your fox's medical records, in case a problem occurs.

, Do not get a fox if you have other pets that are smaller than a fox. Foxes eat small animals in the wild so do not keep a fox around smaller animals especially birds or rodents.Never leave a fox alone with other animals., Foxes are omnivores, so they can eat a large variety of foods. Give them a high quality medium sized dog food and consult a vet about other food options.Fox diets can include meats and vegetables to supplement basic dog food. Check with your vet.
Leave out some dry dog food for the fox during the day. Try adding a can of wet cat food mixed with vegetables to the fox's diet once a day., Work with your vet to create a list of foods that you should not feed your fox. Never give foxes anything that can hurt a cat or dog. Some common foods that will harm a fox include:

Avocados
Caffeine
Chocolate
Grapes and raisins
Green eggplants
Peppers
Tomatoes
Green potatoes
Macadamia and Walnuts
Pits and seeds from apples, cherries, and peaches
Xylitol

, Always keep your fox on a leash or fenced in when outdoors. They will kill other animals even if they aren't hungry, including neighborhood pets. Give your fox a collar and tags so if it does get away it will not be mistaken for a wild fox.

, Foxes are very high energy animals, so they need a lot of exercise. About an hour or two a day will wear your pet down.

, Always use a harness for walks. The collar is for identification, but a leash should be attached to a harness because attaching it to a collar can choke the fox.

, Foxes, like dogs and cats, can have tooth decay, so brushing is a must. Every week or three days should be good, depending on your fox's diet.

Choose a snail tank.,
Line the tank with substrate.,
Add features to the tank.,
Create the right climate.",How to Care for Snails1," Snails need to live in a moist environment free of danger, and it's easiest to facilitate their needs by setting up a home for them in a glass or plastic container. The container you choose should be well-ventilated and escape proof. It should be large enough for the snails to live comfortably, and portable enough that it's easy to clean often. Consider these factors when you choose a container:


Snails need plenty of space to move around. A container the size of a small or medium fish tank will usually work. If you have more than one snail, or if you have Giant African Land snails, which are larger, consider getting a tank that's around 30 to 40 litres; be aware that this species can grow up to 20cm in length.






Snails can lift 3 times their own weight.This means the container you choose must have a lid that can be securely fastened, rather than weighted down.






Snails need plenty of ventilation. Don't choose a container that's airtight. If you use a plastic food storage-type container, poke plenty of small holes in the top. If you can, cover any holes with mosquito net, this helps to keep any pests such as fruit flies or earwigs out while keeping your snail safe and secure.






Snails need light. Don't use an opaque container. Find a clear plastic or glass container instead.






Snails can eat through cardboard. Don't choose a container made of materials that are easy for snails to chew up.






Make sure you don't leave the terrarium in direct sunlight as this can cause your snail to dry out.;
, Recreating the type of terrain that snails naturally live in is crucial to keeping them healthy and happy. Make sure the substrate is sterilized and pesticide free; digging up dirt from your yard won't work, since it may contain substances that could harm the snail. Here are a few different substrate choices:Loam. This is a loose substrate that retains moisture well but also drains efficiently. If you want to include live plants in your tank, make sure you choose a loam that is conducive to growing the plants you want to grow.






Humus. Also referred to as compost, this is a nutrient-rich substrate that provides nourishment to both the snail and live plants.






Peat. Snails like to live in peat, but it can also be a home to pests, so don't use it if you're worried about bugs living in the tank.






Potting soil. This is a cheap option that is ideal for snails to burrow in. Be sure to choose one that is labeled pesticide-free.






Coir. This is a cheap substrate that is a popular choice for snail tanks. It holds moisture well, but it is prone to harboring mites and insects.







, Snails like to crawl, explore and hide, so make them happy by including interesting objects for them to climb on. Avoid hard objects made from ceramic and heavy stone, since snails can slip on these and damage their shells. Choose some of the following options:


Wooden sticks and branches. Sticks made from durable wood are available for purchase at pet stores, since they're often used in aquariums for turtles, snakes and amphibians.






Cork bark. This is a soft substance with hollow areas that provide a great hiding place for snails.






Resin. This is a heavy yet soft material which is perfect to use as a food or water tray. If a snail falls on this material they won't damage their shells and they can't overturn the dish either.
Plants. Choose live plants that do well in the same climate snails thrive in. You could also choose plastic plants, which are easier to keep clean.







, In addition to having a tank that's well ventilated, snails also need a warm, moist environment. They do best at temperatures between 19-25°C (66-77 °F), but they are usually fine at temperatures that are slightly higher or lower. The substrate at the bottom of the tank must be kept moist at all times.


If you're concerned that your snail might get too cold in a certain room, consider buying a small heating pad. It should only cover about 2/3 of the floor of the tank, so the snail is able to move away if it gets too hot.
Keep the substrate moist by spritzing it (and the snail) with water every day. Use purified, spring or distilled water to ensure the snail stays healthy. If you aren't able to obtain these, leave normal tap water in the sun for 48 hours; this breaks down Chlorine, ensuring your snails safety.

Give the snail calcium.,
Provide snail food.,
Provide a water dish.",How to Care for Snails2," Snails need plenty of calcium to keep their shells strong and healthy. You should provide a source of calcium in the tank at all times. Cuttlefish bones are available for purchase at pet stores, but you could also use egg shells. The snails will run their bodies over the calcium source and wear it away over time.

, Snails eat a great variety of different foods, many of which you might have in your refrigerator or pantry to feed your family. Place some food in the snail's tank every day. You can use a small food dish to keep the food separate from the substrate. If you notice the food there a few days later, remove it, since letting food rot in the tank will cause mold to grow and attract insects. Keep these tips in mind when it comes to feeding your snail:


You can buy a snail food mix or turtle food to feed your snails. Fresh food contains more nutrients and is healthier, but it's good to have dry food on hand in case of an emergency.






Feed snails fruits and vegetables. Snails will eat most any type of produce. If they don't like something, they simply won't eat it, so experiment with different fruits and vegetables until you find a combination your snail likes. Try berries, squash, lettuce, cabbage, apples, pears, broccoli, beans, cucumbers, kale, and all kinds of other fruits and vegetables.






Feed snails small quantities of crushed seeds. Oats may also be fed to snails after soaking. You can also feed snails small quantities of milk powder, raw meat and crushed dog bones.
Snails also enjoy bloodworm as an occasional treat, remember snails are omnivores and also indulge in raw meats on occasion. Make sure the meat dosen't contain salt.
Avoid foods that are dangerous for snails to eat. Rice, millet, pasta, and other starchy foods can cause the snails to get bloated and die. Avoid foods that contain salt. Finally, don't feed snails food that has been treated with pesticides or other chemicals.







, This isn't mandatory, since snails get the moisture they need from the substrate, but snails like to drink water and bathe every now and then. Choose a very shallow water dish that will allow the snails to easily climb in and out. If you use one that's too deep, the snails may drown.

"
"
Change the substrate often.,
Clean the tank every few weeks.,
Bathe the snails.",How to Care for Snails3," Once a week should be sufficient, but change it more often if it looks dirty before then. Change the substrate right away if it gets completely soaked or if it seems to be harboring mites.

, Wash the tank with hot water and a sterilizing solution, then rinse it carefully again to remove all traces of the chemicals. It's important to wash the tank fairly frequently so that mold doesn't grow in the tank and harm the snails.


While you're washing the tank, keep the snails safe in a plastic container with a lid; make sure it has plenty of holes in the top for ventilation.
Wash the decorations and food and water dishes as well. If certain decorations seem to have degraded over time, replace them.

, It's a good idea to bathe the snails every so often to prevent disease and pests from taking over. Set the snail in a shallow dish of room temperature water, then pour more water gently over the snail's body. Use a soft-bristled toothbrush to gently clean the shell; don't scrub too hard or you may damage it, and don't use soap.Never use cleaning fluids to clean the snail or its shell. These are extremely harmful and could lead to the snail's death.






You can rub a bit of sesame oil over the shell to give it some shine.

Find the right container.,
Provide substrate.,
Invest in aquarium supplies.,
Clean the aquarium regularly.",How to Care for Slugs1," Slugs generally do well in aquariums. An aquarium should be at least 20 centimeters by 20 centimeters (8 by 8 inches). You can buy an aquarium online or at a pet store.Make sure to provide proper ventilation. The lid should have holes for ventilation. Something like a mesh lid, for example, would work well.
Slugs are very small, especially in comparison to reptiles that are usually kept in aquariums. Examine ventilation holes carefully and make sure a slug cannot creep out of these holes.;
, It's best to use soil, grass, and leaves from outdoors for substrate. If you took the slug from outdoors, use soil, leaves, and grass from the area where you found it. Make sure to sift through soil before adding it to your aquarium to remove any bugs.Once a week, remove your slug and put it in a safe container with air holes. Remove the substrate and then replace it.

, Slugs may benefit from certain aquarium supplies such as fake plants and leaves. You can also bring in real material from outside, such as twigs, for slugs to climb on.If you bring anything in from outside, make sure to inspect it carefully before putting it in your slug's tank.

, Once every three months, clean the slug's enclosure when you remove and replace the substrate. You can rinse things like twigs and aquarium supplies in water and then let them air dry outside. If twigs get soggy or soft in response to water, replace them with new twigs.Slugs are very sensitive to chemicals. You should refrain from washing anything with soap. You should only use water to rinse cage supplies.
Slugs are sensitive to tap water, so opt for distilled water.

"
"
Provide rinsed fruits and vegetables.,
Add plants and leaves for food.,
Remove uneaten food every day.,
Use a spray bottle, not a water dish.",How to Care for Slugs2," Slugs feed off of plants. You can give them leftover fruits and vegetables from your kitchen. You can also give them fresh fruits and vegetables, as long as you rinse them in distilled water first. It's important to remove pesticides before feeding plants to your slugs.If possible, opt for organic fruits that do not make use of pesticides.
In general, feed your slugs more vegetables than fruits. Slugs can die from consuming too much sugar, even natural sugar from fruits.

, Slugs also feed off of plants they find outside. Add things like old leaves, grass, and other plants you find outside. Slugs feed on decaying plant matter, so if you have a plant that's dying you can feed it to your slug., Slugs may not eat everything you leave for them. Uneaten food, especially fruit, can attract fruit flies. Fruit flies can threaten a slug's heath, so remove uneaten food at the end of each day. This will minimize exposure to bugs and keep your slugs safe., Slugs do not need a separate water dish, just a moist environment. You should therefore spray the enclosure with a water bottle each day. You should use filtered water, as tap water can be harmful for slugs. It's important to keep a slug's environment moist so they can absorb the water they need."
"
Do not use certain sprays around your slug.,
Avoid handling your slug.,
Spritz the aquarium with distilled water regularly.",How to Care for Slugs3," Slugs are very sensitive to chemicals and absorb sprays through their skin. Do not use hairspray or aerosol sprays in the same room where you keep your slugs. This can cause them to die., Slugs should not be handled too often. Only handle them when you need to remove them from the tank for cleaning. Slugs dislike being handled and chemicals on your hands from things like lotions and soaps can be harmful to slugs., Slugs need a moist environment to thrive. Each day, spritz the inside of your slug's cage with a water bottle filled with distilled after. Slugs may die if an environment is not adequately moist.It's very important to use distilled water. The chemicals found in tap water can kill slugs.

Determine whether your climate is suitable for raising snails outdoors.,
Fence in an area based on how many snails you are planning to house.,
Decide whether you want a roof or not.,
Fill the enclosure with appropriate soil.,
Plant vegetation in the pen.,
Add a small container for water.,
Choose your structure.,
Put holes in the lid of your container.,
Place your structure on legs.,
Furnish your snail house.,
Supply your snails with food.,
Provide a shallow container of water.,
Determine whether you need to create a semi-intensive system.,
Ensure that your snail house is large enough.,
Replace the compost.,
Keep plenty of fresh water in the enclosure.",How to Build a Snail House," Most snails prefer warmth and humidity - about 25-30 degrees C (or 77-86 degrees F) and 80-95% humidity. Research the breed of snail you are planning to raise to determine whether an extensive system is an option for you or not. Also consider wind as a factor in snail growth. Wind causes snails to dry out, so you should situate your snailery in a sheltered location if possible.;
, Fine chicken wire mesh works well, because snails don’t like to crawl on it. Concrete blocks and bricks are also a good option.Dig the fence in at least 20 cm to prevent snails from burrowing under and escaping.
It only needs to be a few inches tall if there’s no roof. If there is a roof, you’ll need to build the pen at least as tall as the potential height of the largest plants in the enclosure.

, A roof can offer shade and protection from the elements, but it’s an expensive option. If you have constructed your snailery out of a material that snails can climb, a roof is necessary to keep them in. Fine wire mesh is a good option for a roof. You can cover it with thin cloth for added protection.
If you do add a roof, you will need a way to access your snails. If you are using wire mesh, attach the roof with twists of wire so that you can loosen them and get into the pen whenever you need to.

, Be sure that the soil is very loose. Snails lay their eggs in the soil, so it’s important for them to be able to dig into it easily. Avoid


very sandy soil (it doesn’t hold water well)
heavy, clay-like soil
highly acidic soil (it can damage their shells)

, Shrubs and small trees will offer food and shelter. Plants that work particularly well are sweet potatoes, pumpkins, and leafy vegetables. You might also consider planting small trees outside of the enclosure as well. This will help protect them from wind, sun, and rain. , Let it collect rainwater, since tap water often contains chemicals such as chlorine, which isn't good for snails. Use something shallow (like a jar lid) so that your snails don’t topple in and drown. If the water starts to look particularly dirty or full of refuse, replace it., Snails can eat their way out of cardboard and they tend to be escape artists, so you will need something sturdy. Wooden boxes work well. Be sure that they are made of decay and termite resistant material.
Discarded oil drums are a cheap and workable option as well.
Glass or plastic containers work too. If you’re working with just a few snails, a plastic tupperware container would work. For a few more, consider an aquarium.

, Snails houses need ventilation so that your little friends can breathe. If you are hatching baby snails, consider a wire mesh top so that they can’t escape. If you are fattening up fully grown snails, you can bore holes in the lid of your container as long as they are smaller than your snails. , It’s a good idea to bring the structure up to waist-height so that it’s easy to work in. If you’re planning to keep the snail house outside, legs will help keep predators out as well. You can use concrete blocks stacked on top of each other for easy legs.You should also place the snailery away from very direct, hot sunlight so that they can easily stay moist. Don’t put them under a vent, because this can cause them to dry out.

, Put at least 2 inches of potting compost in the bottom of the container. Give the little critters a shelter, such as tupperware container tipped on its side or a half-buried terracotta pot. Don’t use soil directly from your garden, because it could contain other organisms as well.

, Assuming you haven’t planted anything in your container, an intensive system will require you to regularly provide food for your snails. You can give them weeds, vegetable peelings, and pieces of fruit. Avoid plants with hairy leaves and anything that produces poisons. If any food goes uneaten and starts to rot, remove it from the container.
Good fruits for snails include mangos, bananas, pears, eggplant, figs, tomatoes, and cucumbers.
Snails need protein, which they can get from sweet potatoes and plantains.
Household leftovers such as rice and beans are fine, but be sure that they do not contain salt. , The lids of jars or plastic containers work well. Tap water often contains chlorine, which isn’t good for snails. Give them rain water or water from a bottle. , If you already have an extensive system, and it’s time for your snails to breed, you may find that you need to add an intensive element for hatching and rearing young snails. If you already have an intensive system housing eggs and baby snails, you may discover that you need to add an extensive component as your snails get larger and need more space.

, Add to it as your snail population increases. Overcrowding can cause snail growth to lag and can encourage the spread of disease among your snail population. Typically, you want about 1 square meter for every 100 hatchlings and about 1 square meter for every 7-10 adult snails. , About once every two weeks, take the snails out and replace the old compost with fresh. Be sure to also remove any pieces of rotten food at this time. You will need to do this with both extensive and intensive systems. Be careful of moving baby snails. Adult snail shells are hard enough that you can pick them up, but try to move baby snails by nudging them onto a stiff piece of paper and transferring them gently.

, Use shallow dishes such as jar lids or yogurt container tops to prevent snails from falling into the water. If the water starts to look dirty or gets a lot of food or droppings in it, replace it immediately.

Choose a tank.,
Choose a substrate.,
Add decorations.,
Provide some plants.,
Choose a filter for your tank.",How to Care for Mystery Snails1," Select a sturdy tank with a cover for your snails (as they are known to escape). Keep in mind how many snails you will be keeping (and whether or not you will be breeding your snails). This will help you determine what size tank you need.Here are some guidelines:

1-2 snails require a minimum tank size of 5L (1.8 Gallons)
3-5 snails require a minimum tank size of 10L (2.2 Gallons)
6-9 snails require a minimum tank size of 20L (4.4 Gallons)
10-19 snails require a minimum tank size of 37L (8.1 Gallons)
20-50 snails require a minimum tank size of 100L (22 Gallons)
If you plan on breeding, consider buying a tank of 150L (40 Gallons) or more.;
, Snails generally prefer pebbles and gravel, rather than sand. Select a gravel substrate that is nice and smooth, with no sharp edges. Cover the bottom of your tank with this material, no more 5-8 cm (1.9-3.14 inches) thick.Stay clear of painted stones. Often these are coated in harmful paints that will start to flake after only a few months.
Avoid choosing red or orange natural stones, as they may contain copper which is toxic to snails.
Always rinse new gravel/pebbles before adding them to the tank.

, Select some aquarium decorations for your snails' tank. Keep in mind that your snails like to hide, so make sure they can't get stuck. Use only decorations that intended for aquarium use, and do not contain metals.Always rinse your new decorations in water before adding them to the aquarium.

, Select some aquatic plants to include in your snail tank. The more plants the better! Plants oxygenate the water and make use of snail waste.There is nothing wrong with your snails eating your aquatic plants, it's natural and it makes them happy.Some good aquatic plants to choose from include:

Elodea
Wisteria
Hornwort
Java Moss
Java Fern
Hairgrass
Duckweed
Hygrophilia

, You can choose from internal, hang-on, or canister filters. (All are work well, but internal filters are less expensive). You will also select the right size filter, based on the size of your tank.You may want to invest in an under-gravel filter. This creates a natural bio-filter and keeps your water clear.
Purchase an air pump for your under-gravel filter along with air stones.

"
"
Use any container with air holes for short term projects.,
Get a larger tank or terrarium for long term pets.,
Make sure air can enter the terrarium.,
Keep the tank room temperature.,
Purchase terrarium soil or earth from outside.,
Add a layer of natural material on top of the soil.,
Decorate your snail's home.,
Attach a heavy or fastened lid.,
Find snails to put in your container.",How to Care for Garden Snails1," If you would like to watch the snail for a couple days, then release it back into your garden, it doesn't matter too much which container you use, as long as the snail has access to air. A plastic container or jar with a few holes punched in the lid will work. Or instead of a lid, you could use a piece of cheesecloth fitted over the rim of the container with an elastic band.


Keep in mind that snails can climb vertical surfaces, and may escape if the container does not have a lid.;
, If you're keeping the snail for more than a few days, use a container that provides enough space for its size. Only baby snails or the smallest adult varieties can be kept long term in a plastic container.Most require a larger tank to stay clean and healthy. You can purchase a terrarium at a pet store made for this purpose.


Use a 5 gallon (19 L) tank or larger so the snail has room to move around. If you have several snails or intend to take care of young snails if the adult ones reproduce, get a larger tank.

, Just like humans, snails inhale air to use the oxygen, and exhale carbon dioxide. Your terrarium needs holes to let air in, ideally on multiple sides to allow for better air circulation. Some people have reported snails becoming more active when air was allowed to exit through a tiny gap in the bottom of the terrarium., As long as the tank is kept moist, many garden snails will be fairly resilient when it comes to temperatures. However, they will be most active and safe at room temperature. Keep them in the shade during hot weather, and avoid exposing them to freezing temperatures.

, To reduce the chance of harmful bacteria, pesticides, and other dangers, purchase terrarium soil from a pet shop.The next best option is to use natural earth from a garden not treated with pesticides or chemical fertilizers. Put the soil in a layer at the base of the terrarium, fully covering the glass or plastic.


Avoid potting soil for plants, which can contain chemicals harmful to snails.

, Place a layer of sphagnum moss, peat, compost, or vermiculite on top of the soil.This traps moisture inside the soil, which creates good conditions for snails.

, Put objects in the tank that the snails can hide in and climb onto, which will make them more comfortable and more interesting to watch. At most pet stores they have fake logs for small animals to crawl through or short hamster tubes that snails might enjoy. You might find material you can use in your garden as well! Never use rocks in your terrarium as snails could fall off the sides of the glass and break their shell. Bark and sticks usually fall apart after a few weeks, so you will need to replace them.


Cardboard toilet paper tubes also make great climbing objects.

, Snails are surprisingly strong for their size, and are able to climb to the top of almost any tank. A lid that can fasten closed with a latch will probably prevent them from escaping. If your terrarium's lid does not have a latch, weigh down the lid with a pile of books or other heavy objects.

, Look for snails in muddy garden areas, old plant pots, or other moist places. If you can't see any, place a few pieces of fresh vegetables in your garden and check back later to see if there are snails eating them. Heavy rain often drives snails out into the open, so you'll have a better chance of success if you look during or following a rainstorm.


Garden snails are almost always safe to handle, but it's a good idea to wash your hands before and after touching them to minimize the chance of harm to your or your snail.If you do not want to touch the snails, wear gloves.

Choose a spot for your tank.,
Fill you tank with water.,
Add your substrate and decorations.,
Turn on your filter.,
Wait two weeks.,
Check your water conditions.,
Put your snails in their new home.",How to Care for Mystery Snails2," Find a nice well lit area where the floor is nice and stable. Don't forget to put some foam or yoga mat under the glass tank to help distribute the weight evenly., Begin filling your tank with clean, fresh water. You'll want the water be approximately 24-30 degrees Celsius (75-86 Fahrenheit). The quality of your water will determine what additive you might need (such as bio-starters, beneficial bacteria, chlorine/heavy metal removers). Alternatively, you can purchase tank water for many pet stores., While your tank is filling up, thoroughly wash your gravel and decorations with clean water, and leave them out to dry. When the tank is half full add your substrate, decorations, and plants., Affix the filter you have chosen to your tank and turn it on. Various types of filters will have different directions. Simply follow the instructions included with your fish tank filter.If you will also be using an under-gravel filter, you'll need to turn on your air stones.

, Once your tank is set up and your filter is running, you must wait and let the water cycle. It is important to let the tank cycle for about 2 weeks before adding your snails. Keep this in mind before purchasing snails., In order to keep your snails healthy, your take must have a certain a PH range and ammonia/nitrite level. You tank must also stay between certain temperatures. Test the water before adding your snails, and continue to test it each week.To test PH use a liquid pH test kit. (test strips are not as reliable.) Follow the instructions on kit to test the water. Snails like Alkaline water between 7-8. You can alter the PH of your tank by adding certain plants, or using a PH regulator.
To test ammonia/nitrate levels use a ammonia/nitrate test kit. You want ammonia/nitrate levels of 0, or as close as possible. You can bring down this level by adding clean water. Replace 25% of the water in your tank every week.
Keep your water temperature between 24-30 degrees Celsius (75-86 Fahrenheit). If you keep your home between these temperatures, your fish tank should be OK. Just be sure to monitor the temp.

, After you have allowed the water to cycle for two weeks, and once you have verified a safe PH level, ammonia/nitrite level, and temperature, you can introduce your snails to their new home. Gently add them to the tank by picking them up out of the bag (from the pet store) and placing them right side up in the aquarium.

"
"
Wait eight hours.,
Provide home-cooked veggies.,
Add calcium to your water.",How to Care for Mystery Snails3," After you've introduced your snails to the tank, wait around eight hours before feeding them. This allows them a chance to let them get used to their new environment., In order to feed your snails, prepare a mix of blanched vegetables. Blanching involves placing vegetables into boiling water and quickly removing it. Snails especially enjoy shelled peas, carrot, cucumber, broccoli, cauliflower, zucchini and iceberg lettuce. Allow vegetables to cool completely, then add them to your tank.Start by adding a small amount of blanched veggies each morning, and gauge how quickly your snails can finish them. Add a bit more or less until you can see that all food is being consumed within 12 hours.
Remove whatever isn't eaten from the tank within 12 hours.

, Mystery snails need some additional calcium added their water. Add rinsed sea shells, cuttlebone, and/or shell grit to your snails' tank in order to increase the calcium content.Try to add a calcium source one per week.
These items can purchased at most pet stores or online.

"
Keep the tank moist with a spray bottle.,
Lightly spray the snails with water.,
Feed your snails clean food daily.,
Learn which foods might harm your snails.,
Give them a material they can use to build their shells.,
Keep your snails clean.,
Clean their tank every month or whenever it gets dirty.",How to Care for Garden Snails2," Spray water on the moss, peat, or other material you've placed at the base of your tank whenever it starts to dry out. Keep this material moist at all times.If you can't spray every other day at least, you could leave an ice cube in the tank, or a rag or sponge soaked with water.

, The snails may stay healthier if you spray them with water every day or two, but pay attention to water temperature. Spray with warm water in cold weather, and use room temperature water during hot weather or if you have central heating., Most snails are not picky eaters, and will enjoy most types of fresh fruit and vegetable. Wash all food thoroughly in clean water before you give it to them, and cut large vegetables into chunks or slices.Some foods, such as carrots and potatoes, may need to be boiled for a few minutes to soften them slightly. Always let cooked food cool completely before giving it to your snails.


Some snails may eat raw meat, raw eggs, brown bread, or (soaked, but uncooked) oatmeal. Experiment to give your snails a varied diet to increase the chance that they are receiving all the nutrition they need., Not much research has been done on the best nutritious diet for snails, and there is disagreement among snail owners about which foods may or may not harm the snails. Here are a list of food ranging from the most to least dangerous:Salty foods could kill your snails. Avoid anything with salt crystals on it entirely.
Avoid pasta, rice, and millet. These starchy foods can potentially cause blockage in the snail's digestive system. Do not feed them to your snails.
Homegrown plants may be exposed to car exhaust while growing, which could cause harm.
Acidic foods such as citrus fruit, tomatoes, and kiwi fruit may or may not harm snails. Use them in small quantities along with other foods.

, You can use any source of calcium as long as it is clean and washed. Egg shells or discarded snail shells in your garden will work for the average pet owner. If you are trying to breed snails you may wish to buy more concentrated calcium sources from a pet store, such as cuttlefish bones or pure calcium supplements.Have a source of calcium available in the tank at all times. Replace it whenever it runs out, but use calcium supplements with greater than 20% calcium sparingly., Clean a snail with a toothbrush whenever their shells get dirty. Do not use soap and brush gently to avoid damaging the shell. Pour a few drops of water onto the shell to help remove stuck-on soil.

, Pick up the snails gently by coaxing your finger underneath their head, then place them on a towel in a temporary container. Remove the old soil to discard in the garden. Use a wet, slightly soapy sponge to scrub the walls and base of the tank to get rid of snail slime marks and scum. Rinse the tank carefully to make sure every trace of soap is gone, as it could harm the snails.


Don't leave the snails untended if the container is small.
Do not shut the snails in a container without air.
When replacing the soil and other materials in the clean tank, follow all of the steps described under Making a Snail Home

"
"
Keep your snail in a well-ventilated glass or plastic tank.,
'Fit a heat mat with a thermostat and thermometer at the back of the tank to check the temperature is kept at about 25ºC / 77ºF.',
Line the floor with a thick layer of substrate.,
Spray the tank every other day with warm water to maintain the level of humidity at 60-70%.,
Handle with care.Snails should be picked up gently by their shells.,
Feed your giant snail leafy greens every day such as lettuce, cabbage and spinach.,
Clean the tank of snail trails and change the substrate every week.,
Keep your snail healthy.,Make sure they have a cuttle fish bone to give them calcimine to help develop their shells.",How to Care for Giant African Land Snails," Ensure that it has a secure lid. One snail needs a tank about 40 centimeter (15.7 in) by 25 centimeter (9.8 in) by 25 centimeter (9.8 in) / 16"" x 10"" x 10"".;
, Placing the heat mat is optional though.


Place a thermostat sensor over the heat source.

, Use plain topsoil from a garden centre rather than compost which can contain added fertilizers harmful to snails, and avoid coir or bark which can hold mould. Do not use topsoil you have collected yourself as this can be contaminated with pesticides and fertilizers, as well as a range of bacteria and pathogens.

, This can be checked with a hygrometer.

, It is best to pick them off the floor rather than when they are stuck tightly to the glass.
Snails don't mind being handled but make sure your hands are clean and damp, as sweat or chemicals are easily absorbed by your snail, and can be harmful.

, All vegetables should be washed to remove all traces of chemicals. Remove any food that hasn't been eaten within a day.


Snails need calcium. Provide a cuttlefish bone for an easy source of calcium for the snail.
They will need a shallow bowl of fresh water, but can drown if it is deeper than a few millimeters.

, Wash the tank only with warm water as detergents may be harmful.

, Your snail should have few health problems if kept in the right conditions. It is critical that it is not exposed to any chemicals around the home. If the environment is too hot, cold or dry, your snail will hide and become inactive, and a membrane may form over the aperture of the shell. A healthy snail has a clean, unbroken shell, and no unusual lumps or patches on its body.

Make sure you are ready to care for the baby snails.,
Be informed about mating.,
Look out for eggs.,
Make sure the condition of your snail's home is in good shape.,
Take care of their basic needs.,
Make sure they have some foliage to frolic in.,
Be patient.,
Watch the eggs hatch.,
Make sure to add a fresh food and water source.",How to Breed a Pet Snail," This includes getting a new terrarium (at least 15 litres), and being ready to provide extra attention and a little more time to the task.;
, Most snails are hermaphrodites meaning they have both male and female sex organs. After laying a clutch of eggs, snails are generally ready to reproduce again in six weeks throughout the year. Snails lay between 30 to 140 eggs at a time; that's nearly 480 snails a year!

The mating of two snails is possible but extremely painful for both snails, so it's not necessarily encouraged. For two snails to mate, one snail aggressively fights the other looking for attention harming both snails in the process. Eventually the pursued snail will give in and involuntarily receive a 'love dart' full of sperm. You might see a little white dagger-like thing sticking out of the snails body. Do not attempt to remove this as it could harm the snail even more. The love dart is the equivalent of having a thumb-sized needle in your stomach.
To prevent mating, keep an eye out. You might see a snail with it's male genitalia out (penis). This is identifiable by the long white stick-like thing close to the shell. Move the snail to a different terrarium until it has fully retracted; this could take a few hours, in some cases up to a day.

, If your snails have already laid eggs and you want to dispose of them, freeze them for 24 hours; then throw them in the trash., The soil must be at least 2 inches (5.1 cm) deep and must be quite moist. Make sure you purchase soil from your local store, just make sure there are no pesticides or fertilizer in the soil as it could harm your snail. Never use soil from your garden as it could contain pests or parasites that could harm (or kill!) your snail.


Snails need air! They're not that different from you and me. If you put them in a plastic container, make sure you pop some holes in the top. Keep the temperature moderate and comfortable too.

, This doesn't include singing to them, because they don't have ears. But they do have eyes and a mouth -- so make sure to provide the right lighting and food necessary for their growth and success. Check on them regularly. Snails are omnivores, which means they eat vegetation and animals. Some good sources of food are: Apples, Apricot, Banana, Black Berry, Grapes, Kiwi, Mango, Melon, Nectarines, Orange, Papaya, Prickly pear, Peach, Pear, Plum, Raspberry, Strawberry, Tomato, Lettuce, Broccoli, Spinach, Cabbage, Cucumber, Green beans, Mushrooms, Peas, Potato, Sprouts, Sweet corn, Turnip, Watercress, and non-seasoned, raw meat. Don't forget the water!
Most snails are nocturnal. If you turn on the interrogation lights at night, they'll immediately go to hide in their shells. If you're looking for a good show, they'll be the most entertaining in early evening, at night, and in the wee hours of the morning. Sprinkle them with water if you want to excite them a bit!, Don't worry; they use their feelers to sense obstacles (lacking the sight to do so). Get a couple of leaves and sticks in the cage and make sure you spray it with a water sprayer at least once a day. Add a layer of sphagnum moss or leaves, remember to wet all of it. If your snails aren't already in their home, place them in now.


They love damp and dark. You may miss the act of their breeding unless you take up nocturnal habits yourself. Unfortunately, there is not much more you can do other than creating a hospitable environment.

, You must now wait until the two snails have 'mated' or impregnated themselves. When they have, it takes a week or two for them to lay. It can take 1 to 4 weeks for the eggs themselves to hatch depending on the species. Some snails lay them all at once while others spread them around.

, This all depends on the species of your snail and the species you bred it with. It could be a very slow or very fast process -- wait and see!


The eggs will start to hatch in 1 to 4 weeks onward in some species but it is genes and possibly species dependent, with additional factors of how long they have been stored internally and the ambient and soil temperature. Eggs do not necessarily hatch uniformly and this is more noticeable in species that have a long gestation period (perhaps 4 weeks). The first (usually an uppermost member) to hatch can be 10 days or more in front of the main group, with some taking noticeably longer., Add calcium to help your snails grow strong shells, too. they love to play. Pick them up and let them crawl on your hand, but be careful; you may crack their shell. Don't pick small ones up, because their shell is very weak. With the adults, do not ever pick them up by their shell.

Write your and the agent’s addresses at the top of the page.,
Keep the whole thing short.,
Type your letter in a regular font with basic formatting.,
Follow the formula.,
Greet the agent by name.,
Personalize the letter.,
Create your hook.,
Provide a summary of your book.,
Tell the agent about yourself.,
Thank the agent for his or her time.,
Bid farewell and sign off.,
Edit!,
Follow submission guidelines provided by the agent.,
Include a self-addressed, stamped envelope.,
Follow up.",How to Write a Query Letter," At the very top of the page, write out your first and last name, followed by your address on the next two lines, followed by your phone number on the next line, and finally your email address below that.Leave one space, and then write out the agent’s name, the name of the publishing company or agency, the address, and contact information below your address.;
, Agents are busy people, and if your query letter is too long and too wordy, there's a good chance it’ll just get thrown out. Moreover, the agent may just skim your letter, and you want that person to still get the gist of the story.


Keep the query letter to one page, and use short, succinct sentences and short paragraphs.
The entire body of the query letter shouldn’t be longer than five paragraphs., Query letters are professional business letters, and business letter best practices dictate using basic formatting only. This includes using:12-point font
Single spacing
Left-margin alignment for the entire letter
Times New Roman or Arial font
A single line of spacing between new elements and paragraphs

, Query letters have a basic formula that you should follow closely. This will ensure that you include all the relevant information, and increase the chances that your letter will be read. Along with contact information, a query letter will include:Line one: the greeting
Paragraph one: the personalization, or introduction, and the hook
Paragraph two: the synopsis of your story
Paragraph three: a short bio about you
Paragraph four: your closing
A farewell (on a separate line)
Your signature

, A personalized query letter is the only way to grab the attention of a publisher or agent right away, and it demonstrates that you're diligent, careful, and that you’ve chosen that agent for a reason. Moreover, make sure that the agent you're sending your letter to actually deals with your genre of work.For example, if you’ve written a children’s book, seek out agents who represent children’s authors.
The best formats for addressing your letter are Attn. Ms./Mr. Smith: or Dear Sam Smith:

Do not address a query letter to To Whom It May Concern, as this will more than likely never get read.
If you cannot find the name of the agent or publisher online, call and ask to whom you should address your query.

, The first paragraph is an introduction between you and the agent, and this is where you explain to the agent why you have chosen that person specifically for representation. This could be because you’ve met, or have something in common, or any other reason that can link you to the agent.Start by explaining any sort of relationship you have with the agent. This could include a mutual friend, a time when you two met, a conference you attended together, a lecture you heard that the agent gave, or any other connection you may have.
If you don’t know any mutual people and have never met the agent, mention the name of a similar author the agent has represented.
Once you've made your introductions, talk about your book. Be sure to mention the title, the word count, and what genre it falls into.
Lastly, if your manuscript has been professionally edited, say so. This demonstrates that you're serious about your work.

, This comes in the second paragraph, and the job of the hook is to get the agent interested in your work. The hook is a concise but engaging sentence that sums up who the protagonist is, what he or she is trying to achieve, and what struggles are encountered along the way.


Don’t give away the ending. Instead, leave the end of the story a mystery or cliff hanger, so that the agent will want to keep reading on to the summary.
For example, if the book you were pitching was Romeo and Juliet, you would mention that the two protagonists are star-crossed young lovers who must defy the wishes of their respective families and risk everything in order to be together.

, After the hook, use the next paragraph to provide a slightly more in-depth summary of the story. The important thing here is to write a compelling synopsis that will leave the agent wanting more.Include information about the important characters involved.
Explain when, where, and why the story takes place.
Demonstrate who the characters are, rather than just describing them.

, In the next paragraph, provide a brief biography about yourself. This should include writing credits, awards, writing experience, previously published material (include the name of the publications), and any personal experiences that make you the perfect author for your story.Make sure your bio is no longer than two sentences. It should only include information that’s relevant to your story, that demonstrates your credibility as a writer, and that shows why you're an authority on that particular topic.

, The final paragraph of your query will be the closing, where you thank the agent for reading your letter. Do this simply and quickly, by saying something like thank you kindly for your time.In the closing, you should also mention what, if any, other material you’ve included along with the query. The information you should include will be laid out in the submission guidelines provided by the publisher or agency.
With works of fiction, mention that the entire work is available to read (as long as you have completed the manuscript).
At this time, you should also mention that you're prepared to send additional information at the agent’s request.

, Use appropriate business farewells when signing off your query letter, such as sincerely, or yours truly. Leave a couple spaces for your written signature, and then type out your full name to end the letter.

, While including all the relevant information and following the query letter formula is important, editing your letter is just as vital. Errors in your query could cause an agent or publisher to immediately throw out your query. After all, if there are errors in your query, it doesn’t bode well for your book. Read your entire letter out loud, slowly, so that you can hear mistakes. Check and double check for things like:Proper grammar
Typos
Spelling errors
Correct spelling of the agent/publisher’s name and the name of the agency or publication

, Most publishing companies and agencies provide submission guidelines for writers looking for representation.Make sure you follow these guidelines exactly. Guidelines can include things like:


The method by which you should send your query (such as via email or regular mail)
Where to send physical queries
What other information to include with your letter
The proper format for your letter

, For physical queries, you should always include a SASE, which is a return envelope with your address and prepaid postage that the agent will use to reply to your query.This is a courtesy to make the lives of agents and publishers easier, so that they don’t have to waste time pulling up your contact information when responding.

, If you don’t hear back within a month of sending your letter, follow up with the agent or publisher. If your original query was sent by regular mail, send your follow up to the same address. Otherwise, send the follow up by email, using the same address as the original letter.Do not follow up repeatedly, and do not call or drop by in person to follow up.

Decide on a story idea.,

Create a storyboard.,

Write for your audience.,

Plan your illustrations.,

Pick a design for your pages.",How to Write and Publish a Children's Picture Book1," You will want to have between 24 and 34 pages that tell your story. Select a theme that will be enjoyed by preschoolers through the age of 7 years old (and that parents and teachers will enjoy reading aloud to children.) Set a working title that matches your story.

In creating a story use themes of family, adventure, confidence, creativity, imagination, and any others that will interest the target audience of small children, and those that care for them or teach them.;
, It should walk you through each page of the story, and takes into account the needed text, illustrations, and artwork. The storyboard is a working , flexible document and you will change it as needed as you write and create the story.

Storyboards are vital in planning out the pages and flow of your story, as well as noting what illustrations, text, and backgrounds are needed. Your storyboard can be one large sheet of paper divided into book pages, or it can be a binder, or flip chart. DO NOT SKIP the storyboard process, it's the map of you story-telling destination!

, If you tackle sensitive issues, such as loss, sorrow, bullying, etc., make efforts to keep the story from being too dark. You can show bullying or sorrow and still create a picture book suitable for reading to a very young child. Make bright, colorful books, with overall happy messages, while still addressing the central themes.

Write like an adult, think like a child! Read your story to a child, it's the best way to see if you've done a good story-telling job.
Add humor! A touch of humor is always a great idea!

, Once you have written all the text needed to tell the story, you will note on the storyboard what illustrations are needed to show your story. Begin drawing the needed sketches, drawings, doodles for each page., Decide if you are going to have a background color or pattern on your picture book pages, or if you will leave the pages white. If you decide to use backgrounds, you will need to create a background for each page. Again the storyboard is a great place to organize notes on the kind of background needed for each illustrated or text only page."
"
Brainstorm ideas.,
Create a pitch.,
Conduct research.,
Write for the intended audience.,
Polish your article.",How to Write for Women's Magazines1," Think of all the possibilities you could write about. What do you particularly have to offer? What interests you? Try free writing (where you write without stopping and without worrying about grammar, content, etc., for a short period of time—2-3 minutes, perhaps). You can make a list if that helps. You’ll just want a lot of room for possibilities, because your first idea might not be accepted.Draw on your personal experiences. Many magazines want to publish your life experiences. Do you have any experiences that you think would speak to people or shed light on a hot topic in politics or culture? Do you simply have a skill that not many people have (e.g. calligraphy)? Writing from experience is a great way to get your footing when writing for magazines.Try new things. Sometimes magazines like to publish listicles and reviews of products. When you try something new, keep notes about your experiences. This can be anything from a fancy meal to a new makeup product to a vacation spot you particularly enjoyed. Trying new things is fun and can give you lots of material for writing for women’s magazines.;
, Most major magazines want a query or pitch rather than a submission of a manuscript. A pitch is simply a short summary of your idea (typically a paragraph or two). A lot of magazines will give specifics about what they want in a pitch, and what kinds of pieces they are currently accepting. Revise your query to match the vision of the magazine and their submission requirements.Edit query for grammar, conciseness, and clarity. If you want to write for the magazine, your query letter should demonstrate that you can write. Grammar errors and typos are an easy way for editors to cut down the slush pile, and so it’s in your best interest to make sure your query is error-free., Sometimes you will need to research possible topics, especially if they’ve been written about a lot recently. Research can also generate new ideas. People tend to think of research as going through dusty books or simply googling a topic, but you can also go out into your neighborhood to find information about new trends, new ideas, and new ways of doing things.If you’re looking into how to do something complicated, or writing about a complex political issue, you will need to do research.
You may even need to do research for some personal articles. You may need to check to see when things really happened (memories aren’t always trustworthy). Be prepared to use the resources at your disposal.Give credit to any sources you use. You don’t want to be accused of plagiarism when you write your first article for a magazine, so make sure to give credit to any sources you use. Different magazines will have different style guides on how to give credit. If your article appears online, this might mean simply linking relevant parts of the article to an online source., To do this you will need to read women’s magazines. Most magazines would like you to be familiar with their magazine before you submit. If you’re a regular subscriber to a magazine you want to write for, then you should have no problem. If not, you should check out their most recent articles that are related to the ideas you have to get an idea of what they generally offer in terms of content, and what audience they’re aiming for.Some magazines tell you upfront who their audience is, and others are a little more subtle. Either way, you’d do well to read their articles., You will need to edit carefully for grammar and style. Again, you’ll want to produce a good piece for the editors to work with--if your editors are spending all their time working through your grammar errors, your piece is not as likely to become the best it could be. Also remember to you’re your piece to match the style of the magazine."

Pick software to put together your book.,

Envision your book as layers.,

Save your file first in your publishing software!,

Convert it to PDF.,

Decide on a title and work on a cover for your book.",How to Write and Publish a Children's Picture Book2," To combine your different layers of your story to get ready to publish, you will need software (Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator or InDesign). There are free tutorials that walk you through learning the software available on Createspace.com, and Adobe.com, as well as in the software programs themselves.

Adobe Illustrator has a feature called Image Trace, that will remove the white background from black and white line drawings in one or two clicks!
Createspace.com offers templates for book layouts, as well as a user community forum to answer any questions you may have.

, In Adobe or other publishing software, you will combine your story layers, backgrounds (or white page), followed by illustrations and on a top layer, text. Adobe Illustrator handles text better than Photoshop, and it's best to type text into the Illustrator last, after placing backgrounds and picture. Copying text over from other applications can make your text blurry and unreadable. Use Photoshop for altering the illustrations for color, size, perspective, but use Illustrator for text., This will be your master copy if you later need to make changes. Don't rely on your PDF version as your only copy. You want to be able to make improvements to the original file later., Once you have your full book in Illustrator, InDesign, or your other publishing software, you will need to use the save as feature to convert the pages to one PDF file. A single PDF file is needed to upload to a Print-on-Demand (POD) publisher, such as Create Space or Lulu.

If your file is too large you will not be able to upload it for printing/publishing. Make smaller files by selecting ""Optimizing for the Web"", and not selecting ""include Thumbnails, or Illustrator's ability to change."" Now you have two copies, your master Illustrator file, and a single PDF file in a smaller size for upload to POD.

, Create Space has temples that will help you design your cover, and get the correct size that includes front, back and spine in one larger file. The interior storybook file -- the single PDF, and the cover file are uploaded separately to the online publisher."

Review your storybook on line in a digital version.,

Order a printed proof copy.,

Use your proof to fix any mistakes.,

Experiment with small changes.,

Get feedback from friends and family.,

Read you story to a child.",How to Write and Publish a Children's Picture Book3," Make any corrections for typos, wording , or desired changes to artwork. This is a good time to set the final title for your book, or keep the working title if you like it! When you like what you see digitally, you will be ready for the next step., Both Lulu.com and CreateSpace.com encourage you to order a proof copy before you approve your picture book file and cover for publication. While proof copies are only between $7 - $20 in cost depending on page count , color use and publisher chosen, you should make as many changes in the master Illustrator file after viewing the digital / free copy of your book.

Get your book close to typo free and perfect before you order the first proof. Use printed proofs to see how the publisher is true to color, how you like the placement of text and artwork, and for any creative changes you wish to make. Your goal is to need no more that 2 or 3 proof copies in getting to a perfect, printable file!

, At each proof, check for typos, color, text and art placement, and for any changes that will enhance your story. Carefully check your cover, front and back, and the outside and inside margins and gutters.

Did the color ""full bleed"" if you intended it to, (color right to the edges of the pages)?
Is the inside white gutter just right, or showing too much white?

, Use of color can create emotion and tone, grays for rainy scenes, greens and yellows for spring, happy times, etc. Consider ""sub visuals"" - any artwork or drawings that show activity, emotion or tell a separate story from that which is the main story of the book. Sub visuals can add another layer of interest to a story, gently and visually., Ask those you trust to tell you truths. Honest criticism will only improve the story and your work., Beyond marketing, the success of your book ultimately depends on whether it is a good read for the preschool set. Create stories they want to hear about issues that interest them, that have a bit of fun, and a bit of life in them. Don't talk down to your audience; use DR Seuss, Where the Wild Things Are, If You Give a Mouse a Cookie, and other standards of picture books -- to set the level of writing. The days of ""Run Spot, Run"" are long gone!"
"

Publish!,

Deal with any errors you find thereafter.,

Enjoy - and sell - your book.",How to Write and Publish a Children's Picture Book4," When you receive a printed proof that you would be proud to print, publish and sell, you are ready to approve your file with the POD publisher (Create Space. Lulu, or other). After this step, your book is published -- and you can tell people to purchase it in online bookstores, or you can buy cheaper author copies and sell your book yourself!

*Publishing requires an ISBN#, in the publishing process, you will be given a choice to use the POD free ISBN, or purchase one of your own.

, If errors in proofs are in your file, and as such author error, you will need to make changes to the master illustrator file, and re-convert to a PDF copy, then upload that file to replace the bad file. If errors are the POD publishers fault, or printing errors not seen in the digital file, contact the POD publisher for replacement copies., Once you have approved the files and published your book, you should begin to sell author copies as well as market your book via online bookstores, your website, blogs and social media.

Don't get discouraged over marketing , sales, etc. At best, everyone will read your books... At worst, your friends and family, children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren will read them! That's not a bad legacy, now is it?

Update your resume.,
Network.,
Apply for jobs.,
Nail the interview.,
Excel at your new job.",How to Write for Women's Magazines2," You'll want to submit a resume with all relevant writing experience. If you’ve been publishing, include your pieces. If you’ve presented at a writing conference, include that. If you've done any work that is related to writing, make sure you feature it prominently on your resume.Complete any education requirements, as possible. Some writing positions require a degree in journalism or a related field. However, not all jobs require this, and if you establish your reputation as a good writer, you can sometimes get a job as a staff writer. Chances are though, you’ll need a lot more experience than you would if you had a bachelor’s degree in order to get a similar position., This can take some legwork, You can be on the lookout for alumni at the magazines you want to work for. This can help establish a tie early in the application process. If you've got a degree in journalism, you may want to reach out to previous professors. They often have contacts in the industry and could possibly be a reference for you. You'll also want to keep the following tips in mind:Make sure you follow up with every person you meet who might help you. Depending on what they've said or done, you may even want to send a thank you note or email.
You may need to use some tactical social media contact. For instance, you may want to get in touch via Twitter or Facebook. Cold calling on Facebook may not be the best idea, but people often Tweet people they don't know on Twitter. Run your Tweets by friends to make sure they're helping rather than hurting your job prospects., Many mainstream magazines are part of a publishing family such as Hearst or Meredith. If they are, their employment links (usually found at the bottom of the page, or in the “Contact” section) will re-direct you to their parent company’s site for job listings. Editorial positions are often writing positions in mainstream magazines. However, there are staff writing positions for some magazines.When applying, you should follow the instructions in the job listing. This means following writing sample length instructions, as well as how to submit resumes, etc. Some companies will want attachments in pdf, while others might want the resume copied into an email. In any case, following instructions will make it look like you care about details.Write a carefully crafted and edited cover letter. Keep the magazine’s style in mind, but don’t write the cover letter as an article. Make sure you demonstrate clearly and specifically how you would be an asset to their magazine, and why their magazine would be a good fit for you. While it is good to be specific, don’t give every little detail you can think of. Keep the letter to under a page.Try an internship. If you’re not sure you’re ready for a writing job, you may want to try an internship. They can give you experience and college credit. Most writing internships do not pay, so you’ll need to think about that when you think of applying. If you’re in college and the internship is considered college credit, you may be able to get financial aid for while you’re interning., Interviewing for a job can be a stress-inducing experience, but there are ways to prepare to make sure you ace it. Dress for the job. You'll want to wear a nice suit or other professional wear. You'll want to remain calm, and practice beforehand with a friend or colleague. You'll also want to keep the following in mind:Bring your resume.
Be aware of competing women's magazines.
Keep up with current events.
Maintain an online presence (portfolio, social media accounts).
Have ideas and questions at the ready.

, To do this you'll need to get a sense of the office culture (unwritten social and professional rules, when people come in and leave, etc.). It can take some time to adjust, but it's best to watch others to see how it's done, or ask questions. When you're new, you can ask a lot of questions, because no one expects you to be an expert on the policies and culture of your new workplace. You should also use this time to start building relationships with your co-workers. This can help you transition smoothly into your new job and help you network for later opportunities."

Read submission guidelines.,
Submit queries and pitches.,
Confirm your assignment.,
Submit your article on time.,
Look for new opportunities.",How to Write for Women's Magazines3," This is extremely important if you want your piece to be accepted. Oftentimes, if a writer neglects to look at a magazine’s submission guidelines, they will submit something that wastes both the writer’s time and the editor’s time. For instance, at Family Circle, they specifically state that they do not accept fiction or poetry, so if you submit a short story to them, you won’t be accepted, no matter how good your work., It is important to read the guidelines for queries and pitches, as the guidelines vary from magazine to magazine. You may be eager to submit a your query to a slew of magazines, but you shouldn't rush, unless you are concerned about the timeliness of an article (something to do with politics or world events). Even then you should take the time to make sure the letter contains no typos or grammatical errors.You should also keep in mind the following:


Be careful of simultaneous submissions with major magazines. A simultaneous submission is when you submit the same idea or piece simultaneously to different magazines. Each magazine will have a different policy on simultaneous submissions, so check their submission guidelines.If you do submit simultaneous queries, make sure you submit in groups by tier. In other words, submit to your dream magazines first, wait a few weeks, and then submit to other publications.If you are accepted by a magazine and you have multiple submissions out, email the other places to withdraw your piece., You should wait until you’ve heard back to write the piece. While you can write the piece beforehand, if you don’t get accepted into the magazine you want, you may end up re-writing. However, you may end up making a ton of revisions anyway even you are accepted into your dream magazine. Waiting to write until you’ve heard back, though, will give you time to formulate new ideas and queries. You can focus on writing the article once you’re accepted.Accept rejection as a learning experience. While it is never fun to receive a rejection (or not to hear back at all), it can be a good time for reflection. Did your piece not fit well enough with the other content in the magazine? What might you do differently next time? It can also be beneficial to get a friend to look over your piece if you haven’t already to get a fresh perspective on it. It can also be a great time to develop your voice., If you’re a well-known writer or a celebrity, you may be able to blow off deadlines without any consequences, but if you are a new writer, missing deadlines can spell trouble for your potential career. If you have a life crisis or get sick, and cannot meet the deadline, email your editor to let them know. Nothing is worse than letting a deadline go by without saying anything. Often the deadlines are there to make sure the magazine or content goes out on time., You can do this by keeping up with the latest trends and by reading the women's magazines to see what's happening. You'll want to check the submission sections frequently. Once you've established good relationships with editors, you may be able to contact them directly with a piece you think they might be interested in. You may even want to subscribe to a site like Duotrope, which collates information about different magazines and journals you can submit to. Though it has a literary focus, it also includes some mainstream women's magazines."

Just make sure that people will not be annoyed by that. Another method that works is to pick a few key words of the theme your story will be and write them down. For example, a few words of the theme of your story could be ""scary"", ""horror"", and ""terrifying"". It's basically the mood of your story, the theme of it and what ""feeling"" it sets off to your readers.

, If you want to base your story towards younger people, write about youthful topics. If your age group is based towards older people, it is better to write about more mature topics. Don't write about callow topics if you're basing your story towards older people. However, keep in mind, some older people do like younger story topics.

, Make sure the characters relate to your story and try to mix it up a little. Like you could have a bizarre character be in a professional business. You can write a whole profile for your characters, or you could just keep it simple by just writing their name, age, and maybe a small description. Give them a unique name. Give them an unexpected personality. Just don't overdo it or readers will be confused.

Ferry boat service begins at 9 a.m. daily and reservations cost $4.50 per person, Collins added.


The release had two points to make: Alcatraz Island is re-opening AND reservations can now be made, which is too much for one sentence. Put them into two sentences. News releases have short paragraphs.

, When you want the media to attend your event and write a story about it afterwards, send them an editor's advisory. Use the proper format for editor's advisories and make sure you answer the central questions of any journalism coverage.


Example:

EDITOR'S ADVISORY: Secretary of the Interior Opens Coronado International Historical Pageant -- a colorful, costumed fiesta of music, song, dance and drama.
Time: 11 a.m., Sunday, April 20. (Festival from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.)
Place: Coronado National Memorial, Hereford, Ariz.
Who: Secretary of the Interior Arnold Andrews and National Park Service Director Francis Drake Editor's advisories can also be useful at the end of a news release.


If you have an advance news release (and you should), attach a copy to the advisory. The advisory is particularly valuable in soliciting television coverage.
Include a brief description of what will happen, including what there will be to photograph.
Send press releases and editor's advisories in separate envelopes. That's because news media filing systems are usually pretty primitive. If you mail the two in one envelope, your editor's advisory and press release will both be placed in the ""future"" file. The editor usually will not make a copy for someone to cover your event in advance.

, These should be separated from the main text of the release and clearly labeled. They are used to offer supplementary material, related to the release subject.


For example: photographs, copies of reports, and review copies of new publications can be offered to the media through such advisories. They must always include clear instructions on how the recipient can obtain the offered items.

, The first rule to avoid getting your work thrown in trash cans is don't send trash. That is why it is worth taking the time to do a good job. Distribute your releases as plain text. Don't get fancy with formatting, and don't write in all caps. That's just superfluous stuff that someone else has to fix later to put your release in a usable format. And the more time it takes to make your release usable, the less likely it is to be used.

, The less time it would take to turn your release into an actual news article, the more likely it is to be used by the media. The third sample press release above is all wrong.


""We are pleased to announce that Fit Fashion Show is taking a giant leap forward and moving our annual event to San Francisco's Pier 16 on September 2, 2013."" Does that sound like the way a real news article would begin? Of course not. A newspaper can't say ""we"" or ""our"" anywhere but on the opinion page. This sample press release's lead should be changed to ""The annual Fit Fashion Show will be held at San Francisco's Pier 16 on Sept. 2.""
""After two fantastic seasons of unparalleled success at Pitchford University, we have decided to take advantage of new opportunities."" Who is ""we?"" Who is even talking? Whose voice is this? This sample press release is a mess.
Notice how despite all the uses of ""we"" and ""our,"" the name of the organization behind the Fit Fashion Show is never actually given. So now, even if a media person wanted to use this press release, he/she would have to contact whoever distributed it to try to make sense of it. A media person using this release would have to ask the distributor fundamental questions like ""Who are you?"" that should have been answered from the get-go. This sample release makes unnecessary work for media people, and instead of going through all that trouble just to try to make sense of an incompetent press release, a media person is more likely to just trash it and use a competent press release instead.
Don't bury the recipients in a paper blizzard. Use releases only when you have something worth taking an editor's time. An editor who receives too many releases with too little news value soon learns to ignore everything that comes from the same source.

News organizations are trying to interest an audience. If your release will help them do that, they will use it. If it won't, trash it yourself.



, State with the ""gatekeepers"" of key news organizations and cultivate your relationship with that person.


Make an appointment to meet with them professionally and present your press release. Tell them all the key pieces of information of how you would like them to cover it. Respect busy professionals.
After you've made the initial contact, you can send press releases to them as new developments arise. Regardless of whether you choose to mail or e-mail something, the release must be simple. Graphics and attachments that may cause newsroom delays or disruptions will win no friends.
Don't try to save postage by putting more than one release in the same envelope. Since different stories are likely to be assigned to different reporters, this may cause one release to be ignored.
If you use email, the same principle applies: send separate releases separately.

, Honor whom you're sending your press release to. In general, use the following titles to address your releases, unless you know a particular organization uses a different title:


Daily newspapers: City Editor
Weekly newspaper: Editor
Shoppers: Editor
Magazines: Editor
Radio Stations: News Department
Television Stations: News Director
Almost every state has a few newspapers that are circulated over much of the state and that have small bureaus outside of their base city. If such a bureau is near you, put it on the mailing list. Address the releases to ""Bureau Chief"" (even if it is a one-person bureau).

, Consider to whom you are sending it and the necessary timing. Most feature departments (such as travel sections) and magazines have deadlines long before things appear in print. They need to get releases in advance. Weekly papers need releases just before -- not just after -- their weekly deadlines. The daily media usually have reduced staffs on weekends and are better equipped to act on a release received on a weekday.

Keep a journal.,
Be autobiographical.,
Read other humor writing.",How to Write a Humor Column1," Funny things happen all of the time, but your memory might not retain all of the humorous elements that are worthy of writing about. Keeping a journal with you to instantly record anything that you think might make good fodder for your humor column down the line, or ideas that might come out you out of the blue. Re-reading the journal later on might reveal insights that are humorous enough to inspire a column; at worst, you will be left with a journal full of ideas that will not make it to print., Your own life can be a great source of inspiration for a humor column, provided that you are able to laugh at yourself. The benefit of writing autobiographically is that you don’t have to worry about offending anyone – you are simply telling your story in a humorous way, and giving readers permission to laugh at your blunders or comedic misfortune. Try writing first person accounts of funny things that happen to you, then re-read them at a later date. Putting some distance between reading the column and experiencing the event itself will allow you to see if the story is objectively funny, or a “you had to be there” kind of story., When looking for inspiration for your humor column, look to other humor writers for inspiration. Note what they write about, how they structure their articles, and what elements make the writing funny. Try to pick up on tricks that the writer might be using to keep their readers laughing."
"
Be detailed and specific.,
Use expressive adjectives.,
Use the rule of three.,
Be satirical.,
Get feedback on your work.",How to Write a Humor Column2," Adding specific detail to anecdotes in your humor column will give the writing more dimension and paint a vivid picture for your readers. Generalizations can be boring, and an engaging humor column should grab and hold a reader’s interest and leave a unique impression. Include details that are distinctive or bizarre enough to stand out.For instance, instead of writing something like, “the cat was behaving badly that morning”, write, “that morning, the cat knocked twelve books out of my bookcase, ran laps around the apartment, and rolled across every inch of my brand new winter coat - collar and cuffs included.”

, One key to good writing is painting a vivid picture for your readers with interesting vocabulary and wording. Using colorful, or even exaggerated descriptive words can intensify certain points of your story or anecdote. For instance, choose to write something like, “her outfit was disastrously uncoordinated” rather than “her outfit was very uncoordinated”., The rule of three humor writing technique can add rhythm to your column that is both funny and accessible to readers. To employ this technique, write two items that set up a straightforward pattern, then add a third element that derails the initial idea. This setup can be used with many different patterns, for instance:ordinary trait/ordinary trait/unusual trait (e.g. ""She was fair, beautiful, and an excellent golf player."")
something good/something good/something terrible (e.g. ""Looking forward to sun, sand, and hours of punishing exercise."")
something ordinary/something ordinary/something ridiculous (e.g. ""I'm going to stop by the dry cleaners, go grocery shopping, then rob the bank down the street."")

, Satire uses irony and sarcasm to convey the silliness or absurdity of people, organizations, or situations. To be sure that you reach readers with this style of writing, choose a well-known subject to satirize and exaggerate the details of said subject. For example, you could satirize relationship advice columns by writing something like, ""To really show your commitment, you should call your significant other at least 12 times a day, for no reason in particular."", When you first write a column, have friends or family read your work. Second opinions are important in understanding whether or not the humor you’ve injected into your work is universal or subjective. If too many people fail to laugh at what you’ve written, take it as a sign that the anecdotes you found funny were an inside joke, and re-write your piece."
"
Establish yourself as a writer.,
Make sure your writing is strong.,
Write an engaging proposal.",How to Write a Humor Column3," It is unlikely that a publication will choose to feature your column if you are not already an experienced and published writer. If you do not have these credentials, work as a freelance writer and get several pieces of your writing published before pitching a long-term writing project to anyone. Aim to get your work printed in publications that would also feature regular humor columns; the publications that have featured you should be similar to the ones you pitch your column to down the line., Aside from the humor factor, you should make sure that your writing is polished and grammatically accurate if you want your column to be published. Edit all of your work – leave time to put a column aside and proofread it a day or two later. Be especially diligent about checking all sample articles that you submit with your proposal. If you feel it to be necessary, have someone close to you proofread your work before submitting it., The proposal you write to a publication regarding your humor column should be as captivating as you intend your column to be. Avoid a generic introductory statement like, “I am writing to you to submit my proposal for a humor column in your publication” – instead, opt for something more distinctive and memorable, like, “I am writing to you in the hopes that you will consider adding a weekly column to your publication that, in my very humble opinion, is hilarious.” Maintain a confident and humorous tone throughout the proposal letter.Unless you already know the person you are submitting a proposal to, communication by email is the best option."

Decide on how you will address the passage of time.",How to Write a Book Series," Some genres, such as fantasy, science fiction, and mystery, are more amenable to a series than others, like romance or commercial fiction. Decide whether your concept fits into the former or the latter.Children’s and young adult fiction are other genres that are suitable for series building.
Some publishers prefer fantasy series over individual fantasy novels, because fantasy series tend to sell better than standalone fantasy books.;
, You will have to decide whether you are interested in writing one large story broken into several books, such as the Harry Potter series or a group of stand-alone books featuring the same characters, such as Agatha Christie’s Hercule Poirot mysteries.Making this decision will help you figure out whether you will plot each book separately, or whether you will try to have an overarching storyline between the books.


Did you just finish a novel and don’t want to say goodbye your main characters? Or, have you developed a fantastic plot that is so wide-ranging it needs to be told over several installments? The former motivation could lead to a long-running series, like a group of mystery novels, while the latter could lead to a trilogy.You will also need to figure out whether you will have an ensemble cast that appears throughout the series, or whether you will primarily have a main character who meets new characters in each book.

, To help you plan out the series, create a writing timeline with deadlines and due dates. Determine how much time per week or per day you are going to devote to writing the book series. Have deadlines for completed chapters or for a certain page count so you are encouraged to complete the book series.For example, you may have a goal page count per week that you have to hit. Or you may have a certain number of chapters you have to complete every month so you can get the book series done.
You will need to be prepared to write and publish frequently as a series writer. Your audience will want to know what happens next to your characters. You also don’t want your readers to move on to other books or series if they get tired of waiting for your next installment.

, Active characters are more interesting and relatable than passive ones. The protagonist in the series should be motivated and make decisions, for better or worse. They should be active participants in the plot and their decisions should affect the action in the book series.Your main character will sustain you, and your readers, through the length of your series, so make sure it is someone who will not wear out their welcome. Your protagonist will be viewed as a member of your readers’ family or a close friend. Readers will care about what happens to them.
For example, you may have a main character who is a teenage high schooler who wants to win a spelling tournament at their school. This way, your protagonist is motivated by the need to win.

, To make your protagonist feel relatable and believable, give them a backstory. Backstory is a character's past actions or experiences. It usually affects or informs their behavior in the present.For example, your character may have an addiction or a divorce in their backstory. This can make them seem more real. You may have a protagonist that have a difficult childhood or that has struggles with their identity or their sexuality.
Keep in mind that issues like an addiction or a medical condition will need to ring true throughout your series. In other words, you can’t have your character obtain a “miracle cure” if you’re tired of writing about this problem by the third novel.

, If your main character is an adult, they may have a specific profession. If your main character is a child, they may be occupied by going to school or by living at home. Decide how your main character occupies their time day to day and add this to their backstory.


One option is to go for a profession where your main character can interact with a variety of people. This will increase your ability to create new problems for your character to solve that relate to their job.
For instance, your protagonist could be a hair stylist who continually finds himself drawn into the mysteries and personal lives of his clients. Or, she could be a corporate lawyer whose expertise in white collar crime makes her sought out by the police for help on new cases.

, If your protagonist ages throughout the series, make sure they also develop their skills and perceptions as they age. Their relationships with others should also deepen and shift as they get older.For example, maybe your main character has a best friend that they grew up with and are still close to. This relationship could then be central to their life and affect their decisions or experiences. Their best friend may turn out to be a con man, for example, which will complicate the main character's relationship to them.

, Regardless of whether you’re writing a long-term mystery series or a science fiction trilogy, your protagonist will encounter recurring characters throughout your series. By giving these characters the attention they deserve, you will be able to surround your protagonist with a interesting ensemble.Minor characters are a useful way to introduce personalities that can challenge or work against the main character.
Recurring characters can also be used to offer occasional comic relief if your main character is typically involved in solving grisly murders.

, Maintaining consistency throughout your series is one of the most important jobs you will have as a series writer. To assist you with this, create a character bible that includes information on ages, birthdays, physical characteristics, personality types (such as nervous habits or annoying behavior), and back stories of each character.Remember that characters you introduce in the first book will probably play a role in subsequent titles. For instance, if your main character is divorced with two children, those children will have to play some role in future books.
Family trees can also be useful for keeping track of the extended family of your main character.It is useful to keep your character information all in one place, either in a notebook or on a spreadsheet.

, When you embark upon writing a series, you need to be aware of where you are heading and what problems your characters will encounter in the upcoming books. That way, you can include teases and clues in the first book that will delight readers and encourage them to keep reading the series. Set up the key points you want to cover in each book, including the ending.You should have the entire series sketched out before you begin writing the first book.Outline any key events you have in mind and keep the outline in chronological order., If you are writing a shorter series, like a trilogy, thinking about the ultimate conclusion will help you drive the plot in that direction in a believable way.


If you know the course of action for the series, it will be much easier to write how your characters will get to the final resolution.

, One challenge of writing a series like a trilogy, for instance, is deciding what to resolve in each installment and what problems to carry through the series. Each book should have its own plot and its own conclusion, but it should also foreshadow events to come.For example, you may have a series of books that are linked with the same characters, settings, and problems. Or you may have a series of books that focus on different characters within the same world or setting.
Keep some problems unresolved in the first book. Allow the characters to grow.Don’t assume that readers of subsequent books will have read the first one. Include background information on characters and references to previous plots and situations where necessary., Subplots are a good way to both drive the action and develop your characters further. Incorporating a romantic subplot into a mystery thriller, for instance, introduces more characters and could help show another side to your protagonist outside of their job.


Subplots are also useful in giving the reader some satisfaction of plot resolution. In other words, if your overarching plot carries through several novels, the resolution of a subplot or two can give your reader a sense of satisfaction.
For example, you may have a minor character subplot where a minor character gets into a fight in your book. This could then lead to repercussions for the minor character and affect the main character in some way.

, Offer clues to the final resolution throughout the series. The ending of the series should feel compelling and realistic to your reader. Your main character should be changed or feel a shift in some way by the end of the series.Avoid having a surprise or twist at the end that does not feel earned. Your reader may find it unsatisfying if a new concept is introduced at the end of the book that then saves the day.
For example, you may have an ending that answers a few questions presented in book one of the series. But you may leave a few questions unanswered, allowing your reader to feel satisfied but also curious about what might have happened to a few minor characters or to the main character's relationships in the books.

, Whether it is a rugged mountain town or the halls of Congress, you will need to create a world that is interesting and complex enough to draw your readers in again and again. Your main character should also be a natural part of their environment.Setting can be used to establish a mood throughout your series. For example, if you are writing a gritty detective novel, you could focus on the dark alleyways and seedy underbelly of an urban area.If you are writing a science fiction or fantasy novel, your setting will involve a fair amount of world building. You will be creating a new culture, government, terrain, and even climate.

, Similar to a character bible, you will need to create an ongoing list of information regarding key settings in your series.


Information on your list should include names of key buildings and streets; distances between landmarks, stores, and restaurants the characters frequent; and directional data, like which streets run north/south and which are east/west.You should also include information on the paint color and furnishings of rooms commonly featured.

, You have a few options to consider when writing a series. Your character can age throughout the series relatively quickly, or they can remain pretty much the same age throughout (as in primary characters in long-running mystery series).


If your characters will age significantly over the course of the series, keep in mind that other minor characters will need to age accordingly.

Place clams in well-established tanks for the best results.,
Provide a sandy bottom for your clams.,
Add other fish to create a vibrant aquarium systems around your clams.,
Augment your clams natural food with feedings 1-2 a week.,
Note the speed a clam closes up to measure health.,
Remove dead clams from your tank quickly.,
Do not rely on clams to filter your water.",How to Take Care of a Live Clam1," Clams are animals, not plants, though they are often marketed as ""filters."" This is only partially true. Unlike plants, which filter chemicals out of the water and use light to make food, clams are ""filter feeders,"" meaning that they eat small organisms and algae that they pull out of the water. A brand new tank, however, will not have any other life developed, meaning your clams could starve without proper care., Clams like to hide and feel safe, sitting in the bottom of the tank and filtering out all the food waste and leftovers that drift down to the bottom. You want roughly 4 inches (10.2 cm) of sand for them to nest in.


Make sure you rinse your substrate (sand) off before adding it to the tank, especially if you've taken it from a natural environment.
You want a nice, fine substrate, something with a grain size between 1 to 3mm., Snails and coldwater fish all create food waste and scrapes that are perfect to feed your clams. With a strong ecosystem around them, most clams will need little other maintenance beyond the occasional check-up, as they eat the leftovers of the other fish. They can also keep your tank clean by filtering our some algae and microorganisms.


Freshwater puffers, some catfish species, and loaches will all eat clams if they get hungry enough, so it is best to keep them in separate tanks., Your clams can eat a lot of the food leftover by the rest of the tank, but, especially in newer tanks with fewer organisms, they will need some extra food to truly thrive. This is especially essential if you have a lot of clams, or many larger, adult clams. You can use clam food, found at your local pet store and often sold as ""sinking algae wafers,"" or you can make your own mixture, pureed in a blender and given to your clams individually:


1/3 pound red meat (hamburger, beef liver, beef heart) OR Fish with Roe
Beef Blood (drippings from beef package)
1 tsp Cod Liver Oil
¼ tsp Yeast
2-3 tablespoons water from the aquarium the clams live in.

, A good, healthy clam will spring closed quickly if you touch it or it feels like it is being threatened. This is a naturally clammy defense mechanism. Every 2-3 weeks, pull your clams out and make sure that they close up quickly. Since they bury themselves in the sand, finding dead clams can be tough, but you can make it easier on yourself:


Poke 10-20 holes in a clean, single serving applesauce container.
Place 2-3 clams (depending on size) into the container.
Cover them in sand so that the tops are still visible at the top.
Place the container at the bottom of your tank, removing it with your clams whenever you need to check on them., Dead clams release a large spike of ammonia, which can damage or even kill other animals in the tank. This is why checking your clams regularly is so important. Make sure that they still close up rapidly. If they won't close at all, they've likely died and should be discarded.


Dead clams also have a rank, fishy odor.
If you are unsure if a clam is dead, try making a small, separate ""maintenance tank."" Feed them and provide a nice, sandy bottom and see if they begin to react after 4-5 days., Clams are not water filtration systems, and they will not keep your tank clean and happy all on their own. You still need a water filtration system, plants, and carefully monitored water levels to ensure that your tank is healthy and happy.

"
"
Do not place saltwater clams in new or immature aquariums.,
Place clams on the bottom of the tank, where they can establish themselves.,
Ensure that your clams have adequate, bright lights.,
Keep the water movement low and calm.,
Keep phosphate and nitrate levels low.,
Check how quickly a clam closes up to monitor its health.",How to Take Care of a Live Clam2," You cannot simply add saltwater to a tank and expect a clam to survive, as it needs a variety of microorganisms to be well established before it can feed. Clams are best in well-established aquariums that have had several weeks or months to cycle.


Saltwater clams go by the names T. (Tridacna) maxima, T. crocea, T. squamosa and T. derasa.
Tridacna derasa clams are the best beginner options, as they are hearty and can handle a variety of changing conditions.
Once you've successfully put several fish in the tank and let them spend several weeks living healthily, you're likely ready for clams., While it may look good, never place a clam up on a rock or structure. If it becomes detached and falls it can cause major damage and potentially kill the clam. Solid rocky bottoms are fine, as saltwater clams have a foot that they use to attach to the bottom of the tank.When you put the clam in the tank, turn it upside-down briefly to remove any air bubbles from inside the clam.
Make sure that the clams aren't wedged into anything the prevents them from opening up.

, Saltwater clams are photosynthetic, and feed off the products off other photosynthetic creatures, like plants, in your tank. They have symbiotic algae in their mantles (top section) that create energy that the clams then harvest. As such, they love having bright, constant lights to feed under. Metal Halides are your best option, though high level LEDs or Fluorescents may suffice.


Make sure the clams face upwards, and are not blocked from their light source.
Maxima clams, in particular, need 250 - 400 watt Metal Halide lighting or equivalent intensity to survive., Clams do not like rapid or fast-moving water, as it disrupts their ability to filter food out of the water effectively. Indirect, slow moving currents are the best way to keep your clams healthy and happy. Keep your clams out of direct currents and away from pumps or fans.

, Clams survive well in near-natural seawater conditions, which is where you likely keep a saltwater tank already. If you're not already, however, keep the phosphate and nitrate levels at an absolute minimum, potential near zero., A clam, when touched or exposed to a shadow, should close up quickly. If it does not, it likely needs more food and/or light, or your tank could be having chemical issues. If a clam does not close up at all, it may be dead, and should be quickly removed.


Dead clams release a burst of ammonia, which can endanger the rest of the life in your tank."

Buy a jellyfish tank.,
Ensure the right temperature.Jellyfish should be in water that is approximately room temperature, between 70-72 degrees Fahrenheit.,
Add nitrifying bacteria.,
Monitor the water’s salinity.,
Feed your jellyfish.Jellyfish should be fed twice each day.",How to Maintain a Jellyfish Tank1," Several companies offer ready-made jellyfish and jellyfish tanks.The benefit of buying a premade jellyfish tank is that all the parts and pieces you need will be easily assembled, saving you the stress of figuring out what kind of filter, pump, and tank you need for your jellyfish.


After you get the tank assembled, the manufacturer will send you jellyfish in the mail.
Your tank should be a Kreisel or pseudokreisel design. A standard boxy fish tank will not do. This is because jellyfish need slowly circulating water. A kreisel or pseudokreisel design accomplishes this by creating a current that runs in a circle around the top, bottom, and sides of the tank.
You should have at least two gallons of water per jellyfish. In other words, if you have three jellyfish, your tank should be no smaller than six gallons.
Consult a pet shop proprietor or marine life expert if you are unsure of what kind of tank you need.;
, Slightly higher temperatures (up to 75 degrees Fahrenheit) may improve the growth rate of your jellyfish. Water temperatures can dip to around 60 degrees Fahrenheit without adversely affecting your jellyfish.Some species of moon jellyfish can tolerate temperatures up to 80 degrees Fahrenheit.Always consult your vet or a marine expert to ensure you keep your particular jellyfish species at an appropriate temperature.
Put a waterproof thermometer in your jellyfish tank. Monitor the temperature regularly. If your tank is too cold, you could place a heat lamp near the outside of the tank to raise the temperature, or try simply raising the temperature of your home thermostat.
If your jellyfish habitat is too hot, consider moving the tank to a cooler location like a basement, or invest in an aquarium cooler., Nitrifying bacteria are an important part of your jellyfish tank. In their natural environment, jellyfish would be surrounded by nitrifying bacteria (microorganisms that consume ammonia and turn it into nitrite and nitrate).There are many kinds of nitrifying bacteria available. Jellyfish tanks should be given nitrifying bacteria appropriate for saltwater.Nitrifying bacteria are common in many aquarium setups, and can be purchased from your local pet store.

, Jellyfish should be kept in water with a salinity of at least 28-30 parts per thousand and a maximum level or around 32-34 parts per thousand.Use a hydrometer to measure the water’s salinity, and ensure that when you change the water, it is at an appropriate salinity level.


Hydrometers are readily available at pet stores and online.
Introduce your jellyfish to a tank with a salinity level that is slightly higher than normal. This way, they have a better chance at floating. You can gradually reduce the salinity over time. Water with a salinity level that is too low will make them sink.
If you need to adjust the salinity, remove your jellyfish from the tank and place them in a smaller quarantine tank. Dump the main tank out and mix a new batch of water at the correct salinity. Connect your pump to ensure the water mixes well for about 24 hours. Check the water in your hydrometer. Repeat as needed.
Do not use tap water to create saltwater for your tank. Buy deionized or reverse osmosis water from your grocery store, and add Jelly Salt (a salt specifically designed for jellyfish habitats) in an appropriate amount., They can be fed a mix of dry, frozen, and live foods. Live rotifers, for instance, are a good jellyfish snack. Jellyfish also enjoy eating baby brine shrimp.Commercially available jellyfish foods might be available at your local pet store or online.


One half to one full scoop of commercial jellyfish food is usually enough.Check manufacturer directions for specific use directions.
When feeding your jellyfish shrimp or other live food, add a small amount (one tablespoon’s worth) at first, then add more gradually over time. If you notice a surplus of shrimp in the tank after feeding, reduce the amount of live food you’re feeding your jellyfish. It should get only as much food as it can eat in an hour.
Do not pour water from baby brine shrimp tanks into your jellyfish tank.

Pick an appropriate project.,
Pick a subject area in which you have credibility.,
Find a wide angle on your topic.,
Pick something you'll be able to spend months or years working on.,
Plan to cover as many of the expenses as possible yourself.,
Research appropriate venues for your project.,
Start your proposal with a cover letter.,
Provide an overview of the entire book.,
Include any sample chapters.,
Include an ""About the Author"" section.,
Include a SASE for their convenience in replying.,
Personalize your form proposal and cover letter.,
Inquire about any supplementary forms from the publisher you're submitting to.,
Consider the benefits of submitting the project to multiple presses simultaneously.,
Send it, record it, and forget it.",How to Write a Book Proposal," Generally, books that are published on proposal only are nonfiction books, textbooks, and children's books. Usually, poetry collections, novels, and collections of stories are not submitted in proposal form, because those forms are more about the aesthetics and execution than the topic. Presses regularly look for projects to invest in that address topics or issues that they're interested in.;
, You want to write about something that you're either an expert on, or have become an expert about. If you want to write about the Civil War, but you haven't read the necessary literature, or haven't done any formal coursework in American History, your credibility will suffer.Why should they trust that your project will be successful, interesting, and marketable? Unless you've published lots of work, the strength of your proposal will be built on essentially three things:


The strength of the topic and angle
The marketability of the book and the interest of the press in the subject
Your credibility as a writer

, Successful books make specific and narrow topics universal. The average reader might not necessarily be interested in knowing a lot about salt, but the bestselling book ""Salt: A World History"" by Mark Kurlansky managed to find connections between salt and the construction of the modern world. It was a successful book because it made something mundane and specific applicable to all sorts of issues and places.


Alternatively, look for a really specific angle and only research smaller presses that cater to that publishing niche. If you desperately want to write about The Rolling Stones drug habits in the summer of 1966, it might be a hard sell to Norton. Drag City, Da Capo, or 33 1/3, however...

, Are you still going to be interested in researching what the second-in-command Union lieutenant at Appomattox ate for breakfast on the third day of the battle, six months from now? If not, the project might need to change slightly. You need to propose a writing project that you're going to be able to maintain a high level of enthusiasm for throughout the entire writing process.

, Say you want to write a non-fictional account of building a life-size recreation of Noah's ark, or your attempt to start an organic farm from scratch. If you're not widely published, it's unlikely a press is going to help you out financially with the considerable budget necessary for such a project. Are you going to foot the bill yourself?


Maybe instead of doing so much personal-journeying legwork yourself, it would be better to find a third party to observe and study. Instead of starting an organic farm from scratch yourself, could your project work by observing a farm in progress? Consider alternatives.

, Start by looking at publishing houses and academic presses that have issued books on similar topics.


Alternatively, you might check out presses that you particularly like, that you're very familiar with, and that you think might be interested by your aesthetics and your project, even if it's not something they've necessarily published before.
Check whether or not they accept unsolicited proposals from writers. If you can't figure out from their online presence, find a contact and write a professional exploratory email asking about their proposal policy. In this, you might include a brief author's note and a short (one or two sentence) summary of the project to let the contact know which editor to forward your question to.

, This should be brief (250-300 words) and personally tailored to each press, agent, or editor to which you're submitting a proposal. In your cover letter you want to introduce your project and yourself in a few sentences, guiding the reader into your proposal. Let them know what they're about to read. Make sure your cover letter includes:


Your contact information
Your basic credentials, although not a detailed biography
An introduction to your project
The working title of the project
Some discussion of why you're proposing the project to this specific press

, Depending on your project, the meat of the proposal will be a basic walkthrough of the themes, content, and organization of the potential book. This might include a Table of Contents, a formal outline, and a brief description of specific chapters that you'd like to develop. The overview should also include sections that address the intended audience and some discussion of why the press would benefit from investing in your project.


Describe the market for your book. Who is it written for, and why will they be interested?
List your competition and explain how your work differs from theirs. This is essentially your unique selling feature.

, In the overview, you'll want to include chapter-by-chapter descriptions (as you now see the project) for the entire book, giving the editor some sense of its breadth and structure. You also want to give the editor some sense of your aesthetics and writing style, so it's a good idea to include any finished chapters you've included, especially toward the beginning of the project.


Be prepared for criticism. From something as small as the title to as big as the nature of the project itself, editors will have opinions that they're going to be free to share with you if they're planning on thinking of the project. Prepare yourself to confront dissenting opinions and ideas regarding your writing.

, Detail some relevant information about yourself and your credentials. List a basic bio, getting in depth in regard specifically to your expertise in the subject matter. Any formal degrees you've received, previous publications, or research grants you might've received would be applicable and important to include.

, If the press is interested in publishing your work, chances are they'll get in touch via phone or email. If they choose to pass, it's likely they'll not get in touch at all in a personal way, unless you make some extra effort. Since it's good to know that you can stop waiting to hear back from them, it's good form to include a self-addressed and stamped envelope in your proposal packet, so they can include a short note letting you know they've decided to pass.

, The more individualized and personal your proposal, the more it demonstrates a real familiarity with the ventures of the press and the kinds of work they publish, the more seriously your project proposal will be taken. Some presses provide a list of editorial contacts in different subject areas who field proposals.


Address the letter to a specific editor, not ""All concerned"" or ""Section Editor."" Taking the extra step to research the press itself will do much to make you stand out in the early stages.

, Bloomsbury and other major publishing houses have form packets that they require you to fill out to streamline the submissions process.


Lots of the information these forms will ask for you'll have already worked out, so submitting to individually presses will become a matter of taking your pre-written proposal and putting it in their form. It's still a good idea to go through the steps of making a ""form"" proposal first.

, It may be tempting to have your project under consideration at multiple places simultaneously, especially if it's in any way time-sensitive. Presses can take several months to respond to the deluge of proposals and projects they have to sift through, though some won't even consider projects that are being simultaneously submitted elsewhere. Find out their policy before submitting.


In general, presses don't like to be part of ""carpet-bombing"" campaigns, in which an author submits the same thing to every single publisher under the sun, hoping something will stick somewhere. Aiming at specific places and doing some thought about why they'll be interested will make your project stand out much more than a shotgun-style approach.

, Your psychological health will be much more stable if you submit your proposal, record the date in your record of submissions, and promptly put the matter in the back of your mind. The good news will be that much better when it comes.

Remove your jellyfish.,
Remove 20% of your tank’s water.,
Clean your tank once each week.,
Add new water to the tank.,
Keep the pH levels normal.",How to Maintain a Jellyfish Tank2," Scoop your jellyfish into a plastic bag filled with tank water. Place the bag in a smaller, separate quarantine tank and pull it down and away from your jellyfish. The quarantine tank should have water of the same temperature, pH, and salinity as that of your main tank. Removing your jellyfish will allow you to change the water and clean the tank without disrupting or hurting them.


Always be gentle with your jellyfish. Since jellyfish are 90% water, they can be hurt very easily., Water changes are important because they remove excess nitrates -- toxic ingredients that can harm your jellyfish if they build up over time.For instance, if your tank holds ten gallons, you should remove two gallons. Use a measuring cup or siphoning hose to add and remove the water.

, After removing 20% of your water during your weekly cleaning, use an algae cleaner magnet to scrub the walls of your tank clean. You should also use this time to remove and scum or debris that might be at the bottom of the tank or floating on top.Attach a specialized aquarium cleaning cloth to a short pole (often packaged with the cleaning cloth) ti help you scrub the inside of the tank.Use a filter sock and protein skimmer to remove yucky bits from the tank that you may scrape off., Add new water equal in amount to that which you removed to the tank. For instance, if you removed two gallons, add two gallons back into the tank. Ensure the water is of a ph, salinity, and temperature equal to that of the rest of the tank.Place your jellyfish back into their tank, using the same plastic bag method that you used to move them to the quarantine tank.
Keep your jellyfish submerged at all times.
Once each month, perform the same cleaning process but empty and replace 50% of the water, rather than just 20%.

, Jellyfish require a pH level of between 8 and 8.4.Buy a hand-held pH meter and check the pH at least once a week. If your water is deionized and at the appropriate salinity, and your pumps are working properly, you shouldn’t have any trouble with pH levels.


You should also add a chemical filtration to maintain pH levels. Chemical filtration is an additive you can use to remove phosphates and other organic compounds that can discolor your aquarium water, produce unpleasant odors, and encourage algae to grow.Activated carbon and resins are the most common types of chemical filtration media. You can obtain these at local pet stores or online.
If you continue to have trouble with you tank’s pH levels, change the water and check your pumps. Consult a veterinarian if you continue to have problems with your jellyfish habitat’s pH levels.

Allow jellyfish to adjust.,
Remove about half the water from the jellyfish bag.You could use a measuring cup or ladle to remove the water.,
Fill the bag halfway with tank water.With half the water from the bag poured out, you’ll need to fill it back up with tank water.",How to Maintain a Jellyfish Tank3," When moving jellyfish from a store-bought bag to its own tank, place the jellyfish -- still sealed in its bag -- in the water. This will allow the water in the bag to warm or cool to the temperature of the water in the tank. Do not remove the jellyfish from its bag.Wait about ten minutes for the jellyfish to acclimate.

, Whatever you do, don’t dump the water out of the bag, since you’ll run the risk of dumping your jellyfish out along with it.


If moving jellyfish from one tank to another, place it in a plastic bag of an appropriate size. The jellyfish must have room to move. A small jellyfish can be placed in a big plastic bag, and a larger jellyfish can be placed in a very large plastic bag.

, You might be able to add water to the bag by holding the top edge of the bag just above the level of the water in the tank, then dipping one corner of the bag down slightly below the level of the water, allowing water to fill it.


Alternately, you could try filling the bag with tank water using a ladle or measuring cup.
Keep the jellyfish sealed in its bag, and keep the bag in the water for another ten minutes.
When the ten minutes are up, remove the jellyfish from the bag. Open it at the top and carefully pull it down the length of the jellyfish, then move it away and out of the water.

Add starfish to well-established tanks.,
Make sure the temperature is correct.,
Contact your supplier to determine the salinity of its tanks.",How to Acclimate Starfish1," Do not place a starfish in a new aquarium or one that has not had time to reach a balance with the fish and the chemistry of the water. Starfish are generally too fragile to accept the adjustments that a new tank needs.Even if your tank is well established, do not introduce a starfish to a tank where copper medication has been used recently. Copper is toxic to starfish.;
, Starfish need to be in water that is between 22ºC and 26ºC (71.6 to 78.8 degrees Fahrenheit). Make sure that the water in your tank is this warm before starting the acclimation process.Most tropical fish tanks should be kept at between 25° to 27°C (76° to 80°F), so you should not have to adjust the temperature much to accommodate the starfish., Your starfish may have an easier time adapting to its new environment if your tank has salinity close to your supplier's. If buying a starfish from your local aquarium store, this information will be easy to get when you make your purchase. However, if you order a starfish online, you will need to contact the seller and ask them for the information.Keeping the starfish in the same salinity that it is used to will require that your other aquarium residents can thrive in that salinity as well. If they can't, then you will need to adjust the starfish to a new salinity.

Equalize the temperature in the temporary container and the aquarium.,
Establish a drip line between your established aquarium and the starfish's temporary container.,
Set the drip rate to 2 to 4 drops per second.,
Repeat the process several times.,
Move the starfish into the tank.",How to Acclimate Starfish2," Begin by floating the temporary container in the tank to make sure that both are the same temperature. Hopefully they are close to the same temperature, so this will only take about 10 to 15 minutes.In most cases, your starfish will come in a plastic bag. If this is sealed tight, it can be floated on the top of the tank water to equalize the temperature.

, Place the starfish's temporary container next to the aquarium. In order to slowly acclimate the starfish to its new tank, you will need to place the temporary container next to the tank and run a drip line between them.Drip lines are typically available at aquarium stores and online aquarium suppliers. They typically come with parts at the end that can control the flow of liquid.

, In order to make the acclimation of the starfish gradual, you should introduce the new water very slowly. As such, the drip method will take quite a bit of time. Start the siphoning and then assess how fast it is dripping.Plan for at least 2 hours when introducing a starfish to its new environment. Starfish are very fragile during the acclimation phase to a new aquarium, and the whole process must be taken slowly.

, Watch the level of the water in the shipping container and once it is full, dump out half of it. Then begin dripping in tank water once again. You should do this process several times in order to get the starfish acclimated to its new tank.When you dump out half of the water, put it down the drain, not back into the tank. This will assure that the tank levels remain balanced.

, Once you have added tank water into the temporary container for several hours, you can move the starfish into its new home. As quickly as you can, lift the starfish out of its temporary tank and place it on a rock in its new tank. The goal should be to limit its exposure to the air as much as possible."
"
Equalize the temperature of the container and the tank.,
Add tank water to the shipping container.,
Remove half of the water in the shipping container.,
Repeat this process again.,
Move the starfish into the aquarium.",How to Acclimate Starfish3," Float the starfish's temporary container in the aquarium. You should keep the water separate until the temperatures are the same. This should take about 10 to 15 minutes.While the starfish should have been shipped in a container that kept it at a reasonable temperature, it is likely that the temperature is not ideal. However, even if the temperature is not ideal, do not speed up the acclimation process. Your starfish needs time to get used to changes, even if they are for the good of the creature.

, Put 1/2 cup (.25 pt) of water from the tank every 5 minutes until the shipping container has been filled. This will get the starfish used to the new water's pH level.Adding the tank water in gradually will give the starfish the chance to get used to its new environment.

, Once you have the shipping container full, you will want to dump half of that water down the drain. Do not put it back into the aquarium, so that you don't disrupt the balance of the tank.


Removing the water will give you room to add more tank water to the starfish's shipping container. It is allowing you to continue gradually acclimating your starfish to its new water.
You can use the same cup you were using to add water to remove the water.

, Once again, add tank water to the shipping container and then dump some of the water in the shipping container out. Like before, add a 1/2 cup (.25 pt) of water from the tank into the shipping container. Do this every 5 minutes, so that the change continues to be gradual.Then dump half of the water out of the shipping container and begin filling it from the tank once again.
Repeat this process several times.

, Once you have acclimated the starfish to its new water, you can move it into its new home. Remove the starfish from the shipping container and place it on a rock in the aquarium.Do not expose the starfish to the air during the acclimation process, since starfish are very sensitive to changes in oxygen.
Watch to see that the starfish moves around on the rock. This could take a few minutes.

Pick a type of starfish.,
Order your starfish.,
Examine your starfish once it arrives.",How to Acclimate Starfish4," There are a variety of types of starfish that can be kept in aquariums. Ask what types are available at your local aquarium store and search online retailers for options. Some types of starfish that can be kept in aquariums include:Bahama stars
Linckia starfish
Sand cleaning sea stars
Marble sea stars
Harlequin serpent stars
Chocolate chip starfish

, Find an aquarium store in your area that sells starfish or can order one for you. You can also order one from an online retailer directly. A reputable online supplier should have healthy creatures and should know how to ship starfish properly.If the creature is less stressed when shipped, it is more likely to survive.

, If you ordered your starfish online, you will need to look it over right away when it is delivered. Check for discoloration, spots, or injury and make sure the starfish's body is firm before starting the acclimation process.Contact your supplier immediately if you notice anything that may be suspicious or wrong.

Use an aquarium lamp with a timer to simulate night and day.,
Keep fish and other microfauan in your coral aquarium.,
Purchase fish foods that can also be eaten by coral.,
Feed your fish.,
Leave your fish and other microfauna in the aquarium with your coral.,
Feed your coral directly if necessary.",How to Feed Coral1," All coral rely on photosynthesis for part of their nutritional needs. An aquarium light with a timer will allow your coral to feed itself.Coral photosynthesize through zooxanthellae algae, which grows on their surface and gives coral their vivid colors.Light alone will keep most coral alive but will not allow them to thrive.;
, The waste products of these creatures will be used to indirectly feed your coral.


Damselfish, Clownfish, Blue Green Chromis, and Firefish all fit in well with a coral environment.Microfauna are the critters that live alongside coral in the ocean. Sponges, sea squirts, and marine worms are microfauna that will thrive alongside your coral and help to keep them healthy and well fed., These include phytoplankton, krill, shrimp, squid, or clams., Feed your fish using the instructions on the box. Small bits of the food will naturally drift in the water, allowing your coral to eat it up., The fish will digest the food and excrete detritus and dissolved organic compounds. Your coral will naturally feed on this residue., If you notice your coral looking unhealthy, you may need to feed them directly."

Feed your coral two to three times a week.,
Purchase coral foods with different particle sizes.,
Refer to the food containers for serving sizes.,
Mix the three foods together with salt water from your aquarium.,
Let the food mixture soak for 10 minutes.,
Turn off the flow in your tank.,
Keep the lights on.,
Fill a baster or coral feeding pipette with the food mixture.,
Target feed your coral.,
Turn the flow back on in your tank.",How to Feed Coral2," Wait one to two days between each feeding. You should notice an improvement in your coral’s health.

, Coral polyps come in many different shapes and sizes. Smaller polyps will not be able to take in large particles of food, while larger polyps will prefer large particles of food. Mixing together a variety of foods with different particle sizes will give you the best results.Three foods with different particle sizes is enough to feed most coral.There are many options for coral foods. Any combination of copepods, rotifers, and marine plankton, will work., Different foods with different particle sizes will have different serving sizes. It’s important to get the serving sizes right so you don’t end up with extra food floating around in your tank.


Overfeeding your coral can lead to a buildup of nitrates in your aquarium. Nitrates are toxic to coral. If you stick to the serving sizes on the food containers, this won’t be a problem., Measure out the serving sizes for each of your three foods. Place in a bowl or other container. Mix in enough salt water to soak all of the foods., This will allow the food to dissolve into the salt water.It’s OK to let it soak for more than 10 minutes. Just don’t let it soak for less than 10 minutes.If you make extra food, you can store it in your refrigerator in a sealed container., This will allow you to target feed each coral without the food drifting away., Feed your coral at the end of the day when the daytime lights on your aquarium are still running.You want to mimic a natural environment as much as possible in your aquarium. Coral are most active in the evening before the sun goes down. Feeding your coral in the evening will ensure they absorb the most nutrients.If you forget to feed your coral in the evening, it’s OK to do a make-up feeding during the day., You can use a regular cooking baster for this or purchase a specialized pipette.You can fill it all up at once or fill it with a small amount of food and feed one coral at a time., Place the tip of the baster or pipette into the tank. Get the tip close to the individual polyps. Squirt a small amount of the food mixture near each polyp.Squirt the food mixture out gently so you don’t damage your coral., This will allow fish in your saltwater tank to feed on the leftover coral food and will help to keep the aquarium clean."

Purchase a large disposable plastic syringe from a pharmacy.,
Purchase a screw top plastic jar of suitable size to store the organisms until they can be decanted.

,
Cut open the end of the syringe.,
Use the end of the syringe and a fine felt tip marker to mark the position for the hole in the lid of the jar.,
Cut this hole using whatever tools you have that work best.,
Pierce a pair of small holes adjacent to the loading hole for the bungee spring which will close the flap.,
Pierce a few small holes in the far side of the lid to allow water to escape when transferring organisms from the syringe to the jar.,
Cut a small piece of flat plastic sheet for the flap.,
Thread a short length of thin (about 2mm) bungee cord (shock cord) through the holes in the lid and flap.,
Test the function of the flap by fitting the lid to the jar and inserting the syringe through the transfer hole.",How to Make a Collecting Syringe and Jar for Small Marine Invertebrates," The 60ml size is suitable for many organisms and is easily available.;
,, Take care to leave a small flange to prevent the plunger being pushed out the end. This can be done using a hacksaw and a round file. The end of the syringe will probably be a flat cone with the needle nozzle offset to one side. Cut off most of the cone and file the edges until the remaining flange is about 1mm wide all round. This is not a critical dimension. The syringe is now functional. A useful accessory is a small bungee lanyard which can be slipped over the wrist to prevent accidental loss.

, Be careful to put the hole fairly close to the side , but clear of the thread. The reason for this is to allow space for the spring-loaded flap closure.

, A bell punch is quick but may not be available in the ideal size, but the hole can be filed to correct the size and shape. If all else fails, a carpet knife will do the job, bur cut undersize and file to a reasonably close fit for the syringe, which should enter the hole easily, but with small clearance all round.

, These may be drilled or pierced with a heated wire. These holes should be just beyond the edge of the loading hole to allow the syringe to push the flap open when inserted into the loading hole.

, These holes should be too small for the organisms to escape through them. 1mm to 2mm diameter is usually appropriate. Use as many as you find convenient. A large number of holes allows the transfer to be done faster.

, This must be stiff enough to remain flat. Pierce two holes to correspond with the bungee spring holes in the lid. The flap should be straight sided adjacent to the holes and parallel to the line between their centres. and should fit completely over the transfer hole, but clear the thread at the edge of the lid.

, Tie the ends to hold the flap in place on the underside of the lid. Ensure that the flap allows clearance for the jar to screw onto the lid.

, The flap should open into the jar and automatically close when the syringe is removed.

Remove jellyfish that become too big for the tank.",How to Start a Jellyfish Tank," You can house your jellyfish in an aquarium tank that is clean and sterile. You may decide to have only one to three small jellyfish in a small tank that you can fit on your desk at work or at home. Or, you may go for a medium sized aquarium tank that can fit a larger number of jellyfish. Look for a tank that is circular in shape or tall and narrow.A tank that is circular, with a flat base, is ideal as the shape can allow your jellyfish to float in the tank water. This is essential for the health and happiness of your jellyfish.;
, The other option is to buy a tank kit that is made specifically to house jellyfish. These tanks come in a small size, which is usually circular in shape to house one to three small jellyfish. You can also get tall, narrow tanks for a larger number of jellyfish. You can purchase jellyfish tank kits online or at your local pet store.Keep in mind jellyfish tank kits are not cheap, ranging from $350 - $600. You may want to try using an aquarium tank instead to save money on your set up., Most jellyfish tank kits come with the supplies necessary for setting up the tank. If you are using a fish aquarium to house your jellyfish, you will need to purchase several other supplies, including:An air pump
An undergravel filter plate
An air tube
Airline tubing
Substrate for the bottom of the tank, such as glass beads
An LED light
An LED remote control (optional)

, Jellyfish do well in dark environments. Make sure you place the tank on a flat, raised spot in your home or office that does not get direct sunlight and is not near any heat sources or electrical equipment.A low table in your home in a dark spot or the top of a desk would work. You could also get a small raised wooden stand for your home or office and place the tank on top of that.

, Connect the filter plates together and place the air tube in the center of the filter plates. Depending on which filter plates you buy, they may come in several small parts or one to two larger parts. You want the air tube to be in the middle of the tank so it can circulate air throughout the tank.You may need to trim off one side of one of the plates to make it fit with the rest of the plates. You can do this using scissors or an X-ACTO knife.
Place the filter plate and the air tube in the tank. The plates should cover the bottom of the tank and fit snugly when you slide it into the tank.

, Substrate is going to help to hide the filter plates in the tank. You should use glass beads, rather than sand or gravel. Gravel can be a hazard for your jellyfish. Place the beads into the tank by hand so they do not break or nick the tank.Look for glass beads at your local dollar store or online. Glass beads that are the size of jelly beans are ideal substrate for your tank. You should fill the tank with at least one layer of substrate, or 2 inches of glass beads for a medium sized tank.

, Once the substrate is in the tank, you can connect the air tube to the air pump. Do this by using the airline tubing.Place the airline tubing into the air tube so it is dangling a few inches into the tube. Then, connect the airline tubing to the air pump. This will allow you to cycle through air into the tank using the air pump.

, Jellyfish are salt water animals so you will need to use salt water only in the tank. You can make your own salt water using aquarium salt or buy pre-mixed salt water at your local pet store.To make salt water for your tank, you can use aquarium salt or ionic salt. You should dissolve the salt crystals in reverse-osmosis filtered water or distilled water, making sure there are no big chunks of salt in the water. Do not use tap water as it contains elements that could be harmful for your jellyfish.
Once you add the salt water, smooth over the glass beads with your hand so they are even at the bottom of the tank.

, Once you do this, you should let the tank run for at least 12 hours. During this time, the water should turn from cloudy to clear.Some jellyfish tank owners will add in the jellyfish to the tank right away and then do daily water changes. The water changes help to control the ammonia levels down in the tank. However, letting the tank cycle through before adding the jellyfish will ensure your new pets stay healthy in their tank.

, You can get test kits for aquariums that will allow you to test the tank water for these elements. You should do this once the tank water has cycled through and appears clear in the tank. The test should show a built up of ammonia, followed by a rise in nitrite as the ammonia level goes down. Nitrate will then start to appear as the nitrite level falls.Ideally, you should have ammonia and nitrate at 0.0ppm in the tank. You may have lower nitrate levels, at around 20ppm. Once these elements are at these levels, you are clear to add jellyfish into your tank.

, You should search for online pet supply stores that specialize in jellyfish and offer a money back guarantee. Most jellyfish supply stores offer moon jellyfish or blue blubber jellyfish, though you can find other varieties for your tank. The jellyfish will be shipped to you alive in plastic bags.Alternatively, you can buy jellyfish in person at a pet supply store. Talk to a sales associate to ensure they are knowledgeable about the jellyfish they are selling. You want to buy jellyfish that are floating and moving in a tank already, with bright, healthy looking tentacles. Often, pet supply stores will have a specialty area for jellyfish and other sea animals.
A species of jellyfish called moon jellyfish do best in home aquariums. Moon jellyfish are seasonal animals and usually live between 6 to 12 months., Your jellyfish tank is a closed system, so you do not want to crowd the tank with too many jellyfish or jellyfish that are various sizes. The larger jellyfish will end up outgrowing the smaller jellies and over power them. The smaller jellies will then shrink in size and not fare as well as the bigger jellies.You should also only buy one species of jellyfish for your tank. For example, you may decide to have only moon jellyfish in your tank or only blue blubber jellyfish in your tank. Most jellyfish species do better with the same species in one tank., Your jellyfish will come in clear plastic bags. You should start by making sure the tank has been cycled completely and has healthy nitrate levels. You will then need about twenty minutes per bag of jellyfish to acclimate your new pets to their tank.Place the sealed bag of jellies on the surface of your tank for 10 minutes. This will help bring the water in the bag to the same temperature as the tank water.
After 10 minutes, open the bag and remove half of the water with a clean cup. Then, add tank water to the bag, making sure the amount of tank water is equal to the bag water you removed.
After another 10 minutes, you can slowly release your jelly into your tank. Use an aquarium net to gently release them. Do not pour them out into the tank as this can shock them.

, It may take your jellyfish a few hours to acclimate to their new home. Once they are comfortable, they will pulse and move in the tank, usually about three to four times every minute.You should observe your jellyfish over the next few days to ensure they appear to be moving and pulsing comfortably in your tank.
If your jellyfish appears to have turned inside, a process known as eversion, your water temperature may be off. Jellyfish should be kept in water temperatures of 24 degrees Celsius to 28 degrees Celsius. You may need to adjust your water temperature and test your water again to ensure it has the proper ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate levels., You can get live or frozen baby brine shrimp at your local pet store or online. You should feed your jellies twice a day, once in the morning and once at night.Live shrimp brine will keep in the refrigerator for up to two weeks. You can feed the jellyfish through a small opening in the tank to prevent getting stung by their tentacles. The jellyfish should catch and ingest the food on their own.Do not overfeed your jellies, as this could compromise the water quality in the tank. If you have smaller and bigger jellyfish in the tank, you may not be able to encourage the smaller ones to grow and stay healthy by overfeeding them, anyway.

, To maintain healthy water quality in your tank, you should do a 10% water change once a week. This means that you will change out 10% of the water and replace it with new salt water.Remember to test the water quality after each water change. The salinity level should be 34-55 ppt, which is closest to natural seawater. You should also confirm the ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate levels are correct in the tank.

, With the right care, your jellyfish should grow to a healthy size. You can prevent overcrowding by only having a few jellyfish in your tank at a time. If your jellyfish appear to outgrow your tank or if you feel your tank is overcrowded, you may need to remove one of your jellyfish. To do this, do not release the jellyfish into the wild via the ocean or a body of water. It is illegal to do this and puts the jellyfish’s life at risk.Instead, you should contact the seller you bought the jellyfish from to then arrange for a new home or caretaker for the jellyfish.

This microchip will ensure your pet is properly identified when he reaches the UK.Keep in mind microchips do not act as GPS devices or tracking devices for your pet. Instead, they contain a radio-frequency identification that acts as a permanent ID for your pet. The microchip procedure is painless for your pet and can be done at your vet’s office.Not all microchips use the same reader. To ensure the chip can be read, you can purchase one that is compatible with the chip, or you can ask your vet what type of chip has been implanted and then contact the UK DEFRA organization to see if the readers are compatible. If the chip cannot be read, you pet will likely be put into quarantine.;
, This is a required step in the process of bringing your pet to the UK. You will need to have your pet vaccinated for rabies even if he has a current rabies vaccination.Make sure this information is recorded in your pet's passport on on their health certificate.

, If your pet is a dog and you are planning to have him shipped to the UK, you will need to have him treated with an approved product containing praziquantel, which is effective at killing the tapeworms (Echinococcus multilocularis).The treatment must be be approved for use in the country in which it’s being given.
If your dog has tapeworm, your veterinarian should apply the treatment for tapeworm no more than five days before your pet is scheduled to be shipped to the UK, and the treatment should be recorded on your pet’s health certificate to show he has been treated for tapeworm.

, Your vet can provide you with a copy of your pet’s health certificate stating the pet is free from infectious disease and healthy enough to travel. The certificate should confirm that your pet has received his rabies vaccine and has been treated for tapeworm, if applicable.Your pet should travel within 10 days of the certificate being issued. The certificate is valid for four months if your pet does any more travelling within the UK. The certificate will be reviewed and stamped by an official when your pet first enters the UK.

, Many vets can provide a pet passport for your pet. If your vet does not have access to a pet passport, ask her to refer you to a vet nearby that does give out pet passports or contact the Animal and Plant Health Agency of the UK here: https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening. You should check that your vet has filled out the following information in the passport:The details of ownership, including the full owner name(s).

If you are traveling between states with him, you will probably need a certificate of health from your veterinarian as proof that your small pet is disease-free.Even if you are staying within the state, making sure that he is healthy is still a good idea.


Ask your veterinarian for a copy of your small pet’s medical records.If your small pet is on any medication, make sure that you will have enough to make it through the trip. If not, obtain a refill from your veterinarian.If your veterinarian determines that your small pet is not healthy enough for travel, consider keeping him at home and making plans for someone to take care of him while you are gone. Keep in mind that most small pets would prefer to stay at home rather than travel.;
, Make a list of the veterinary hospitals at your destination. Doing this beforehand will help alleviate the stress of finding a veterinarian in case your small pet needs emergency medical care during your trip.Alternatively, you could bookmark the websites of the veterinary hospitals on your phone or laptop.

, It will probably not be practical to place a collar and identification tag on your small pet. As an alternative, place an identification tag on your small pet’s travel carrier and regular cage that contains his name and your phone number., Do your research to identify the pet-friendly hotels in the area where you will be traveling. Be mindful that a pet-friendly hotel may not have many rooms in which they accommodate travelers with pets. In addition, you may have to pay a hefty convenience fee to reserve a pet-friendly room., Travel carriers are available at your local pet store. Pick a carrier that is well ventilated, escape proof, and has enough space for your small pet’s food, water, and toys. If you are traveling by car, the carrier should be able to be secured and fastened in by a seatbelt.Keep in mind that you should bring your small pet’s regular cage with you as well.The travel carrier should be used only when you are in the car or on the plane.
Be sure to pack plenty of fresh bedding for his carrier and regular cage.
In addition to visiting your local pet store, you can talk with your veterinarian for recommendations on travel carriers.

, Your first aid kit will be your first line of treatment in case your small pet becomes sick or injured during your trip. There are a number of items that should be included in the first aid kit, including bandaging material, tweezers, and contact information for veterinary hospitals and poison control.If you feel like you don’t have the time to put the first aid kit together yourself, you can purchase one online.


Be aware that the kit is not necessarily a substitute for taking him to a veterinarian, especially if his sickness or injury is serious.

, Even though you may be able to relax your dietary standards on the trip, your small pet will need to stay on his regular diet to keep him healthy and less stressed. If you are not sure of the water quality at your destination, pack bottled water for your small pet. Start giving him the bottled water before your trip so that he can get used to the taste.Storing his food in airtight containers will help to keep it fresh.Since fresh produce could spoil, consider buying fruits and vegetables at your destination to feed your small pet.

, Keeping your small pet’s cage and carrier clean will be necessary for the duration of your trip. Supplies that you will need include paper towels, pet-safe disinfectant, and a scrub brush.You can purchase all of these supplies at your local grocery and pet stores.

, Place plenty of his regular bedding in the carrier. To keep him entertained, place some of his favorite toys in the carrier as well. However, do not put a lot of toys in the carrier—if you have to come to a sudden stop, the toys could fly up and injure your small pet. You should also avoid putting swinging toys in his carrier, since these could easily injure him if you have to stop suddenly.Placing a toilet paper roll in his carrier will give him a comfortable place to hide.Consider covering the carrier with a towel to give him a dark and quiet space in which he could feel more comfortable.Giving him chew toys will also help keep him busy and entertained during the trip.

, The trip will be less stressful for your small pet if he is able to continue eating at his regular times. When it is time to feed him, use a deep food cup that you can attach to the side of the carrier to prevent the food from making a mess inside the carrier. Have one dish for his pellets and another one for fresh produce.Feed him less than you would if you were at home.He may experience some digestive upset if you feed him too much during the trip.
Be aware that small pets may not want to eat in a moving car.When you stop, consider giving him time to eat before getting back on the road.

, Your small pet must have fresh water at all times.However, keeping your small pet hydrated without making a mess in his carrier could be tricky. Consider placing a small water bottle in his carrier rather than a water dish.Water bottles that are ideal for travel carriers are available at your local pet store.

, If your small pet is not used to taking trips in the car, you will need to get him comfortable with this before your actual travel date. Place him in his carrier and begin taking him on short car rides in your local area.If he seems to be comfortable, gradually take him on longer car rides. Consult with your veterinarian if your small pet is unable to relax while in the car.

, After placing your small pet in his travel carrier, secure it in the backseat with a seat belt. Securing the carrier with a seat belt will prevent it from moving around during the car ride. It is safer to have the carrier in the backseat, since having your small pet’s carrier in the front passenger seat can put him at risk of being injured by the air bag if you get into an accident., During these stops, take the time to check on your small pet and play with him to make more comfortable.If necessary, the stop would also allow you to clean his cage and replenish his water.



Never leave your small pet unattended in the car during a stop, especially during the summer.Small pets are very prone to overheating, which can become a serious medical problem requiring immediate veterinary care.

, Traveling by car is the best way to travel with a small pet. In fact, the Humane Society of the United States advises traveling with pets by air only when absolutely necessary.However, if your destination necessitates travel by plane, you will need to familiarize yourself with your airline’s rules and regulations for pet travel.Make sure to check the regulations before purchasing your ticket.
The website http://petfriendlytravel.com/airtravel provides helpful information on each airlines’ regulations regarding pet travel.
Be aware that not all airlines permit travel with small pets.Also, keep in mind that airlines that allow travel with small pets may require them to stay in the baggage compartment. If this is the case, talk with your veterinarian about ways to keep your small pet comfortable when traveling in the baggage compartment.
If you are uncomfortable with the possibility of having to stow your small pet without being able to see him, you may want to consider traveling by car instead.

, You do not want to find out when you are on the plane that your small pet’s carrier is too large to fit under the seat in front of you. To prevent this from happening, consider calling the airline on which you will be traveling and provide them with the carrier’s dimensions. If the carrier is too large, purchase a smaller one at your local pet store.


Keep in mind that your airline may charge an additional carry-on fee for your small pet.Your airline may also specify whether the kennel should be hard- or soft-sided, and will likely require that the carrier be ventilated and leak proof., Even with being able to carry your small pet on the plane, transferring planes could be very stressful for him. In addition, it could add more complications for you, especially if you check his regular carrier. Booking a direct flight will lessen the likelihood of his regular carrier getting lost and will make the trip less stressful for the both of you., Placing him in his regular cage will help your small pet adjust to the new location. Place his bedding, food and water dishes, and toys in the cage before you transfer him. Set up the cage in a quiet area of the room that is out of direct sunlight and drafts.Continue keeping his cage clean while you are at your destination., Small pets need a lot of daily exercise. Whether you are staying in a hotel room or at someone’s house, find a safe area where you can set up a play area for your small pet.In addition to meeting his daily exercise needs, the exercise will allow him to release any pent-up stress that he had during the car (or plane) ride.

, Just like with being in the car, you will need to do your best to maintain your small pet’s regular schedule when you arrive at your destination.Keep his feeding and playing times consistent. The more regular you can keep his schedule, the better he will acclimate and the less stressed he will be.

, You will need to clean his cage at least several times, depending on the length of your trip. If you happen to run out of cleaning supplies, pick up some more at a local grocery or pet store. Be sure to replace any soiled or damp bedding. In addition, promptly remove any uneaten food to keep it from spoiling.


As you clean his cage, look at the consistency and amount of his droppings. Unusual droppings may signal a medical problem."

One of the most important factors of this decision is whether or not your pet is physically healthy enough to make the move. Air travel can be hard on pets, so you should make sure he does not have any underlying health problems.Your vet will want to perform blood tests and vaccinations on your pet. He may also need a microchip.
Ask your vet to help you learn about the medical requirements for moving a pet abroad. He is your best resource for any health related questions.
If your pet is older, he may also need certain tests to determine the health of his heart and blood pressure.;
, Quarantine means that when you arrive in your new country, your pet might be required to stay under medical observation. Quarantine lengths are determined by the health and safety laws of each individual country. When you are planning a move, one of the first things to do is to look into the quarantine requirements of your new home.The countries of the world have been divided into rabies-free countries, rabies-controlled countries, and high-rabies countries.
Whether or not your pet needs to be quarantined depends on what type of country you are moving from and what type of country you are moving to.
For example, if you are moving from a rabies-free country to many other countries, you will be able to enter without quarantine and with minimal paperwork.
There are several websites that you can use to determine the quarantine restrictions in each country. Most governments have websites dedicated to telling you the rules for taking your pet in and out of that country.An organization called the International Pet and Animal Transportation Association (IPATA) offers multiple resources for checking the resources for multiple locations. This organization also provides information about paperwork.

, In addition to quarantine rules, you need to learn about what types of vaccines your pet needs and what paperwork he requires. Each country has different restrictions on domestic animals entering the country. If you are moving to a country in the European Union, you will need an EU Health Certificate.In the EU, you also need records of your pet's rabies vaccination, microchip certificate, and a letter from your vet.
Contact the department of health in whatever country you are moving to. They can tell you precisely what paperwork you will need.
Many people choose to use a pet relocation service. These businesses will look into all of the requirements, and arrange the paperwork and travel logistics for your pet.

, It is important to make sure that your pet can emotionally handle traveling and a big move. If your pet suffers from anxiety, a long flight might harm him psychologically. Most vets discourage the use of sedatives, so it is best to figure out if your pet will naturally be able to stay calm during a flight.Talk to your vet about your pet's emotional health.
You should also think about ways to make the travel bearable for your pet. Look for flights that have the shortest flying times and the least amount of layovers.

, Organizing an overseas move is a challenge. It is important to realize that just like yourself, your pet requires a lot of organization before moving. You cannot just decide on the spur of the moment to move your pet. Typically, moving a pet overseas requires months of planning.Depending on which country you move to, there may be a certain time frame for vaccinations. For example, sometimes your pet may need his vaccinations 3-6 months before arriving in the new country.
Once you have researched the requirements, meet with your vet to discuss a potential timeline.
When you are deciding whether or not to move your pet, take into account that he may not be able to move with you as soon as you are ready.

, Airlines have different policies regarding pet travel. Start contacting airlines to ask about the specific qualifications for traveling with your type of pet. For example, some airlines may allow your cat to be stowed under your seat in a carrier. Others will require him to travel in the cargo area.Ask the airline whether they practice pet-safety policies. These policies include always keeping animals in a climate controlled area, making sure that pets are the first ones off the plane and the last ones on, and a promise to never leave animals sitting on the tarmac.
If you decide to travel with your pet, purchase the travel crate well in advance. Give your pet a chance to get used to being in the carrier.

, When you have decided to move, you need to investigate your new home from your pet's perspective. Research local vets and contact one of them to ask about his practice. Also, consider what type of home you will have. Does it have enough room for your pet to be comfortable?If you have a dog, consider whether your new home is dog friendly. Will you have a yard? Or is there a dog park nearby where your dog can play?
Ask your current vet to help you find a new vet.

, Giving up a pet can be emotionally difficult. After all, pets are part of your family. Spend some time thinking carefully about how you will feel if you leave your pet behind. Will guilt be a factor? Could it lead to sadness or depression?You should also spend time thinking about what is best for your pet. If you move him and he doesn't handle the move well, that can be emotionally draining, too.
Ask for advice. If you have friends or family who have had to make this difficult decision, reach out to them and ask if they can offer insight.

, Moving a pet can be very expensive. You will need to pay for extra vet visits, and it can be costly to obtain all of the required tests and vaccines. It is also very pricey to travel with a pet. You will likely need to pay for a separate airline ticket for him.If you use a pet relocation service, that can make the process easier. However, that is an additional expense that you will need to consider.
You should also take into account that you will most likely need to purchase a new travel crate for your pet. Depending on his size, this can be expensive.

, When you are planning an overseas move, you will likely run into several unexpected expenses. Try to make a thorough financial plan. Factor in all of the expenses involved in relocating your pet.If you are in the military, there are many ways that you can save on the cost of moving a pet.
Many airlines will offer you a discounted rate. There are also charitable organizations that can help defray the costs.

, Thinking about the logistics of moving a pet can be very overwhelming. If you think it over and are not sure whether your pet can handle the move, you might want to consider other options. When you are making a big decision like this, it is important to weigh all of your options.First of all, think about the length of your move. Are you only planning to be gone for a year or so? Then maybe it would be best to leave your pet behind.
Consider your vet's advice. If he seems to have reservations about your pet's ability to successfully move overseas, it might be in the best interests of his health to find him a new home.

, The ideal solution would probably be for a friend or family member to take your pet. You would feel better knowing he was in a caring home, and you would likely be able to remain in contact with your pet. Carefully explain your situation, and answer any questions about your pet.Make it clear that you don't need an answer immediately. Give your friend or family member time to consider your request.
If your immediate friends and family cannot help, reach out to your extended social network. Make posts on social media describing your pet and your situation. Ask your friends to post, too.

, There are many types of animal rescue organizations. Some are breed specific, while some help all types of animals. Contact your local shelter and ask if they have re-homing programs.You can also ask your vet's office if they know of anyone who would take your pet. They might know an animal lover looking for a new companion.
The most important thing is to make sure that you are placing your pet in a caring, safe home. Do not ever just release your pet into the wild.

Call the driver’s number displayed on Lyft.,
Inform the driver that you have your pet with you.,
Take the ride.,
Know the law.,
Don't pretend your dog is a service dog if it isn't.",How to Bring a Pet on a Lyft Ride," Tap the app’s icon from your phone’s home screen to open it.;
, Tap the “Request a Lyft” button from the app’s screen, and the nearest driver will arrive to pick you up.


You’ll also receive some basic information about the driver, including his or her name, the car they’re driving, and their contact number

, Take your phone and immediately contact the Lyft driver before he or she comes to pick you up.

, Let the driver know that you’re with your pet before they arrive so that they know what to expect and make needed adjustments.


If you are a service dog handler traveling with your legitimate service dog (one that performs trained tasks to mitigate your disability) you do not have to call the driver. You may choose to but, by federal law, you are not required to call ahead.
Drivers with medical conditions like allergies have logical reasons why they need to decline from giving you a ride. However, the law still protects service dog handlers and their dogs. If a driver must refuse you for medical reasons, they must notify Lyft immediately and Lyft must send another driver to you immediately.
Lyft abides to the American Disability Act and has a No-Discrimination policy, which covers people who have service animals. Drivers who decline to give a lift to people with service dogs will be banned and removed from the Lyft service.

, Once you’ve properly informed the Lyft driver of your companion, just wait for them to arrive and come pick you up on the designated location.

, In the US, federal law (The Americans with Disabilities Act or ADA) only protects people with legitimate Service Dogs. A Lyft driver is required to transport a service dog handler and their dog and only required to transport a service dog and handler.

, It is against the law and punishable by a large fine to falsely represent your pet or companion dog as a service dog. Companion dogs, therapy dogs and emotional support dogs are not service dogs. Although a service dog handler can, if they choose to, call Lyft to tell them they are traveling with their service dog they are not required to.

Bring along a human companion.,
Don’t let your pet roam in the vehicle.,
Keep your pet’s head inside the vehicle.,
Take lots of rest stops.,
Don’t leave your pet alone in the automobile.,
Never transport a pet in the back of a pickup truck.",How to Handle Holiday Travel with Your Pet1," Traveling with your pet via automobile will be much easier if you don’t do it alone. If possible, take along a friend or family member on your holiday road trip. Your human companion will be able to help you with any issues that might arise, and can keep your pet company in the back seat if needed., If you are taking your pet on a holiday road trip, it’s important that they do not roam while you are driving. Allowing your pet to have free range of the vehicle can lead to accidents. For example, if your airbag deploys and your pet is in the front seat, it can cause injury. Instead, make sure you pet is in a kennel or carrier for the duration of the journey., While traveling with your pet in an automobile, you must make sure they keep their head in the car at all times. Allowing your pet to hang their head out of the window can be dangerous. Pets can get debris in their eyes or have cold air forced down their lungs., When embarking on a holiday road trip with your pet, make sure you plan for plenty of breaks. Your pet will need to get outside, stretch its legs, and take a potty break. This is especially true for overly anxious pets, or those with physical problems that might limit bladder control.

, You should never, under any circumstances, leave your pet alone in a vehicle. Temperatures within a vehicle can rise or fall quickly, putting your pet at risk of injury or death. When traveling with your pet, make sure you always take them out of the vehicle when you leave it., Unless the back of your pickup truck is covered and heated, you should never transport your pet in the bed of your truck. There are multiple dangers associated with doing so, including damage to your pet’s eyes, ears, and nose. Pets can also be easily ejected from the back of a truck, and riding in the bed of a pickup truck increases the risk your pet will jump ship, which can result in extreme injury or death."

Understand the risks of air travel.,
Get the proper health clearances.,
Choose cabin travel if possible.,
Take precautions if your dog flies in the cargo hold.,
Do not feed your pet for 4-6 hours before the flight.,
Clip your pet’s nails before air travel.,
Do not give your pet tranquilizers.",How to Handle Holiday Travel with Your Pet2," Before you decide to travel in an airplane with your pet, it is important that you consider all the risks involved in this type of travel. Flying can be terrifying for animals, and extreme conditions cause animals to die on flights every year. Do your research and consider reconsidering your decision to fly with your pet., Many airlines and countries require that your pet have proper health clearances before traveling. This often includes a certificate of health along with proof of vaccinations. Check with your air carrier and country of origin and destination to get information on what health clearances are necessary for pets. Once you do this, set up an appointment with your veterinarian to ensure your pet is properly certified for travel.

, You should, at all costs, avoid flying with your pet in the cargo hold. Extreme temperatures, lack of pressurization, and elevated stress levels contribute to numerous deaths of pets flying in the cargo hold of planes each year. Instead, find an airline that will allow you to fly with your pet in the cabin., You should take a direct flight, and make sure you are on the same flight as your pet. Your pet should be wearing a collar that will not get caught in its carrier, and the carrier should have a travel label attached to it with your information. You should also notify the flight attendants that your pet is traveling in cargo, and carry a current photo of your pet with you., If you are flying with your pet during the holidays, it is important that your pet does not eat in the hours preceding the flight. This will help prevent your dog from vomiting during the flight if they experience motion sickness. It will also limit your pet’s need for a potty break during air travel., If your pet is traveling in an airplane, it will have to spend the duration of the flight in its travel carrier. The last thing you want is for your pet’s paws to get caught in the carrier due to unruly nails. Take time before you travel to clip your pet’s nails., It is important that you refrain from drugging your pet before or during air travel. Under no circumstances is it safe to sedate your pet before or during air travel. Sedated pets can have extreme reactions to pressurized aircraft, and sedating your pet increases the risk of death."
"
Respect other guests.,
Bring along your pet's bed.,
Take some toys.,
Make sure you bring enough food and snacks.",How to Handle Holiday Travel with Your Pet3," It is important that you are respectful of other guests at your holiday destination. This means you need to be aware of your pet and its behavior at all times. You should stop barking, meowing, or chirping immediately and pick up all pet waste. Never leave your pet unattended in your hotel room. If you need to go somewhere your pet is not welcome, you should take your pet to a kennel for the duration of your day trip.

, If at all possible, you will want to bring your pet's bed with you to your holiday destination. You will want to make sure your pet feels at home during your holiday, and bringing along its bed will help ease the uneasiness that comes from being in a new or foreign location. If you can't bring your pet's bed, make sure you at least bring a familiar item, such as a blanket, that your pet can rest upon for the holiday.

, Your pet will be in a location that is not its home during your holiday travel. This can result in anxiety, uneasiness, or even excess energy. Bringing along your pet's favorite toy can help soothe frayed nerves and can also help your pet work out some of the pent up energy that it acquired from your road trip or the plane ride to your holiday destination.

, When traveling with your pet, it is important that you bring along enough food and snacks for the holiday. It is not wise to attempt to buy pet food once you reach your destination. You might not be able to find your pet's usual brand of food, and abruptly changing your pet's diet can wreak digestive and emotional havoc on your already disoriented pet.

Consider your pet’s health.,
Think about your pet’s emotional needs.,
Consider leaving your pet at home.",How to Handle Holiday Travel with Your Pet4," Before you decide to take your pet on a holiday trip, you should consider whether they are healthy enough to make the journey. If your pet suffers from chronic health conditions, it might be best to leave them at home. Book an appointment with your vet and make sure your pet is healthy enough to travel., It’s understandable that you do not want to be separated from your pet over the holidays. However, travel can be extremely stressful for animals. This is especially true if you are thinking about flying with your pet, or will have to leave them in a strange hotel room or kennel while you are out enjoying the holiday at your destination. These situations can cause undue emotional stress for your pet., If possible, booking a pet sitter might be the best way to handle holiday travel with your pet. While you may not be able to stomach the idea of being away from your pet over the holidays, chances are your pet will be less stressed and happier if left at home. Try to find a responsible pet sitter, friend, or family member with whom you can leave your pet for the holiday."

For instance, if your animals don't react as expected during your trip and you need to keep them separate.
You could use it to protect your food while camping, even!

, You are not going to have room. Have a few items, so that your pet feels comfortable, but not a lot. Keep it simple., Don't decide to move and be on the road in a few days. Let them be part of the process. This will help them to realize that something is happening and won't completely blindside them., You don't have to put their name on it, but put a phone number or other contact information on it. Just because they have a chip, doesn't mean someone will think, or know, to check it out. Also, the part of the country that you are in, may not have ready access to a chip reader., Even when you are in your hotel room. If they escape, you will REALLY appreciate the extra handholds.

Be aware that if they do get loose, the leash hanging from their neck can become a danger to them. However, that leash may be what keeps them from actually getting loose.

, Keep that in mind.

, If they are high energy, be prepared. If they have a small bladder, be prepared to stop frequently., Yes, that means you need to stop, but you would have to stop anyway. Do not limit the water, trying to lessen the stops. Animals are much smaller and can die of dehydration quicker.

, If you are going to be driving for 4 days, then bring enough food for a week and four days. This is so that you don't have to replace their food in a rushed emergency situation. It can cause some intestinal distress if their food is changed improperly., Use Ziploc bags (or whichever method works best for you) and portion out the dry portion of their meals, and then add whatever else you feed your pets.

, Don't rely on what you can find at the side of the road. There is no telling what organisms are in that water. A gallon a day is a good measurement, for multiple animals.Obviously, your mileage may vary (YMMV)).

You want to have the water because the quality of the water will vary from state to state and you don't want to have a nasty reaction (diarrhea) during a big move.

, Don't bring too much. You don't need it and you want to keep down to the basics for a move."

Microchip your pet.",How to Bring a Pet Into the United States from Another Country," You have several options for airline travel: having your pet travel with you on the same plane, booking your pet on another flight, or shipping your pet to the US via a licensed commercial shipper.If you pet will be traveling on the same plane with you, he can travel in the cabin with you, be checked in as baggage, or shipped as cargo.Only small dogs and cats are allowed to travel in the cabin with you and they must be securely stowed under the seat in a special carrier in front of you.Ask your airline about carrier requirements if your pet will be traveling in the cabin.
Dogs and cats checked-in as baggage or shipped as cargo must be in a sturdy carrier that will allow them enough space to comfortably stand, sit and lie down.Air travel can be very tough on pets, but airlines do make efforts to make the flight comfortable for pets that are shipped as baggage or cargo. For example, the baggage and cargo area is pressurized and quiet.Shipping crates can be purchased at your local pet store or through your airline. Make sure the crate is USDA-approved.If you are not comfortable with booking your pet’s travel on a different flight, or using a commercial shipper, follow your own airline’s pet travel requirements to ensure a smooth traveling process for you and your pet.;
, It is very important for you know your airline’s pet travel requirements before you book your flight.Keep in mind that pet travel requirements will vary from airline to airline, and may differ between US and non-US airlines.


US airlines generally require a health certificate for pets traveling internationally. Some US airlines require the certificate to be no older than 10 days old, while others may require a certificate that is less than 10 days old.Be aware that pets weighing 100 pounds or more will be considered as cargo. If your pet is around 100 pounds, check with your airline to learn if you will be charged a cargo fee.It would also be helpful to inquire about where you should pick up your pet after the flight lands.

, This is very important! Include your contact information, as well as the address to where you will be traveling. It would also be helpful to attach a clear picture of your pet to his carrier, in case he escapes from his carrier.Attach a ‘live animal’ sign to your pet’s carrier, along with arrows to indicate which side of the crate should face up., From the time you check in until the time you get settled in your seat, notify as many airline staff as possible that your pet is on the plane with you. They may be able to make special accommodations to make sure your pet is comfortable and safe., In addition to making sure your pet is healthy, you can make air travel itself as comfortable for him as possible. For example, you can feed your pet a light meal about two hours before you arrive at the airport.You do not want him to have a lot of food on his stomach before getting on the plane.


If you have a dog, it is a good idea to take him for a walk before heading to the airport, and again after you check in.This will give him some exercise, as well as an opportunity to go to the bathroom before getting on the plane.
Minimize the number of layovers for your trip. Layovers may be unavoidable, depending on where you are traveling from. If you are unable to get a direct flight, an itinerary with as few layovers as possible will minimize the stress of loading and unloading your pet—for you and for him.For long flights, it is helpful to freeze a pouch of food and water the night before your flight. Freezing the food and water will prevent a mess in your pet’s carrier, and can make it easier for you or the airline staff to feed him., A health certificate, officially known as a Veterinary Health Certificate, is not required for the entry of most pets into the US. However, most airlines, as well as some states, require health certificates.Check with your airline, and the state to which you will be traveling, to get more information about health certificate requirements.


Once you know your destination in the US, call the American Embassy in your country to find out if there are any specific entry requirements for that state.
If you need a health certificate, it must be completed and signed by a licensed veterinarian.There may be restrictions on how old the health certificate can be for international travel. Pay close attention to these restrictions to ensure you obtain the health certificate within the appropriate time frame before you travel to the US.

, A rabies vaccination is required for all dogs entering the US, including puppies and service dogs.Your dog must a have rabies vaccination certificate that was completed and signed by a licensed veterinarian.The certificate will include such information as your contact information (name and address), information about your dog (e.g., age, breed, sex), the date of rabies vaccination, and vaccine product information.If your dog has not received a prior rabies vaccination, he will need to receive the vaccination at least 30 days before your arrival in the US.It is acceptable for your dog to receive a booster rabies vaccination less than 30 days before arrival if he meets the following requirements: 1) at least 15 months of age, 2) received a rabies vaccine after 3 months of age, and 3) the vaccine has expired.Your dog will not need a rabies vaccination if you are traveling from a rabies-free country in which you have lived for the past six months.A current list of rabies-free countries can be found at: http://www.cdc.gov/importation/rabies-free-countries.html

Be mindful that your dog may be denied entry if you do not have valid proof of his rabies vaccination., If you would like to bring your pet bird with you, be aware that bird imports are banned from some countries due to the risk avian influenza. Visit the USDA APHIS website (https://www.aphis.usda.gov/wps/portal/aphis/ourfocus/importexport) for a list of these countries.Even if you are not traveling from one of the banned countries, your bird will have to enter a 30-day quarantine at the USDA Animal Import Center at your expense. Pet birds require several pieces of documentation for entry into the US: Exporting Country Veterinary Health Certification, USDA Import Permit, and a Fish and Wildlife Certification (if necessary)., There are no restrictions or requirements on the import of rabbits, guinea pigs, hamsters, or ferrets. If you have one of these pets, they must be healthy at the port of entry. If your pet looks sick when you enter the US, he will need to be quarantined at your expense. If you have a pet turtle, the length of shell will be important for his entry into the US. A turtle whose shell is less than four inches (about 12 centimeters) long can be permitted for entry into the US, as long as he is not used for commercial purposes., Making sure your pet is healthy and up-to-date on his vaccinations is one of the most important things you can do to ensure a safe and smooth entry into the US for your pet. There may be a specific time frame for this visit, usually no more than seven days before you travel. Be aware that a pet who looks sick at the port of entry will need to be examined by a licensed veterinarian at the owner’s expense. Notify your veterinarian when you schedule the appointment that you will be traveling to the US.Your veterinarian will ensure that your pet is fully vaccinated and make sure you have all of the necessary veterinary documentation before you travel.
Your veterinarian must be approved by your home country to verify the exportation of animals. Ask your vet if they are certified to do this. If not, contact the government agency in charge of the import/export of animals in your home country. They should be able to provide a list of suitably trained vets in your area.
It is also a good idea to contact the American Embassy in your country, to ask about any specific requirements necessary to get a pet from your country into the US. This may vary depending on what diseases are common in that country, especially if they are rare or not in the United States.

, For the US, rabies vaccination status applies to dogs and cats. Cats are not required to have a rabies vaccination for entry. However, some states may require that your cat have a current rabies vaccination. Check the rabies vaccination requirements for the state to which you will be traveling., Air travel can be difficult for pets. The anxiety of travel, along with confinement on a plane, can be very stressful for your pet. The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) strongly advises against giving sedatives to a pet for air travel, since the sedatives can negatively affect his breathing.Talk with your veterinarian about safe options to keep your pet calm during the flight., This is most applicable for dogs and cats. A microchip is not required for entry to the US,but is highly recommended for air travel. The microchip will help identify your pet if he happens to escape.Your veterinarian can microchip your pet during the appointment to check his overall health.
Make sure that your dog or cat also has a collar and ID tag."

Spoil your pet during this stressful time.",How to Move with Pets1," Make a plan and stick to it. Once you have a plan, you can care for your pets in the best possible way during this stressful time.;
, Don't wait until the last minute!


Tell your vet you are moving. Ask your vet if they know if a vet in your new hometown they can suggest. If your pet has a condition that may worsen after you move, you should consult your vet about the proper treatment until you can find a new vet.
If your pets are due or almost due for shots, now is a good time to get them. It may take you a while to find a new vet and you may need to have updated shot records for boarding, traveling, etc.
Get a sedative for your pet. If you are traveling long distances, flying, exposing your pet to a means of transportation they've never experienced before, or traveling with children, you should ask your vet for a sedative--unless the pet is traveling in the cargo area of an airplane, in which case sedatives should be avoided. Most of these are quite mild and won't really knock the pet out but will certainly take the edge off. This is also helpful if you have a pet that you know doesn't travel well, is cage aggressive or could bite movers. If you need something more sedating, you should discuss this with your vet. Make sure you understand how to give proper dosages.

Get copies of vet records and vaccination certificates. The rabies tag will not serve as proof of vaccination. You may need to show the documentation. Make sure your pets get the kennel cough vaccine or other vaccines that will be necessary for travel or boarding. Even if you don't normally board your pet you should consider those vaccines in case something happens on the road or during your move (such as an accident, blizzard or family emergency). Be specific and ask your vet if there is anything else needed that might be requested. Ask what you will need to do to have these vaccinations recognized in your new state or if they will carry over. Chances are if you need a vaccine and don't have it, you'll be in horrible situation when you find out you should have gotten it. Pay the extra $5-$10 and you won't have to run back to the vet for an additional vaccine.
If your pet is traveling by air, you will probably need a health certificate from the vet, and there may be a time requirement (for example, the health certificate may need to be dated within 30 days of the travel date).
Get your pet's prescriptions refilled and get a prescription written so you can take it with you and present it to your new pharmacy. Pick up any prescription pet foods. If your pet has specific food needs make sure you pick it up before you leave. You don't want to be lost in a strange town trying to find an open pet store.


, This should have been done before you made the decision to move, but it never hurts to double check. Verify that your apartment building, if you have one, is pet-friendly. While house hunting, look for a house with a backyard if you have a dog, or a nearby park.

, Cats and small dogs can often fly in a small carrier with you in the cabin. Larger pets and large carriers may require transport in the cargo area. The latter is probably the most stressful and dangerous mode of transportation for your pet--see Warnings below, and check out How to Minimize Risk to a Pet in the Cargo Area of an Airplane.


Confirm they accept pets. Keep in mind airlines have very specific regulations for pets transported in the cargo area. They will not allow a pet to fly in temperatures in departure, layover or destination cities if the temperatures are too hot or too cold. It may be a pleasant 75 °F (24 °C) in Atlanta but it may be 40 °F (4 °C) in Chicago. The decision may not be made until the day of your flight.
Travel on the same flight as your pet if your pet is going to be in the cargo area. Ask the airline if you can watch your pet being loaded and unloaded into the cargo hold. When you board the plane, notify the captain and at least one flight attendant that your pet is traveling in the cargo hold. If the captain knows that pets are on board, he or she may take special precautions.
Find out what additional cost is involved.
Inquire if you must fax your vet records beforehand (always keep a copy with you).
Ask what specific maximum carrier measurements are allowed. Your pet should be able to turn around freely and not be cramped. Food and water should be available for cargo transported animals. You may be able to buy a cheaper carrier online so shop around if you have time. Also try borrowing one from a friend or buying one from a friend. Chances are these aren't used often and you may be able to get a cheaper one if you just ask around.
Plan to arrive at the airline extra early. Allow time for potty breaks before you enter and give your pet the sedative.

, Having boxes scattered, furniture in disarray and the family stressed also stresses your pets. With people going in and out, your pets may escape. Even the most well behaved pet may flee because of the stress. It is easy for a pet to get out unnoticed with all of the confusion. If the pet is very stressed they may resist coming to your call. Consider taking your pet to the kennel 2 days before and schedule the pick up on departure day after the trucks are loaded and right before you leave. Since most people move on weekends and that's when most people board their pets, you should schedule your boarding as soon as you know your moving day. Don't wait until the last minute because you may be out of luck!


If you don't board your pet, you should arrange for a closed off room that will not have in and out foot traffic. Warn movers, family and children to stay out of room and not to open the door. Secure your pet at all times when doors, attics and windows are open for moving.

, They will smell clean, their nails will be trimmed so not to ruin your car's interior and you won't be taking a dirty dog into a new home. Consider having long hair dogs shaved or heavily trimmed. You may also want to give your cats a good brushing, since they might shed more when they're stressed.


Let the groomer know you are moving. They may have suggestions about the groom that will make traveling with your dog easier such as shaving a particularly furry and shed prone dog. You can also request they do extra brushing to remove as much shedding as possible, trim the nails and take other measures to help with odors.
Be sure you request they are groomed early enough in the day to be completely dry and well brushed by the scheduled pick up time. (You don't want the car to smell like a wet dog.)
If you are sensitive to scents, make sure you agree on the fragrances/cologne spray used. Some shampoos also help with shedding and itching. Ask your groomer. You don't want your dog itching for the entire trip. Not only is it noisy but it is also hard on the pet since the dog may not have enough room to scratch.
Make your grooming appointment early and don't wait until the last week. You're making special requests and you should give them plenty of notice about what you want done so they can schedule the appropriate amount of time and personnel needed.

, If you're going to stay anywhere overnight, make sure you know which hotels are pet friendly. Some hotels are pet friendly but limit pets to certain rooms. Make your reservations early to make sure you can bring your pet and get one of those rooms. The most important thing is to speak with someone directly at the hotel. Make a note of their name and department. Get a direct phone number if you can. Do not make assumptions based on what you read online! Hotels often change their policies and may have stopped taking pets. The special requests you make in an online reservation are sometimes not read. You don't want to try to check in and be turned away. Strange city, no hotel reservations can be a huge headache. Plan ahead.


Always put the do not disturb sign (some hotels offer pet signs) on a hotel room door if your pets are inside. Housekeeping could accidentally let them escape. Your pets could also scare people who are afraid of dogs. You should try to keep them crated. Don't leave them alone if they bark as it may disturb the neighbors.
Remember to tip hotel staff if they are particularly helpful with the care of your pet. Even offer an extra tip upfront if you are staying several days. This may help insure your pets get that extra bit of attention in the pet friendlier hotels. This includes housekeeping if they are having to work around the pets. You may need to coordinate a time with housekeeping to remove the pets from the room so it can be cleaned daily.
Do everything you can to prevent your pet from having accidents on the floor or being destructive in the hotel. The hotel may be pet friendly but chances are the fine print says you are responsible for damages caused. You don't want the hotel to charge you for $4000 in new carpet.

, If you're missing something on your list, pick it up now and not wait until move day. Instead of throwing away tattered linens and pillows, you can save one or two for the pet carrier. See the ""Things You'll Need"" lists below.


Will your pet carrier fit in the car? You may need to measure and get a new one.
Set a small suitcase or bag aside for the traveling pets.

, Let them sleep in the bed, take them for walks, take time out to play and feed them their favorite food or treats. It will improve their spirits for the actual move day. Pets are often the last thing on people's minds during a stressful move. The pets begin to feel unloved and neglected which can bring about more stress and bad behaviors.


It is not uncommon for pets to refuse food and water while away from home or in a stressful situation. Keep a close eye on their intake. Offer them special treats and their favorite foods to encourage them to eat. Try to take time every few hours during moving and travel to walk your pet, set out food and water and try to get them to drink. If their appetite doesn't improve, you should contact a vet. Some sedatives can cause your pets to become thirsty and if not addressed they become dehydrated. Make sure they have access to plenty of water.
Keep a log of when and how much sedative you give. It will prevent you from double dosing should you forget in all the chaos of moving.

Go over your new yard very carefully and make sure it is dog or cat proof, there are no harmful items or chemicals, the gates close, the fence is secure and your pets can't escape.,
For outdoor cats, keep them inside for a few nights until they get acclimatized.,
Enjoy your new home with your pet!

",How to Move with Pets2," Routines are very important, especially when so much else around them is changing. Feed and/or walk your pet at the same time that you would normally.

, If you don't have anywhere to leave your pet or are traveling alone, keep your pet on a leash or in a carrier at first. Inspect your new home for anything that might be harmful, such as wet paint, sawdust, broken glass or bare wires.

, Make sure that all doors and windows are closed for the time being. Allow your pet to get used to your new dwellings.

,, Give them time to associate their new home as a positive place.

, If your pet is microchipped, make sure that information is changed as well. Since you are in a new place, it will be easier for your pet to get lost as they are in a new environment.

, Your pet may be confused with the new surroundings. Have patience and understand this is a confusing time.

, Gradually allow them to spend more time outside.

If you are slouched over, no one will believe in you. Making yourself tall communicates victory, like you just won a competition.Body language (nonverbal communication) makes up 60% to 93% of how others perceive you..
Maintain good posture in both seated and standing positions.;
, The more space your body takes up, the more confidence you appear to have. To take up space, do things like roll your shoulders back, keep your head held high, and place your hands on your hips.Gesture when you speak. Not only will moving your hands with your speech make you take up more space, it will make you seem like you feel convicted about what you are saying—meaning you look confident., No matter if you are meeting for the first time or meeting up with old friends, keeping steady eye contact makes others think you are confident. Less confident people tend to look away frequently.Less confident people look away because eye contact makes us feel like we are under scrutiny, thus being judged and possibly rejected.Resist the urge to look away even if you don’t feel confident.

, Offering your hand before the person you’re meeting does displays a show of confidence. It shows you are not afraid to meet new people, encouraging others to have confidence in you.


Don’t hold the other person’s hand too firmly nor too limply. Shake the hand for two or three seconds before releasing.Accompany your handshake with eye contact and a smile., Both moving about a room and speaking slowly allow you time to think about what you’re doing or going to say. This purposeful movement makes people think of you in terms of power, like a lion might look.Don’t jump or startle easily. This behavior mimics animals like cockroaches instead of lions, repelling others., Called “fronting,” this stance of facing your torso and toes toward a person is a sign of respect.You also look focused and like you’ve got it together.


Make sure to maintain this stance throughout a full conversation.

, Some people define confidence as a “quiet inner knowledge that you are capable.”Believing you can do things without help assists you in looking like you are confident, just as it helps you actually feel confident.


Believing you are capable helps you feel secure in your identity and ready to face challenges like going to a social gathering.

, It you’re headed to a social gathering and you feel nervous about what people will think of you, give yourself an inner pep talk before heading out the door. This can boost your confidence enough to get to the party and start talking before you feel insecure again.


Recall compliments you have received recently, whether on your clothes, hair, or abilities. Repeat these compliments to yourself out lout.Look in the mirror before you leave your home and give your personal pep talk out loud.

, If all you think about is not wanting to be there, you will make it more uncomfortable for yourself. Think about the positives of social gatherings.


Think about the possibility of making a new friend or meeting your soul mate.
If you like learning new things, think about what you might learn from the different conversations you’ll have.
Consider how at most gatherings, you’re getting the opportunity to have free food and drinks.

, Dress and groom yourself to appear confident. Studies show that women who dress up tend to feel better.And if you feel good about the way you look, it will be easy to appear confident.

Don’t forget to smell good.

, If you get nervous in social situations, you should develop some on-the-go coping techniques you can employ while you’re at social gatherings, such as breathing exercises and thinking of happy things. Slowing your breathing triggers the brain to calm down, and thus all organs in the body (including your flight or fight response).There are many breathing exercises you could employ. One you could do is simply breathe through your nose, because this creates resistance. Another is to breathe five times in a minute by breathing in five seconds and breathing out five seconds.For general anti-stress relaxation techniques in your daily life, set aside 10 to 20 minutes a day to practice. Relaxation techniques are effective differently for every personality, but generally you can do things like meditation, yoga, even running., If you’re in the middle of a social gathering and you start to lose your feelings of confidence, one trick is to press your fingertips on one hand against the fingertips of the other in a the shape of a steeple.


This action sends a signal to others that you are confident, and it reminds you, too., Slowing down, as mentioned in the part above, is good for speech because it allows you to think about what you are going to say as well as making you appear relaxed.You also appear to be in command of yourself when you speak slowly., Saying the other person’s name frequently makes you seem more likeable, since we all like to hear our own names., Ending sentences that aren’t questions as thought they are—especially when introducing yourself—places the idea of a question in the other person’s mind, making them doubt your confidence.When answering questions, avoid the question inflection as well, opting for a firm, even tone.

, If you have an issue that you feel passionate about, try to bring the conversation around to that topic. When you stand up for or speak passionately about something you believe in, this inspires confidence in others.


If you choose not to bring a conversation around to your soapbox, at least listen for someone bashing an issue you care about and confront them politely.

, This will make you feel connected, and each smooth conversation you have will make you feel more comfortable. The more you know about people, the more you will feel confident.

Your animal companion will be experiencing changes to its routine as well as the physical challenges of traveling, so you need to verify with your vet that your pet is up for it before you go.This is especially important if you plan on taking your pet on a long trip.;
, While you are at the vet, get your pet's vaccinations up to date. It's a good idea to have a current health certificate to take along with you. This is more important if you are traveling internationally.If you are traveling between the US and Canada, you will need a copy of your pet's rabies certificate.
If your pet is due for rabies vaccination within six months of your trip, discuss early re-vaccination with your vet in order to avoid potential issues with customs officials.

, The risk of your pet getting lost increases while traveling and this collar could save you both a lot of grief. Make sure the ID tag has your phone number listed on it.Consider adding the contact information for a friend or family member back home. Should you and your pet be separated, having this information may make the difference between your pet being lost and you and your pet being reunited quickly.

, Each airline is different. Don't assume anything. Some will let your pet, if it is small enough, ride in a carrier under your seat. But if it has to ride in the cargo hold, you will need to take proper precautions for your pet’s safety.You’ll need to make sure you have a carrier for your pet that meets airline regulations regarding size and weight whether you take your pet in the cabin with you or put them in the cargo hold.

, If travelling by car, be sure to secure your pet during the trip. This is for everyone's safety. Animals are unpredictable and a pet that is free to roam an automobile is a high risk of causing an accident or escaping from the vehicle.This means strapping your dog into the seat with the seatbelt by its harness or securing your cat’s carrier with a seatbelt.

, If you are staying a hotel or some other kind of overnight resort, you’ll need to make sure they allow pets. Call ahead of time to check that the place you’re staying will allow you to bring your pet.


There are also some online resources that provide listings of pet friendly hotels., Bring along the phone number of your local vet and any health records you have. If anything happens, you’ll probably need to know what vaccinations and shots your pet has already had.You should also try to find out the number ahead of time for a vet or animal hospital near your vacation destination in case of an emergency.

, You’ll obviously need to care for your pet while they are on vacation with you. Bring all of the necessities with you. This includes food, water, food and water dishes, treats, your pet’s bed (if they need one), harness, leash, and any necessary medications.If you are going on a long trip, bring enough pet food to last a couple of days in your luggage. That will give you enough time to find a pet store in your vacation destination to buy a larger supply. And then you won’t have to haul a big bag with you, especially if you are flying.
If you are traveling with a cat, remember that it will need a litter box as soon as you reach your new destination. Bring a small, disposable baking dish in your luggage and a small bag of cat litter. You can use this as a makeshift litter box for a day or so while you look for a pet store when you arrive.

, Bring a couple of your pet’s favorite toys with you so they will feel more at home at the new place and also have something to entertain themselves with, especially when you are gone. This will help your pet settle in more quickly.Bring a chew toy or a rope toy that you can use to play with your dog. Or bring a little catnip toy for your cat.

, The stress of traveling can be difficult for your pet to deal with, so try to spend as much time with them as possible while you are on your trip. This will comfort your pet and reassure them that everything is okay. Spending time with your pet will help them feel safe and secure in their new surroundings., If you’re taking your pet with you on a trip, you don’t want to just leave them in the hotel the entire time. Your pet will likely be unhappy if it is left alone in a strange place all day long while you’re out enjoying your vacation.Try to plan activities that your pet can participate in – like going to the beach, hiking, or taking a stroll through town.

Understand the risks.,
Exhaust all other alternatives.,
Research airlines.,
Ask each airline about its animal welfare policy.,
Book the same flight as your pet so that you can supervise the trip (described further in later steps).,
Buy a strong carrier.,
Ask the airline if you can watch your pet being loaded and unloaded into and out of the cargo hold.,
When you board the plane, notify the Captain (through the flight crew, that is, a flight attendant) that your pet is traveling in the cargo hold.,
After checking your pet in at the ticket counter, make sure to read the claim check back to the agent to ensure that the pet is checked to the correct final destination with you.",How to Minimize Risk to a Pet in the Cargo Area of an Airplane," Since the pet is traveling in the cargo area, the carrier is going to be treated like cargo. Despite airline regulations as to what temperatures the pet can travel in, the airport cargo area is likely to have temperature fluctuations. Carriers are generally not strapped down in case of turbulence. The carrier may be tossed and thrown like a piece of baggage. Delays can cause temperature changes in the hold that can injure or kill the animals. Even the best airlines have a statistically significant death rate for animals. Recognize that many airline employees are pet lovers and will look after your pet very well. Accidents do happen, though.


Some breeds of animals are more prone to problems when flying than others. Short-snouted dog breeds (like pugs and bulldogs) don't travel well in cargo holds according to a Department of Transportation report because their method of respiration prevents them from cooling down adequately. Some airlines even ban their travel during hotter weather.;
, Have you considered...


Driving with your pet?
Paying someone else to drive your pet to your new destination, whether it's a friend, family member, or pet transportation service?

Finding your pet a new home?

, By browsing forums online, you may be able to determine which airlines are the most reputable in terms of transporting pets. Read about other people's experiences. Keep in mind that people most often post their bad experiences, but not necessarily their good ones.

, What are their standards? Ask if the airline will insure your pet. If not, you may want to pass., Go for a nonstop flight if the trip is less than 6 hours. Otherwise, ask if you'll be able to see your pet during any changeovers. It is more likely to be possible at smaller airports than at major hubs due to security restrictions. Many airline employees are pet lovers, too!


Note: A ""direct"" flight may have stops before it arrives at the final destination. Only a ""nonstop"" flight is truly nonstop in airline language.

, It must comply with airline and government regulations. It should also be strong and spacious enough to accommodate your pet, especially if it gets bumped around during the flight. The regulations require that your pet must be able to stand up fully and turn around in the kennel without touching the sides or top. This is not negotiable with the airline.


Buy the carrier as early as possible and get your pet used to it. Give the pet treats inside the carrier and make it a comfortable, familiar place.
Most US airlines require that you use a water dish that attaches to the door. It's less likely to spill. Even better, freeze water in the dish so it lasts longer.
Tape your name, seat, and contact information on the carrier. If you have a cell phone, keep it on till the very last minute.

, If you see the carrier being mishandled or left in a hot or noisy area for too long, tell a supervisor or a gate agent immediately.

, Most large jets cool, heat and pressurize the cargo areas with the same system as the main cabin. If there is a delay, make sure to remind the the flight crew that your pet is on board so that the heat/cooling is not shut off to save fuel or power. Ask if they can check with the ground crew to make sure your pet is safely on board before the aircraft departs.

, A few seconds at the counter may save hours of grief for both customer and pet later on.

Be aware of the volume and tone of your voice.,
Learn the right manner in which to initiate a conversations.,
Find ways to extend conversations.,
Steer clear of inflammatory topics.,
End conversations courteously.",How to Improve Social Skills1," Don’t speak too softly or too loudly either. Speak at a volume that can be heard easily, and suggests confidence but never shows aggression.


Remember to adjust the volume of your voice to suit the surrounding environment.
If possible, speak at the same volume and tone as people in your immediate environment.;
, You can begin by saying something that is generally or universally true, rather than overly personal because that might seem to be insulting or offensive to some. Comment on the weather, or maybe some current event you heard about in the news recently. You could compliment someone on what they are wearing or the way they have done their hair.Small talk is not always easy though; since it can often be difficult to think of exactly what to say. Here a few examples:


""That's a nice hat, where did you buy it""?
""What's with this crazy weather?""
""I just love the view from here.""
""Isn't Professor James' class fascinating?""

, After speaking about general issues such as current events, try bringing up more intimate or a more relatable topic. Asking questions that delve a little deeper below the surface. For example, asking polite questions about their family, employment, or hobbies can lengthen a conversation and make it more meaningful. Remember that a conversation takes two people, so avoid speaking too little or vice versa. Try as much as possible to ask open-ended questions; in other words, start with a ""How,"" a ""Why,"" or a ""What,"" instead of those questions to which there can only be a plain and simple ""Yes"" or ""No"" answer. That doesn't encourage the person you're speaking to speak more. Here are some ways to lengthen conversations and give them depth:


""So, what you do for a living?""
""Tell me a little more about your family?""
""How do you know the host of the party?""
""How long have you been attending / been a member of weight watchers?""
""What are your plans for the weekend?""

, When interacting with a person you don't know all too well, there are some subjects you should steer clear of. In general, these would include controversial subjects like religion, politics, or the persons ethnicity/race etc. For instance:


While it appears appropriate to ask someone a question about an upcoming election, it might be offensive to ask someone who they plan to vote for.
While it seems okay to ask someone about their religious affiliation generally, it might be a bad idea to ask just about anyone about the church's views on sexuality.

, Instead of abruptly cutting them off and walking away, try to be polite about it. Tell them in a sweet, non-offensive way that that you have to take their leave, and give them the impression that you enjoyed the interaction. Try concluding with positive statements such as:


“I've got to run, but I hope we meet again soon.”
""Well, I have a bank appointment, but it's been fun chatting with you.""
""I can see that you're busy, so I'll let you go. It was nice talking to you.""

If you intend to live in another place among the borders of your country, you should know the regulations and the habits or the traditions of the society you going to.,
if you travelling to another place out the borders “from Manchester to Rome“ here comes the hard work side by side with much more effort.,
Try to have friends, new ones in the new society.,
Be kind to people.,
Be your-self.,
Enjoy your new life style “shops and how they buy things, public places and how they deal with each other”


Speak the language not only the mother tongue “Italian” but also how they use it.

,
By using all of that and getting new friends, you are simply one of them now, congratulations!

",How to Live in Another Society,"


For example if you moving from Liverpool to Manchester, you have the same spoken language but may the traditions of the local people in Manchester vary from their counterparts in Liverpool.
You are to know these habits and use them too. You usually drink from time to time but people do not espouse drinking so, just drink privately in your house not publicly. People usually have meetings and encourage team work so, go ahead, learn these values and use them in your daily routine.;
,


You need to know not just knowing but also learning their spoken language. Their language like ”words people always use, expressions, movements, thoughts, interactions with each other and what they like” as for the mother language Italian, you will learn it sooner or later, sooner will be outstanding as that helps you to be in action much more quicker. That will also help you coping with the society faster and know their habits and customs.

, They will put you in the right track and make your life easier and easier than it looks. They will give you an overview about their living style, traditions, people as a whole, what they like, what they espouse, how to help them, and let you visit new places. With teaching you some of their own language.


Getting friends will help if you have problems in that society or even if you want to search for a new job.
Making friends in a foreign society is not easy at all, you are to show your good side of your personality, just be your-self and everything will be on track.
Show people that you care, want to help in order to get new friends. And when that happened, those friends will back you up and also support you in your living.

, You have to know that you are a new member in their society and it`s not easy that they trust you quickly, you must show them that you worth this trust and gain it too.


If anyone tried to get under your skin “let by gone be by gone”
If anyone asked for your help do not refuse and try not to let him down.
Use their traditions and stick to them, forget the traditions of your society and live your new life.

, If their traditions abject yours, choose the best. Like “if they walk in streets and usually greet each other and you do not do that so, choosing their option will be helpful. If you live a private life and they live an open one in this case choose the best that suits you. If they usually visit hospitals so, let them know that you are there and go ahead for it.”


No ideal society. Espouse the best of their customs and habits. And other things you would better get rid of them!
Know them, and you need to be the best because if anything happened against your situation, they will defend you.

Pay attention to your body language.,
Observe how other people behave in social situations.,
Improve your non-verbal communication skills at home.,
Focus on a keeping a genuine smile right from the moment you meet a person.,
Practice your eye contact.,
Spend a little extra time on your self while getting ready to go out.",How to Improve Social Skills2," Our gestures often communicate messages more powerfully than words.Remember that body language plays an important role in social interactions. Be wary and take time to reflect on messages you give others through your posture, eye contact, and facial expressions.


If you are avoiding eye contact, standing far away, or crossing your arms, you are likely telling others that you don't want to interact.Adopt a confident pose, and smile a bit more, Make frequent eye contact with people you are talking to; stand tall and unfold your arms. This way you are certainly more likely to create a good impression on people you speak to.

, Watch their body language closely and consider why they are better at interacting with others socially. Observe their posture, their gestures, their facial expressions, and how often they make eye contact. Consider how you might replicate or improve upon your own body language while talking to people.


Determine 'how well' the people you're observing know each each other. This is important, because the body language shared between close friends who are talking differs completely from that displayed by two complete strangers even in an ordinary setting.
Mentally take notes about what you see and observe. This will both guide and help you to become more aware of your own body language.

, Home is often the best place to start learning something new, because you won't be as inhibited in a familiar setting. You could try making a video of yourself in conversation with your family members, and then consider how you can improve your body language. You could also practice non-verbal gesturing in front of a mirror. Enlist the help of family members you are close to, or even close friends- this is another effective approach, as they can give you honest useful feedback that no one else would. Some other tips include 'pulling back' your shoulders, keeping your spine straight, and your chin up, parallel to the floor.


One of the best things about practicing at home is that its obviously a private and a low-pressure environment.
Don't be shy! It just you and the mirror! Have fun trying out different types of body language signs and gestures.

, A smile is universally known to be a great way to show you are open to others, and makes people feel at ease. Just focusing on smiling when you meet people will make things a little easier., Work on making more eye contact as you you get comfortable with it. Don't stare people in the eye, especially if you're uncomfortable with it because that could prove annoying. Whenever you think about eye contact, make yourself look at someone in the eye for just about 3-5 seconds only. As this gets easier, you'll be natural about it.


If you're not right next to someone, look at their ear lobe, or the spot right between their eyes. This is faking it, but people won't be able to tell the difference.
If you're nervous making eye contact, some social psychologists suggest that you practice doing with people on TV. Put on the news and try keeping eye contact with the anchor., You'll feel more confident with the way you look. Spending a little extra time on making sure you like the way you look and feel confident about yourself will make all other social situations easier to be in. Develop a hygiene routine, buy some new clothes or a pair of shoes you liked, and dressing your best not only improve self-confidence they make you naturally more social, too.

Find a place where people seem easy going.,
Start small, chatting with service people that helped you out to get started.,
Pick someone who doesn’t appear busy or uninterested.,
Reflect on how it went.,
Talk to more people.,
Join a support group.",How to Improve Social Skills3," Starting a conversation with an unknown person will seem less risky and more acceptable by everyone there. Some situations seem easier than others especially when initiating social interaction. Supermarkets or banks are more often than not among the worst places to initiate a conversation with a total stranger (people just want to get their groceries and be done with it). Coffee shops, sporting events, and community centers can be great places to start talking to great new people.


To meet new people, try joining a group such as an amateur sports club or a book club. A fitness class is often a great place to start a conversation.

, Ask your barista how their day is going. Thank the mailman as he passes by, or ask a co-worker how their weekend went. You don't have to dive into deep, invasive, and consuming conversations immediately. Start small. Remember, there is no downside to saying 'hey' to someone. You will most likely not see them again, and these low-key conversations are the best to practice with., Approach your subject with open body language and and appear to be interested in getting to know them better. This often is a good opportunity to have a meaningful conversation.


Be confident when approaching a person. If you are too nervous you may make the other person nervous too!
Remember to put away your cell phone. Checking your phone all the time during a conversation annoys people, and makes them think your more interested in your phone than you are in talking to them!

, If the encounter went on well, take note what you did right and do try to repeat this in the future. If things went poorly, mentally assess the situation to determine what exactly you did that wasn't all that impressive.


Did you approach someone who appeared to be busy with something or who was displaying closed body language?
Was your own body language open and inviting?
Did you start the conversation with an appropriate topic?

, Your social skills will improve with practice. The more you communicate and interact with people, you will get better at it.


Try not to let negative social interactions get you down. Oftentimes such encounters are not your fault.

, This is usually a safe, comfortable environment where learning to speak to people can be easier. You are not the only one there who wants to work on their speaking skills. Why not practice with others who are in the same boat? The very fact that you want to improve your social skills shows that you are an open, kind person who is willing to work on themselves. Surround yourself with people with similar goals to help you grow."
"
Make your social life a priority.,
Get ready to say yes to invitations.,
Don't be afraid of rejection.,
Add value to a social interaction.,
Keep things positive.,
Don't be too eager.,
Be more open-minded toward new people.",How to Have a Social Life1," There are some reasons why your life may be lacking in the social life department. It's likely that one of them is that you haven't made socializing a priority, favoring work, school, or your romantic relationship over getting out into the world and making friends. If going out to the bars every night seems exhausting and unfulfilling at the end of the day, there are lots of other ways to make friends. Because friends are after all, one of the main sources of meaning and fulfillment in a person's life.


Though you may be slammed with work and/or school, you need to tell yourself that the next time you have free time, you should devote it to a social activity instead of more work or more school.
Of course, you need your sleep. Don't go out and socialize if you're grumpy and exhausted. But try to manage your schedule so that you have some time to go out while you're feeling energized each week.;
, Chances are, you've gotten used to rejecting invitations, whether they've come from your neighbors, classmates, or co-workers. Sure, your co-worker Martha's weekly bowling night may not sound like the most exciting way to spend your Friday, but it's better than your current plans...which involve you, a tub of fro-yo, and a 30 Rock marathon. Get used to saying ""Yes"" to things unless you have a really good reason to say no.


Part of this change will come from adjusting your mindset. The next time someone gives you an invitation, instead of scrambling to think of excuses to say no, consider it a positive thing, and think about all the benefits the experience may have for you.
You don't have to say ""yes"" to a person who you think is creepy or weird, of course. But lets say you think your neighbor Jen is nice but a little boring, and she invites you to a BBQ at her place. Not only could you see that she's more interesting than you thought, but it would be a great opportunity to meet other potential friends.

, Another reason people don't socialize as much as they may want to is that they are afraid of being turned down, or are convinced that people secretly don't like them. Well, if you want to make close, lasting friendships, as well as make your daily life more fun, then you have to put yourself out there more, even if you're afraid of getting burned.


Sure, rejection sucks. But you know what else sucks? Spending a weekend hanging out with your cat.
Remind yourself that the worst thing that could happen is that you might not hit it off with a person, and could never hang out with that person again. Is that really so bad?

, Think about your strengths as a person, and the things that might draw others toward you. There are a number of ways to add value to a social interaction, whether it's by being a generally fun, funny person to be around, or by being genuinely interested in what people have to say and being a good listener. So, if you're just standing there, adding nothing, you're not adding value. Make sure you contribute something, no hijinks required.


You may have a number of things to offer to different people. One person may be blown away by your intelligence, while another would rather talk about music with you. Find what works for every person.
Don't get nervous if you've been quiet and haven't found anything to contribute to a social interaction. You'll get your chance.

, You know who loves hanging out with people who complain too much or spend all of their time walking around with a sour look on their faces? No one. Even if you're in a terrible mood or think there's no justice in the world, try not to let it show when you're interacting with people. Start off by talking about light, positive topics, and you'll find yourself laughing in no time. People are much more likely to want to hang out with you again if they have a positive experience and feed off of your positive energy.


This doesn't mean you should hide your true feelings or not let people know what's really on your mind. You can open up and be positive and negative with people, but you should work on building casual friendships before you get too serious.

, Though you should make socializing a priority and be excited by hanging out with new people, you shouldn't have ""Hang out with me!"" written all over your face. When you're hanging out with a new person, you should act like you might never see that person again until the end of the day, when the time to exchange contact info will come.


Don't invite a person you just met to do nine million things with you, especially if some of them are pretty friend-intensive, like hanging out with your family. If you both mention a movie you want to see, then sure, you can ask if that person wants to check it out with you, but don't start inviting the person to join every aspect of your life at once.
Though you may be tempted, don't say something like, ""You're really cool -- I hope we can be friends,"" or the person may be a little weirded out.

, One of the reasons you may have trouble having a social life is because you tend to think that all new people are boring, stupid, or mean. If you tend to think that no one is good enough to be your friend, or that you have nothing in common with almost anyone you meet, then you may have to rethink the situation. Instead, try to look for all the good qualities of a person you meet, and consider all the things you might have in common, instead of focusing in on all the differences you may have.


If you tend to judge and think negatively of new people, then it may be a defense mechanism, a way of keeping yourself from being rejected by rejecting people before they've had a chance to get to know you.
If you really didn't think you have anything in common with a person you met, try talking about something completely different; if you were talking politics, switch to sports. Sure, you may have widely different political views, but you may find that you have both had a life-long obsession with the 49ers. Who knows, maybe you could end up being sports-watching buddies.

Draw on your current acquaintances.,
Pick up some new hobbies or interests.,
Offer more invitations.,
Go on dates.,
Network.,
Hang out with more social people.",How to Have a Social Life2," If you've moved to a completely new town where you don't know a soul, then this may be trickier. But chances are, you've been living in the same place for a while and just can't seem to hit it off with anyone. If that's the case, then you should think about the people you already know who you may be overlooking. Here are some ways to do it:


Click on ""Friends"" on the lower-left hand side of your Facebook homepage. You'll be able to click on a list of people who live within 10 miles (16 km) of your hometown (if you've listed it). This doesn't mean you should reach out to people you barely know, but see if you're surprised to see if any people you were once close with have ended up in your hood.
Look through your phone and make a list of people who you'd like to hang out with. This can be a bit of a stretch. Now, make sure they wouldn't be too surprised to hear from you. Then send them a text suggesting a low-pressure hang out, like grabbing coffee.
Look around your work or classes. See if you've overlooked anyone who might be a potential friend. Remember to be open-minded.
Know thy neighbors. If your neighbors are really friendly and always invite you over, accept the invitation.

, If you have a problem with socializing because you're too busy to socialize, then you shouldn't make your schedule more busy. However, you should rearrange it so that you have time to pursue new hobbies or interests that could lead you to meet more people. Here are some things you can try:


Has your friend been inviting you to join her book club for months? Say yes. Or start your own club.
Take an acting or improv class for beginners. Not only will it help you become more social in public, but you'll also meet a lot of dynamic people.
Join a sports league, like soccer, volleyball, or tennis. You'll get your endorphins up while meeting some cool new people.
Take an art class. Sure, you may be focused on your art during the class, but you could make some great friends during breaks.
Volunteer in your community. This is another great way to meet new people.

, Remember that friendship is a two-way street. Not only should you accept more invitations, but you should make invitations too. So, once you've found someone you (at least sort-of) click with, you should invite that person to hang out. The more concrete or personalized your plans, the better. If you just say, ""We should hang out soon,"" it'll never happen. Here are some things to consider as you make your invitation:


Be concrete. Don't just say ""We should grab coffee some time."" Instead, say, I'd love to grab coffee one morning. How does next week look for you?
Don't offer anything too personal or intense at first. Ask the person if he or she wants to grab a drink instead of eating a fancy four-course meal. The person may worry that you'll run out of things to talk about.
Don't invite the person over your place. Invite the person out for lunch at a restaurant, not on your back porch; invite the person out to the movies, not to watch a movie at your place. If you invite the person over to your place first, you'll come on too strong.

, Romantic life is part of any social life, whether you've been with the same partner for years or you're just part of the casual dating scene. If you haven't dated anyone in months or years, and it's not because you're heart-broken but because you're afraid of making the effort, then you need to start making some changes. Sign up for an online dating site, attend singles events, or ask your acquaintances or friends to set you up; there's nothing wrong with asking for help.


Even if the dates don't lead to romance, you may end up making a new friend, or meeting other potential friends along the way.
Dating is a great way to put yourself out there, overcome social anxiety, and learn to connect with a wider variety of people. Just don't jump into an obsessive relationship right away, or your social life will get even worse.
As you search for a partner, find someone who is social and has lots of friends, so you can meet more people.

, Use your job or school to network, improve your career prospects, and to meet more people. If your job is having a work networking event, whether it's through a volunteer day or a happy hour, don't turn down the opportunity. Though you should build professional relationships at work, you can make some real friendships too. The same goes for school; if you're invited to an event where you can meet other people in your field or major, take it as an opportunity to make new friends and meet people who share your career goals.


You shouldn't think of the people at work or school as just your ""work friends"" or your ""class friends"" only. Some of them could become real, life-long friends. This doesn't mean you should try to be BFF with your boss.

, Maybe one of the reasons you don't have much of a social life is because you only have two friends, and neither of them like to leave the house. Though you shouldn't ditch your hermit-like buddies, you should make an effort to hang out with more people who have a lot of friends, love to mingle, and generally like to have a good time with a variety of people. These people will not only be fun to hang out with, but will lead you to meet more people.


Don't hang out with a social person you don't really like. Just use ""sociability"" as a quality you look for when you're on the search for more friends.

"
"
Get more personal.,
Don't fall off the grid.,
Favor quality over quantity.,
Let people see the real you.,
Remember that having a social life isn't all about having fun.",How to Have a Social Life3," Starting to have a social life is one thing, but if you want to keep your life going, then you have to make your relationships last. Though you should start slow with new friends, and stick to safer topics as you get to know one another, you can't just rehash the same superficial territory if you've hung out more than a handful of time. You need to learn to open up, to reveal a little more about yourself, and let the person reciprocate.


Don't reveal everything at once. Start introducing more personal information into the conversation little by little.
As you try to build a deeper relationship, you should also think about the activities you do with a person. If all you ever do with a new friend is drink a lot and go out dancing, try inviting the friend to dinner and a movie instead.
Invite people in to more spheres of your life. As you develop closer bonds with people, you can invite them to share your hobbies, see your place, meet your brother, or do whatever will help them get to know a different side of you.

, One of the most important things you can do is to stay on the grid, keep attending your commitments, and continue to hang out with people. If you met a new friend and had two successful coffee dates, don't let two months go by without reaching out to the person, no matter how busy you are. With a new friendship, it's important to keep moving forward.


If you miss your last three book clubs, you have less of a chance of connecting with the people there.
If you want to be a real friend, then you'll have to stick to your commitments. No one will take you seriously if you have a reputation of being a flake.

, This may sound counterproductive if what you're really trying to do is get a social life, but when it comes to having real friendships, having two or three close friends you can really rely on is more important than having thirty acquaintances. Though having acquaintances can help improve your social life, if you connect with a few people on a deeper level, then you'll be more likely to hang out with each of them at least once every week or two, which will greatly improve your social life.


It's okay to have close friends and acquaintances. Not all acquaintances have to turn into sincere friendships, and that's okay.

, Though you may have tried a little harder or hidden parts of your personality when you first went on the friend market, if you want to make your relationships with new friends last, you have to drop the act. If you're having a bad day, open up to your friends; if you're worried about the future, let them know you're concerns; if you have a goofy sense of humor, let it out.


Don't be afraid. If you want to have meaningful friendships, then you have to put yourself out there.

, Sure, there are the parties, the trips to the beach, and the funny text exchanges that crack you up in the middle of your work day. But having a real social life, and having real friendships, means being their for the laughter and the tears. Working out the difficulties of life together is what will bring you closer to your friends, and will make you take your relationships to a deeper level.


If you want to be a real friend and to make strong connections that lead you to hang out with people, then you have to learn to be sympathetic, be a good listener, and learn to recognize when your new friend is upset and just wants to talk.

"
Get a Facebook.,
Get texting on your cell phone.",How to Have a Social Life4," It's simple, easy, and free. Start by adding your current friends and family members with Facebook. Try to make friends and start a conversation, but don't make others uncomfortable. If most people use something else, like Twitter or Myspace, use that instead.

, If you have parents that won't pay for it, convince them. Texting is a good way to talk make small talk with people. Many people love to text, but you might not, so make sure you know before you get into the habit of doing it.

"
Wear clothes that are comfortable but trendy.,
Take a shower before you leave.,
Loosen up with friends before the party.",How to Have a Great Time at a Frat Party1," The worst thing at a frat party is to go overboard on the clothes and look like you’re trying way too hard to fit in. You want to stay classy, but wearing a tuxedo will most likely get you laughed out of most frat parties.


If you’re a man who is unsure what to wear, a polo and jeans or a button up shirt and some slacks will suffice. Just make sure your clothes aren’t wrinkled or have any stains and you’ll fit in.
Girls can wear skirts, a dress, or jeans, but just make sure that the skirt isn’t too short and the dress isn’t too long. Frat parties can get crowded and a long dress can get dirty very easily, and there’s a good chance there will be people physically bumping into you.
Keep the weather in mind. No one looks cool when they are shivering from the cold, or soaking wet from the rain, so try to dress appropriate to the weather forecast.
If you already have a unique style, stick to it! The thing that matters most about how you dress is how confident you feel about your appearance.;
, If you smell bad or look dirty, people are not going to want to interact with you at a frat party. If you’ve spent all day in the heat or doing something physical, it’s important you wash off the dirt before going to a party.


If you don’t have time to shower, make sure to apply some cologne or perfume.
Keep in mind that this is not a substitute to good hygiene.

, If you feel anxious about being around a ton of new people, it’s good to loosen up at home with your friends before you go out by having a couple drinks if you are over 21. This will get you in the mood to be social, and will make your experience better once you get to the party.


Don’t go overboard on drinking. Showing up to a party totally drunk is bad form, and they could restrict you from going in!
Once you are at the party, getting too drunk can tarnish your reputation and be very dangerous.

"
"
Participate in the games and comradery.,
Start conversations with strangers.,
Dance and let loose!,
Make an impression on people but don’t try too hard.,
Get phone numbers.,
Relax and don't overthink things.",How to Have a Great Time at a Frat Party2," Usually at frat parties they will have games like beer pong or flip-cup, and you shouldn’t be afraid to join in. Frat houses are a brotherhood, so comradery is also something you’ll find at most parties. Don’t be afraid to make friends and join in on the fun, even if you are an outsider.

, If you feel nervous when going up to strangers don’t worry, it’s pretty common.It’s important to break through that nervousness and talk to as many strangers as you can at a party. It will make you seem sociable and other people might come up and start talking to you.


Try making a friend every hour. The more people you meet, the better the chance of finding someone to have a blast with!
Try to pick out someone who looks like they came alone. These people are usually waiting for people to talk to them, so they will be responsive.
If you can’t think of something to say, complimenting someone’s clothes usually works.

, If there is music at a frat party and people are dancing, make sure that you join in. Dancing for some people can be a source of anxiety, but the best method to overcome it is just to get out on that dance floor and do it.


Don’t be afraid of looking stupid. Many people don’t know how to dance but try anyway, the important thing is to have fun.
If you feel nervous about dancing with strangers, dance with some of the friends you came with. Since you know them, it will be less awkward and there won’t be any expectations.

, Sometimes it’s hard to stand out at a frat party because of a lot of people usually attend. You want to make an impression on some people, but don’t want to go overboard and try to be the center of attention. By being louder than usual, sociable, and open to speak to anyone, you’ll make a positive impression and people may remember you at the next party.


Sometimes if you try too hard it can come off as agitating, fake, or desperate. Your goal isn’t to be everyone’s friend, but become friends with those that you genuinely like.
Being funny is an easy way to get people's attention and leave a positive impression. If you're not funny, try to be nice instead.

, The party doesn’t end when you leave the frat party. While the ultimate point of going to a frat party is to have fun, it doesn’t mean that you can’t meet really good friends there. When you talk to someone you like, or you see someone you find attractive, don’t be afraid to ask for that phone number.


Don’t ask for a number out of nowhere. Start a conversation with the person first, then ask for their number if the exchange goes well.
Don’t be afraid of rejection. The worst thing someone can say is “no.”
The more you ask people for their numbers the better at it you’ll become.

, Having a fun time at a frat party isn't like solving a calculus equation. While following all these steps will help you have fun, it really relies on you and whether you. If you find yourself overthinking everything and not having fun, just relax and try to make some friends.

"
"
Show up when the party is kicking into high gear and leave before it ends.,
Choose the frat house that’s right for you.,
Bring a couple of friends.",How to Have a Great Time at a Frat Party3," Showing up to a party too early shows that you have nothing else to do, and could make people think you’re desperate. Arriving too late may mean that you miss everything and the party is already over. A good rule of thumb is to arrive at the party when it’s in full swing, typically around 11:30 p.m.


Once the party is dwindling down make sure that you leave. It’s embarrassing to be kicked out of the party once it’s over. When groups of people start to leave, that's your cue.

, Not all frats are created equal, and many of them have different cultures and house rules.Make sure that when you are going to a frat house, you like the culture of the frat so you can meet people with similar interests and maximize your fun.

, Showing up to a party alone can increase your stress.If you bring friends to the party, you’ll have someone to talk to before you can start warming up to strangers.


Make sure to bring people of both genders. Sometimes frat parties won’t allow a group of guys to go in unless they have females with them.
Don’t forget to open up and be social with other people. Limit conversation with your friends so you can meet new people.

Learn who's who.,
What exactly IS an Alpha?,
Find out the qualities your current Alpha has.",How to Go from Omega to Alpha," In a clique there are 5 types of people, Omega, Delta, Gamma, Beta, and Alpha. Although you want to be the Alpha in the clique, each has their special role in the clique that stitches the clique so tight together.


The Alpha. The queen bee. The puppet master. This girl pulls all the strings, inside and even outside the clique. She is the mastermind and is often described as manipulative, ruthless, and a bitch. Which is why people aren't attracted to her because of her traits, it's usually because of her status. You hate her, but you love her so much. She's pretty, gets whatever she wants, and is popular. And everybody wants to be her, which means people stab her in the back frequently for a chance to be on the top. So while being the Alpha is fun and glam, it sure can be a pain.
The Beta. The vice-president of the group. Although this role isn't as glamorous the Alpha is, it's much more easier as you don't have to make the decisions, just make sure the others follow that decision. She is considered the clone to the Alpha, and will basically do anything the Alpha says. She gives the Alpha all the latest drama and gossip and always keep her up-to-date. While Betas are said to be easy to control, like everyone else, they wish to rule, and sometimes if an Alpha doesn't treat her Beta right, she may stab you in the back and take over.
The Gammas. The followers. They aren't fully happy with their role, because being a Gamma means you don't have a choice in what you say or do, but you are invited to most of the parties and usually know all the gossip in the circle. The Gammas wish to be the Alpha, but they all know that if they mess with the Beta/Alpha too much in the wrong way they can easily be turned into an Omega, or even worse.. kicked out of the group. So it's easier to stay the way you are, after all, it's better than not being in the group!
The Deltas. The clique-crashers. They come and go, and sometimes depending on how uptight your clique is you may never even have Deltas at all. These girls are popular and funny, and don't exactly belong to a clique, they are just known everywhere. So giving them a place to eat and a few extra ears for them to talk to is worth it as it increases the clique's status. They are usually jokesters and very social, so they entertain the clique for the time being. They rarely ever officially join the clique, but if they did, they would usually start as a Gamma.
The Omegas. The outsiders. The fringes of the clique. No one knows for sure how they got in. There isn't a special trait about them really. They aren't that pretty, they aren't that funny, and they aren't that popular. No one really likes the Omegas, maybe the Deltas or Gammas, but not in a best friend way. They are just there for some reason, and they are unavoidable. Like house flies, you spray bug-repellant everywhere in your house but they keep coming in and you don't know how. And like house flies are, they are annoying. They are usually pretty immature and clueless. The members often leave her out of social events and hardly tell her any good gossip. The Alpha also tends to use her to do her dirty work and will convince the Omega she will like her more if she does, even though she never does. And like all the other members, she desperately wants to be the Alpha, but usually Omegas don't know where to start. But if you are reading this article and you are an Omega, soon you will.;
, And why do people like her so much when she's so mean sometimes? There are three things which causes people to be attracted to you in this order: Looks, Personality, and Status.


Learn the looks. AKA Ugly or Pretty. The first thing a person looks for in a friend is how they look. It's a no-brainer, really. Let's say you are at a new school and don't know anyone there, and before school starts there are a few groups of people talking. Half of the groups have messy hair, some acne, and not a good fashion sense. The other half has silky hair, a perfect complexion, and the cutest clothes. So who do you want to talk to? Group 1 or Group 2? The answer is obvious, group 2. For some reason, humans think that pretty people usually mean they are happy and successful in life, and that is the type of person people want to talk to.
Learn the Personality. AKA Good or Evil. Once you talk to the pretty, popular kids they invite you to sit with them at lunch (for new kids: populars love meeting new people, the more in their squad the better). You meet the alpha, and at first she seems super nice. But the longer you stay the more you realise how dark the mean the Alpha can be. As you are walking to class, a younger kid walks past and the Alpha ""accidentally"" elbows him and whispers ""Nerd"". The girls laugh and walk away, and since you don't want to be excluded, you follow. Then one day you talk to one of the omegas and she tells you how the Alpha told everyone that she was taking weight pills so she wouldn't get fatter. You start to feel sick around these girls, but there is one reason why you stay.
Status. AKA Popular or Unpopular. No matter what happens, there is usually that final factor which determines whether you stay with that group of friends or not, their status. Let's say one day in class you start to talk with a few other girls and they are all funny and nice. There is hardly any drama and they overall just seem like good people. So you would think, ""Why not just leave the mean, popular girls for them?"". The thing is, everyone wants to be popular. So although those one girls you met in class the other day are nice, they aren't popular. And even though the popular girls are mean and manipulative, being popular is like being royalty. Everyone knows who you are, you get to go to the latest parties, and you always know the hottest gossip. So why become a villager in the kingdom when you are a princess?

, Is she super pretty? Does she know everyone? Is she really sporty? Is she rich? Usually the difference between an Alpha and a Gamma is the Alpha has one special quality like being pretty or rich and knows how to manipulate someone. So really, becoming the new Alpha isn't that hard, it's just about finding how to get a super special quality compared to hers and some good tricks on manipulating people to liking you more.

"
Give an honest explanation.,
Fill your days with activities that keep you from accepting invitations.,
Just say “No.” Sometimes you just do not want to do something, and that is usually understandable.,
Suggest a new plan.,
Blame shift.,
Flake out at the last minute.",How to Get Out of Something1," Being honest about your feelings is not easy, especially if you think you will disappoint someone. Showing complete transparency can be a healthy way to get out of doing something that you have a good reason for avoiding. Your honesty may be well received, and it may open up an important dialogue between you and another. On the other hand, you might find yourself wishing that you’d stayed quiet. Be tactful when you approach the conversation. Find a time to talk privately with the person. Use a friendly and firm voice that communicates your true feelings about the situation. Provide an alternative if appropriate.For example, if your parents want to do something with you, but you have too much homework, let them know. Try saying, “I know this is important to you, but catching up on work is really my top priority right now. Let’s eat together tomorrow when I’m finished with this essay.”
Communicate dislike for others softly. If you’re invited to a party with people you don’t care for, for example, say something like, “It is so nice of you to invite me, but I don’t get along so well with that crowd.”
A conversation with your boss might be a bit harder. Maybe you really hate the job you’ve been assigned, but you don’t want to quit completely. Try saying, “Ms. Bartlett, I wanted to talk to you about the project. I’m trying my best but it’s been weighing me down and I need to take break. Can we talk about a different topic for my next assignment?”;
, Set a day and time for the things you need to do to have a productive week. That way you’ll have a concrete reason to not do something if you get an invitation or are asked to do something extra for work or school.Pre-booked personal activities might include times dedicated to working, exercising, or family time.


If you are a student, you might designate certain evenings for an extracurricular activity or have a homework day on the weekend. If you’re asked to attend an event, you can say, “Sorry, but I have soccer practice that day.”
Remember to do the thing you say you are going to do. Your goal is not to be labeled dishonest.
Although you won’t be lying by saying you have to do something else, someone might get offended if you pick another activity over doing something with them. This is more likely to happen if people know that you’ve made exceptions to your scheduled activities in the past. Stick to your schedule or be prepared to explain yourself.

, Even so, turning down an invitation or getting out of responsibilities can be difficult. You probably don’t want to make the other person feel bad or cause problems. If you do not want to do something, it is likely because it causes some kind of physical or emotional discomfort. Remember that you have to take care of yourself too. Don’t please other people at your own expense.Use short and direct phrases to say “no” without going into too much detail.


You can say “No” and still be gracious and kind. Try saying, “Thank you for inviting me, but I have to pass.” Keep it short and direct. You have a right to say “no” to things, especially if they are not within your responsibilities.

, Maybe you made plans to do something and later realized that you really aren’t feeling up for it. This doesn’t always mean you have to cancel. Try suggesting a new plan that you and the others involved might enjoy.


For example, if you made plans to go to the park, but you really would rather stay home and relax, try inviting your friends over instead. You can say, “Hey, I still want to hang out, but I’m feeling lazy. Can we hang out at my place instead? I’ll make some snacks.”
Rescheduling is another way to get out of something you aren’t up for in the moment. Try saying, “Something came up. Can we change dinner to Monday night?”, Avoid taking the heat for a failed project, scheduling errors, or any situation in which you receive negative attention, by pointing to other people’s mistakes. Although shifting the blame is not the most noble way to get yourself out of something, it happens often. People in work environments have even admitted to taking the blame for something they did not do.Shift blame without using names. If you don’t want to get your coworkers in trouble, explain the facts and details of what went wrong without mentioning specific people.Remember to point out the things that were beyond your control or given responsibilities.

, With modern technology it is much easier to declare that you are not going to be where you said you would be or do what you said you would do. Send a text, tweet, or Facebook message to say that you just won't make it. The plus side is that social media allows you to avoid any disappointing looks or sighs of discontent.Keep your message short and sweet. Try writing, ""Hey everyone, I'm not going to make it today.""

Say that you are sick.,
Say that you have too much work.,
Say that you’re broke.,
Say that you need to take care of someone else who is sick.,
Wait until you receive the reminder from the organizer to cancel.,
Slack off.,
Say you're having technical difficulties.,
Avoid the situation completely.",How to Get Out of Something2," Illness is the golden standard of getting out of something, because people can’t question how you feel. Beware that some people might be suspicious if the sickness was unknown until just before the activity.Use an illness that is easy to recover from and doesn’t bring on too many questions. Things like a 24 hour stomach virus or a migraine work well because real recovery is quick. That way you can show up the next day as if nothing happened.


Sickness may still be the best way to get out of school or work, because you are allotted sick days. However, you may use up a valuable sick day that you later need when you are truly unable to get out of bed.

, This a very common reason for avoiding plans. Even if you do not have work, you can tell the person that you are swamped with paperwork or tests to study for. Most people will not probe you too much. Additionally, telling people that work or school is the problem will shift the blame from you to your boss or teacher.If the plan was to meet a friend or coworker, call them up and say, “I’m sorry, I’ve got too much work to do. Can we raincheck?”
You might be trying to get out of something with your parents. Try saying, “Dad, I just feel like I need to study more for the math test. I really want to get a good grade.” It helps if you actually have a test or paper coming up. Even if you don’t end up studying, at least you won’t get caught in a lie if your parents happen to check with your teachers.

, This excuse works well if you are invited to dinner, a show, or a weekend trip. Even if the activity requires only transportation, you might still claim that you need to cut back on train or gas expenses.Note that the person may offer to buy the ticket for you or pay for your drinks. If this is the case, say, “I wouldn’t feel comfortable with that. I need to be frugal and stay home a little more.”

, Your spouse, child or parent needs a nurse for the night. You may need to fill your spouse in on the lie so that they can cover for you in the future.

, This only works if you received a written invitation. If that is the case, wait for the reminder to break the news. Let the organizer know that you did not get the first invitation and made other plans.


Be careful with email invites. Some people use applications that allow them to see if a receiver has opened an email.

, If you do something poorly, or show disinterest, people might stop asking you to do it. This may be at work, school, or in social environments.


If your boss gives you task you don’t like, find clever ways to avoid doing it. Spend more time on something you like doing, wait until the last minute to do it, or turn it in late.Avoid showing enthusiasm when you complete your assignment.
Consistent social invitations may be harder to get out of. Show up late to the events and leave early. Spend most of the time on your cell phone so you don’t have to talk to anyone. The host may stop inviting you if you are boring enough.

, We use many machines in the 21st century. Sometimes things break. Use the technology around you to get out of something.


Point to transportation problems. Try saying that your car won't start or that there's been a train accident. This can either buy you some extra time or completely prevent you from doing something.
Blame your phone or computer. Phones and computers have difficulties often enough that you can use this excuse at least once. Say that your computer broke down or your phone won't turn on.

, Get out of something by leaving, not showing up, or not doing whatever you had to do. Don’t say anything, just act like everything is fine. This, of course, may have negative consequences.

Pretend to be on your cellphone.,
Say you have an emergency.,
Go to the bathroom.",How to Get Out of Something3," This is a very common way to avoid all forms of social interaction.As long as you’re in an environment where cell phones are allowed, you can take out your phone and pretend to get an important call or text message. Excuse yourself from the situation and pretend to be deeply engaged in conversation.

, This may be used right after you pretend to receive an important phone call. Go back into the room, state that you just got an important call, and say you have to leave. Remember to make your excuse believable and relatively unverifiable.If you have children, try saying, “My son isn’t feeling well. I have to go pick him up.”
If you are on a date, try to look disappointed and say, “My roommate looked herself out, and I have to go let her in. Let’s meet up later.”

, This can be hard to pull off if the bathroom is within eyesight. If not, however, going to the bathroom may be your best escape route. No one will question this need, and they probably won’t go looking for you until at least five minutes have gone by.


A short trip to the bathroom may be all the time you need to get out of something. For example, if you’re in class and you don’t want to participate in an activity, ask your teacher to use the bathroom. Take your time so you miss the full activity.
You don’t always have to use the bathroom as an excuse for leaving. You can say that you’re going to get more popcorn from the concession stand, drinks, or anything you might need in the moment.That way, you have a real reason to take your coat and bag with you.

Find out how you remember other people.,
Choose your own personal scent.,
Develop your own style of clothing.,
Develop a sense of the current style.,
Develop a signature movement.,
Have your own way of saying things.,
Have a certain icon that you put in signatures or other writing.",How to Have Other People Remember You Subconsciously," How you do it could be influenced by a variety of factors: cognitive recall, long-term memory and associative memory are all important factors. If you know a person knowledgeable in psychology, s/he could be quite helpful in teaching you about memory by association.;
, Go to a store that sells perfume, cologne or other scents, and find the right one for you. You could even mix scents together for something unique. If you like it, use it; it will be your signature smell. If you don't find something right away, try again later.

,


For example, wear something red. That's the color associated with fiery passion. Just be aware of the moods of those around you. This color can draw people to you, but it's also been known to enrage others. Perhaps people will respond more if you're in some other color. Experiment.
Look over fashion magazines or watch popular TV shows for grooming hints. Keep in mind, however, that merely being fashionable can lead to your being easily forgotten. When people around you all follow the same trends, you will be just another face in the crowd. You'll do better by progressing a bit beyond the normal fashion. Look for the chance to stand out with even a minor personal flourish.

,


Mix contemporary and classic styles.
Find some examples of authors or illustrators with their own signature tricks..

, Be aware of your own mannerisms ( head tilt, hand gestures, typical gait, etc.). If you don't already possess some memorable trait, make up something attractive, perhaps quirky, in some way memorable. Give it some thought and some time in front of the mirror.

, Try smiling while you speak or making your intonation go up or down. When you can't chat face-to-face, invent a unique written style for texting, e-mail or letters.

, For example, if you sign your name with a musical note, such as a quarter-note, people will know that symbol and may come to associate it with you.

Ask them for their contact information.,
Introduce the person to another person.,
Introduce yourself again.,
Ask the person for additional information about her name.",How to Find Out Someone's Name That You Have Forgotten1," Depending on the situation, it might be appropriate to ask someone to exchange business cards with you. Their business card will usually contain her name, in addition to other contact information.Even asking for a person's email address often results in learning her name. Many people have their names as part of their email address.
You can ask them to enter their phone number in your phone. They'll likely enter both first and last names, along with her number.;
, If you're in a social environment with other friends, there will likely be other people you know. Take this opportunity to introduce someone whose name you know to your new friend.


When you introduce your friend to the person whose name you've forgotten, there's a good chance that the person will then introduce herself to the new person.
Once you've heard the person's name, repeat it so that you'll be more likely to remember it. You might easily work this into conversation by saying, ""I'm sorry, (name), I'm sorry I forgot to introduce you.""

, If the person hasn't approached you, initiate interaction by introducing yourself. She'll likely reciprocate by introducing herself. She'll also be likely to appreciate your directness.


If you ask what her name is, and don't want to admit that you've forgotten her name, you can say you meant to ask what her last name was.The reason this works is because the person will rarely expect you to remember her last name, and she'll usually reply by saying her first name.
Ask whether she goes by her first or her middle name. People will often respond to this question by sharing both names, and even offering more information. For example, she might respond by saying, ""I was always Emily Jane to my grandmother, and when I was a kid, everyone called me Emily. But when I came to college, I decided to use the name Jane.""

, People often are flattered by this attention, and may enjoy sharing particular details about their name's history.


Asking them how their name is spelled is one way to do this, particularly if you recall that it might be an unusual name. Of course, if the name is Smith or Jones, you might have to be prepared with a diversion!
You can also ask the meaning of the name, or about the geographical origins of the name. People are generally happy to talk about themselves in this way, and you'll have more details to help you remember their name should you forget again!

Get in a fun, cheerful mood.,
Wear something comfortable.,
Play party games.,
Volunteer for DJ duty.,
Sing!,
Hit the dance floor.,
Listen.,
Help your host.",How to Enjoy Yourself at a Party Without Drinking1," Often times the fun you have at an event or party depends on the way you prepare mentally for it. If you dread what’s coming and fret anxiously about not drinking at the party, chances are that you won’t have much fun. In the same way, you can increase the odds of having a good experience by getting yourself in a good headspace and elevating your energy level before leaving the house.


Take a moment and visualize the party going well, with you having a good time, eating, dancing, mingling, etc. This will help get you excited for the event.
If you have networking or professional goals for the party, review your intentions while you're getting ready or driving over. This mini-prep session can set the tone of your interactions at the party before you even get to the party.For example, invite some friends over to chat and listen to music together before you all leave. Or, if none of your friends can make it, put on your favorite record while you get dressed.;
, Many people drink alcohol at parties because they feel they need it to make them more comfortable and less socially awkward. You can do a lot of this legwork without alcohol, though, by making yourself as comfortable as possible before entering the social arena. This doesn’t mean you have to look like a boring person if you’re not drinking, though. Just be sure to wear something you love and feel comfortable in, be it a sequined dress or your dad’s old flannel shirt.


Decide what you will wear ahead of time and try it on to make sure you're comfortable with it. This can help avoid last minute panicking!
Depending on the nature of the party you’re attending, you might not have total sartorial freedom. If the invitation indicates a dress code, make sure you adhere to it. If you’re unsure as to the expected ensemble, call your host ahead of time to be sure you show up in appropriate attire., One of the best ways to be social without relying on alcohol as an interactive lubricant is to play games. The common activity will unite diverse and often unacquainted partygoers while focusing the conversation and encouraging enthusiasm. Use this opportunity to get to know the new people you are meeting and bond with them! Some games are more popular than others—for example, saucy games Cards Against Humanity and Say Anything are touted as some of the most reliably party-revving games available—but you can choose from a variety of games and platforms, including classic board games, video games, card games, and improvised games such as charades.If you’re not sure your host will provide games for the guests, bring your own! You might want to ask your host as you enter if they mind your contribution, but chances are that they will be more than happy to have your party-pumping activity added to the mix.

, Dancing isn’t contingent on alcohol consumption, but many people feel uncomfortable doing it without some kind of boozy encouragement. If you’re one of these people, you can get involved in the music and dancing without putting yourself out on the dance floor by playing the DJ for an hour or two. Take requests from your friends and other partygoers while adding your own musical know-how to the mix in order to create a fun and energizing party playlist.

, If you own a karaoke machine or know someone who has one, ask the host if you can bring it along! Many cultures rely on karaoke to liven up parties, create new social bonds, and strengthen existing ones. Some studies have posited that the reason for this popularity is that communal singing creates a powerfully positive experience like a drug- or activity-induced high.Whatever the cause, keep in mind that karaoke is a jolly, alcohol-independent way of brightening the mood and encouraging conviviality.


Karaoke can be a loud and boisterous activity, so be aware of local noise ordinances. Keep an eye on the clock and turn off the tunes at a reasonable hour in order to avoid unwanted visits from the police or irritated neighbors.

, If you’re not shy about busting a move without an alcoholic beverage, take full advantage of the dance floor! You’ll have more fun, time will go by faster, and you can work off some of the calories you’ve consumed from sweet and salty treats at the party.Perhaps more than anything, though, you’ll earn the gratitude of the host by leading by example and encouraging others to get moving.


Not in the mood to dance? No problem! You can still participate in the festivities by watching your friends get down, singing along to your favorite songs, and even just bobbing your head to the music.
Most importantly, just keep a smile on your face. This simple gesture shows you’re a good sport and that you’re enthusiastic about the party, even without an alcoholic wing-man assisting you.

, Many people think that meeting strangers at a party when you’re not drinking is more difficult, but this isn’t necessarily the case. After all, one benefit of alcohol is that it eases people’s social hang-ups and makes them more talkative.So, while over-indulgence can lead to some obnoxious moments, people who are just a bit tipsy are often fun, outgoing conversationalists.


This can be a blessing if you're feeling awkward and tongue-tied in your sobriety. Since your new acquaintance will feel loosened-up from their drink, they'll probably feel more comfortable leading the conversation. You can encourage this impulse by asking leading and follow-up questions such as, ""I never knew you could take classes in that! How would one get started if they were interested? How did you get started?""

, Depending on the tone and crowd of the party you’re attending, you might find that your host or hostess quickly becomes overwhelmed, whether it be from too many drunk revelers, snack bar cleanup, or game oversight. Helping out your struggling host will provide you an excellent, productive way to stay busy and involved without drinking alcohol. Just remember to offer your help explicitly and sincerely, as many hosts might feel like they need to refuse help automatically as a matter of decorum.Some specific things you could ask to help out with include coat check, cleanup, drink duty, noise monitoring, and designated driving.

Ask another person for help.,
Search online.,
Wait for the person to reveal his name.,
Confess your situation to the person.",How to Find Out Someone's Name That You Have Forgotten2," In a social setting, ask the host or hostess. If the other person has signed in, ask if you can see it. You can explain your reason to the host or hostess simply by confessing your situation.


Ask a friend. If you're attending a social gathering, chances are that someone else in the room knows the person's name. Discreetly ask a friend what the person's name is. If you don't get a chance to ask your friend during the social gathering, ask them later.
If you're in a bar, restaurant or other public setting, and person seems to know the location well, people who work there may know the person's name. Ask them to help you. You can explain your situation by honestly confessing that you've forgotten the person's name. Usually, people approached in such a manner are eager to help.
Eavesdrop on their conversations with others. The person may introduce himself to other people over the course of your time together.
Keep alert for any printed material that might have the person's name on it. If you're attending a seated dinner, for instance, you will have place cards. If you're at a trade gathering, the person may have printed materials that he's sharing with others.

, This is easily done by retreating to a private place, and pulling out your smart phone. Most people have sufficient information about themselves online that online search engines will often reveal someone's name by entering in the information about the person that you do have. Enter the information that you have about a person (the city in which he lives, his college or workplace, any other affiliations that you can think of).Once you've entered in all the information you can think of about the person into a search engine, search by ""image"" to narrow down your results. After all, you know what the person looks like - particularly if you're still with him!
Social media sites will use your shared information to find the person quickly, particularly if you have many shared friends. Facebook's ""People Search"" can often help, if you remember any part of his name.
Search for him online by their phone number. Many sites, such as White Pages, 411, or AnyWho, will provide a person's profile through their phone number. Entering the person's phone number into an online search engine, such as Google, Bing or Yahoo, will result in lots of results. These are filtered by relevancy, so you'll only have to check out the most likely options, listed at the top.

, While you're waiting, perhaps you'll remember his name. Talk about other things, which don't require names.


Use verbal work-arounds to avoid saying the person's name. Use the phrase, ""my friend"" or ""my colleague"" if you have to refer to the person.
In certain cultural settings, generic endearments may be appropriate. For example, some people choose to use the terms, ""sweetie,"" ""darling,"" or ""pal.""Be very careful before employing these, though, as they are culturally specific. If these terms aren't commonly used within a particular culture, they might be misunderstood.

, Most people will be understanding, and won't mind telling you their name a second time. You can use this opportunity to tell them your name again as well.


Use a casual tone of voice when you ask what her name is. For example, you might say, ""Hang on, I've already forgotten your name. Would you mind saying it again?"" or ""I'm totally blanking on your name for some reason."" The other person will likely appreciate your honesty.
You might add, ""I'm not good at remembering names,"" so that the person will not assume that knowing her name isn't important to you. If this is a potential business contact, however, don't add this, as it will perhaps seem like a potential liability.
Blame your forgetfulness on your age. Most people experience worsening memories, particularly for names, as they age."

Ask your host for some non-alcoholic options.,
Opt for caffeinated beverages.,
Raid the snack bar.,
Make a special, virgin cocktail.",How to Enjoy Yourself at a Party Without Drinking2," When you get to the party and the host offers you a drink, ask for something non-alcoholic. It’s proper etiquette for hosts to stock booze-free beverages as well as alcoholic ones, so chances are that you can choose from a variety of drinks such as soda, juice, ice water, and tea.Even if you’re not particularly thirsty at the moment, having a drink in your hand can give you something to sip on during awkward silences and prevent unwanted interrogation from curious partygoers regarding your alcohol abstinence.
If you’re worried there won’t be any non-alcoholic beverages on offer, bring your own! Buy your favorite soda or juice in a large enough volume that you can share it with the party.

, While alcohol is not necessary to have fun in social scenarios, it can help to keep you energized and enthusiastic during late-night gatherings. You don’t want to rely on caffeine to keep you engaged, but a moderate amount is nothing to worry about. Aim to limit your daily intake to 400 milligrams per day, equivalent to about four cups of coffee or two energy drinks.While most bars and restaurants keep coffee available for tee-totalling customers, don’t expect your host to make you a fresh pot of coffee. Instead, bring a cold, bottled coffee drink or caffeinated soda such as Red Bull or Rockstar so that you’re not inconveniencing your host with any special requests.

, Just because you’re not drinking, doesn’t mean you can’t treat yourself to some of the yummy party snacks on offer! In fact, many people only drink alcohol at parties in order to keep their mouths occupied and look like they’re doing something when they’re not talking, so eating something tasty can serve you just as well as drinking!


While sweet treats can be some of the most tempting and delicious indulgences available at parties, keep in mind that over-indulging in candied treats can lead to a sugar crash. Try to balance out your sinful samplings with some healthier, high-protein options such as fresh veggies or trail mix., Just because you’re not imbibing, doesn’t mean you can’t participate in the elaborate punches and mixes popular at many parties. Most classic cocktails can be done just as well—and arguably more deliciously!—sans alcohol, so check out some recipes and try your hand at some mixology! You can even occupy yourself at the party by playing bartender and mixing up your booze-less potions for other partygoers.


Virgin Bloody Marys, daiquiris, and mimosas—made with seltzer water or a light sparkling soda instead of champagne—are good for brunch parties and barbeques, while virgin margaritas, mojitos, mulled ciders, and punches are great options for evening soirees."

You identify the negative emotions that you feel when you want to approach someone.,
You apply certain psychological techniques that destroy forever these negative emotions and eliminate the limiting beliefs that are sustaining them.,
Compare in your mind this feeling with the exact feeling that you applied this technique on.,

If there it is still anything psychological that is stopping you then get back to Step 1.",How to Eliminate the Fear of Meeting Women AKA Approach Anxiety," You will hopefully uncover the beliefs that are generating these emotions.


Example: You answer the following question and you write as many answers as you can: ""What's stopping me to meet and interact with more women ?"";
,


One example of a such a technique that will help you eliminate anxiety:

""Joye Pete Technique""

Think of a situation when you want to meet and talk with a beautiful girl. Choose one that makes you feel anxious. Imagine the scene as real, as it happens right now. Hold the image and the feeling and even make it worse. You can make it worse by imagining that the outcome of the interaction gets even worse.
Inhale part way. If you are of an average lung capacity take around half filled with air and hold it. If you are an athlete fill around 25% of your lung capacity.
After a few moments (4 to 15 seconds on average) you will begin to feel stressed by holding your breath.
Let the panic and stress come! It's getting more and more stressful.
Let it build up!
Hold it as long as you can. When it gets too much: slowly and calmly let the air out and gently exhale. Exhale softly and in a relaxed controlled fashion. (This is key! Do not let it in a gasp at once and do not gulp for air after you finish). Immediately, smile big.
Breath normal and keep smiling for 20 seconds or more.
How do you feel now?





, Try to access the same feeling.

, Do you feel as anxious as before?(Some of the people feel good, others less anxious and other people don't feel anything because they completely eliminated the negative feeling.)

Ask people you know what social media they use.
For professional social networking, try LinkedIn.
Once you have a nice picture and a cute or accurate name on your platform of choice, add friends freely.;
, To network with the people you have in your life already, check out communication apps that will let you send what are basically cooler text messages. Check out messaging apps that are popular in Asia, like WeChat or WhatsApp.

If you're interested in privacy, download an encrypted app like Signal.

, Search the platforms you have joined for causes you care about and other interests of yours. For instance, you can join groups on Facebook, follow organizations on Twitter. Post in these groups, reply to other members, and add other members with whom you get along.


For instance, if you're in a Facebook group for Panda Habitat Conservation, and you always feel inspired by the jokes some man named Heinrich from Idaho posts, you can like his post, reply with a joke of your own, and then add him as a friend.
Find message boards or online communities that focus on one of your interests. Post on the topic and share your knowledge. If someone on the message board has similar interests or can teach you something, then send them an email or a private message and get to know them.

, Request connections with everyone you know and like in real life, and anyone you have interacted with online. Don't be offended if people choose not to connect with you. Your strategy is to connect broadly and trim down as needed—this will help you build your network. Others may be in the habit of only following close personal friends, or only friends from school.

, Be active on the sites you choose! Once a day or so, share a comment, photo, or article that interests you and that you think may interest others. If you only use your site to follow others, people will forget you are there.

, The best way to strengthen your network is to interact with the people you are connected with. Take a few minutes a day to check the site and express enjoyment of various posts. Different platforms will let you do this different ways—you might comment or press ""like"" ""heart"" or ""favorite."" Only do this when you actually like something! Otherwise your feed will slowly fill with things that do not interest you.On many platforms, you may post things and tag the people you think may be interested. Only do this on occasion, and try not to tag more than a few people—otherwise it won't feel personal.

, Go through your address book, day planner, or other contact information for your current friends and contacts. Make connection with them just to talk. The subject of your conversation isn't really important at this point. Just staying in touch works wonders and will serve as the foundation for the next steps.

Work your network.",How to Build a Social Network2," From a birthday party to a friendly get together, parties are a great way to gather your friends and expand your network. Ask all of your close friends to come and encourage them to bring guests. Speak with everyone at the party and get phone numbers and contact information from those you do not know and that you share common interests with.

, Attend weddings, funerals and parties that you are invited to. Showing that you care about the people in your network, even if you just pop in and say hi, will cause those that are in your 'network' to return the same courtesy. And, you could meet other people there too.


If you have to say no to an invitation, send an event-appropriate gift or card.

, Consider volunteering and joining a cause that you believe in. You might agitate for a change in election procedures, march against corruption, fundraise for the homeless in your neighborhood, or join an anti-deportation league.You will meet people who share your interests and do some good at the same time.

, Meet new people by joining groups of strangers that gather for socializing. Sites like Meetup.com offer local volunteer-led hiking groups, poker parties, and other fun things. Since everyone is participating in the initial difficulty of meeting with strangers, the awkwardness is diminished.

, Go to large meetups that involve the topics you are interested in. Whether they are about technology, skiing or scrapbooking, you will meet new people that share similar interests. Introduce yourself to people in line, ask questions at panels, and add other attendees on social media.


Try going to the same gatherings every year. That way, you'll make friends with other regulars.

, If you want to participate in a community, you have to give back! That means hosting parties and connecting people, promoting the interests of others within your network, and otherwise being a mensch to those around you.


Consider starting your own activist, social, or artistic group. This can be a bit of a daunting task, but if you start your own group, whether an internet bulletin board group or an actual meet and greet group, people will be coming to you instead of you looking for them. This is a great way to meet new contacts and friends.

, Once you have established yourself in a community, and are known to give back to it, ask for favors. Should you be seeking a job, don't hesitate to tell everyone in your network about it. Send out resumes to those you are closest to or those that share business interest.

Stand in a central position.,
Move locations every 15 – 20 minutes.,

Pay attention to the tone of your voice.,
Learn to read the room.,
Enjoy yourself!",How to Become the Centre of Attention1," If you are at a party or another type of social setting, you’ll receive more attention if you stand in a prominent place.If you’re in a social setting with friends or people you know, ask them to join you in the center of the room. This will help you appear friendly and connected; new individuals will be drawn to you and your friend group.;
, Many people tend to pick a single location at a social event and simply stay put; however, you will attract more attention and meet a larger variety of people if you do not spend too long in any one location.Vary the types of locations that you spend your time in. Talk with someone next to the food table, go outside and have a conversation, etc. This will allow you to meet new people, and you will not wear out your welcome with any one social group.

, A great way to place yourself in the center of attention is to reach out to other individuals around you; bring them into a conversation or game. Reach out to new people and use light conversation and humor to keep the situation friendly and fun.


Bring new people into your group. Don’t just spend time by yourself or with your friends. As long as you are the one starting conversations, you will remain the center of attention.
Use humor appropriately and sparingly. While humor can be an excellent way to bring together a group of strangers, and to make yourself the center of attention, too much humor will start to feel abrasive.

, People love a good story, but even the most fascinating subject can be boring if the teller doesn't know how to keep an audience's attention. Try listening to podcasts like The Moth, which is all about sharing stories, watch stand up specials from comedians like Ellen DeGeneres or Louis C.K., and even check out presentations from legendary businesspeople like Steve Jobs, Sheryl Sandberg, and Richard Branson. Pay attention to pacing, where they pause for emphasis, how they build up to the climax. Watch gestures and body language.


Practice your skills by choosing a short children's story or getting a copy of a favorite speech or monologue from a well-known storyteller. Stand in front of a mirror and practice telling the story over and over again. If it helps, you can start out by replicating the storyteller's performance, pausing where she paused, raising your voice where she did, etc. By telling the story repeatedly, your own voice will begin to emerge.Think about your own life and what stories you have to tell. If you don't think you have any good stories, think about if there are any favorite family stories you might share. It is particularly important you pay attention to length with these stories — often first time storytellers leave in too many boring details and their stories become far too long to hold anyone's attention.Practice this story in front of a mirror, in front of trusted friends and family, and even video tape yourself so you can watch your performance and see where you need to tighten up the story, or if you are mumbling or looking at the floor instead of at your audience.
Keep personal stories simple and truthful. Make sure there is a clear beginning and end, and remember your audience. If your story involves your college roommate's crazy sex life, you may not want to share it with your great-grandma.Incorporate voices, facial expressions, gestures and actions.

, The sound of your voice can be a factor in whether or not you command attention. Learning to speak from your diaphragm may help you keep people's attention when you speak and may even cause them to like and trust you more.To speak from the diaphragm, first learn diaphragmatic breathing. Inhale, allowing your belly to fill with air and rise, then exhale and allow it to fall. Your throat will relax and you will be able to better project your voice and have a deeper, more resonant sound.Take an acting or singing class to develop your breathing and speaking skills, or work with a voice coach. , Going into a business function with the same stories and presence as you would bring to a sports bar might make you the center of attention — but not in a good way. Learning to read a room and adapt to the environment is an important skill to learn so you can be the center of attention in a positive way. Try to get a sense for the overall vibe of the room — do people seem tense, relaxed, worried, aggressive, bored? — and adapt your style for the situation.


For instance, if you're at a dinner party and everyone falls into a tense, awkward silence, you might break the tension by telling a funny story or even calling attention to the situation: ""Well, this is awkward!""If the group seems reserved and the gathering is somewhat formal, save your wild stories for another time, even if you know they kill. Listen to what other people are talking about and try to chime in with something relevant.
If you notice people are bored — looking at their phones while you are talking, glancing away, etc. try engaging them by asking questions and listening closely. People are drawn to good listeners, and once you learn what does excite them, you can focus on that. For instance, you may realize that your hunting stories aren't going over well because you're speaking to a group of vegans. Use this new knowledge to take the conversation in a direction that is more relevant to the interests of the crowd.

, People who are overly concerned with their social image often come across as clingy or personally insecure. One of the most important steps to being the center of attention is simply to enjoy yourself and act naturally in any interpersonal settings.


Try new things to see which you enjoy—other people will notice this and consequently pay attention to you. These activities could include:
Ask someone to dance
Help the host prepare food
Initiate a lawn game or party game.

"
"
Step back from the center of attention from time to time.,
Listen to the opinions of the people around you.,
Develop friendships rather than seeking out crowds.,
Invite friendly individuals to hang out again.",How to Become the Centre of Attention2," It can be emotionally and physically draining to be the center of attention all the time, so be willing to step back and let others shine. People will see this as a generous act, and one that includes others in the conversation.


When you have an opportunity, try asking others questions that will help them open up and lead to further conversations. Try asking:
“Who do you know at this party?”
“Tell me a little about what you do for work?”

, Sometimes, to leave a lasting, good impression on a group of people, it’s important to keep quiet and listen. This shows that you have a sincere interest in the people you are with — fellow party attendees, etc. — and will show that you care about others.


It’s important to ask questions, too. You will seem more socially engaged and thoughtful if, rather than drawing all of the attention to yourself, you try to bring others into the spotlight as well.

, While being the center of attention in a large, crowded setting can be fun and gratifying, it’s also important to have lasting friendships in your life.Find individuals with similar interests, and focus on cultivating friendships built on mutual respect and shared interests.

, Once the party or social gathering has ended, the crowd will dissipate; at this point, you can reach out to people you’ve spoken with and invite them to participate in an activity that interests both of you.If you met several people that you’d like to see again, invite them all to an activity together. This way, you’ll be able to introduce your new friends to one another, and still maintain your status as the center of attention.

Look your best and dress professionally.,
Take the initiative in your job.,
Engage with other employees and your supervisor.,
Organize workplace events outside of the office.",How to Become the Centre of Attention3," The best way to begin drawing attention to yourself is to do so nonverbally; if you dress more professionally you will appear to have more authority, and your office mates and coworkers will be visually drawn to you. Try:


Wearing chinos instead of jeans
Wearing a dress or skirt instead of jeans
Wearing a jacket, or a more formal shirt

, More attention will be devoted to you if you offer to lead projects, start new developments, or offer solutions to significant problems.Rather than sitting back and letting others handle the majority of the innovating and leading, step up to the plate yourself.


This will place you into the center of attention, as it shows leadership skills. As long as you do the work well, you should be positively noticed by your boss.

, This may seem like common sense, but many employees barely talk with the people in their office, and instead go through the day with as little communication as possible.


Face-to-face time will increase your time as the center of attention. Although you shouldn’t detract from your own or other employees’ productivity, do try to engage coworkers in friendly (work-related) conversations.

, This will help you draw attention to yourself, and will give others the impression that you are a social, outgoing individual.Try proposing events like:


An office or company happy hour at a nearby restaurant.
An office picnic, potluck, or cookout.
An office sports game, like softball or volleyball.

Come up with a story plan, but keep an open mind.,
If you still think of something that you wanted in the book but then don't think it fits so well, then take notes on it.,
Take the notes and place them in an order.,
Tick off the ideas when you use them.,
Rewrite, rewrite, rewrite!",How to Keep Track on Book Writing," Don't plan it all at once. That will cause the writing to become boring and you will want to write something new. Jot down and edit new ideas when you get them - don't be afraid to cut out a whole section entirely.;
, Create a notebook just for the unwanted but great ideas, that way you can look at what you wrote during future writings and draw your inspiration from efforts you've already realized.

, Create a series of stories. Maybe even write a story with more than one book--that way you can put all the short stories together to make a large book.

, There's nothing worse than finding that you've used two identical events in two different chapters, which make your story seem boring and unimaginative.

, Don't be hesitant to edit your story. Just keep old copies in a separate document in case you want to return to it.

Consider whether you possess uncommon knowledge about a subject or area of expertise.,
Ask yourself if your experience in a subject area something that you are willing to share.,
Assess the need for your book.,
Gauge your level of passion for books.,
Consider the extent of your ability.,
Consider how you'll promote it.,
.",How to Know if You Should Write a Book," Here is what former marketing executive and current U. S. Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn had to say about the subject: ""Everyone has a transferable commodity-knowledge. Sharing your unique expertise and making introductions for someone creates a lasting legacy."";
, If the experience is painful, and telling about it might dredge up the uncomfortable past, then you will need to factor this into the decision.

, Is there a surfeit of information on your subject already available to the public? If so, it makes little sense to add to the clutter. However, if it is difficult for the public to learn about things that you know--and are willing to share--you have another strong reason to write that book.

, Do you read widely? there are some people who claim to not read much at all, and they mutter something about how they might well write a book. Why? Would it not be like someone who hates golf and cannot play the game well deciding to teach golf to others? Keep this in mind: Good writers are good readers. Samuel Johnson, the great philosopher and lexicographer noted, ""One must spend time in gathering knowledge to give it out richly...""

, Will you be intellectually honest? This is a question that many fail to ask, and few ever answer. If you are going to just write a diatribe, then you are adding to clutter, not knowledge. In fact, more than likely, you are writing nothing but propaganda. Do the world a favor--if that is your mental set--and do not write a book. On the other hand, if you are looking for truth, honesty and accuracy, your book will find an honorable place on bookshelves.

, Do you plan to allow your child--your book--to be an orphan? Are you going to write your tome, and then just let it sit on shelves gathering dust? Or will you promote your book, find a way to get it out to readers? A book that just sits there without readers might as well not have been written--much like a conversation spoken to a mirror.

, Focus on your ambition. Is the notion of writing a book a concept that just will not go away? Does it continue to nudge you? Even shake you up? Have you ever dreamt about the task? Then your subconscious mind is screaming at you to share yourself with a grateful world!

Look in magazines and online for writing contests.,
Carefully read all the requirements of the contest.,
Research the sponsor.,
Heavily edit your manuscript.,
Read the copyright rules for the contest.,
Read past winning entries.",How to Increase Your Chances of Winning Writing Contests," Although there are books on the subject, they can quickly become outdated. Your best chance of finding current, active contests is to search online or to read current issues of magazines that sponsor writing contests. Don’t be discouraged if you are not computer savvy, many writing contest sponsors accept manual submissions.;
, If you plan to submit a poem, make sure the contest includes poetry submissions. Some writing contests accept submissions in only one genre. Contest details should include the following information:


The name of the sponsor
The contest fee, if any
The genre
The deadline for submissions
The minimum and maximum words allowed
The cash prize or other reward recognition

, Select a contest that interests you, and then research the contest’s sponsor. Make sure the organization or company is legitimate. Some trusted sponsors include:


Magazines, especially literary magazines
Publishers
Established businesses (some may sponsor a contest for a new jingle, for example)
Universities

, Don’t rely on spell check. Print it out (even if you plan on submitting your entry online) and read your words out loud, you will often catch mistakes that way. Give your proposed submission to a family member or friend to read. Ask them to look for spelling and grammatical errors, and ask them for any other constructive feedback they may have. Play it safe and use standard, approved writing rules. When in doubt, consult a style book.

, It’s not advisable to submit your writing to a contest sponsor that insists on retaining all the rights to your manuscript.

, Try to enter contests that have a track record. Most sponsors provide links to the entries that have won in the past. Read at least 4 winning entries so that you have a feel for what judges are looking for. If the majority of past winning manuscripts are lighthearted and funny, you may not want to submit your dark horror story. If you are entering a contest sponsored by a magazine, read all the stories in the previous 6 issues of that magazine. There are some periodicals that publish a wide range of fiction, but most magazines want articles that are geared towards their primary target audience. A short story about a sea monster won’t be acceptable to a magazine that focuses on mountain climbing.

"
"
Refresh yourself on the genre.,
Read entries in small batches.,
Read entries when you are in a fairly good mood.,
Review the contest rules.,
Ask yourself if you like the entry.,
Sort through the entries you dislike before going through the ones you like.,
Look at how strong an entry actually is.,
Start critiques by presenting the entry's strong points.,
Only offer constructive criticism.,
Resist the urge to tell the entrant everything you know.",How to Judge a Writing Contest," Contest judges are chosen based on their areas of expertise, but if you have not focused your recent efforts on the genre you've been asked to judge for, refresh your memory before you embark on the task. For instance, if you are an acclaimed romance writer but have spent the last year and a half working on a romance-free crime thriller, spend a few weeks immersing yourself back into the realm of romance before you even start looking over the contest entries.;
, Reading too many entries at once will cause you to get tired. As you tire, your ability to judge and perceive things accurately decreases. Once your eyes blur or your mind feels fuzzy, take a break.

, Like any judge, you are only human. As a result, you are prone to having fits of good and bad moods. People tend to be a little harsher with others during a bad mood. If possible, review contest entries when you feel your best—or, at the very least, at any time other than when you feel your worst.

, Many writing contests have themes, word counts, and other conditions that must be met. Entries that do not fit the theme well or otherwise ignore the contest guidelines must be rejected, no matter how good the story itself might be.


Ask the person putting the contest on for a checklist or set of judging criteria. Smaller contests may leave the decision up to the judges, relying on them to interpret the contest's rules, but many larger contests will have set criteria they want their judges to abide by.

, This alone should not be grounds for passing or rejecting someone's entry, but it is a valid place to start. Pieces that you like are probably strong and grammatically sound. Pieces that you do not like may not be, but you should give them a second look before assuming so. Some pieces may not appeal to you on a personal level even though they are strong and fulfill the contest rules.

, Oftentimes, it is easier to determine why you dislike something than why you like it. Be objective. If you dislike an entry simply because it is not your ""style"" or does not appeal to your own sense of taste, do not reject it. If, however, you dislike an entry because it contains numerous grammatically goofs or otherwise exhibits weak writing, turn it down.

, Each writer and reader has his or her own rules governing ""strength,"" but there are some standard questions you should ask yourself when reading a contest entry.


Does the entry contain numerous spelling and grammar errors?
Does the entry maintain a consistent point of view, or does it jump around without warning?
Does the entry rely too heavily on passive tense?
Does the entry abuse exclamation points?
Is the content unique, or is it filled with one cliché after the next?
Does the writer use strong verbs, or are the verbs all accompanied by adverbs?

, Many writing contests require judges to provide critiques for each entry. By starting with praise, you make the recipient of your critique feel more at ease and more likely to take what you say seriously. Even if you struggle to find anything positive about the entry, keep struggling until you find something worth praising. There are plenty of mediocre pieces, but very few that contain nothing worthwhile.

, This should go without saying, but the criticism you offer entrants should be for their sake and should not be used as an opportunity to vent your own frustrations. Instead of merely stating that you do not like an entry, explain why the entry seems weak. Provide examples and temper your language. For instance, instead of saying, ""This section of the story doesn't work,"" say, ""This section of the story could be stronger if...""

, Being helpful is great, but it has its limits. If you politely suggest two or three changes that you feel very strongly about, the writer may believe your critique and follow through on your suggestions. If you overwhelm the writer with several dozen suggestions, however, he or she may feel too discouraged to benefit from your suggestions or the even bother reading them.

Clarify your statements.,
Rework your introduction and conclusion.,
Expand on your existing quotes.",How to Increase Word Count1," Read over your paper and look for any statements that seem long winded or unclear. Check for sentences that run more than two lines. Break apart long sentences or statements into multiple sentences. Then, clarify your ideas in each sentence to help increase your word count. Add follow up statements so your ideas are specific and well rounded in the paper.For example, you may use clarifying phrases like, “In other words…” or “As noted in my previous paragraph…”.;
, One spot in your paper where you can increase word count is your introduction and your conclusion. Read over your introduction and consider if you can add one to two more sentences to make it sound more detailed and well-rounded. Check your conclusion for any spots where an extra sentence might be needed, such as a short, powerful final sentence at the end of your conclusion to wrap up the essay.For example, you may notice that there is a long sentence in your introduction that could be broken up and then elaborated on further. Or maybe there is an image from the text that you want to describe in a bit more detail in your conclusion to wrap up the paper.

, Another way you can increase word count is to expand on any quotes or references you already have in your paper. Look over the quotes you have already included in the paper. Consider if you can add more of the quote or other quotes from the text to support your idea.For example, if you have a short quote from a section of the text, add another quote that relates to it so you can flesh out your ideas more in your paper.
You can also substitute your existing quotes for quotes that are longer or more relevant to your ideas. This can make your paper stronger and help you increase the word count.

Do an online search for the name of pubs in your area.,
Choose the area with several good pubs in it.,
Decide on a night.,
Contact your group.,
Find a designated driver(s) from amongst your group.,Get out there and have some fun!",How to Do a Pub Crawl," This is the fastest way to turn up the most results.  

Google also offers a GPS map option (if you're on your smartphone) that can show you how the locations of the pubs relate to one another. Seeing the locations allows you to pick an area where a few interesting pubs are clustered together so there's not a large time gap between each hit.;
, If there's an obvious best spot (most pubs of interest clustered together) with few outliers in your area, then this is your location for the night., This can happen either before or after choosing your location.

If you have a special night (anniversary, birthday, etc.), then you need to choose your location based on the date of said crawl.
If you have multiple nights to decide between, it might be to your advantage to select the date of your crawl after viewing the hours of the establishments you wish to visit--as this can limit the nights you're able to go.

, Group messages are a ton of fun and can lead to some silly text-antics. Let them know which night you'll be taking libations together and make sure it jives with everyone's schedules.

Let them know the locations and ask for further suggestions and/or revisions due to information you may have missed.

, Good pubs will typically have a cab option, which your group should consider as it's a cheap price to pay for everyone to be able to drink.

Put in different viewpoints on the topic.,
Include more examples in the text.,
Put in other references or sources.,
Avoid adding fluff to the paper.",How to Increase Word Count2," You can make your paper longer by adding in viewpoints that are different than your own. This could be an opposing viewpoint on your topic or a viewpoint that is slightly different than your own. Adding in different viewpoints can help to make your paper stronger and help you reach the required word count.For example, if you are writing a paper on reproductive rights in Oregon, you may include a section on an opposing viewpoint on abortion rights from a credible source.

, You can also increase word count in the paper by adding in more examples from your sources. Look in your body paragraphs for spots where another example may be relevant to support your idea. Use examples that are more detailed from your source text to strengthen your argument and add to the word count.For example, you may add another example from the source text that illustrates the theme of your essay. Or you may include another case study to support your argument in a paper.

, Consider if there are other references or sources that you can add to your paper to make it more well rounded. Add in references from other texts or include a new source that feels relevant to your topic.For example, if you are writing a paper on reproductive rights in Oregon, you may look for a recent government source that you can then pull content from to add to your paper. Or you may add scholarly articles to your paper to help support your ideas more fully.

, Try not to simply put in fluff, or unnecessary content, into your paper to increase the word count. Fluff includes things like stating the obvious and repeating the same ideas or thoughts several times. Avoid being redundant to help reach your word count. This will only tell your instructor that you are trying to pad your paper, rather than delve deeper into your ideas.You should also avoid using overly complex words in your sentences. Do not try to increase word count by adding a lot of “very,” “really,” and “rather” in your sentences. This will only clutter up your essay and weaken your sentences.

Flesh out existing scenes.,
Include backstory for characters.,
Connect loose threads in the narrative.,
Add minor characters.,
Put in a subplot.",How to Increase Word Count3," If you are trying to increase the word count for a novel or short story, try adding details to existing scenes. Read over the scenes you are have already written and consider if there is a detail about the setting that you can add into the scene. You can also add more of the physical movements or physical details of your characters in a scene.For example, if you have a scene where two characters are arguing in a forest, you may include more details about the forest setting. You can also elaborate on what the characters are wearing in the scene as well as how they move their bodies when they are speaking to each other.

, Backstory is the past of a character, or their history as a character. Having backstory can be valuable in a novel or a longer short story as it helps your reader get a better sense of how your character arrived in the present of the story. It can also make them feel more fully realized on the page.For example, you may try adding in section of backstory for your main character about their childhood. Or you may include a chapter that discusses the history of the relationship between two characters as a form of backstory.

, Read over the draft of your novel or short story and consider if there are any loose threads in your narrative. This could be a relationship between two characters that is left too open or a conflict that is not resolved. There may also be a theme in your novel that sort of fades into the background. Try to draw out this theme more to increase word count and make the narrative stronger.For example, maybe you have a conflict that happens mid-way in the novel. You may try to resolve this conflict by adding content to the last section of the novel so it feels more wrapped up and complete.

, Another way you can increase the word count of your novel or short story is to add in a minor character or several minor characters. Minor characters can be useful for moving plot forward and for developing your main characters in more detail. Minor characters often show up sporadically in the story or at crucial moments in the plot.For example, perhaps you add in a family member for your main character who plays a minor part in the story. Or maybe you include a best friend character to add more content to the novel.

, A subplot is a plot that is secondary to the main plot in a story. Subplots can be useful for making your overall story more complicated and engaging for the reader. They often involve minor characters and present a conflict or issue that is not as immediate as the main plot.For example, if you are writing a novel about the end of a marriage, you may have the main plot be the end of the marriage from the perspective of the couple. The subplot could then be how the marriage affects the children of the couple.

Expand your vocabulary.,
Read more.,
Look at literary criticism.,
Find a new writing setting.,
Try different writing prompts.,
Take on a new writing form.,
Improve one element of your writing.,
Dedicate time in your day to writing.,
Create a writing schedule.,
Participate in a writing challenge.,
Take a writing class.,
Join a writing workshop group.,
Participate in live readings.",How to Grow As a Writer," You can grow as a writer by taking the time to expand your vocabulary and learn new words. Try to learn one new word a day and use it somewhere in your writing, whether it’s in a poem, a short story, or a novel chapter. Adding one new word to your vocabulary each day can help you strengthen and deepen your writing. It also allows you to use words that may be unique or surprising to your reader.

You will need to get a good dictionary and a good thesaurus to expand your vocabulary. You may look up one new word a day and use it in a sentence. Or you may look up words that you notice in published writing so you can add it to your mental vocabulary bank.;
, Great writers are often avid readers. Reading the works of others can help you improve your writing skills and determine what makes a “great work of literature” so great. Try to read a book a week or a week every other week, as your schedule allows.

You should read a variety of genres and styles so you have a better understanding of the stand-out works in each genre. Reading different genres and styles can also help you broaden your own writing style. You may decide to include elements of science-fiction after reading a sci-fi novel in your work. Or you may find yourself inspired to create a character based on a non-fiction character in a book.
Reading a lot of books will also help you get a sense of what is being published and by which publishing houses. This may be beneficial if you plan to submit your writing for publication one day, as you want to be knowledgeable about what is currently on the market and which books are popular with readers.

, You should also take the time to read literary criticism in print magazines and publications as well as online. Reading literary criticism can expand your vocabulary and give you a sense of what critics are talking about in the writing world.

Literary criticism can come in the form of book reviews, opinion pieces of published works, or even blog posts by respected book critics. You may subscribe to magazines that print book reviews and literary opinion pieces or look at websites online that have a “Books” section.

, You can shake up your writing habits and your writing style by choosing a new setting for writing. If you tend to go to the same coffee shop on the corner, head to a nearby park bench instead. Or, if you often write in your office at home you may try writing in a local bar to place yourself in a new environment. Sometimes, changing your writing setting can help to shift your writing so it feels new or different.

You may also want to consider writing with a partner if you have become tired of writing by yourself. You may ask a writer friend to sit with you in a cafe so you can write on your separate laptops. Or you may write with a friend and ask them for feedback on your writing as you go to change up your normal writing habits.

, You can expand your literary horizons by focusing on experimentation. One way to do this is to try different writing prompts, which will force you to experiment and take a unique approach to your writing. Avoid writing prompts that you tend to use often or that feel familiar to you. Instead, push yourself to try writing prompts that might be strange or challenge for you.

If you tend to use the same writing prompt, pick a different writing prompt for your next freewrite or create your own prompt. Go for a prompt that you find disturbing or unsettling and push yourself to try it.

, Let go of your usual writing style and take on a new writing form instead. You may challenge yourself to write in a genre or form that you find intimidating or difficult to do, or you may opt for a form that you have always wanted to try.

For example, if you tend to write contemporary fiction, you may try writing science fiction or if you often write non-fiction, you may try your hand at historical fiction. Mixing up your genres can help you grow as a writer and experiment with your style.
You may try a new form to get you out of your comfort zone, such as trying your hand at poetry if you often write fiction. Or you may try writing a specific type of poetry, such as rhyming poems, if you usually write free verse poetry.

, You may have one element of your writing that you often struggle with or find challenging to do well. Home in on this element and work hard it for a specific period of time. Work on improving this element so you feel confident and proficient at doing it well.

For example, you may struggle with writing dialogue well in your short stories. You may then set aside time everyday to improve your approach to dialogue. You may read published short stories that are dialogue heavy and work well on the page. You may also do exercises where you write a story only using dialogue or focus on improving dialogue in an existing draft of a story.

, To grow as a writer, you will need to spend a lot of time sitting in a chair, writing. It seems simple but it is one of the most important things you can do to grow as a writer. Try to dedicate a set period of time each day or several times a week to writing. You may focus on specific stories or ideas during your writing time or use this time to do freewrites and experiment with your style. Whatever you decide to do, make sure it connects back to writing somehow.

If you are currently writing something, you may set a certain page count or word count that you need to hit each time you sit down to write. You may then challenge yourself to reach this goal as a way to grow as a writer.

, It may also help to create a set writing schedule with milestones and goals. Make the schedule clear and easy to follow. Then, commit to doing it so you can grow and get better as a writer.


You may create the writing schedule by hand or by using a spreadsheet in Excel. You should include a word count or page count in your writing schedule as well as dates of when you are going to complete the story or novel.
You should also note when you have hit a certain milestone or goal on your schedule. This can give you a sense of accomplishment and push you to stick to your schedule.

, You can improve your writing pace by signing up for a local or national writing challenge. This could be a writing contest where you write a set number of pages or words within a period of time, such as a 30 day writing challenge. Doing a writing challenge can push you to write more often and complete a piece of writing within a set period of time.

You may also create your own writing challenge, where you give yourself a deadline for a certain piece of writing. You may then submit the finished draft to a writing contest or a call for submissions by a publication.

, You can improve your writing and get more involved in the writing community by taking a writing class in your area. You may sign up for a class at your local community center or through your local university. Attending a writing class will allow you to meet other writers and improve your craft.

You may choose a writing class that focuses on a writing element that you would like to improve on. For example, if you struggle with story structure, you may take a class on story structure and plot.

, You can also get involved by joining a writing workshop group in your area. Workshopping your writing with others can push you to get better and learn how to take constructive feedback. It will also allow you to meet other writers in your area and connect with them.

You may also consider joining an online writing workshop group, especially if there are not many writing groups available in your area. Regardless of whether you do an in person workshop or an online workshop, you will need to feel comfortable with sharing your working drafts with others and be able to handle getting feedback.

, Another good way to get involved in your writing community is to sign up for live readings at local venues in your area. You may notice a standing open mic night at your local bar and sign up as a reader or apply to be part of a reading at your local university.

Take advantage of any opportunities to read your work, as it will help you improve as a writer and allow you to get more comfortable with sharing your work with an audience.

Number the footnotes within the main body.,
Format the footnote section at the bottom of each page.,
Number all footnotes consecutively throughout the paper.,
Use bibliographic footnotes sparingly.,
Include footnotes for explanatory purposes.,
Include content footnotes only as needed.,
Provide copyright footnotes when appropriate.,
Use bibliographic footnotes for all in-text citations.,
Provide full bibliographic information.,
Cite a book.,
Cite a journal article.",How to Format Footnotes," Within the body of the paper, the footnotes should be numbered using Arabic numbers after the punctuation mark used in the clause the note relates to.









All footnote numbers should be in superscript within the body of the text.
Example:

Preliminary research suggests that this matter could be of crucial significance within the field.1

Studies regarding this matter could be difficult to perform,2 but the effort may well be worth it.


Note that the only exceptions are the long dash and closing parentheses. When a long dash appears after a noted clause, the footnote number appears before the dash. Similarly, when the footnoted clause appears within parentheses, the footnote number should be included within the parentheses, as well.
Example:

The research is important3—whether these efforts are for personal or public gain has yet to be determined, though.
(Contradictory reports made in the past have already been proven inaccurate, as noted in the chart below.4)

;
, A footnote should be included on the bottom of the page that the related information appears on, and it should be labeled using the same Arabic number used to identify its corresponding clause within the body of the text.









Footnotes must begin four single-spaced lines, or two double-spaced lines, below the body of the main text on that page.
Footnotes should be double-spaced.
Each footnote should begin with a standard parenthetical indentation (five spaces). Only the first line is indented, though. All others are flush with the left margin.
Place the corresponding number after the first-line indentation, followed by a period and a single space. Begin the text of the footnote after that.
Examples:

1. See Smith, chapters 2 and 5, for a more detailed discussion on this concept.
2. Other research supports similar conclusions. See Jackson 64-72, Doe and Johnson 101-157.
3. Brown, who worked closely with Smith during these studies, agrees with Smith's process but disagrees with Smith's conclusions (Brown 54).
4. Note. From ""Studies on Style,"" by J. Doe, 2007, Smart Journal, 11, p. 14. Copyright 2007 by Doe. Reprinted with permission.



, Do not restart your numbering at any point within the same paper. In other words, you should only have one footnote labeled ""1,"" one footnote labeled ""2,"" and so on.








, MLA discourages the use of footnotes within a paper, but some publishers may use the footnote system instead of using the more commonly accepted parenthetical citation system.









Do not cite the entire source within your footnotes. The bibliographic information provided in your footnotes should cover no more than the information usually covered by parenthetical citations.
The bibliographic information you need to include should be introduced within the context of a full sentence. At minimum, you should introduce the information by saying, ""See...""
Conclude each citation with a period.
Example:

1. See Smith, chapters 2 and 5, for a more detailed discussion on this concept.
2. Other research supports similar conclusions. See Jackson 64-72, Doe and Johnson 101-157.



, The majority of your explanations and information should be included within the body of the paper, and the MLA style discourages long digressive notes. If you need to occasionally include brief information that strays too greatly from the main text, however, you can use a footnote to do so.









Each footnote should be phrased in a complete sentence. Avoid using footnotes that are more than one or two sentences in length.
Include information that would be helpful to the reader even though it does not fit within the body of the main text.
Example:

3. Brown, who worked closely with Smith during these studies, agrees with Smith's process but disagrees with Smith's conclusions (Brown 54).



, Content footnotes can be used when you have additional information that can benefit your readers even though that information does not fit in within the main body of your paper. Use these notes as infrequently as possible, however, since the APA style actively discourages the widespread use of footnotes.









Limit the contents of your footnote to one or two complete sentences. The total length should not exceed that of a small paragraph.
Keep the focus of your footnote brief and singular. In other words, only describe one subject, and do so as concisely as possible.
You can also use footnotes to direct readers to more detailed information that can be located within another source.
Example:

1. See Smith (2009), for a more detailed discussion on this concept.
2. Other research supports similar conclusions. See Jackson (1998), Doe and Johnson (2012).
3. Brown (2009), who worked closely with Smith during these studies, agrees with Smith's process but disagrees with Smith's conclusions.



, If you pull a direct quote that uses more than 500 words of published material, you need formal permission from the original author. This formal permission should be mentioned within a footnote.









Other violations of ""Fair Use"" copyright laws also require you to obtain formal permission from the author.
You also need to include a note regarding copyright if you reproduce a graphic, chart, or table from another source.
Such citations usually begin with the word ""Note,"" written in italics.
Provide a full citation of the source according to APA specifics.
Example:

4. Note. From ""Studies on Style,"" by J. Doe, 2007, Smart Journal, 11, p. 14. Copyright 2007 by Doe. Reprinted with permission.



, Unlike APA and MLA, Chicago style prefers the use of footnotes over parenthetical citations. The information corresponding to all of your in-text citations should be provided via footnotes.









Note that footnotes still appear at the bottom of the page the cited information appears on, and all basic footnote formatting rules still apply.

, You will need to include more than the author's name, page number, or published date within a footnote. The full citation must be provided. That includes the author's or authors' names and all information regarding the original published source.









Provide the authors' full names as they appear in the original source material. Do not replace full names with initials.
Note that a full citation must be used the first time you reference a text, but every time you mention the same published text after the first, a partial or abbreviated form should be used.

, When citing a book, you will need to provide the author's full name in first-name last-name format, followed by the title of the book in italics. The city of publication, publisher, and year published should be included in parentheses after that. If relevant, provide the page number of the source material last.









For two or three authors, each author should be listed in the order they are presented in on the original source material. For four or more authors, list the first author's name only, followed by the phrase, ""et al.""
Examples:

1. John Doe and Bob Smith, Interesting Book (New York: Wonderful Publisher, 2010), 32.
2. Rebecca Johnson, et al., Another Great Book (Chicago: Awesome Publisher, 2009), 102.


For subsequent references to the same text, shorten the citation to include only the last names, titles, and page numbers.
Examples:

3. Doe and Smith, Interesting Book, 98.
4. Johnson, et al., Another Great Book, 117.



, When citing an academic article, include the author's full name in first-name last-name format, the article title in quotation marks, and the journal name in italics. Follow this information with the volume number, issue number, year in parentheses, and page number.









Example:

Sue Rogers, ""Clever Article,"" Very Important Journal 14, no. 3 (2011): 62.


When referring to the same article at a later place within the text, abbreviate your footnote to include only the last name, article title, and page number.
Example:

Rogers, ""Clever Article,"" 84.

Help motivate your child by analyzing books or stories that your child reads.,
Help your child come up with the subject of the story.,
Help your child brainstorm characters.,
Have your child pick out the main character.,
Have your child select the setting.,
Help your child create a plot.",How to Help a Child Write a Story1," When your child reads stories, take the time to ask her questions about what she is reading (this is much easier done if you also read the story). These questions can help your child to begin to recognize the different parts of stories, as well as to generate her own ideas. Ask questions like:


Can you define the beginning, middle, and end of the story?
Who is the main character of the story? Who are the supporting characters?
What do you like about the characters? What do you not like about them?
Where does this story take place?
Can you identify a conflict in the story? How does this conflict get resolved?;
, If your child is having trouble coming up with a storyline, help her to refine her ideas by prompting her with different topics. Tell her to think about what she experiences in her daily life, or about people that she finds interesting.


Consider prompting your child by asking her to write a story that is based on a situation she found herself in that made her feel a certain way.
Borrow ideas from your child’s favorite stories.
Give your child three unrelated objects or events and allow her to craft a story around a connection she makes with all three things. For example, three things you could mention could be a dragon, the ocean, and a volcanic eruption.

, Before trying to help her, ask your child to come up with her own characters that she feels could fit into the storyline she has just created. Give your child a piece of paper for each character and ask her to write down different traits, skills, and the appearance of each character. If she gets stuck, ask her questions like:


Why is he so grumpy? Did something make him angry or was he always like that?
Where are the parents? Are these children alone in this story? Why is that?
Does this little girl wear the blue dress always? Is it her favorite dress or her only one?
You can make a table to help your child keep track of her characters. The table could have the following columns: Name of character, relationship with other characters, appearance, and behavior.

, Ask your child who the main character of the story is. If she doesn’t understand what the main character is, explain that the main character is the one that is involved in most of the action in the story.


Once she has selected the main character, suggest that she flesh out the character a bit some more. What was the character’s childhood like? Who is his or her best friend? What does the character love more than anything else in the world?

, Once your child has picked out the place that she would like the story to take place, ask her about the setting to help her generate a description or image of the place. Ask questions like:


If you were standing in this place, what would you see? What would you hear?
What are the main colors of the landscape? What are the main features? Are there mountains nearby, or does this take place in a city?
Is the setting a large landscape, or will the whole story take place in a house, cave, or inhabited area?

, A plot generally revolves around a challenge or problem that the main character has to face and overcome. The main character could have to go on a journey to do this, or could seek help from a variety of unique characters. Because she is only brainstorming, you can help your child to come up with the beginning, middle, and end of the story. Ask her:


What caused the problem in the first place? What does your character have to do to find the answer or overcome the challenge? What is the outcome? Ask your child to describe each section of the story in a short paragraph; these don’t have to be detailed, they can simply offer a glimpse into what will happen in each part of the story.
You can help your child to keep track of her story by helping her to draft a map or outline of everything she says for each section of the story. You can also have your child draw pictures of the main events of each section of the story to help her visualize the plot.

"
"
Help your child to write the story once she has made a plan for the story.,
Explain the importance of a catchy first sentence.,
Help your child to set up the problem the main character must solve.,
Add some secondary characters.,
Let your child take the plot wherever she wants.,
Suggest adding a conflict.,
Insert dialogue and emotions.,
Suggest a cliffhanger for each section of the story.,
Help your child to add resolution to the story.",How to Help a Child Write a Story2," Once your child has come up with a rough idea of where she wants the story to go, she can begin to write the story out.


This can be done by writing each section of the story individually, or by writing the whole thing all at once (it doesn’t have to be that long after all).

, Teach your child that having a strong opening sentence is important to making the reader want to keep reading. Explain that the story can begin with an intriguing statement, or a descriptive passage. She could also begin her story with a section of dialogue.


An example of an intriguing statement could be something like “As Jack looked up in wonder at the big puffy clouds in the sky, he could not have guessed what strange events were going to happen that day”.

, Help your child to come up with a description of the major character, as well as the problem that that character will have to face. If she gets stuck while writing, begin to ask questions again.These questions could include:


How does the character find out about the problem? What is his or her reaction to the problem? What his or her first idea of how to solve the problem?
Who does the problem affect? Is someone in danger? Does the character find out he or she has to travel a far distance to solve the problem?

, Remind your child that she came up with other characters to put into her story. If she gets stuck figuring out how to work those characters into the story, consider talking to your child about the main ways that secondary characters relate to the main character:


Helpers or mentors: These are characters who help the hero to solve the problem. They may be smart, good-natured and friendly.
Opponents: These characters may want to prevent the hero from solving the problem, and can serve to complicate the tale. These are generally not friendly characters.
Jokers: These are characters that appear in the story simply to make the story more interesting; these generally joke around with the hero.

, Once you have helped your child to get on the path to writing the story, sit back and let your child take the plot wherever she wants. If she gets stuck, be there to help her run through ideas, or ask her questions that could help her to generate new ideas.

, Conflicts are often a part of different plots, and serve to make the story more challenging and interesting. This conflict generally causes the hero to have a harder time resolving the problem he or she is facing.


Conflicts often happen between character and character (such as the hero getting into a fight with the villain), between character and nature (maybe the hero has to climb a very tall mountain to find the item she is looking for), and between the character and his or herself (maybe the character wants to overcome a flaw that he or she is aware of within his/her own nature).

, Help your child to come up with dialogue by role playing the scene out loud. Have your child cast themselves as the hero, and you are the character they are talking to.


For emotions, ask your child what she thinks the character feels during different situations throughout the story.

, Teach your child to use “the cliffhanger” to keep the reader's attention. Let each chapter end with the action that reaches a peak and remains incomplete. In this way, the reader is compelled to start the next section of the story right away.


For example, perhaps the hero found a solution, only to realize that an unexpected conflict stands in the way, such as a dragon guarding the sword the hero needs.

, Once your child feels like the story is winding down, help her to resolve the story. If she is having trouble figuring out how the story should end, suggest different ways that the hero could resolve the problem.


You could also suggest that she write in what happens to all the other characters in the story.

"
"
Let your child re-write the text.,
Polish the story.,
Help your child proofread.",How to Help a Child Write a Story3," If your child is not totally satisfied with the story, let her rewrite the story as she sees fit. She make the story go in an entirely different, and even more exciting direction.

, If your child has written her story, but feels that it could use some details, help her to replace boring words with more flowery or engaging language. Help her to look over her descriptions and come up with ways to make the description more engaging.


Brainstorm adjectives, epithets, and descriptions for characters, places, and events.

, Editing the story is very important. Help your child to read through the story and find any sections that don’t really make sense, or that don’t seem to fit with the rest of the story.


Proofread the story together with your child, correct the errors , suggest details, and look for awkward sections together.

"
Recognize that editors prefer simplicity, familiarity, and consistency.,
Accept that there is no single “Standard Manuscript Format.” This is true despite the fact that editors and publishers regularly use the term, or even abbreviate it as “SMF.”Instead of a single, clearly-defined, universal standard, what exists instead are a set of generally-agreed upon formatting principles with variations on the specific details.,
Get the basics correct.,
Lay out the title page.,
Format your header.,
Make new chapters clearly identifiable.,
Address other possible components of your manuscript.,
Set up the page.,
Choose the proper alignment, spacing, font type, and font size.,
Set up your header.",How to Format a Manuscript," Editors have huge piles of submitted manuscripts — well, nowadays, perhaps countless email attachments — to read through at any one time. You might think that flashy colors, unique fonts, or some other eye-catching effort might make your manuscript stand out, but they usually prefer a “boring” standardized look that allows them to quickly examine and assess the work.For each publisher to which you submit your manuscript, check to see if they have specific formatting guidelines, and follow them if so. Guidelines will often be posted on the publisher's website, but if you aren't sure, you can contact a person in the acquisitions department for clarification.
In absence of publisher guidelines, however, using the general guidelines here should work. Usually, if your formatting is common, simple, and consistent, your manuscript’s odds of immediately landing on the “reject” pile will be reduced.;
,
If you don’t have specific formatting guidance from your prospective publisher, don’t drive yourself crazy trying to find the one true “SMF.” Pick and stick with the variations you find most sensible throughout your manuscript.

, Despite the SMF being akin to the Loch Ness Monster or Bigfoot — rumored but never proven to exist — there are some formatting guidelines that are practically universal and should always be followed.


Use all black text on all white paper. No funky, unique, or ""pretty"" colors of any kind. Also use a good-quality, 20-pound bond white paper if making a hard copy submission. Don’t staple the paper, and pack it neatly and securely for shipping.Make the manuscript readable by choosing a traditional, 12-point font and double-spacing everything. No big letters, no cramped pages to save trees / shipping costs, no Comic Sans font. There is some disagreement on the best traditional font, but Times New Roman, Courier, and possibly Arial are the best bets.Create margins that allow the editor room to scribble notes on the pages. One-inch (2.54 cm, or just 3 cm) margins all around is the typical standard. You can go a bit bigger if desired, but there is no reason to have giant margins and a small text area in the center.Every page of text should have a header with your last name, the manuscript title (or just key words from it), and the page number. Commonly this is placed on the right margin. Some recommend using hyphens or spaces, but slashes are typical as such: Smith / My Manuscript / 23.Unless told otherwise, left align your text, leaving a jagged right edge (don’t “justify” the text). This is considered more readable by most.If you're submitting electronically, save your manuscript as a PDF unless specifically told otherwise. This format is easily readable by anyone with a computer and will preserve your formatting exactly.

, While some editors advise using a combined title page / first text page, especially if submitting a short story, creating a separate title page is probably the safe option.At very least, your title page needs to have your full name (legal name and pseudonym, if used), the full title of the work, your contact information, and a word count (actual or close estimate). Consider the following layout for your page (all double spaced):Place your legal name and contact information on the top left of the page.
Place your word count on the top right. With the ease of modern word processors, there is no reason not to include the precise word count instead of an estimate.
Halfway down the page and centered, place your title in all caps. On the next line (centered), add “by.” On the line after that, add your name or pseudonym as you want it to appear on the work.


In the bottom section of the page, you may choose to add copyright information and / or contact information for you or your agent, if either is relevant to your manuscript., Despite some slight variations in style, experts invariably recommend that you include as a header your last name, the title (or abbreviated title), and the page number along the top right of each page of the manuscript text.


The following would make a clean, simple header: Lastname / My Manuscript / 1. If your title happened to be “My Totally Awesome, Must-Read, Must-Publish Manuscript,” then “My Manuscript” would make a good abbreviation for the header.Your title page should not have a header nor a page number (think of it as page zero). Other possible prefatory materials (contents, acknowledgements, etc.) are also not part of the main page count, and can instead contain a header that uses lowercase Roman numerals (for example, Lastname / My Manuscript / iii). The page indicated by Arabic numeral one (1) marks the beginning of the actual manuscript text., Editors do not want to have to search for (or guess) where one chapter ends and another begins.Start each chapter on a new page. Leave the top third of the new page blank, save for the header.
One-third of the way down the page, centered, enter the chapter number and chapter title in all caps; for instance: CHAPTER 1 — THE BEGINNING.
Start the text of the chapter four to six lines (two or three double-spaced lines) below the title.
Do not indent the beginning of the first paragraph in each chapter. Only paragraphs that begin a new, separate chapter, section, etc., after a break with the last part of the text, should appear without indentation.
All lines of dialogue should be indented, unless they begin a chapter, etc.
Advice on the actual indentation varies, with some advising five spaces and others one-half inch or 1.25 cm.Consistency throughout the manuscript is probably most important.

, Once again, consistency and clarity should be your goals.


Every manuscript has an ending (and hopefully a compelling one), and placing “END,” centered and in all caps, is the best way to clearly indicate the conclusion of the work.In a manuscript that includes scenes, such as a play or movie script, scene breaks can be identified by leaving a blank line, save for a centered hashmark (#).Footnotes are less common in non-academic manuscripts, and as such not as often clearly addressed as part of “SMF.” If you have footnotes, consistency is likely the most vital factor. You should probably only consider using endnotes if you have nothing but citations in your notes.

, Default margins in Google Docs are already set at the preferred one inch, but if you need to reset them:


Click the File tab.
In the drop-down, click Page Setup.
In the box that appears, enter “1” (inches) for the top, bottom, left, and right margins.
The document should already be in portrait mode, not landscape. If not, change it here also.

, All of these can be changed by clicking on the proper buttons across the top section of the page. The default text type and size in Google Docs is Arial 11-point, so these should be changed.


The preferred left alignment (with a jagged right edge) is the default, but the four alignment option buttons (left, right, center, justified) are easily located near the center of the row.
The line spacing button is just to the right of the four alignment buttons. 1.15-line spacing is the default in Google Docs. Simply click the button and choose “Double” from the drop-down.
The font type and size buttons are also easily located in the left-center part of the row. Simply click on each to produce drop-downs with your font style and size options. Always choose 12-point, and it is usually best to use Times New Roman unless otherwise directed.

, Remember that your header should include your last name, (abbreviated) title, and page number, and be located at the top right of each page of the main body of the text. The title page should not have a header nor be included in the page number sequence.


Click the Insert tab. Choose “Page Number” from the drop-down.
Four options will appear. Select the one that places the page number in the top right corner, but excludes the title page (as indicated by a small animation of two sample pages).
Page headers are not shown unless you are in Print View mode. This option is found under the View tab.
Find the first inserted page number (“1”). Place the cursor to its left, then type your header as such: Lastname / Abbreviated Title / 1.

Find a quiet, secluded area to write.,
Make your writing area ergonomic.,
Eliminate distractions around you.",How to Get Started Writing1," Choose a writing spot that is in a quiet, secluded area in your home. This could be a desk in your bedroom, a table in your living room, or a secluded spot in your school library. Go for a spot that has little to no foot traffic and is barely used by others.You may set up an area to write if you do not already have access to a table or a desk. Set up a desk in your bedroom that is for writing only or put a table in the basement of your home and use it as your writing spot.;
, To ensure your writing area is comfortable, make it ergonomic. Get a desk chair that supports your lower back. Adjust your desk chair so your feet can lie flat comfortably on the floor and your lower back is straight. If you are typing on a computer, make sure the monitor is 20 to 40 inches (50-100 centimeters) from your face. The monitor should be eye level and you should be able to see the screen without having to squint or strain your eyes.You should also make sure your keyboard is at the right height so your wrists are not strained when you type. Keep your mouse near your keyboard so you can reach it easily.

, One of the biggest hinderance to writing is getting distracted by things and people around you. Turn off your cellphone or switch it to silent so you are not distracted by phone calls or text messages. Keep your door closed and wear noise cancelling headphones, especially if it is noisy around you.You may also shut off your internet connection so you are not distracted by social media or online news.
If you live with other people, let them know you are writing and that you are not be disturbed.

Base your brief preparation on the particular court that’s hearing your case.,
Establish the reason for the brief.,
Find and follow the court rules.,
Make a list of the important facts in your case.,
Determine the legal points you need to address.,
Research the law.,
Compile a list of the legal cases and statutes you plan to use.,
Follow the court rules regarding formatting requirements.,
Prepare a Cover Page, Table of Contents, and Table of Authorities.,
Compose the body of the brief.,
Set your page numbering.,
Consider hiring an attorney to represent you.",How to Format a Legal Brief," This will determine the requirements for how you’ll compose your brief. Your case will either be in federal or state court.


The federal court system encompasses Federal District Courts, Federal Courts of Appeal, and the United States Supreme Court.
State court systems usually have trial courts (sometimes called Superior Courts or Circuit Courts), appellate courts, and the state supreme court.;
, Briefs are normally either trial briefs or appellate briefs. There will probably be different rules governing each, so the necessary elements of the brief will depend on whether you’re using it for a trial or an appeal.


A trial brief is provided to a judge as a written presentation of the facts and law that you feel backs up your argument as to why you should win your case. (In a trial, if you're the person who started the lawsuit you're known as the ""plaintiff"". If you're the one being sued, you're called the ""defendant"".)An appellate brief comes into play primarily when someone has lost a trial, and wants a higher court to overturn (reverse) the decision. (This is known as an “appeal”.) The purpose of the appellate brief is:

To convince the higher court that the trial court’s decision was wrong (if you’re the person—known as the “appellant” or ""petitioner""—who lost the case and is appealing the decision), or
To defend the trial court’s decision (if you’re the person—known as the “appellee” or ""respondent""—who won the trial)., Whether you’re in federal court or state court, there are rules of procedure that control how a brief should be written. You’ll need to follow these rules very carefully to ensure that your brief is acceptable to the court.


Federal courts usually have a website that will give you access to the court rules. For example, the rules governing federal appellate briefs can be found here.
Many state courts have websites. Some may have their procedural rules posted online. If your state doesn’t provide this service, then you’ll have to check legal research sites online (some of which you may have to pay for), or go to a law library to find the rules. Most courthouses have law libraries that are open to the public.

, This amounts to setting down the sequence of events that led to your case being in court. The facts of a particular case are what dictate which laws a court will need to apply to make a decision.

, You have to identify the legal point (issue) in your case that you believe needs to be resolved. For example, you signed a contract to sell your house. But now the buyer wants to back out of the deal because the house has termites. The legal point you want to address is whether the law permits the buyer to avoid going through with the contract under these circumstances.Some other common issues you may encounter are:


A neighbor’s responsibility if a tree limb, hanging over your property from his or her yard, falls and damages your house
Whether a landlord who’s trying to evict you for non-payment of rent is obligated to accept your offer to pay the overdue amount
A municipality’s liability for damage to your car caused by an unrepaired pothole.

, Once you know the legal points you need to deal with, you have to find the law that applies to these issues. You’ll require access to federal or state statutes, and legal cases that are similar to yours. You can find statutes (and some case law) here, as well as on your state’s official website. However, you may need more case law than is available on these sites.


There are online legal research services, but normally you have to pay to use them.
The alternative is to go to a law library, where you can research online or by using the law books available there. Law librarians can help you find the research tools you need, but doing the actual research is up to you.

, Whenever you find a legal source that you believe supports your argument, you’ll have to note its citation (its name and the legal book it’s located in) to use it in your brief. You’ll also need the page number (for case law) or the section number (for a statute) of any portion of the legal source that you want to quote in your brief. Your best bet is simply to print the case or statute so you have it readily available.

, Each court’s procedural rules will tell you what kind of formatting is needed. However, some of the more standard features are:


Paper: opaque and unglazed
Line spacing: double-spaced for standard text; single-spaced for quotations, headings and footnotes
Paper size: 8.5” x 11”
Margins: one inch all around
Type size: 12 point, usually Times New Roman, Arial, or Courier (The Supreme Court of The United States requires a font from the Century family)
Sides of page available for text: One side only., These are the preliminary pages of the brief.


The Cover Page is where you’ll list the court name, the names of the parties involved in the case, the court case number (usually known as a ""docket number""), the type of brief (trial or appellate), your status (plaintiff or defendant; appellant or appellee), and your name, address, and contact information.
The Table of Contents is pretty much what you’d expect. It breaks down the various sections of the brief, and indicates the page on which each section begins.
The Table of Authorities is where you list the legal sources you’re referring to in your brief, such as statutes and case law citations.You can find an example of a Cover Page, Table of Contents, and Table of Authorities here.

, This is the actual heart of the brief. Keep your sections concise and to the point. Some standard sections are:


A Statement of Facts. This is where you’ll use the information you compiled in Part 2, Step 1, above. Lay out the facts in a logical order, basically leading from the beginning events of the case up to the time the case was filed in court.
A Summary of the Argument. As the title implies, you’ll summarize how you believe the law applies to your circumstances.
The Argument. Here's where you’ll be able to expand on how the law applies to the facts of your case (such as by quoting prior cases similar to yours).

Usually you’ll have the word “ARGUMENT” centered, in capital letters.
Below that, and single-spaced, you’ll indicate the legal point you’re making, in just a few lines.
The rest of the Argument section should be double-spaced, except for quotations (single-spaced).


The Conclusion. This section is typically very short. You basically tell the court what you’re asking it to do. For example, if you’re the appellant in a case, you’ll respectfully request that the appellate court reverse the decision of the trial court. The Conclusion section is also where you sign the brief., This is known as “pagination”, and it can be a bit tricky in a brief. For example, some courts may want your preliminary pages to be numbered in lower case roman numerals, and the body of the brief to use standard numbering. Again, be guided by the court rules. You can learn more about pagination here.

, Brief writing and formatting can be complicated, particularly on the appellate level. Even if you represented yourself at the trial, you might want to consider retaining an attorney to represent you on an appeal.

Set aside a specific time in the day to write.,
Maintain a goal word or page count.,
Reward yourself once you reach a writing goal.",How to Get Started Writing2," Another way you can get started on your writing to to make it part of your routine. Designate a specific time in your day to get writing done. This could be early in the morning before work or late at night after dinner. You may also use a lunch break or a gap between classes to write. Try to stick to a writing routine, where you have a set time for writing only and nothing else.For example, you may designate the hour before you go to work for writing. Or you may set aside one hour after dinner to work on writing.

, To motivate you to get writing, establish a goal word or page count. Have a goal word count per day or a goal page count per week. This can help you dive into the writing and feel a sense of accomplishment every time you achieve your writing goal.For example, you may have a goal word count of 500 words a day. Or you may have a goal page count of five pages a week.

, To help you feel good about starting your writing, use rewards. Whenever you reach a writing goal, reward yourself to recognize your accomplishment. This could be something small like a piece of chocolate or a cup of coffee. Or you may take a five minute break as a reward to go for a walk or to do some stretches in your chair.


You may also use social events as rewards for getting your writing done. For example, you may reward yourself with a night out with friends once you get a certain number of pages done. Or you may reward yourself with dinner with your partner once you hit a certain word count.

Use a current event as a writing prompt.,
Write a letter in the voice of your main character.,
Write from a perspective opposite from your own.,
Use a quote from a source text as a prompt.,
Do one writing prompt a day.",How to Get Started Writing3," Open a newspaper or go online and scroll through the news on your social media pages. Use an interesting current event as a prompt for your writing. This is a good option if you are struck trying to write creatively and do not know where to start or how to come up with a story idea. Imagine you are a character involved the current event or one of the witnesses of the event. Then, write about it.For example, you may use a recent fire in your town as inspiration for your writing. Or you may use a recent political event as a story idea.

, If you are not sure how to write in the voice of a character in your story, try writing a letter from their point of view. Address the letter to another character in your story or to you, the author. Use the first person “I” to write the letter. This can help you tap into your character’s voice and use it later in your story.You may also try to answer the prompt, “What does this character want?” in the letter. Respond to this prompt in the voice of your main character.

, Another way to get into writing is try writing from an opposing perspective. This prompt can work well for creative writing or academic writing, such as a position paper. Writing from a different perspective can help you explore different points of view and get your creative juices flowing.For example, if you are stuck on how to write a position paper on pro-choice, try writing a few sentences from the perspective of a person who is pro-life. This may help you realize who the opposition is and what their views are. It can then make it easier for you to start writing your paper.

, If you are struggling to get started on an academic paper or essay, pull a quote from a source text and use it as a prompt. Choose a quote that you find inspiring or interesting. Write it down and then write about what you think it means in the context of the text. Reflect on its significance as well as what it might be missing or any parts that you find unclear or confusing. You can then use this content to continue writing your essay or paper.


For example, if you are writing a paper about a literary text, you may pull a quote or a scene from the text and use it as a writing prompt.

, If you are looking for a writing prompt to get your mind going and help you put something down on the page, search online for fun, short prompts. Sites like Writer’s Digest and the Writing Prompts Tumblr are good options for fun prompts.


Select one prompt a day and do a timed freewrite using the prompt. From prompts on writing in the perspective of an animal to writing about a dream, you can find a prompt to inspire you and get you writing.
For example, you may try doing 10 minute freewrites in the morning before work or school to get your ideas going. Or you can do a 10 minute freewrite before you start on an essay or short story to get your creative juices flowing.

Make a cluster map around a topic or theme.,
Create a list of writing ideas.,
Talk to others about your writing ideas.",How to Get Started Writing4," If you are struggling to get started on an essay or paper, use a cluster map. Write down the main topic or theme of your paper. Then, cluster ideas and thoughts around the topic or theme. Circle each idea and draw a line from the idea to the main topic. Put down as many ideas as you can think of around the topic or theme. Then, read it over and pick ideas that you find inspiring to start your paper.For example, if you are writing about the theme of loss in a novel, you may write down character names and scenes in the novel that illustrate this theme, clustering them around “loss.”

, You can also brainstorm by making a list of possible ideas for your writing. Include bad ideas as well as good ideas. A big part of brainstorming is letting ideas flow without judgement. Once you have made the list, you can read it over and see if any ideas stand out to you or inspire you.For example, if you are writing a position paper for a class, you may make a list of possible positions on an issue you can take for your paper.

, Sometimes, brainstorming with others can be more effective than doing it on your own. Talk to others around you about your writing ideas and see what they have to say. Tell them what you are thinking about writing and ask them for feedback or guidance. Often, chatting with others about your ideas can force you to verbalize them and think them through out loud.For example, you may speak to a peer about your ideas for an essay for class. Or you may talk to a writing professor about your thoughts for a short story.

Read before you write.,
Use short chapters.,
Write-A-Chapter day.,
Use a chapter outline.,
Pursue your passion without doubts.,
Write about something interesting.,
Work on only one story at a time (up to a certain point).,
Complete stuff.,
Stop pursuing new ideas.,
Write and then be done with it.",How to Get Your Writing Mojo Back," The words will come easier and the dialogue will be more fluid.;
, Short chapters offer more productivity. To use this technique wisely, once you've completed the story, join the short chapters up into pairs of three or four, and combine them as one chapter. For example, four 1000 word chapters combined will earn you a nice chunky 4000 word one.

, This one is all about continuity. Writing a chapter per day keeps the fluid motion of the story moving, and entails good discipline habits. This is easy to do because your chapters, initially, are so short. A simple 1k chapter feels like such an accomplishment, especially because you can say that you’ve finished 16 chapters of a story, when in reality, once you combine them, you’ve may have only finished four. Despite knowing this, there’s still a certain exhilaration in seeing a folder full of 40 completed chapters. The chapter a day step makes you think that you’re writing more than before, when in reality, you’re writing the same amount – and this feeling of euphoria helps you push through with ease and fluidity.

, This step is if you’re not doing Step 2 or Step 3, in which you want to use full chapters spread over a couple of days instead of short chapters every day. Creating a chapter outline is like a savior from heaven once you’re knee-deep in the story. It doesn't need to be extremely detailed – just a short summary of everything that will happen in each chapter. This way, when you reach chapter four and feel like banging your head against the table, you can pop out your document and figure out where the story’s going. This also aids in picking up a story after a long time, so you remember what’s going to happen and how to continue with it.

, The only way to pursue a passion is with determination and blind enthusiasm: know you can do something. Believe deeply in it. And yes, there’s always the possibility that it all may not come true, but hey, at least you wrote, right? At least you had fun with your writing, right? And in the end, isn't that what matters the most?

, It could be something you really like so that the story can pull you in instead of you pulling at the story.

, Pick one novel idea that you've been toying with, and make an effort to reach the halfway point without starting anything else. Once you’ve reached the halfway point, you can possibly start a new story. This ensures that you’re not aimlessly starting a few chapters and moving onto new stories, but also getting somewhere. Another thing is: once you've written half the story, you've put too much effort into it to back out. Writing 50 000 words is a lot of work, and now that you’re knee-deep, you’ll be compelled to finish it despite starting a new story.

, Probably the biggest drawback for a writer is when they’re stuck in the rift of never being able to finish anything. It is disappointing to be a good writer (or think you’re a good one, at least) and never be able to finish a novel, or a short story, or anything. Completing one story at a time, one chapter at a time – it feels good, and bumps up your motivation. So strive to complete that chapter you hate – lug through it, but finish it. It’ll feel like a lungful of fresh air when you’re done, and this fresh air will help you get through the next one.

, Write your new ideas and new plans in a notebook, but stop pursuing them. So instead of pursuing new ideas, take the first idea you've written down in your notebook, and finish it. Then, move onto the next. Find one good, fool-proof plan and seriously stick with it. Seriously. Don’t keep changing it.

, Once you've created your fool-proof plan, your mega-awesome schedule to finishing your story, stick with it. And after that, be done with it. For example, if you plan to write a chapter of Project A and then a chapter of Project B, and keep switching until one of them is finished, then follow through with it. But when you’re not writing, don’t think about writing. That’s an issue of some – they make plans, think about their writing, mulling over how to do it - all day. Once you've done your daily word count or goal (strive to do this in the morning), ease yourself out of writing, pretend you’re not a writer, and go do other things. You can cook, or spend time with your family. Get writing out of your head once you’re done, and everything will be so much easier.

Read and watch.,
Write down lines--until you don’t need to.,
Practice.,
Stay cool.,
Think outside the box.,
Listen.,
Keep it short.,
Be nice.,
Don't get angry.,
Consider accepting the insult.,
Play the dozens.",How to Think of a Comeback Quickly," Many great wits have excelled by adapting lines from predecessors. Read the works of great humorists and watch stand up comedy. Listen for good quotes that you can memorize for later use.Read the works of Dorothy Parker, Ogden Nash, and Tom Stoppard. Listen carefully to the comedy of Louis C.K. and Wanda Sykes or the lyrics of Jay Z.;
, Jay Z used to carry around a notebook, writing down lines as he composed them. Eventually he was able to commit these lines to memory. He developed this practice until he no longer needed a notebook; he was able to instantly memorize all of his lines. Follow the same practice if you want to be an encyclopedic wit., To get your lines down, keep yourself cool, and learn how to execute you will need to practice. That means talking to people. The more you engage in conversation, the better you will get at it.

, Being quick and natural is essential and for that you need to be relaxed. Don’t self-monitor your comments; speak off the cuff without overthinking. To suppress feelings of anxiety try not to be too invested in what happens. The world doesn’t hinge on this conversation; pretend it doesn’t matter and just be yourself.A bit of alcohol can be good for your wit, making your conversation more natural and effortless. Too much, however, will compromise your ability to think clearly., Humor is the shock that we feel when we hear a novel interpretation of the world. To be funny you should be unpredictable and surprising.For an example of this type of comedy, review New Yorker cartoons. One of the most famous is that of a businessman on the phone with the caption, “No, Thursday’s out. How about never—is never good for you?” The joke hinges on taking a convention, a busy businessman rescheduling a meeting he doesn’t want, and then taking it in a direction no one would see coming.To make unexpected allusions or comparisons in conversation, it is important to have a broad understanding of the world. Keep up to date with current events., When you start thinking about what you need to do when you get home, the likelihood that you’ll be able to bust out a great line declines exponentially. Many types of jokes require that you get out of your own head and pay close attention to the conversation. To be interesting, you first need to be interested.


You should pay close attention so that you can listen for words that have multiple meanings. Puns are one of the easiest ways to make witty banter.
Listening is also essential for the “call back,” which is when you apply a point made earlier in the conversation to a new topic in a way that is ludicrous.If you pay attention to stand-up routines, you’ll notice that most reference earlier jokes in ways that make them progressively more absurd. One example is the constant use of ""That's what she said.""Similarly, if you have some good lines in the back of your head, you need to make sure that you are using them at the right time. Busting out an off topic quote will just be weird; missing a good chance to use a quote will be an unfortunate lost opportunity., “Brevity,” they say, “is the soul of wit.” Explaining a joke kills the humor. The point of good humor is to shock and for that you should pull off the band-Aid as quickly as possible., Too frequently we choose to be mean in ways that aren’t particularly witty or original, just because that is the closest thing we can get to humor. Depending upon the audience, that might be off-putting. Instead of making other people the butt of your joke, try directing them against society, yourself, or another person’s strengths.Self-deprecating humor tends to be inclusive and bring people in. Laughing at yourself makes people who would otherwise be intimidated by you feel comfortable.Studies have even shown that self-deprecating humor is sexually attractive.For example, Stephen King once quipped, ""I am the literary equivalent of a Big Mac and Fries.""This comparison suggests that King's writing isn't very high-quality, but it is very popular, allowing King to poke fun at himself while acknowledging his position.
Make fun of a person’s strength in a way that is ironic. When your joke implies that a bodybuilder is out of shape, it is fairly likely that no offense will be taken. It might even be interpreted as a compliment, because he understands that you mean the opposite of what you are saying. The same strategy can be used when making self-depreciating jokes to highlight your own strengths.
Make fun of society or the state of the world. Few people can take offense at these jokes. These, however, require that you do some homework. Also consider whether your audience will get the joke.

, Anger proves that the person has gotten to you. It means that you take the other person seriously and perhaps that you believe there is truth to the insult. Getting emotional will also make it harder to think clearly and respond.Insults are often a away to establish social hierarchy. Taking offense will give the other person an edge over you in inter-group dynamics., If you laugh and make a self-deprecating joke, you demonstrate that the other person's insult did not affect you. This can disarm your assailant and prove that you don't consider them a credible threat to your social status.


If the person in question is someone you respect and the comment has an element of truth to it, consider whether the ""insult"" might have been constructive criticism. If so, try to follow the advice.
This is generally preferable to returning the insult. Returning the insult means that you consider it a credible threat to your social status. It validates the insult and, unless you can execute a comeback very effectively, you will come out on bottom.It was often alleged, for example, that Ronald Reagan was too old to serve as President. Instead of going on the counterattack, he diffused the situation with self-deprecating humor: ""Thomas Jefferson once said, 'One should not worry about chronological age compared to the ability to perform the task.' . . . Ever since he told me that I stopped worrying about my age."", ""The dozens"" is a traditional African-American game in which two people trade witty retorts. Familiarize yourself with some effectively lines, so that you can return an insult quickly and naturally. Practice your delivery to get your timing down. This response is best reserved for friends who won't take offense.


To be effective the insult should sound creative. But the standard format of ""Your mom is so ____"" or ""You are so ____"" is a good go to.
Examples include: ""Your mom is so generous she would give you the hair off her back"" or ""Your mom is so old she was the waitress at the last supper."""

Do not use the F-word if you are not an adult.,
Do not use, or at least, avoid using the f-word, even as an adult, if:


The usage is in formal situations.",How to Use the F‐Word Appropriately1," Although there's no hard-lines or consensus on a certain age, the general recommendation will be:


Never use the under the age of 13/14.
Strongly avoid using the word if under the age of 18.
Using the f-word might get you in serious trouble if you choose to use it while still under 18.;
, Examples are work, meetings, briefings, workshops and/or trainings.
You are talking to someone you only have a formal relationship with.
Its usage is to describe the actual literal meaning. Many words and/or clauses exist to describe this in a more formal way.
It is used as a swearing targeted towards the person(s) you are talking to.
The usage of the word will be offensive, abusive or hurtful to the person(s) you are talking to.

"
"
Listen for overly positive or negative language.,
Listen for intense verbs, adjectives and adverbs.",How to Tell if Someone Is Being Sarcastic1," Many sarcastic remarks are completely over-the-top hyperbole, making them easy to identify. Typically a positive statement will be used when a negative response is expected, and vice versa.


An example of highly positive language would be: ""That's the most gorgeous hat I've ever seen!"" when the speaker really means, ""No, I do not like that hat.""
An example of highly negative language would be: ""Well that's one way to really blow an exam!"" as opposed to, ""Congratulations on your top grade."";
, You can expect sarcastic remarks to contain words such as ""love,"" ""great,"" ""best,"" ""most,"" or ""really."" Also listen for unnatural pairings of adjectives with nouns, like ""soft as a rock"" or ""sharp as a bowling ball."" For example: ""I just love the sweater grandma knit for me.""
Translation: ""I hate the sweater grandma knit for me.""

"
"
As a Noun: The f-word can be used as a noun.,
As an Adjective: By using the present, active, imperfect, or progressive participle ""F-ing"".,
As a Verb: It can be used as a transitive, non-transitive and passive verb.,
As an Adverb: It can be used as an adverb by adding more character to an expression.,
In clauses and terms: F-word can be used in many de facto terms such as:



F-ed up: usually meaning messed up.",How to Use the F‐Word Appropriately2," Usually, this is done by replacing a normal word with f to denote being annoyed


Example: I don't give a f!/I don't give a damn f!

, The meaning intended might be positive or negative depending on the context, body language and face expressions (if applicable).


Examples: ""What a F-ing party!""/""XYZ is doing all the F-ing work!""

, This usage can be dangerous as it usually can be understood, even by mistake, to denote the actual literal meaning. Usually, it can be used to denote messing something up. Depending on the context, it can denote betrayal, bad behavior, general messing up and/or unapproved actions.


Examples: ""XYZ F-ed the whole thing!""/ ""He F-ed his business partner by selling the secrets of the company""

, (Adjective)


Example: ""XYZ parties too F-ing much."" (Added character by stating how much)

,

F-ed sideways: denoting being in a generally bad situation.

"
"
You might use the f-word in private relaxed conversations to provide comic relief.,
You might insert the f-word within words to express excitement or ecstasy by inserting into strong expressive words to add humorous improvisation.,
Sometimes, it can be accepted to express disapproval of something by describing it with statements, that normally would mean approval.,
In some closed private circles, the use of the word as an adjective to describe strong approval might be accepted or even welcome.",How to Use the F‐Word Appropriately3," If the conversation is too serious and you want to drive it back to a more relaxed one, you can use expressions containing the f-word sparsely. For example: ""Man, that's F-ing deep!"",

Examples:

Fanf-ingtastic! (Fantastic)
Absof-inglutely! (Absolutely)
Inf-ingcredible! (Incredible)
Asf-ingtonishing! (Astonishing)



, However, when the f-word is inserted, it will denote your disapproval in an indirect way. For example: ""I f-ing love it when people accuse me of things like this."", However, this usually needs to be accompanied by facial expressions so as not to be misunderstood for the previous usage. Example: ""Are you joking? I f-ing love soup!"""
"
Watch out for facial expressions.,
Watch out for sarcastic gestures.",How to Tell if Someone Is Being Sarcastic2," Watching people's faces while they talk is a good way to pick up on sarcasm. Often a sentence that may sound completely genuine can be intended sarcastically when accompanied by a specific facial expression.


Lifted eyebrows, rolling eyes and smirking mouths are some common tell-tale signs of sarcasm.Also look out for other facial expressions which indicate disgust, irritation or apathy., Although gestures such as head nods, body leans and thumbs-up signs may not be sarcastic in themselves, when combined with other verbal and non-verbal cues they are highly likely to indicate sarcasm."
"
Listen for out of place comments.,
Watch out for personal/subjective topics.,
Sarcasm is often used when the answer to a question seems obvious to at least one participant in the conversation.",How to Tell if Someone Is Being Sarcastic3," If you hear something that seems completely contrary in the context of the conversation, you might be hearing sarcasm.


Example: If you spend most of a conversation talking about how terrible your wife's cooking is, and then end with, ""She made the best chicken casserole last night that I just had to bring some for lunch,"" listeners will probably know that you didn't care for it at all.
Example: If you hear someone say ""I'm glad I brought my suntan lotion,"" on a miserably wet day, they're almost certainly being sarcastic.

, Most sarcastic comments concern the speaker's emotions, offer judgments, or criticize something.For example, if the speaker is describing how to get to the airport, the remark is probably not going to be sarcastic, but if the speaker is talking about how he hates flying, there's a much better chance that the remark will contain sarcasm.

,


Question: What would you like me to do now?
Answer: Put your feet up and rest while we take care of all the work.
Question: Are we there yet?
Answer: Yes, it's just around the corner and another 482 miles (776 km) ahead.

"
Listen for nasal tones.,
Listen for elongated words.,
Listen for stressed adjectives.,
Listen for a ""flattening"" of the voice.",How to Tell if Someone Is Being Sarcastic4," The use of a nasal tone may indicate sarcasm.


When English speakers express sarcasm with the word ""Thanks!"", they often use a nasal tone.
Some researchers say that this nasal tone shows a connection between sarcasm and extreme disgust., Sometimes words are drawn out for effect when the speaker is trying to convey sarcasm.Example: ""Well, excuuuuuse me!""
Example: ""You're sooooo welcome.""

, A speaker will often place stress on certain adjectives in order to convey sarcasm.


For example, if you hear someone say ""Aunt Prunella sent me this gorgeous pink and green paisley tie,"" the stress on the word 'gorgeous' would usually indicate sarcasm.
The stressed word may also be communicated at a lower pitch than the other words in the sentence for added emphasis.

, This is when speakers create a unique sarcastic effect by totally eliminating all vocal expression.Such flattening is usually complimented by a monotone pitch and a generally bland delivery.
This is particularly effective with words that normally express excitement, such as ""Wow."" or ""Yay.""

"
"
Use either/or pronouns.,
Alternate pronouns.,
Change the sentence.,
Use ""they"" as the singular pronoun.,
Write in second person.,
Avoid falling into gender stereotypes.,
Use gender-inclusive titles.,
Skip gendered phrases or group terms.,
Don't assume a person's gender.",How to Use Gender Inclusive Language1," One option to make your writing more inclusive is to write ""he or she"" or ""she or he"" in place of just using ""he."" That way, you're including at least two genders in each instance. The downside to this approach is that it can make your sentences more cumbersome.You can also use a backslash to divide the two pronouns, such as he/she, her/him, or s/he.Additionally, another downside to this approach is it also reinforces the idea that only two genders exist.;
, Another option is to switch back and forth between pronouns when giving examples. If you're writing a paper and giving examples throughout, use ""he/him"" in some examples and ""she/her"" in other examples. That way, you're not only using ""he"" or ""him.""This approach is more gender-inclusive than only using masculine pronouns or only using feminine pronouns.

, Another option to be inclusive is to simply rewrite sentences to be more inclusive. In other words, take out the pronoun if at all possible. For example, you be tempted to write, ""If child is hungry, he should eat."" Instead, change it to ""A child who is hungry should eat.""Changing the noun to a plural one can also make it easier to avoid gender pronouns, as you can use the non-gendered plural pronoun ""they"": ""If children are hungry, they should eat.""

, While not acceptable in all circles, using ""they"" as a singular pronoun is becoming more widespread. If you'd like to try this tactic, simply replace ""he"" or ""she"" with ""they"" in any sentence that calls for a singular pronoun.For example, if you wanted to write, ""A teacher should always be kind to his students,"" you can write ""A teacher should always be kind to their students.""

, Another option is to switch to second person. Second person is when you address the reader directly with ""you."" While this approach won't work for every type of writing, it can work in some instances, particularly if you're writing an informal blog post or giving directions.For instance, if you’re addressing teachers and you want to tell them to be kind, instead of saying ""A teacher should always be kind to their students,"" you could say, ""As a teacher, you should always be kind to your students."" Because ""you"" isn't gendered, it eliminates the problem.

, Often, examples used in writing fall into gender stereotypes, such as calling all firefighters men or using a woman as an example of someone who can be overly emotional. It's best to turn those stereotypes on their head if possible or to not include gender at all.For example, if you're writing something like ""The firefighter rushed into the fire, as he was worried about the survivors,"" you might write one of the following instead: ""The firefighter rushed into the fire, as they were worried about the survivors,"" or ""The firefighter rushed into the fire to rescue the remaining survivors.""

, Many titles in the world are gendered, such as ""fireman,"" ""anchormen,"" ""mailman,"" or ""businessman."" When using these terms, especially in a general sense, stick to more neutral terms to be more inclusive.For example, use ""firefighter,"" ""anchor,"" ""mail carrier,"" or ""business person"" in place of the more gendered words.

, Many phrases use ""he"" or ""him"" as a part of the phrase, such as ""the best man for the job"" or ""man the booth."" In addition, many words that people tend to use for a group of people or the world as a whole also tend to be gendered, such as ""mankind."" Try to substitute non-gendered words and phrases for these more gendered ones.For instance, use ""the best person for the job"" or ""staff the booth."" Instead of mankind, try ""humanity"" or ""humankind.""
In addition, always refer to an adult woman as ""woman"" or by her title, not as ""girl"" or ""lady."", In some cases, such as when talking about an anonymous writer or an internet persona with a handle, you may not know the gender of the person. In that case, you should either use a phrase to refer to the person (such as ""the anonymous writer"") or repeat the handle. Of course, it's always preferable to find the gender of the person if possible."
"
Develop a basic understanding of independent clauses to better understand relative clauses.,
Consider dependent clauses when trying to understand relative clauses.,
Know that relative clauses are a type of dependent clause.,
Understand why relative clauses are important.",How to Use Relative Clauses in the English Language1," A relative clause is a particular kind of clause. By definition, a clause must have a subject and a verb (if it doesn’t, it’s called a phrase). For instance, a simple sentence is made of an independent clause. meaning a clause that can stand by itself.


The sentence “Kaylee eats ice cream” is an independent clause. It has a subject, “Kaylee,” and a verb, “eat.” As you can see, an independent clause can stand by itself.
A subject is just the noun (person, place, thing, or idea) or pronoun (replaces a noun) that is doing the action in the sentence. The verb is the action of the sentence.;
, A dependent clause, on the other hand, needs to be a part of a larger sentence in order to be complete. This is why it is called ""dependent"" — it is dependent on the other part of the sentence in order to make sense.


For instance, “because I like strawberries” is a dependent clause. It doesn't make sense by itself, even though it still has a subject (“I”) and a verb (“like”).

, A relative clause is a type of dependent clause; it needs the rest of the sentence to exist. A relative clause is introduced by either:


A relative pronoun (that, who, whom, whose, and which). This will be covered in Method 2 of this article.
A relative adjective (when, where, or why). In a sentence, it functions as an adjective, meaning it describes a noun or a pronoun. This will be covered in Method 3 of this article.

, Relative clauses are important because they allow you to add extra information to a sentence, making it more interesting or relevant to the reader.


Remember that every clause needs a subject and a verb (though sometimes the relative pronoun acts as the subject).
Also, remember to separate the relative clause from the rest of the sentence using commas if the information is not necessary.

Know what ""ergo"" means.,
Understand that ""ergo"" is a conjunctive adverb.,
Note that “ergo” is considered an archaic term.While you can use ""ergo"" and may hear or read it on occasion, the term is generally considered an archaic one, meaning that is ""dated"" and no longer a common term in modern English.,
Use ""ergo"" with a semicolon.Usually, you will see “ergo” preceded by a semicolon and followed by a comma.,
Begin a sentence with ""ergo.,
Be careful with commas.,
Follow all applicable standard grammar rules.The sentence or sentences themselves must make sense concerning all other grammatical aspects.,
Apply the term to both serious and lighthearted matters.",How to Use Ergo," The term ""ergo"" can be defined to mean ""as a result"" or ""for that reason.""Similar words include ""therefore,"" ""hence,"" ""consequently,"" ""so,"" ""thus,"" and ""accordingly.""
You can use ""ergo"" when describing the relationship between a cause and an effect.

Example: I love reading; ergo, I have a large library at home.;
, It can also be described as an adverbial conjunction. The two parts of speech are interchangeable and essentially describe words that share properties of both adverbs and conjunctions.


An adverb is a term that modifies a verb or an adjective.
A conjunction word that is used to connect two sentences, clauses, or ideas.
A conjunctive adverb is a word that modifies the verb of an independent clause in a way that demonstrates a connection to another independent clause.

Example: I love reading; ergo, I have a large library at home.

In this sentence, ""ergo"" modifies the verb ""have"" in the independent clause, “I have a large library at home.” It also connects the clause beginning with ""I have"" to the independent clause, ""I love reading,"" and indicates that the latter is a result of the former.



,


This does not mean that you cannot use the term ""ergo."" It does, however, mean that you should be cautious about using it. Using it too often can seem forced, pretentious, or unnatural. Since there are other terms that can be used in the same way, like ""therefore,"" you may want to ask yourself if ""ergo"" is the best choice before you use it.
In spite of the fact that it is an archaic term, ""ergo"" is still used more often than many archaic terms, which does grant it some form of modern relevancy.

Example: Instead of saying, “I love reading; ergo, I have a large library at home,” consider saying, “I love reading; therefore, I have a large library at home.”

, This is one correct way to use the word and tends to look the most natural.


Typically, you use the term to indicate how the information of one clause results from the information in the clause before it. Since the two clauses are independent, you need to bridge them together with some form of punctuation.
As two independent clauses, they need to be separated with a semicolon rather than a comma.

Example: She had five cats at home; ergo, anyone allergic to cats never enjoyed staying at her house.

,""If done correctly, you can also begin a sentence with “ergo.” The term should still be followed by comma, as it is when used with a semicolon.


Essentially, “ergo” is used in the same way at the beginning of a sentence as it is when used after a semicolon. You're simply splitting the two independent clauses into two separate sentences.

Example: She had five cats at home. Ergo, anyone allergic to cats never enjoyed staying at her house.

, The most common mistake people make when using “ergo” is the dreaded comma splice. This occurs when you replace what should be a semicolon with a simple comma.


Standard coordinating conjunctions can join sentences and clauses, but conjunctive adjectives cannot do so. As a result, punctuating ""ergo"" the same way you would punctuate a standard conjunction—""and,"" ""or,"" ""but""—cannot be done.


Incorrect example: Jim got caught in traffic on his way to work, ergo, he missed this morning's meeting.

Correct example: Jim got caught in traffic on his way to work; ergo, he missed this morning's meeting.

Correct example: Jim got caught in traffic on his way to work and missed this morning's meeting.


You can surround ""ergo"" with commas if you are using the term to further clarify the meaning of a sentence. If you remove ""ergo"" from the sentence, it must be able to stand on its own.


Example: Carol enjoyed the outdoors. She decided, ergo, to spend her vacation camping.



, You must also make sure that you use “ergo” in a way that matches its definition.


Always use “ergo” to express results or effect. You cannot use it to contrast, emphasize, illustrate, or describe the sequence of time because its meaning simply does not agree with those purposes.


Incorrect example: The two friends used to be inseparable; ergo, one moved away in the fifth grade, and the two lost contact after that.

Correct example: The two friends used to be inseparable; however, one moved away in the fifth grade, and the two lost contact after that.


As with all sentences, your subjects and verbs must agree with each other, all pronouns must clearly describe a previously mentioned noun, and the overall sentence must be parallel. Any rule you have learned concerning sentence syntax and grammar must still be followed here.

, Due to the fact that “ergo” is an archaic term, you will often see it applied ironically or in a tongue-in-cheek tone. You can still use it seriously, of course, but it stands out most in modern applications when used in a lighthearted way.



Example A: My neighbor Sally and the Queen of England are never in the same place at the same time; ergo, Sally must secretly be the Queen of England.

In this example, ""ergo"" is used to mockingly imply some degree of academic or serious thought even though the claim made is clearly preposterous. Using a ""prim and proper"" archaic term is a way of highlighting the sarcasm of the statement.



Example B: Robert had a stressful day at work; ergo, he went straight to sleep as soon as he got home.

In this example, ""ergo"" is used seriously. The grammar is correct, but one might expect to see something more common in its place, like ""therefore,"" ""as a result,"" or ""as such.""

Recognize that a syllable involves a single vowel sound.,
Divide doubled consonants in the middle to make syllables.,
Divide words with single consonants sandwiched between vowels before the consonant.,
Divide the word after the middle consonant only if dividing before the consonant doesn't sound right.,
Memorize important English bound morphemes (or units of meaning).,
Memorize the special rule about -le words.,
Divide compound words in-between the two base words.,
Be wary of dictionaries.",How to Teach and Learn Syllabication1," A syllable is a unit of pronunciation that includes a single vowel sound and that may or may not include the sounds of surrounding consonants.For example, the word Bahamas has three syllables, each with its own vowel sound: ""ba,"" ""ha,"" and ""mas."" On the other hand, the word flat only has one vowel sound and therefore only one syllable.
Remember to ignore silent vowels in this rule, such as the final -e in late. Even though the word late has two vowels, it only has one vowel sound and therefore one syllable.
Keep in mind that two vowels next to one another can sometimes be two separate vowel sounds, as in chaos (with its two syllables ""cha-"" and ""-os""). But sometimes two vowels next to one another can make a single vowel sound, as in leaf, which only has one syllable. Time and experience will allow you to determine whether a double vowel makes two vowel sounds or a single vowel sound.There are no syllables that do not involve a vowel sound in English.;
, When you see two consonants in a row that are surrounded by vowels, divide the doubled consonants in half to create proper syllabication. For example, sil-ly, let-ter, mar-ble, plas-ma, and Eas-ter are all the proper way to divide these words into their component parts.The only exceptions to this rule are consonant digraphs, which are single sounds represented by two consonants. Common consonant digraphs include the ph, sh, th, wh, wr, ck, ng, and ch sounds.These should be treated like a single consonant and should not be divided. For example, rather should be divided into rath-er, not rat-her.

, This does not work for all words, but it will work more than half of the time. You should therefore use this method first.For example, if you come across words such as ti-ger, sa-bre, or fi-ber, the syllable division comes before the middle consonant. That initial sound will be a longer vowel sound instead of a shorter vowel sound.Sound out the word to see if this syllable division makes sense.

, This method works for about 45% of words, so you will use it less often than dividing words before the middle consonant.Use this method only when dividing the word before the consonant does not make a recognizable word.


For example, when you come across the word ""habit,"" you should first try dividing before the consonant: ha-bit. However, there is no word that sounds like ""hay-bit"" in English. You should therefore move on to the second method, which will give you hab-it, a common English word.
These words will often begin with a shorter vowel sound instead of a longer vowel sound. Other words in this category include cabin (cab-in), panic (pan-ic), and second (sec-ond).
Sometimes, there are differences between American and British English in where you divide the word. For example, Americans would usually divide the word ""privacy"" as ""pri-va-cy"" (with a long i sound). However, most British speakers would usually divide the word as ""priv-a-cy"" (with a short i sound).

, A bound morpheme is a part of a word that is unable to stand alone as a word but that has a self-contained meaning. For example, the English prefix non- implies a negation. The English syllable -er implies a comparison. These morphemes usually stand alone as their own syllables during syllabication.If you memorize common English bound morphemes, you will be better equipped to divide words properly.


Common bound morphemes include: un-, non-, pre-, post-, -ing, -ed, -er, -est, and -less.

, Words that end in a consonant plus the letters -le have special rules governing syllabication. Divide these words just before the consonant-l-e pattern.For example, bubble can be divided bub-ble; maple can be divided ma-ple; and purple can be divided pur-ple.


The exception to this rule is when the -le is preceded by the ck digraph. These words are divided before the -le. For example, pickle should be divided into pick-le; buckle should be divided into buck-le; etc.

, Compound words are words that are built of two separate, individual words that each carry meaning. For example, driveway, wallpaper, and lampshade are all compound words. Be sure that you divide compound words in between their base components: drive-way; wall-paper; and lamp-shade. If a base word in a compound word is composed of multiple syllables, follow the typical rules of syllabication: wall-pa-per.

, Dictionaries usually hyphenate words according to how they should be hyphenated across lines of text. This is distinct from how words should be divided into spoken syllables. Do not rely solely on dictionaries for syllabication support."
"
Ask people for their preferred pronouns.,
Skip dividing by gender.,
Don't make assumptions about a person's biology.",How to Use Gender Inclusive Language2," If you're not sure what pronoun a person would prefer, it's fine to ask. Most people appreciate being asked because it shows you care enough to find out their personal preferences. Just be polite when you do it.For example, you could say, ""I hope you don't mind me asking, but do you have a preferred pronoun you'd like me to use?""
Once they tell you what they prefer, be sure to use it.

, When you're in a classroom or giving a speech, it's not necessary to address the group with gendered words. For example, you may be tempted to say ""boys and girls"" or ""ladies and gentlemen."" Instead, pick a plural noun that works for everyone, such as ""students,"" ""peers,"" ""colleagues,"" or ""folks.""In addition, try not to break into groups based on gender. Use other tactics, such as dividing by location in the room or numbering off.

, Not every woman you see has a period. Not every man you see is incapable of getting pregnant. This is dependent on how strongly a man identifies with being a woman or a woman being a man. In addition, many transgender people, who are living as the opposite sex, still experience the biological functions of the sex they were born with.For example, any discussion of abortion rights should not just be limited to women, as many transgender men are affected by the legislation, as well.

Ask for the person's gender.,
Separate sex from gender.,
Skip gender and sex altogether.,
Leave a place for their preferred pronoun.,
Ask for a preferred name.",How to Use Gender Inclusive Language3," Instead of creating check boxes for a person's gender, leave a blank space for their gender so that they can fill in the blank. That way, they aren't limited by a binary system. Many people identify somewhere in between genders, as a completely different gender, or as no gender at all, and leaving the option open is much more inclusive., If you're a medical office, you'll likely need a person's sex rather than gender. Gender is how a person identifies in society, while sex refers to biological sex. Having a question about sex is acceptable, but you should make sure to be inclusive.You could include options such as ""male,"" ""female,"" ""intersex,"" ""MtF female,"" and ""FtM male.""

, Think about the application or form you're creating. Is it necessary to know the gender of the person? Unless you're a medical office or something similar, it's often not necessary, so consider skipping the questions altogether.If you're asking to know what pronoun to use, just move on to asking what pronoun they prefer.

, It's appropriate to ask the person what pronoun they prefer. If they're filling out a form for you, having a space to ask for a preferred pronoun will help put them more at ease. Just make sure you and other people on the staff make use of that pronoun., In addition, ask the person if they have a name that they prefer that's different from their license. If someone is transitioning to another gender or simply living as another gender, they may or may not have been able to change their license to a new name. However, it's respectful to ask what name they prefer to be used. In addition, this practice allows you to learn everyone's preferred name, even those who just use a nickname because they like it."

Create a subject for a sentence.,
Choose a verb for your simple sentence.,
Determine which part of the simple sentence your relative clause will describe.,
Try using your relative clause to describe a different part of the simple sentence.,
Consider using “whose” to try out a different relative pronoun.,
Understand that “whom” acts a bit differently than other relative pronouns.",How to Use Relative Clauses in the English Language2," When writing a relative clause using a relative pronoun, the relative pronoun sometimes acts as the subject of the clause. Begin by writing a simple sentence. Choose a subject for the sentence.


Let’s say your subject is “George.”

, Now choose a verb and a direct object (which could be a noun or pronoun) in order to complete the sentence.


To find the verb, ask yourself what George is doing. Let’s say he is grilling: “George grills.”
To find the direct object, ask yourself what George is grilling. Let's say he is grilling meat “George grills meat.”

, Now, because a relative clause modifies (i.e. describes) a noun, you have two choices in this sentence for using a relative clause - ""George"" and ""meat"".


Let’s modify “George.” What could you say about George that is relevant to the sentence? What if George is a vegetarian? That would be relevant information for the reader to have.
Add the relative clause after George because you are describing him, for example: “George, who is actually a vegetarian, grills meat.”
This clause describes George—it is giving the reader extra information about him. Therefore, it is functioning as an adjective, as adjectives describe nouns. It is set off by commas because the information isn't essential to the sentence.

, However, the sentence given above is not your only option for adding a relative clause to the sentence. “Meat” can also be modified. However, because “meat” is a thing, you’ll use “that” or “which” instead of who.


For example: “George, who is actually a vegetarian, grills meat that will be eaten by his friends.” In this case, you do not use a comma after the word ""Meat"" because the clause changes the meaning of the sentence, so the information is considered essential.
If the sentence was “George, who is actually a vegetarian, grills meat, which isn’t vegetarian,” a comma is used before the word “which”. This is due to the fact that the information given in the relative clause is obvious and doesn't change the meaning of the sentence.

, If you want to use a different relative pronoun, try “whose.” “Whose” is actually a possessive pronoun; it shows possession. Let’s look at the basic sentence again, “George grills meat.” Think of it the same way you would use “his” or hers”; those words show possession, as well. Consider this addition:


“George, whose favorite pastime is cooking, grills meat.” This sentence could be divided up this way: “George grills meat; his favorite pastime is cooking.” However, when you add it as a relative clause, you use “whose” instead of “his.”
In this case, “whose” is actually acting as an adjective describing the subject of the clause, “favorite pastime.” It’s possessive because it’s George’s pastime; it “belongs” to him in a sense.

, “Whom” acts a bit differently than other relative pronouns. It is an object instead of a subject. Consider this sentence: “George, whom everyone loves, grills meat.” Without the relative clause, the same information could be expressed like this: “George grills meat. Everyone loves him.”


In the first sentence, look at the dependent clause, and rearrange it this way in your head: “Everyone loves whom.” While it sounds a bit silly, it makes sense if you replace “whom” with “George” (as that is what a pronoun does—it stands in for a noun, like “George”).
“Everyone” is the subject, doing the action; “whom” is the object. Because “whom” is the object in the clause—who the action is being done to—you use “whom” instead of “who.”

"
"
Try modifying the subject of your sentence with an adverb.,
Try other adverbs to describe a part of your sentence.,
Understand that “why” acts a little different when it comes to relative adverbs.",How to Use Relative Clauses in the English Language3," When writing a relative clause with a relative adverb, you’ll need a subject and a verb, as the relative adjective does not act as the subject of the clause.


Let’s begin with the same simple sentence: “George grills meat.” Once again, you have two nouns you can modify, “George” or “meat.” Let’s try describing “George.”
For instance, you could describe George by including information on when he grills meat: “George, when he feels hungry, grills meat.” The clause “when he feels hungry” is modifying George. In this clause, “he” is the subject, while “feels” is the verb.

, You can also modify the word “meat.”


As yourself when or where is the meat grilled? Let’s use “where”.For example: “George, when he feels hungry, grills meat where it can get smoky flavor.”
In this clause, “it” is the subject and “can get” is the verb. “Where it can get smoky flavor” is describing “meat,” as it tells where it is located.

, “Why” usually works a little differently from other relative adverbs. “Why” often ends up in the second half of the sentence, even though it describes the subject.


For instance, you could write, “George knows the reason why the meat is smoky.” In this sentence, “why the meat is smoky” is modifying “the reason.”
In fact, you will often use “why” clauses to modify “the reason,” even if it is only implied. The sentence above could read: “George knows why the meat is smoky.”

Have your student touch his chin while speaking.,
Use drumming and clapping to emphasize syllabication rules.,
Have your students memorize only the most useful syllabication rules.,
Give students the Syllable Sort exercise.,
Ask students to divide proper names into syllables.,
Make a syllabication game using index cards.,
Reinforce syllabication knowledge using quizzes and tests.",How to Teach and Learn Syllabication2," Before a student can learn syllabication, she will have to understand how vowel sounds work. She will also have to learn the fact that some vowel sounds are spelled using two vowel letters, such as the ""ou"" vowel sound in the word round.Before moving on to syllable division, ask your student to accomplish the following tasks:


Know the difference between a short vowel sound and a long vowel sound.
Be able to determine a vowel sound for one-syllable words based on the consonants around it.
Recognize common English word patterns. For example, they should learn that many consonant-vowel-consonant words involve a short vowel sound, as in rat or tot, whereas many consonant-vowel-consonant-e words involve a long vowel sound, as in rate or tote.

Memorize common vowel sounds that are spelled with two vowel letters, such as ""ou,"" ""oi,"" ""ie,"" ""ea,"" and ""ei.""

, Many of the rules of syllabication are approximations. There are no exact rules that can be applied 100% of the time. Much of correct syllabication has to do with instinct and experience. This is why it is essential that you are helping to build your students' vocabularies and reading skills at the same time that you teach syllabication.For example, continue to ask students to read increasingly difficult texts to expose them to new words, longer words, and new sounds.
Assign vocabulary lists to memorize. Make sure you tell students how to pronounce these words as well.
Encourage your students to listen carefully to other speakers to hear how words are pronounced and divided into syllables.

, Whether you are teaching young children, new learners of the language, or native speakers, you should introduce the concept of counting syllables as early as possible. Read off several words of varying lengths, and ask your students to identify the number of syllables they hear. They should be comfortable with counting syllables well before they begin syllabication themselves., Ask young students or people who are having trouble understanding syllables to hold his own chin while saying words. In general, the chin will drop each time there is a new syllable. This physical activity will help make the idea of syllables more concrete., This is especially useful for younger children. Ask your student to clap along with words of varying lengths: one, two, three, and four-syllable words. While clapping might not help your student understand where exactly a word will be divided, this exercise will help your student begin to understand how syllables work, and how many syllables are found in common words., Practice and application are the most useful ways to teach syllabication. Having students memorize dozens of minor rules will not help them get the experience they need to understand syllabication.Only have them memorize the most useful rules of syllabication:


1) Compound words should be divided in-between the two base words.
2) Bound morphemes often comprise their own separate syllable.
3) If two consonants appear in the middle of a word, divide them in half.
4) But never divide consonant digraphs, vowel digraphs, or diphthongs in have.
5) When one consonant is sandwiched by two vowels, first try to divide the word before the consonant. If that doesn't work, then try to divide the word after the consonant.

, The Syllable Sort exercise asks students to make lists of words that adhere to various rules of syllabication. At the top of a piece of paper, list four major categories of syllabication: 1) Divide a compound word; 2) Divide a word in between two consonants; 3) Divide a word in between a vowel and a consonant; 4) Divide a word in between a consonant and a vowel. Ask students to brainstorm words that might fit each of these categories, and have them divide the word according to the relevant rule., Many students already know how to pronounce the names of their classmates and friends. Use this knowledge as a tool to emphasize syllabication lessons. Have your students divide up each other's names into correct syllables to reinforce your syllabication lessons., Write 50 common English syllables on separate index cards. Make sure that these syllables can be combined in various ways to create real English words. Then ask your student to combine these syllables in various ways to create real words and nonsense words. Ask your student where each word should be divided.

, Give your student a list of words that are two-, three-, and four-syllables long. Ask your student to divide each word according to the rules of syllabication. If you notice that your student does not understand a particular pattern, review the rules once more and re-test.

Dig deeper to the root of the problem if you continue to struggle.",How to Stop Being Sarcastic," If you want to stop being sarcastic, the first thing you need to do is determine how and when you use it. If you’re a very sarcastic person, this could be a difficult task. You might not notice every time you use sarcasm, or it may slip out before you can catch yourself.


Pay attention to every word that comes out of your mouth, and jot down a note every time you say something sarcastic.
Who did you say it to? Why? Were you feeling angry, annoyed, frustrated, jealous, or insecure? Try to figure out what caused you to say something sarcastic.;
, These are any situations that elicit sarcasm from you, and you can identify them by looking at your list of sarcastic comments. What did the incidents have in common? Maybe you notice that you use sarcasm every time you are embarrassed. Perhaps you resort to sarcasm when you feel angry or defensive. By figuring out what causes you to use sarcasm, you can be on guard when you're in those situations again.


Some trigger situations may seem vastly different, but have the same root cause. For example, you may use sarcasm toward your girlfriend when she points out something you're doing wrong, as well as in a meeting when you're getting constructive criticism. Both times this sarcasm stems from embarrassment and/or defensiveness.
Trigger situations can be just as easily thought of as ""trigger emotions.""

, This might sound strange, but it can help you closely analyze what you say and identify your sarcastic comments. Pretend that a court reporter is in the room with you, transcribing every word you say. Sarcasm cannot be translated to paper. If you roll your eyes and change the inflection of your voice while sarcastically saying, “Great job!” to someone, that will look like a genuine compliment on paper. If someone reads that conversation later, will it be an accurate reflection of your thoughts and feelings? Did you mean everything you said?


Remember the quote, “Say what you mean and mean what you say.” If you don’t mean what you are saying, and wouldn’t want your name attributed to it on paper, just don’t say it!

, On a scale of one to ten, how sarcastic are you? If you know that you’re a nine or a ten, you will have to work really hard to break that habit. If you only say the occasional sarcastic comment, you will rank yourself lower and it won’t be a total language overhaul. Once you’ve worked on changing your speech, you can rate yourself again.If you use sarcasm multiple times a day, you're on the higher end of the spectrum. If you only find yourself using it a couple times a week, you're on the lower end of the spectrum.
By being honest with yourself about where you stand, you can better measure your progress.

, Sometimes others will notice sarcasm from you when you don’t. By telling everyone, they can remind you if you start reverting back to old ways. Make sure that you tell people you see regularly, like a friend, co-worker, or significant other. Tell them to interject whenever they catch you speaking sarcastically.Don't offended when people call you out for sarcasm. You need some tough love if you want to make a real change!
By including others in your goal, you open yourself up to advice and encouragement. Having support from people around you can be extremely helpful when you're making a change.

, Create a sarcasm jar, like a swear jar, and put a dollar in it every time you say something sarcastic. By forking over cash every time you let a sarcastic comment slip, you’ll choose your words more carefully— or put a strain on your bank account! When you’ve accumulated a fair amount of money in the jar, use it for something productive, like a bill.Don't use the money for a treat. That money a penalty payment, so it cannot be used for something fun.
Place the jar somewhere you can see it, so that your goal is always on your mind. It will serve as a physical reminder to watch your words and avoid using sarcasm.

, Maybe you saw a friend being sarcastic and you realized how unflattering it is. Perhaps you hurt someone’s feelings unintentionally, and want to work on speaking more kindly. Whatever your reasoning, make sure you remind yourself of it regularly. You can become the person you want to become, you just have to stay focused on your goal.Try writing these reminders down and posting them somewhere that you'll see everyday.

, This can be something like randomly telling a friend something you really admire about them, or telling a stranger on the bus that you like their shoes or their bag. Maybe you just want to tweet something every day that makes you genuinely happy. It doesn't matter what you do, just make sure it is earnest, kind, and uplifting. Not only will you get into the habit of speaking truthfully, but you will also start creating a new image of yourself to the people around you.


Even if you are having a horrible day and don't particularly want to challenge yourself, just do it. You will feel better afterwards, because kindness is contagious.

, Say you noticed yourself being sarcastic every time you hung out with a particular group of people that made you feel insecure. Rather than speaking sarcastically, try speaking genuinely. You can offer them sincere compliments, while remarking on your own great characteristics. If you notice that you speak sarcastically whenever you’re angry with co-workers, try addressing your frustrations instead of using sarcasm to ridicule or vent.


Treat words as if they are valuable currency. By using your language to convey truthful, straightforward, sincere thoughts, you are getting the most bang for your “buck.”

, This should be someone who speaks earnestly, without any sarcasm. It doesn’t matter whether you speak with them directly or just admire from afar. How can you emulate them? How does their sincerity make you feel? Sarcasm can hurt and mock others, reveal a lack of confidence, and put others on the defensive.Identify someone who makes people laugh without using sarcasm or hurting others. It is empowering and motivating to see someone who can make real, earnest jokes without putting anyone down.

, Bad habits can sneak back into our lives easily if we aren’t vigilant, especially when we are feeling frustrated. Remember why you wanted to remove sarcasm from your language in the first place, and constantly check yourself. If you observe and evaluate yourself with honesty and you notice that you’re saying insincere, sarcastic things, try to figure out why.Address any issues that are causing you distress or making you feel uncomfortable. Attempt to fix the problems that are causing you to revert to your sarcastic language.
Remind yourself that kindness and sincerity will get you farther than sarcasm and mockery ever will.

, If you are constantly blurting out cynical, sarcastic remarks and you just can't seem to hold back, the issue may be deeper than simply breaking a habit. Don't be ashamed to spend time ""getting in touch with your emotions,"" or even asking for help. Often times, sarcasm can be used as a defense mechanism or an emotional crutch, so solving the core problem can help change your speech.If you realize you use sarcasm as a means to feel better about yourself, try to find other ways to raise your self-esteem and feel empowered, without sacrificing the feelings of others.Spend time doing a hobby you love, exercise, and surround yourself with people who make you feel confident.
If you believe you are struggling with anger issues or depression, don't be afraid to ask for help from a psychologist or psychiatrist.

Why are you forming a club?
What are your long-term goals?
Will you offer services or resources to members?;
, If you would like the meetings to be held at your school, talk about it with your other club members first. Will you be meeting just once a month or twice a week? It's important to have these details ironed out so that your members don't get confused. Make sure everyone can get to the meetings easily. If they can't come to every meeting, it's okay!

, Most members should be among your friends, but a few people you don't know well should be allowed to join so that it will become more popular. But keep in mind that having too many members can result in a lot of anger or frustration.

, It's best to have snacks and some kind of games to make a good impression. Call or email members to remind them of the first meeting, as it's best for everyone to attend.

, 'Rules of Procedure' define two things: 1) Communication Procedures within the club, such as: how long a member gets to speak to the club; who gets to speak first (if two members persist to speak at the same time; and 2) how the club will Make Decisions, such as what kinds of votes will be necessary in what kinds of circumstances. Members of a club can go about to make up all the rules of their club; which can be a tedious job. In the United States, a book titled 'Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised' is used as 'rules of procedures' by over 85% of clubs. This book sets forth 'rules of procedure' for every known situation because of it's long history of research and daily website updates (www.robertsrules.com). It is very trustworthy. A shorter version of the original book is 'Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised IN BRIEF'. It is satisfactory for most clubs that have under 300 members., Club members should vote on who the officers will be. This can happen at the first meeting or at a later meeting. Typical officer roles include:

Treasurer. This person handles the club's money, and keeps track of dues for memberships, pays the bills for the club's operations and activities. He/She also keep records of all debits and credits for accounting purposes.
Secretary. The secretary keeps minutes of every meeting and reads them for correction or addition at each following meeting. He/She can assist with the activities of the club, such as events that are hosted, and give a report of the event at meetings following these events.
Historian. This person keeps a record of activities that the club hosts, etc.
Head of Events. This person delegates club members to help in planning and organizing activities.
Advertising team. They should be responsible for creating flyers, etc.

, This should also be decided by the club and voted on.

, Make a template with your name, the club's name, the member's rank (if they have one), contact info for the club, club location, and the time since they became a member.

, This step is optional, but it can help to keep everyone in the club on the right track. Make it inspirational.

, Have a good constitution to help clarify what you want to do and how. Help your officers know what they should do and how to behave. There are books to guide you in these things - get one.

Find old-fashioned swear words.,
Use the bard to curse.,
Try cuss words from other languages.,
Pick substitutes.,
Try an acronym.,
Say it right when you slip up.",How to Swear Creatively1," Old fashioned swear words certainly don't hold the same power today that they once did. Therefore, you can get away with using them in polite company. As a bonus, old-fashioned words may make people in the room giggle, diffusing the tension.For instance, ""Jumpin' Jehoshaphat,"" ""dagnabit,"" and ""Jiminy Cricket"" are old-fashioned swear words that you could use to replace cuss words in polite company.;
, Shakespeare was a master at cursing people, and you can use that to your advantage. As a bonus, you'll confuse your adversary in the process.For instance, you could try ""Thou art a hideous, eye-offending, hedge-pig!""Other options could include ""Thou art as loathsome as a toad,"" ""I do desire we may be better strangers,"" or ""Away, you three-inch fool."", If you really don't want to give up cuss words, try looking up bad words in other languages. You may be able to get away with these words with your polite-tongued grandparents, but beware, as many people do speak other languages and may call you out.If you're worried about offending someone who speaks the language, try picking a word close to the cuss word but that's not actually a cuss word, such as ""Miercoles,"" which means ""Wednesday"" in Spanish but sounds close to a curse word., Come up with your own creative substitutes for your favorite curse words. The word should be catchy and not too close to the original, since you are trying to go your own way with your curse words.For instance, you could try something silly such as ""fartknocker,"" which gently invokes the same types of taboos as curse words without offending most people., An acronym is a word or group of letters taken from the first letter of each word in a phrase. Therefore, you can use an acronym to build a curse word that no one realizes is a curse word.For instance, you could use a ""Yafs!"" as a cuss word that represents ""You are fracking stupid.""

, If you're trying to cut cussing from your vocabulary, you probably will slip up from time to time. Instead of getting mad at yourself, repeat the word you'd rather use to yourself, so that it becomes embedded in your memory."

Choose a cause.,
Name your club.,
Start researching.,
Find a clubhouse.,
Have meetings.,
Decide on jobs.,
Have activities.,
Do projects.,
Make a website.",How to Start an Environmental Club," Some good ideas might be something like, ""Save the whales!"" or ""Stop global warming!"" the cause should also relate to where you are. For example, 'save the whales' might not be such a good idea if you live 10 hours to the nearest whale location, whereas 'keep our state clean' would work anywhere. But nothing says you can't do more than one cause. Your club could do a different cause every month. For example, you could do saving polar bears in November, pandas in December, and global warming in January.;
, This can be as simple as 'The Environmental Club' or as cool as 'Team Environment'. Some words you could use are green, tree-hugger, and, of course, something that relates to your cause. Then you can start accepting members.

, Now that you have your club, you need to assign days you will get together to study your cause. After the club members are experts on the cause, research places where you can help or protest, depending on your cause.

, Your club must have a place where it gets together to have meetings and discuss your projects. It could be in the woods (just don't litter), in someone's room, living room, tree house, or your yard, there are endless possibilities.

, Find a time that suits most of your club members (if not all) and talk about possible projects. They could be fund-raisers, cleanups, spreading awareness, it should relate to what you have been researching.

, Each club member should have a certain job they need to do. Some you could include are a recruiter, site administrator, activity manager, Project manager, the President who decides all the meeting times, new members, meeting places, activities, and projects. (The president only decides on them, does not think them up.)

, Your club should have some fun activities to do occasionally to remind them what they are fighting for. These could be hikes in the forest, watching environmental movies (such as ""An Inconvenient Truth, or even ""WALL-E""), or anything else you can think of that would apply to the environment (don't use this as an excuse to spend your meetings watching movies and eating popcorn), only do these once a month or twice a month or the group may become too passive.

, At your meetings, decide on a few projects, and do them. When you're done with the few projects you have chosen, decide on a few more. And after that, a few more. In addition, after that, you can always redo projects if you think they were not successful. The projects could be anything from fund-raisers to park cleanups and even to handing out brochures on a cause (be sure to print them on recycled paper, or don't print it at all because recycling still pollutes).

, If you don't have enough money, you can always make it from a web-hosting service, such as WordPress or Posterous, Current/Upcoming Projects (the projects you are working on and what you will do soon), and Home. On your homepage, write what you have been talking about during your meetings. You can also have a photo gallery, links to other environmental sites, a members-only area that is password protected and where you have a discussion page, and even a section about how you can help the earth. Be sure not to give any personal info on your page, such as phone numbers, last names, addresses, e-mail addresses, or school addresses. Update your website frequently, so people don't get bored.

Use tmesis.,
Borrow from other languages.,
Get emotional.,
Combine them creatively.,
Try rhymes.",How to Swear Creatively2," Tmesis is when you cut a word in half with another word or phrase. Using it when you're cussing can add emphasis to the word or phrase. For example, you could say ""Abso-blooming-lutely,"" mixed up with your favorite cuss word., You can, of course, curse in another language. However, it's far funnier to borrow the phrases that people use to curse in other languages and translate it into English. In fact, because taboos are the similar around the world, they often do make some sense in English. For instance, angry drivers in Italy use ""che cazzo,"" meaning ""What the ."", One study should that you become more creative in your swearing just by getting angry or emotional. The study examined how many curse words a person could come up with in a minute; when people were angry or emotional, they were able to come up with more., One way to spice up how you swear is to combine curse words in your own creative way. Throwing together one swear with another, or turning one into an adjective, can help make your cursing a bit more interesting.For instance, you could say ""Darn that fracking house.""

, Sometimes, rhyming (or half-rhyming) curse words with other words can lead to more creative uses. For instance, saying ""Frack a cat!"" is more fun than just saying ""Frack,"" though it's not quite a true rhyme.

Decide whether you really want to start the club.,
Get faculty support.,
Find a venue.,
Decide when to meet.,
Advertise your club at school.,
Plan volunteering events.,
Have fun.",How to Start a Volunteering Club at Your School," Narrow down your idea until you have a focused, specific mission. For example, rather than being a general volunteering club, start a club to volunteer once a week at a certain soup kitchen in your community. Ask around and see what your fellow students think of your idea, and whether or not they would join. Once you have strong enough support from your friends and fellow students, you're ready to go.;
, Find a faculty advisor for your club. Pick someone who will help you promote and organize events for your club and be a liaison with the community. If your school has a process established for starting a club, talk to the teachers in charge of that to fill out any necessary paperwork. If not, talk to your principal and/or year co-ordinator to check that your idea is okay with them.

, Once you have clearance and permission for your club, you're almost ready to get your club up and running, but you need a place to hold meetings. Most clubs meet in classrooms after school. If you want to take this route, talk to faculty to reserve a classroom. If you have a faculty advisor, ask them to help you with this step, as they will likely know more about finding and reserving an available classroom.


You can also consider meeting at someone's house, at a nearby park or restaurant, or anywhere else in your community. If you choose to meet off campus, however, make sure everyone has adequate transportation to and from your meetings.

, Most school volunteering clubs hold a weekly organizational meeting in addition to weekly, biweekly, monthly, or quarterly volunteering sessions. Decide how often your club should meet, and then pick a convenient time and day when most club members will be free. For example, meet at lunch or immediately after school, and choose a day when other clubs or sports are less likely to interfere.

, Make bright, colorful, informative posters that will attract attention. If your school has daily notices or a bulletin,get a message about your club printed into it. Include when and where your club will meet, as well as information about what your club does. You can also ask your principal if you can make a small presentation on assembly.

, Once you have enough members in your club, start volunteering! You can decide on events yourself, or hold a meeting to get your club's opinion. Either way, be sure to hold fun events that everyone can participate in. Work with a few other members of the club to plan and organize your events, and advertise them to your whole school to get even more people involved.

, What's the point of having a club if it's no fun? Don't take yourself too seriously and be sure to have a sense of humor.

Distinguish the type of travel club you are going to develop.,
Recruit members to your travel club.,
Develop a club charter and rules, then appoint offices.,
Set up a business bank account.,
Write up membership contracts.,
Research the best deals, tours, and charter companies for your travel group.,
Book your travel club's events, vacations, and excursions.",How to Start a Travel Club," Types of travel groups include genres such as family travel groups, high school or middle school travel groups, special needs travel groups, abroad travel groups, singles travel groups, etc. If you do not have a specific travel group niche, simply establish a general travel club.;
,


Fliers: Post fliers in local businesses and ask local delivery services (such as pizza or Chinese food restaurants) if they will post your flier on their deliveries. Be sure to get permission from the businesses' owners or managers before posting anything on their property.
Network: Utilize social networking through face-to-face and word of mouth contact, through online social networking sites and blogs, use advertising on online sources such as search engines and post your site on any source pages that will allow it.
Ways to find members to recruit can also be based on the type of travel club you are going to create. For example, if this is a high school travel club, advertise with flyers around your school, word of mouth, online posting and networking, and even a travel club event such as a luau that showcases pictures and travel ideas for both near and far destinations.

, The club charter is a commitment created by the club's members to establish the club's intention, expectations, and policies. And as with any club, the typical offices held are as follows.


President: This person mandates over the club and leads meetings.
Vice President: This person plans the travel events and excursions.
Secretary: This person records and recites minutes.
Treasurer/Accountant: This person handles all monetary effects.
Historian: This person maintains pictures and notes of previous outings.
Public Officer: This person distributes flyers and maintains responsibility of club advertising.
Web Master: This person sees over the club's website if applicable.

, This will be the duty of the treasurer/accountant of your travel club and will ensure all monies are easily accounted for within a legitimate financial institution.

, Hire a lawyer to do this so it is legally binding, free from loopholes, and protects you and your assets. The lawyer will also inform you of liability issues as well as any legal aspects that may have been overlooked.

, Many travel accommodators offer big discounts for large travel groups, especially if you have a specific niche your travel club is filling. This job should be delegated to more members than yourself, so include at least your vice president in on this task as well. Also, if you have never been to a destination or used a certain charter company before, be sure to thoroughly research them and especially look into reliable reviews before booking.

, Be sure to be certain about every aspect in the itineraries and have back up plans in case of any unforeseen circumstances."

The first step to starting a spy club is choosing your members.,
Be careful when choosing your members choose people that are trustworthy, quiet, keep secrets well, and will not leak information of your club to people on the outside.

,
Hold an initiation ceremony.",How to Start a Spy Club in Your House1," Since this club will be in your house and or a close place e.g. a shed, siblings are a great idea. It can be great bonding time and may bring you and your siblings closer together.;
,, This will be where the new members choose their spy names, receive an I.D., and formally become a member of the club.

"
"
Brainstorm.,
Choose something you are excited about.,
Gauge the level of interest in your club.",How to Start a Club1," Before you start your club, you’ll have to pick a theme. What is your club about? Take some time to brainstorm and come up with a list of possible topics. Spies, princesses, geeks, pop stars? Remember to think about your club’s purpose. Do you simply want to discuss a topic with like-minded people, or are you putting a plan into action?;
, After you’ve brainstormed, choose an idea that you are truly interested in. Starting the club and keeping it running may turn out to be a lot of work for you, so you’ll want to focus on something that you enjoy.Consider creating a short mission statement that explains exactly what the club is all about. That way you can go to your statement when you are wrapped up in the excitement of explaining it to your friends.For example, “Trebble club is a group of high school students that are dedicated to arranging and performing pop songs from the 1990s to the present.”

, By nature, a club is a group activity with a certain number of participants. Talk to your friends, acquaintances, and other people in your community about your ideas. Ask them if they would be interested in participation and membership.If no one seems interested, try reaching a bit further out of your network. For example, you may have only spoken to your class or your schoolmates. Try reaching out to older or younger students, or contact other schools in the area.
Consider adjusting your idea if you can’t find any members. After several conversations, you should have a better sense of what would be interesting to your peers.

Choose a location.,
Gather your materials.,
A good idea for lighting up your base is to use white Christmas lights.,
If you are using a corner of a bedroom (or a bedroom itself) you can block your base using a dark colored curtain or blanket.

,
Bring small tables and chairs (small fold up tables are great!),
Decorate your spy club's base.",How to Start a Spy Club in Your House2," A corner of a bedroom, outdoor shed, or room under the stairs would all make a good spy base. Make sure the area is clean and you have permission to use it.

, See Things You'll Need below. Now bring all of your supplies to your base and organize them. Your base can't be messy!

, They look nice, create a lovely glow, and are not too 'in the way'.

,, into the base.

Gather fingerprints from your club and family members and then tape them to a wall.
Take pictures of members of your family and upload them online. You can then edit them to say ""Most Wanted"" or ""Missing"" along the middle. Then you can print the photos off (black and white ink can make the photos look more realistic) and tape those above your desks or pin them to a bulletin board..

"
"
Be as quiet as possible!,
Maintain distance.,
It is great to have something to take pictures of your suspect with.,
If your suspect goes into a room or outside and closes the door, you can listen through the walls.",How to Start a Spy Club in Your House3," This is the most important step when spying. Breath through your nose, wear soft soled footwear, and know exactly wear the floor creaks.

, When tailing a suspect, it's best to stay a distance of at least 8 feet (2.4 m) behind someone as to not be seen. If you make a mistake, you could risk falling and bumping into the person your spying on.

, Spy glasses or a camera are great to use but they can also be a bit of a hassle. If the person you are spying on turns around, you'll need something that you can hide easily. It may be a bit hard to take your glasses off and hide them behind your back or wait for your camera to turn off.

, Remember though, eavesdropping can be very rude if someone is having a personal or private conversation. Only eavesdrop if you know the person won't be upset if the find out. Record all of your evidence and enjoy being the spy of your house!

"
Get permission.,
Come up with a good name for the club.,
Find a meeting spot.,
Create a schedule for your meetings.,
Create a basic structure for your meetings.,
Advertise.",How to Start a Club2," If you plan to run your club at your school or university, you will need permission from the administration. Talk to your principal or student council about the rules for starting a club. Not all clubs are run in schools, so you may have to check with other local authorities. If you are under 18, however, you should still check-in with your parents, as they may end up supervising events or lending space in your house for meetings.


Some clubs require paperwork, a minimum number of participants, a teacher advisor, and so on. Check all the fine details, and make sure your club fits the criteria., Think of an inviting or appropriate name for your club. Try using a funny play on words that fits your theme. Alternatively, simply use a name that accurately describes what you do. You can ask your friends in the club to help you with this.

, Some clubs require a special facility or equipment, while others simply need a small room.Think about what kind of space is necessary for the things you plan to do. Depending on your club, the location for your meetings may need to be determined early on so that you can reserve your space. Talk to the person who is in charge of the space you plan to use, and get their permission before holding meetings.For example, a club dedicated to playing electronic music will probably require instruments, synthesizers, and a soundproof room. A club dedicated to discussing sports magazine articles, on the other hand, may not require a consistent meeting place at all.

, Decide how often, and for how long your club needs to meet to be productive. Weekly or monthly meetings are common, but it really depends on the club. Remember to consult with group members and consider their schedules when you decide on your meeting dates and times. You want everyone to show up!A writer’s club, for example, may only meet once a month because of the time it takes to write enough material to share at the meeting. A stretching club may meet once or twice a week since exercise needs to be consistent to show progress.

, Decide on what you will actually do when your club meets. Maybe you will bring in a guest presenter, or maybe each member has to bring something to share with the group. Remember to think about who will run any discussions and make announcements.

, Put up posters around your school or neighborhood to attract new members. Include when and where your club will meet. Add attention-grabbing words or images to build excitement and interest.


Place your fliers in strategic places. If your club meets at school, put up fliers in the bathroom stalls, hallways, and classroom doors. Get permission from teachers and administrators before you put up fliers.If your club is open to the public, put up fliers in places that prospective members will see them. If you are starting a cooking club, for example, ask to put up fliers at local restaurants and markets.

"
"
Determine roles.,
Maintain an updated contact list.,
Stick to your plan for success.,
Work towards a goal.,
Make it fun.",How to Start a Club3," Most clubs have elected leaders or officers. Your club may or may not need more authority than just one leader. It helps, however, to delegate responsibility to a few club members. Have the club vote on leadership roles once you’ve had your first few meetings. Remember that all roles are not always necessary. If your club doesn’t handle money and only meets to play soccer during the week, you probably don’t need a treasurer.President: The club president is the leader and face of the club. The president often runs meetings and makes final decisions.
Vice president: The VP usually helps the president with any tasks involved with running the club. Having a vice president may help if the president has a lot on their plate in terms of scheduling events or meeting with larger organizations.
Secretary: The secretary takes care of the paperwork and contacts for the club. They might take notes during meetings and send out emails to club members.
Treasurer: The treasurer is in charge of keeping track of funds. If your club raises money, for example, the treasurer would establish a budget and oversee any cash flow and banking accounts., Keep a list of emails and phone numbers for when you need to communicate with group members. Call or text club members in the event that you need to cancel a meeting or change locations.


Consider using social media. Make a Facebook group or club website to post announcements or send messages.

, Be consistent with the time and location of your meetings. Expect club members to do the jobs they sign up for, and give them space to do their best. Hold a meeting if something needs to be changed or adjusted.


Remain established and active. Keep your eyes open for new members and opportunities to promote yourselves., Your club might hold annual fundraising events, or you might be preparing for a special performance. Whatever your goal is, make sure you address it in each meeting. This will help give everyone a common goal to work towards, and members will see a clear purpose for club meetings.

, The whole point is to have a good time! Set a cheerful and positive environment so that people want to join the club, and stay in the club. Keep things fresh by thinking up new ideas and talking to group members about what they would like to do. "

Conduct member outreach.",How to Start a Social Club," Before you start making a club, you need to come up with a subject. If drawing is your hobby and you want to meet more artists, that can be your theme. Keep the theme as broad as possible. You can make a group about knit tags, but it may be difficult for you to find enough people who share that interest to grow a group out of it. Instead, make your group about knitting in general and share your love of knit tags during group time.


Consider what clubs exist in your area. Does your theme fill a need in your community? Search online or in gathering grounds such as a local community center, churches, or schools for similar clubs and avoid copying their theme.;
, Most clubs start small with a few interested people. You can do this with a few of your friends. It doesn’t matter if these people intend on staying long-term if they help you get the club up and running until you can recruit more members. Other options include advertisements such as flyers posted on bulletin boards and telephone poles, posts to social media, and words in town bulletins and newspapers.


Try asking among acquaintances such as fellow church members. Someone may refer someone they know to your group.
School groups usually require a few interested people to be recognized and receive funding. Some colleges, for instance, require a minimum of ten members. Check with your school.

, Many schools require you to have an advisor to lead the club, grow it, and make it successful. If you’re forming a club outside of school, you aren’t required to have the help, but a school advisor can help you register your club, find a meeting location, provide guest speakers, and more.Choose an adult who will take responsibility, stay interested in the group, and be responsive to your group’s needs. Usually you can find this person among teachers you’re familiar with or professors in your study branch.

, Once you have a few people who will attend your first meeting, settle upon a location. You can do this by asking your prospective members for a place that’s good for them. Often this location is someone’s house or a restaurant since new groups don’t have many members or money to spend on renting public space. If you’re in school, your advisor or the school can refer you to their classroom or a room where there won’t be a class around the time you want to meet.When your group grows, you can consider renting larger spots such as a room at a church or a community center.

, Now that you’ve got a place to meet, set a time. If you already have several members interested in joining the group, discuss with them a time that’s best for the majority of people. Often this will be after school or work or evenings on weekdays. It’s important to get as many people involved in the group as possible in order to establish the group and help it grow.


Once the group starts expanding, you’ll be less able to plan around the schedules of every member.

, Check with your school to find out what form you need to submit to be recognized as a group. If you’re doing this outside of a school, you won’t have to do this, but everyone else needs to respond to a club commissioner or outline the group on an official application. Clearly write out the name of the club and what its purpose.You will likely need information such as your faculty advisor’s name, budgeting concerns, and group activities.
Remember to make the information on the form as clear as possible. Confusing the commissioner or the school board that will vote on your application will surely cause your application to be rejected.

, Before you start the meeting, you’ll want to make sure everyone’s settled and as comfortable as possible. To do this, you can simply introduce yourself, but it helps to have an icebreaker activity. This can include anything like having people introduce themselves and state their experience with the group’s theme and why they’re there, such as having three years experience coding computer games for fun, but feel free to get creative.Creative icebreakers, for example, can be tossing a beach ball around and having people add a word to a story or answer a question you’ve written on a section of the ball.
Don’t pressure shy members to speak. Reassure your group members that they can pass if they don’t feel comfortable sharing.

, Chances are you already have in mind what the group is about and have discussed this a little with prospective members. However, bring these ideas to the first meeting. Discuss with your members again why you are starting this club. Why do you want to create this club? Write these answers into a basic mission statement.For instance, if your club is about photography, you may wish to connect to others over a love of photography. Write a mission statement saying exactly that.

, Once you have a basic idea of the club’s purpose, use it to determine what the club should accomplish and what the members will do together. The club members will share a common interest in the subject, but your club will benefit from having something to achieve and activities that allow members to have fun. Talk to your members about what they want to get out of your meetings.


For example, for a photography club, you can discuss photographs, improve your knowledge of photography, and go on trips together.

, Many clubs require nothing more than one’s presence. However, some clubs require extra material. If you want to start a book club, members have to have their own copy of the books you discuss. For other groups, such as ones about social anxiety, you can print out copies of lessons and worksheets and provide the material yourself., While conducting the first meeting, introduce yourself to unfamiliar members. Welcome them to the group. Tell them who you are, why you’ve created the group, and what experience you have with the subject. Then introduce anyone else responsible for the group and have them share the same facts about themselves.A social group usually lacks a formal structure. Groups that charge membership, raise funds, or get involved in politics may have to declare their type of group to the government.
As your group grows, consider appointing other members to handle tasks such as a deputy leader to back up your role, a treasurer to handle expenses, a secretary to contact members, and a membership manager to keep track of group membership.

, What does it mean to be a member of this group and what is membership like? Many social clubs have an open door or simple rules like having social anxiety to be in a social anxiety group. Other clubs may demand qualifications such as advanced computer coding skills, being a certain age, and so forth.Is there a charge to be a member? What benefits to members receive for being a part of this group? Make sure these rules are clearly communicated.

, Many social groups won’t need to do this since many groups have members show up as they please and pay for themselves. A ski group can have members pay their own way on trips, for meals, and chip in for snacks. Other groups need to identify what money they bring in, such as membership fees, expenses, how the money will be used, and draft a budget.


You as a leader may wish to do this for yourself. Include any officers you’ve appointed. You’ll need to consider your own budget, such as what you can afford to spend on meeting rooms, food, advertising, and materials for the meetings.

, A charter is a document that establishes the rules of the club. If your club is small, for fun, and has little structure outside of yourself as leader, you can simply write down all the rules. Outline the group’s purpose, leadership, and rules such as how members should act and respect one another.


Larger and more organized groups need to outline issues such as leadership position terms, how voting on group issues works, and how many members need to be at official meetings.

, With your members, come up with a time you’ll meet next and, if possible, future meetings. A group may choose to meet every Sunday, for instance. Consistency is good for keeping all members on the same page, not forgetting meetings and having a set time to indicate when they refer others to the group.


A time schedule doesn’t have to be set immediately. It may take a few meetings to come up with a good day and time and afterwards you may still need to switch to accommodate others.

, The introductory meeting of the group is a good time to indicate what you want the group meeting to be like while also listening to what other members want. For the next meeting, start breaking the time into segments. The first part of your book club can be about sharing how your week went while having snacks. The second part can be discussion over the assigned reading. The third part can be about addressing any concerns or suggestions.

, If you want a larger group, decide how you’ll grow your group. Consider placing advertisements on bulletin boards around town, starting a page on social media, making a website, and having members recruit new members. The more the word of your group spreads, the better chance you’ll have of finding new people who keep the group going and provide new insight.


Sign up for a website such as Meetup.com. There is a fee for listing the group, but the listing may make your group easier to find for interested people.

, In order to keep old members and attract new ones, it helps to get everyone in contact with one another. One way of doing this is a social media page. Another is a member’s forum. You can also design a newsletter you can email to your members. By creating contact, members talk to one another, which is appealing to potential members and helps you share information while promoting group solidarity.

Whether you focus on one type of car or keep it open will have some bearing on the goal and mission of the club. A club focused on one car might mean your members have more in common, but an open group will most likely draw more people to want to join.
You might start the club with one intention in mind, but as the club progresses you may decide that you want to shift the focus in a new direction. This is perfectly fine if it serves your members well.;
, Your club will only grow and be successful if you have an idea of what the purpose is. It is good to write down something specific which briefly outlines what your club is about.


For example, you might say, “Our club will encourage members to perform preventive maintenance, help members build friendships, and promote responsible driving.”
You may want to make new members officially accept the mission statement in some way, perhaps by signing a membership agreement.
You can write up a draft of this mission statement on your own, but you can also ask others for input as new people join the club.

, Goals could range from reaching a certain number of members to growing into a non-profit or business. Set goals that are specific and that you can easily tell once they have been accomplished. You might even have individual members set personal goals for what they hope to get out of the club.


Other examples of goals are host five car-themed charity events in the next year, have all members gain car maintenance or detailing certifications, and make a cross country road trip during the summer.

, Since the club revolves around your cars, it’s usually good to find somewhere that has a large parking lot. You may even want to hold the meeting in the parking lot so you can be around your cars. On occasion, you may want to hold the meeting in a large garage so you can be with the cars and be inside.


The location of your meeting will be partly determined by where you live and what is available to you. Community centers and churches often rent their space out to groups, so those are good options to check out.
If you can arrange to rent a space on a regular basis, this will make it easier for people to always know where the meeting is going to be.
It’s likely that you will need to pay to rent a space, so it’s important to figure out where this money will come from. You may have to cover it yourself the first time, and then you can collect dues or rent money from the members of your club.

, Ask any close friends or acquaintances who are car enthusiasts if they would come to your first meeting and if they would be interested in becoming members of a car club. You can tell them the place and time and give them an idea of what some of the meeting’s content will be.


You can spread the word to lots of people if you want, but for a first meeting it might be better to just have a handful of interested people. You can expand from there.
Tell the people you gather that they can invite anyone else they know that loves cars. You might build a large club just by asking people that someone already knows as opposed to inviting strangers.

, Welcome all the new members and potential members. Talk about the mission of the club, any restrictions and requirements, and what members can expect from the car club. Share information about any dues that will be collected, and how the club will be structured. Talk about leadership, and what will be expected from the people who manage the club.You may want to print out copies of the agenda so people have an idea of what all you want to cover in the first meeting.
Start out by having everyone introduce themselves and mention something they like about cars.
At least for the first meeting, it’s great to have some food as a draw and a centerpiece for initial hanging out and conversing.

, After the first meeting, call the people who attended to get their feedback and thoughts about further involvement with the club. You don’t want to set a date for the next meeting and find out that no one is interested in doing anything else. Tell people at the meeting that you’ll be reaching out to them.


You could also have people fill out a feedback card of some kind to give you an idea about where everyone stands in regards to the club.
During the phone call, ask people how they felt the meeting went, whether or not they would like to participate in the club, and what they would like to see the club do in the future.

, Most organizations, businesses, and groups in the modern era thrive because of their online presence. You can go the simple route of starting up a Facebook page for your club, or you can create a website.


If you aren’t good with social media, enlist the help of one of your early joiners to create the online club page.
This can have contact information for the club’s leader, meeting location and other details, the clubs purposes and mission statement, and other relevant information that someone searching for the club would want to know.
As the club grows, this can become a vital resource for staying connected as a group. It can be a place to message members, post cool articles and videos, and alert your members to any upcoming events or changes to schedules.

, While an online presence is important, getting your name out there still requires more than just a website. You can post flyers around your college campus, high school, office, church, or anywhere else around town. Cards can be carried by the founding members to pass out to people.Business cards and flyers should have the name of your club, some contact info, and a brief blurb about the purpose of the club. Local mechanic shops would be a great place to leave some flyers and cards.
Flyers are great because they are a constant presence that will ideally stay where you put them for quite a while. They’ll get more views than handing a business card to one person.
You can go through parking lots and place these on cars that seem like they belong to people who would be interested in an enthusiasts club. Some of your meetings might focus on just reaching out to new people and handing out flyers and cards.

, Once your club has been established for a little while, perhaps a few months, you can hold meetings that are specifically designed to invite new people. This could be sort of like a mixer which has a welcoming environment to make potential members feel comfortable.


If you feel that your club is at a good size, you may not want to continue expanding. It’s okay to find a size that works well and allow the group to hang out there for a while.

, If your club is based around a university, talk to the clubs or organizations office and get an official sanction. The benefit of this is that you can get university funding for your programs and events. Another option is to seek out accreditation from a national car club. You can become a charter club that is part of their official network.


There are many benefits to belonging to a larger organization, and national car club chapters can usually advise the local chapters on management, event planning and marketing opportunities.

Recognize when the person is lying.,
Look for patterns in the person's lies.,
Determine whether the person's lies are harmful.,
See if the person gets pleasure from lying.,
Look for signs the person is a pathological liar.,
Document instances of lying.,
Talk to the person privately.,
Give the liar a chance to explain the lie.,
Show your evidence that a lie was told.,
Explain that your trust has been lost.,
Recommend psychological treatment if necessary.,
Understand it might take awhile for the liar to stop.,
Know you don't have the power to change another's behavior.,
Protect yourself from being harmed by the liar.",How to Deal With a Liar," If you know what to look for, it's not hard to tell when someone is lying to you. Knowing how to recognize when the person is trying to deceive you can clue you in to how serious the issue is. Get to know how the person looks and acts in a normal, non-stressful situation, and contrast this with how they act when you think they may be lying. After awhile you should be able to read the person's body language well enough to have a grasp on when they're not telling the truth.


Check out the way the person acts when you ask his or her birth date or hometown. Now compare that behavior to how the person acts when you ask a more difficult question, like whether he or she slept with your boyfriend or fudged numbers on a work document. If the person is telling the truth, he or she shouldn't show signs of stress when answering the more difficult questions.
Forget what you've heard about lack of eye contact being an indication that someone is lying; in fact, many liars deliberately make eye contact because of this myth.When people lie they unconsciously exhibit other physical signs of stress. Look for these signs:

A fake smile that engages only the mouth, not the eyes.
A higher-pitched voice than normal.

Dilated pupils.Very slow blink rate (and rapid blink rate when the lie is over).

Antsy foot movements, like toe-tapping or shuffling.

Face touching, like repeatedly covering the mouth, eyes or nose.

;
, Many people lie about a few subjects that make them extremely uncomfortable - usually their past bad behavior or something that makes them embarrassed. If the person in question tends to consistently lie when asked about a certain topic, you may just want to back off and stop pressing that particular issue. However, if the person's lies seem to have no rhyme or reason, with no pattern you can make out, you've got a bigger problem on your hands.


If someone lies every time you ask him about why his father is always absent, or why he never finished high school, or why he refuses to speak to a certain person, the answers to those questions might well be classified as none of your business, anyway. Unless you're in a committed relationship with someone, you aren't entitled to knowing every detail about someone's life.
If, on the other, hand the person seems to tell lies just for the heck of it, even when asked questions about seemingly unimportant topics, he or she might be a compulsive liar. Since his or her lying doesn't follow a pattern, it will be a lot harder to sympathize with the person's intentions for hiding the truth.

, It never feels good to be told a lie, but some lies are more harmful than others. Before you stage an intervention, figure out how the lies are affecting the liar, you, and other people who may be involved.


Is the person merely protecting him or herself from saying too much? Maybe it's not that big a deal.
Is the person lying to manipulate other people? Do people make decisions based on what the person says, not realizing they've been lied to? This is a problem that needs to be addressed.






Is the person lying to get away with bad behavior, like stealing, cheating or hurting someone? This behavior has a severely negative effect.







, Some people actually enjoy the act of lying more than they enjoy telling the truth. It can be like an addiction, evoking a small high each time a lie is told. Brazen liars who have gotten away with lying for a long time might start to lie as a way of life, rather than out of perceived necessity. Compulsive liars are tough to crack, since they need to treat lying like any other addiction.

, Pathological liars tell exaggerated lies that are so far from the truth they're often glaringly obvious. They often believe the lies they tell, and they'll tell you a completely absurd story with a poker face so earnest you can't help but take it as truth. Pathological liars have a psychological disorder. Unfortunately, because they think they're telling the truth, you won't be able to talk them out of lying. Still, it's worth having a confrontation to determine whether a wake-up call will set them on the path to getting help.

, Write down each instance of lying that you notice, with details that explain why you believe it's a lie. Do some research so you have evidence that the person was lying, rather than just going on a hunch you have. You want to be able to show the liar that you know without a doubt that he or she was being deceitful.


If you can collect hard evidence, such as emails or paperwork that contradicts what the person said, it'll make the confrontation that much easier.






If you're relying on other people to call out the lie, try to get more than one person's word.

, Confronting someone on their bad behavior in public is pretty cold, and isn't likely to help that person change. It's better to discuss the matter in private, so feelings of shame and embarrassment don't escalate the matter to a breaking point. Calmly tell the person that you believe he or she lied. Spell out the specific lie or lies you want to discuss.


Don't call the person a liar. Again, it's better to take a gentle course at first. In most cases the person will be so embarrassed at being found out that he or she will stop lying.







, Watch the person's body language carefully for more signs that he or she is lying. Listen to the person's excuse. If he or she admits to the lie and apologizes, you may not need to take the confrontation much further. Discuss the matter fully and end the conversation by telling the person that you hope it doesn't happen again.

, If the person gets defensive, makes excuses, or continues lying during the confrontation, it's time to bring out the evidence. Show the person the emails, papers, or other evidence you collected that definitely proves he or she lied to you. At this point you've cornered the liar, and he or she will probably either remain silent or begin to apologize.

, This is a difficult thing to hear, and the person in question will probably feel upset when you tell him or her that you no longer believe a word he or she says. Explain that you can't help but be hyperaware that the person might lie, and that until he or she demonstrates a commitment to the truth over a prolonged period of time, your trust will still be broken.


Most people will be deeply embarrassed by this, and hopefully will make a commitment to you to tell the truth from now on.






Compulsive liars may admit that they have an addiction, and ask you for help in stopping their bad habit. You may have to confront them over and over again before they stop lying for good; for some, it will be a never-ending battle.
Pathological liars and sociopaths are not going to be swayed by a confrontation. For them, lying is an essential part of their personality.

, Tell the person that excessive or compulsive lying is something that can be treated in therapy. Encourage the person to seek outside help before he or she loses everyone's trust. Eventually, liars are usually exposed - and as a consequence, they can lose their jobs, ruin relationships, and hurt their chances for living a more honest lifestyle.

, People who have made a habit of lying can't usually break it right away. Don't be surprised if you catch the person in a lie again at some point in the future. Depending on your relationship to the liar, you may or may not want to continue helping him or her stop by repeating the cycle of gathering evidence, confronting the liar, and informing him or her that trust has been broken.

, Ultimately, you can't know what's going on in someone else's head. If a person wants to stop lying, he or she will have to make that commitment and stick to it. If a person doesn't want to stop, there's absolutely nothing you can do about that.

, Dealing with a liar can be emotionally exhausting. Just when you think trust has been restored, you might catch the person in the act again, and be forced to start all over. It's important to take time away from the person and spend time with people you know you can trust. You might also consider seeking counseling for help dealing with the mixed emotions that come with being close to a liar.


Don't get wrapped up in the person's lies. Make sure you always have a firm grasp on the truth. Good liars are believable, and it's important to be able to tell the truth from fantasy.






Cut the person off if it gets out of hand. Don't let yourself get too sucked in. At a certain point, you might need to cut ties and let go of a toxic relationship. After you've done everything you can, break it off and start healing.

Decide where, when, and how often the club will meet.,
Research other clubs on the Internet.,
Choose a cool name.,
Choose a fish species, location, or cause as your theme.",How to Start a Fishing Club1," As the founder of the club, it might be a good idea to provide the primary meeting place at least for the first little while. If the club takes off, you may want to implement a rotation, meaning that a different member of the club takes over the hosting duties each time. A weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly schedule will likely make it easier for members to commit than trying to meet twice or three times per week.;
, Starting a club from scratch can be a bit daunting, so seeing how others are run can go a long way in easing any reservations you may have. They don’t even have to be fishing clubs - you can research similar groups to gain tips on structure, events and protocol that can be transferred to your club.

, Every club needs a cool name.

, Most fishing clubs employ a theme that centers around whatever is nearest to the members’ hearts. Some choose to highlight a particular type of fish indigenous to the area. Others devote their focus to a nearby lake, or to attracting young people or women to the sport. The theme can always change, but having one pre-chosen can help generate interest in the club.

"
"
Create and distribute a flyer promoting the club.,
Create awareness of the club via social media.,
Promote your club on fishing-themed message boards.",How to Start a Fishing Club2," Use your creativity here, but make sure you have all the necessary information:



What is the club? This is where you detail the purpose and theme of the club, along with some of the activities you have in mind (sharing stories, debating topics, going on trips and others).

Where and when will the club meet? Make sure you choose a time that is as user-friendly as possible, and work under the assumption that most of your prospective club members are only available at certain times during the week.

How much does it cost? Unless you plan on creating a fund or collection for future excursions, it doesn't make much sense to charge for entry. Simply invite others to bring snacks or drinks, and everything you need should be covered.

What is the club founder’s contact information? Be sure to include an email address and telephone number, since some people prefer one mode of communication over the other.

, Tell your friends. Tell your family. Tell everyone else you keep in touch with on a regular basis. Even if they aren't interested, they may know others who will be. Word-of-mouth notice has never been easier to achieve, thanks in large part to the growing presence of social media.

, For many hobbies, message boards help to bring together those with similar interests for discussions and story-sharing. In essence, being an active member of a fishing-themed message board is almost like being in a club. Making the transition to an actual club simple and smooth.

"
"
Be enthusiastic when talking to prospective members.,
Invite interested members to an inaugural meeting.,
Hold the first meeting.",How to Start a Fishing Club3," If you seem put out, disinterested, or dull when discussing the club, it will be difficult to elicit a positive response from those who wish to join. Be sure to express your excitement at the prospect of sharing fish tales with a group of peers, and be open to suggestions on how to make the club better.

, Be firm with the date unless there is overwhelming interest in changing it to something everyone else can agree upon. If one or two people cannot make the meeting, tell them you’ll fill them in on the specifics and invite them to attend the next one. Make sure you give each interested party enough advance notice that keeping his or her schedule clear will be as easy as possible.

, Between an opening speech, “mission statement” (if you opt to create and share it), introductions, and a few ice breaking fish tales, you'll have no shortage of things to do on the first night. Make sure everyone takes the opportunity to share a bit about himself or herself, and encourage the attendees to talk about something fishing-related to help create familiarity.

Think about why you lied.,
Identify who should hear your confession.,
Set a time and date for your talk.,
Choose a neutral location.,
Maintain eye contact.,
Identify your lie.,
Tell the whole truth.,
Apologize.,
Stay calm.,
Listen.,
Be honest in the future.",How to Tell Someone You Lied1," Take some time to contemplate your actions and question your underlying motivations. It’s not that you’re trying to find an excuse for your behavior, but rather that you’re trying to more fully understand what happened and why. This self-evaluation can help you avoid similar behavior in the future, as well help the person you’re confessing to understand.If you see a therapist regularly, you can ask for their help in plumbing the issue. If not, you can try writing about your lie in a journal or self-reflection exercise and see if this gives you any insight.;
, You should tell anyone you may have injured in the course of your lie, as well as anyone to whom you lied.


Sometimes this is straightforward. For example, if you lied on a job application, you need to tell the recruiting officer with whom you interviewed. Sometimes, though, the issue is less clear-cut: there might be people who you didn’t directly lie to or about, but who were or could be affected by the deception. For example, if you cheated on an exam, you should tell not only your teacher, but also your parents or close guardian who need to be aware of your behavior.
If there are multiple parties to whom you should divulge your lie, do so on a one-on-one basis rather than grouping them together. This will make it easier for you to be direct and open, and it will also show those to whom you’re confessing that you respect and care enough to dedicate a one-on-one to them.

, Although an impromptu chat can be productive, it’s usually best to assign a special time for your talk. This assures that you can gather your thoughts ahead of time and avoid problematic distractions like other peoples’ conversations or work obligations.Pick a time when you and the other person can think clearly. This means you probably want to avoid lunch break or the morning hours when people are often preoccupied with work problems., Sitting in someone’s living room can make it feel like one person has an advantage over the other, so think carefully about the location of your meeting before making the assignation.


Public places like coffee shops or park benches can be a good idea, but make sure it’s not so busy that you get distracted or feel uncomfortable about talking about personal things in the proximity of strangers.

, Looking someone in the eye denotes sincerity and can make a big impact as to how your confession is received.It can help to remember that, while you were wrong to lie, it’s a noble act to recognize and admit your wrongdoing. Allow yourself to be proud of your decision and acknowledge its bravery.

, As clearly and concisely as possible, outline the lie which you told. Provide a reason or context for the lie if your interlocutor is willing to listen, but make sure it doesn’t sound like you’re trying to rationalize or excuse your wrongdoing.Use “I statements” when talking about your lie. This will help to make sure that you aren’t slipping into any accusatory or blame-dodging patterns., Studies have shown that conceding only partially to lying or other misbehavior detracts significantly from the concession’s positive effect on both confessor and the one who confesses.So, while it may make the conversation uncomfortable initially, try not to omit anything or soften the impact of your confession in other ways.

, Once you’ve explained your falsehood, wrap up your confession with a sincere expression of regret. Show that you understand how hurtful and serious the transgression was and that you’ve thought about how it has affected others around you. You can’t be sure that you will be forgiven, but it’s still important to show your compunction.It can help to reassure your interlocutor that you have no expectations regarding their acceptance of your apology. This lets them know that you are apologizing for the right reasons—to admit your culpability for the simple sake of honesty—and not for wrong, self-serving reasons, such as feeling relieved or absolved by another’s forgiveness.Avoid hedging phrases which qualify and undermine your apology. Things like “I’m sorry if you were upset by what I did” are not real apologies but rather weak expressions of pity or compassion. You need to be direct and say “I’m sorry for what I did, period.”

, Although the subject might be an emotional one for both of you, try to keep the tone of the conversation evenly measured and low-key. Getting emotional can muddle your ability to expression yourself, so, for the sake of your message, try to keep calm and carry on.If you’re worried about getting flustered or emotional and, consequently, getting off track, bring a “cheat sheet” with you. This can be a card or leaf of paper where you’ve outlined briefly the points you want to cover.
Avoid drinking alcohol or coffee before or during your confession as this can make you more emotional or tense. Drink green or chamomile tea instead, as these have natural placating side-effects.

, You should let your interlocutor tell you how they feel about your admission and how they want to proceed with your relationship. You’ve said your piece and now they deserve to say as little or as much as they wish.This doesn’t mean you have to tolerate abuse or other violent reactions. Just because you’ve done something wrong and admitted to it, you don’t deserve to undergo overly punitive measures.If the person reacts poorly, apologize again for your lie and withdraw as quickly as possible from the situation.

, Show that you can be a reliable and trustworthy person after lying by mending your ways and being honest. The other person does not have to forgive or forget, but you can still improve personal integrity and habits."

Reflect on why you lied.,
Decide if you want to post a letter or send an email.,
Make an outline.,
Write a first draft.,
Be concise.,
Take a break.,
Re-read and edit your letter.,
Draft a final copy and send it.",How to Tell Someone You Lied2," If you keep a journal, try writing about the lie in an entry that questions your motives and what impact the lie has had on you and others. Writing as means of personal reflection has been shown to have multiple mental and emotional benefits, and it can be one of the best ways to understand yourself better and organize your thoughts.No journal? No problem! Open up a Word doc on your computer and do a free-write, or jot down some ideas in an old school notebook. If you have a personal blog, try writing about the lie in the blog.
If you see a therapist regularly, you can ask for their help in thinking about the problem.

, While it used to be thought that email is an inappropriate mode for conveying serious emotions or problems, it has since become widely acceptable as a suitable medium for both casual communications and serious discussions. That being said, mailing a real letter can be a special gesture as it shows effort and respect.


If you don’t have the person’s email or postal address, try checking with friends for a way to get in touch.
Don’t write a letter by hand if you have messy handwriting. You’re already asking someone to read your confession and apology; you don’t want to additionally ask them to puzzle over your handwriting.

, Once you’ve thought about your actions, think about what you want to say in your letter and how you want to say it. Put these thoughts into a structured outline so that you won’t get off track in the course of writing your letter.


Your outline should be no more than one page. Write just one bullet or the topic sentence for each paragraph and then fill in the surrounding text later., Flesh out the points on your outline so that you have at least three full paragraphs. The first should explain what you lied about and why you’re writing the letter. The second should express your remorse for your actions and an apology. The third should express the hope that your apology helps in some way but also clarifies that you don’t expect to be forgiven.You can (and should!) include more specific and personal details in your letter, but don’t stray too far from the simple formula of disclosure, apology, and conclusion.

, Your letter can be elegantly written but it shouldn’t be overly verbose. Too many words will dilute the impact of a clear, direct, and responsibility-acknowledging apology., We’ve all impulsively fired off an email or text when we were emotional, and most the time it doesn’t end well. More often than not, we find ourselves regretful of the rash missive because, even if you stand by its intent, you ultimately deem its timing or language as less than optimal.So take a lesson from your past and set your letter or email aside for a night.


If you’re writing an email, save it as a draft but don’t enter the addressee yet. This will ensure that you don’t mistakenly send the email before it’s all prepared.
If you’re mailing a letter, wait to buy the stamps you need until the next day so that, even if you get the urge to send it off right away, you won’t be able to apply the necessary postage.

, Find some time the next morning or afternoon to review your letter. You’ll be able to fix any overlooked typos or awkward phrases and, more importantly, your fresh perspective will allow you amend bigger problems like rationalizing language or sentimental, mealy-mouthed platitudes.


If you have a close, trusted friend who knows the situation, think about reading your letter to them and asking for their feedback., It can be tempting to edit something to death as a way of delaying the ultimate, scary step of pressing ‘Send’ on your email or dropping your letter in the mailbox. At a certain point, though, you need to accept your final draft and send it on its way. The sooner you do so, the sooner you can begin to move on.

Apologize.",How to Tell Someone You Lied3," If you want to confess your lie and apologize in a face-to-face conversation, but you’re worried that you don’t have the emotional control or wherewithal to facilitate the discussion, you can hire a trained professional to assist you.If you’re in school or college, your institution might provide a free counseling service that performs conflict mediation and relationship counseling. Look over your school’s website for information about this possibility, or talk to an administrative official who can direct you to the right place.

, Whether you are taking advantage of a free service offered by your university or paying an independent professional, base your decision on a variety of factors including cost, personal compatibility, and convenience.Fees for therapists who perform mediation vary significantly, so get a written quote before you commit to one.Make sure the party you choose is a disinterested party and trained in conflict resolution. Even if your parent or relative wants to help and thinks they can be objective, they are only a good option if they are a lawyer or therapist, or if they have completed some kind of conflict resolution training.Even if you like the looks of a mediator, take a little time to review the counselor’s client feedback on sites like Yelp or Better Business Bureau. This is particularly important because some states don’t require professional mediators or conflict resolution counselors to possess a special license or affiliation in order to practice, so you’ll need to do your own research to make sure you’ve found a good one., Before carrying out the conflict mediation, you should sit down with the mediator you’ve chosen in order to explain your situation, needs, and objectives for the session. The mediator can also inform you about the procedure and give you some helpful tips to prepare.Remember that your mediator is a valuable resource and can refer you to a long-term psychological professional if you’re interested. Seeing someone regularly can help you work on living more honestly and avoiding similar mistakes in the future.

, Your mediator can extend a formal invitation to the person you want to talk to, or you can get in touch with them through more informal channels.


If you work or study full-time, you should try to make the appointment for after work rather than during lunch. This will help avoid distraction and work-day stress., Gather your thoughts before the session and make sure you keep your emotions in check.Try meditating, drinking green tea, or doing relaxing exercises like yoga or controlled breathing beforehand. A centered mindset will help you organize your thoughts and be a better participant in the mediation., Instead of jumping right in and confessing your lie, have your mediator set some ground rules and facilitate the discussion.


When it’s your turn, explain your lie. Use “I-statements” to avoid sounding accusatory or blame-shifting, and let your mediator point out any time you seem to be rationalizing or getting off-topic.
When it’s the other person's turn, listen attentively. Chances are, you haven’t understood or considered their side as much as you could have, so listening to the other person will provide you valuable insight., A meaningful apology means that you acknowledge that lying was wrong, that you take full responsibility for your lie, and also that you may have caused harm through your falsehood.The person you've lied to is more likely to forgive your apology if you show that you are changing. You want them to see not only that you're sorry for your mistake, but also that you want to avoid similar mistakes in the future."

Football is a complicated game, but a knowing a few simple rules will prevent you from having to ask what is going on.When they have the ball, the offense will have 4 plays to go 10 yards. If they get the 10 yards, that is a first down, meaning they now get another 4 plays to go 10 more yards. A phrase like “3rd and 7” means it is 3rd down (the third play of a possible four) and the offense needs to go 7 yards for a first down.
There are several types of scoring plays in football. The most common is a touchdown, when a player gets the ball into the end zone, which is worth 6 points. After getting a touchdown, the team that scored has the chance to kick an extra point (1 point) or run another play (2 points). Other scores include a field goal, kicking the ball through the goal posts (3 points), and a safety, where the defense tackles the offensive player in his own end zone (2 points to the defense).
Football has a lot of penalties with complicated hand signals. Luckily, the referee will announce the penalty after he has called it. You can know a penalty has been called because the referee will throw a yellow flag onto the field during the play.
Lots of the sport’s little rules change yearly, and even ardent fans can have a hard time keeping up. Chances are if there is a new rule, the commentators will explain it to the audience, possibly even several times, so keep listening to them.;
, If you want to look like you know what you are talking about during a football game, you should probably know a few of the people involved. Quarterbacks are usually the most popular and famous players involved, though knowing the names of coaches and a few other random players will make you seem more involved and knowledgable.Look for reasons to know about a player beyond what they do on the field. Players are real people too, and may have diverse interests, backgrounds, and charity work that can be interesting facts to know. Additionally, some of them may also have negative parts, like run-ins with the law., Learn about the teams that are playing, so you can have something to talk about. You’ll probably want to know a few of the key players, what the teams’ records are, and if there is any particular history between the two teams, such as being rivals, or having met in a big game in the recent past.


Team websites and blogs are good sources for this kind of information. Some casual skimming of a more generic site like Wikipedia is good for basic background, while other more open sites like a team blog or even threads on Reddit can give you some idea on what fans of the team are thinking about and what is important to them., These can be obscure facts about the game, or maybe a crazy story involving one or more of the players. You don’t necessarily need to tell these stories, but they can be good things to know in the back of your mind. After all, you wouldn’t have that kind of information if you weren’t really knowledgeable about the sport, right?There are plenty of good sources out there for information about sports and the athletes that play them. You can visit team and league websites, read the Sports section of your local newspaper, or find team-centered blogs. You can also watch programming on sports-based TV networks like ESPN or Fox Sports. Remember that you don’t need to learn everything there is to know about the team or sport, just a few interesting facts to mention if you need to contribute something.

, These people are paid to explain the game to the audience, so take advantage of that. You’ll be able to pick up a few more terms or nuances of the game, and be able to interject them into conversation later., You won’t be able to convince people of your knowledge by staying totally silent and hoping no one notices. Throw in a few generic statements about the game as it goes along. This will let other people believe you are involved, and give the more knowledgeable folks around a chance to chime in with more detail.It’s best to keep your comments as generic as possible. Something like “What a play” or “Great move” can contribute to the conversation without having to actually say anything specific.
Occasionally questioning the referees’ ability to make a call correctly is also a good way to throw something into conversation. Chances are someone will be able to agree when you say things like “What are they doing?” or “Tough call there.”, These should be open-ended questions that allow other people to talk. When something happens in the game, ask someone “What do you think about that play?” This gives the other person an opening to share their opinion, and means you don’t need to talk. Plus, you might learn something from that person's thoughts., If the conversation starts to move into areas you don’t feel comfortable with, find ways to change the subject, or at least get yourself out of it. Unless people are yelling and getting heated, the topic probably isn’t so important that you can’t steer the conversation to something you are more comfortable with, like another sport, or another topic altogether.Jumping in by saying “You know, that reminds me of something else...” can be a good way to start shifting the conversation to something you are more comfortable with, while not revealing that you don’t know what is going on.
Another way to create a distraction is to step out of the conversation. Get a snack or drink for yourself, or other people, as a way to excuse yourself and step away.

, Speak slowly and calmly, and avoid saying something until you’ve figured out what to say. Avoid filler words such as “um” or “like” when stating something, as these tend to suggest you are uncomfortable with your ideas.Remember that other people don’t know that much either. People love sports for a variety of reasons, including the tribal affiliation of rooting for “your” team or the narratives that a great game can provide. Mostly, people appreciate having something to talk about with others, much like a good television show. They might be faking it just as much as you are, meaning your confidence can go a long way., Even if you don’t quite know what’s going on, other people who do will be able to give you some clues. If other people start screaming at the TV, adding your own “Come on” or “What was he thinking?” gets you in on the action.Similarly, don’t be the one person who reacts to something. What looks like a great play to you may actually be pretty routine, so don’t expose your lack of knowledge by overreacting to it.

, If you are watching a game with a group, chances are some of the people there really care about the outcome. You don’t need to actually know more or care about the sport to join the crowd in cheering the team on. Other people are also less likely to challenge your fandom if you aren’t actively supporting their opponents.You should be able to figure out who people are cheering for. Many will be wearing team gear and colors. Even those that aren’t will react when something happens.
Look for the hometown team. If you live in an area with a team (college or professional), you will likely be surrounded by that team’s fans. If you are looking to blend into the crowd, the local team is the one most people will probably be supporting.
Wearing the team’s colors is a good idea, as that can help you blend in. Plus, by knowing the team’s colors, you can avoid the awkwardness of accidentally wearing the colors of the opponent, which will definitely draw attention to you.
Be careful about wearing clothing with logos, like a jersey, t-shirt, or hat. By wearing the team’s logo, you are branding yourself as one of its followers. People will expect that you know something about the team beyond its name and mascot. If you want to go that route, make sure you’ve done a little research on the team and some players beforehand, just in case something comes up while talking. You’ll want to be able to respond briefly before shifting the conversation.

, If someone challenges you, you want to stress how much you agree with him. If you try to argue back, you may need to reference evidence that you don’t actually have. Instead, emphasize things that you do agree on, and try to avoid actually responding to his questions.Saying something like, “Come on, we’re both here to watch the game” can diffuse the conversation, and lets other people around you think you are trying to rise above the argument. The one person may not be convinced, but others will probably agree that watching the game is the most important thing.

Think about why you lied.,
Identify who should hear your confession.,
Set a time and date for your talk.,
Choose a neutral location.,
Maintain eye contact.,
Identify your lie.,
Tell the whole truth.,
Apologize.,
Stay calm.,
Listen.",How to Confess to Lying1," Take some time to contemplate your actions and question your underlying motivations. It’s not that you’re trying to find an excuse for your behavior, but rather that you’re trying to more fully understand what happened and why. This self-evaluation can help you avoid similar behavior in the future, as well as help the person you’re confessing to understand.Talk with a trusted friend who has known you a long time. They might be able to help you figure things out.
If you see a therapist regularly, you can ask for their help in plumbing the issue. If not, you can try writing about your lie in a journal or self-reflection exercise and see if this gives you any insight.;
, You should tell anyone you may have injured in the course of your lie, as well as anyone to whom you lied.


Sometimes this is straightforward. For example, if you lied on a job application, you need to tell the recruiting officer with whom you interviewed. Sometimes, though, the issue is less clear-cut: there might be people who you didn’t directly lie to or about, but who were or could be affected by the deception. For example, if you cheated on an exam, you should tell not only your teacher, but also your parents or close guardian who need to be aware of your behavior.
If there are multiple parties to whom you should divulge your lie, do so on a one-on-one basis rather than grouping them together. This will make it easier for you to be direct and open, and it will also show those to whom you’re confessing that you respect and care enough to dedicate one-on-one time to them.

, Although an impromptu chat can be productive, it’s usually best to assign a special time for your talk. This ensures that you can gather your thoughts ahead of time and avoid problematic distractions like other people’s conversations or work obligations.Pick a time when you and the other person can think clearly. This means you probably want to avoid lunch break or the morning hours when people are often preoccupied with work problems., Sitting in someone’s living room can make it feel like one person has an advantage over the other, so think carefully about the location of your meeting before making the assignation.


Public places like coffee shops or park benches can be a good idea, but make sure it’s not so busy that you get distracted or feel uncomfortable about talking about personal things in the proximity of strangers.

, Looking someone in the eye denotes sincerity and can make a big impact as to how your confession is received.It can help to remember that, while you were wrong to lie, it’s a noble act to recognize and admit your wrongdoing. Allow yourself to be proud of your decision and acknowledge its bravery.

, As clearly and concisely as possible, outline the lie you told. Provide a reason or context for the lie if your interlocutor is willing to listen, but make sure it doesn’t sound like you’re trying to rationalize or excuse your wrongdoing.Use “I statements” when talking about your lie. This will help to make sure that you aren’t slipping into any accusatory or blame-dodging patterns.Also, be sure to lead with a total acknowledgement of responsibility before venturing into explanations.

, Studies have shown that conceding only partially to lying or other misbehavior detracts significantly from the confession’s positive effect on both confessor and the one who confesses.So, while it may make the conversation uncomfortable initially, try not to omit anything or soften the impact of your confession in other ways. Even if you think certain information is unnecessary to include, let the other party be the decider of that. This helps to rebuild their trust in you.

, Once you’ve explained your falsehood, wrap up your confession with a sincere expression of regret. Show that you understand how hurtful and serious the transgression was and that you’ve thought about how it has affected others around you. You can’t be sure that you will be forgiven, but it’s still important to show your compunction.It can help to reassure your interlocutor that you have no expectations regarding their acceptance of your apology. This lets them know that you are apologizing for the right reasons—to admit your culpability for the simple sake of honesty—and not for wrong, self-serving reasons, such as feeling relieved or absolved by another’s forgiveness.Avoid hedging phrases that qualify and undermine your apology. Things like “I’m sorry if you were upset by what I did” are not real apologies, but rather weak expressions of pity or compassion. You need to be direct and say “I’m sorry for what I did, period.”

, Although the subject might be an emotional one for both of you, try to keep the tone of the conversation evenly measured and low-key. Getting emotional can muddle your ability to expression yourself, so, for the sake of your message, try to keep calm and carry on.If you’re worried about getting flustered or emotional and, consequently, getting off track, bring a “cheat sheet” with you. This can be a card or leaf of paper where you’ve outlined briefly the points you want to cover.
Avoid drinking alcohol or coffee before or during your confession as this can make you more emotional or tense. Drink green or chamomile tea instead, as these have natural placating side-effects., You should let your interlocutor tell you how they feel about your admission and how they want to proceed with your relationship. You’ve said your piece and now they deserve to say as little or as much as they wish.Let the person know they can take time to reflect on everything and the two of you can talk about it later after they've collected their thoughts. There may need to be a few conversations about this lie before it's all said and done.
This doesn’t mean you have to tolerate abuse or other violent reactions. Just because you’ve done something wrong and admitted to it, you don’t deserve to undergo overly punitive measures.If the person reacts poorly, apologize again for your lie and withdraw as quickly as possible from the situation.

Ask questions.,
Consider whether it happens often.,
Ask their relative.,
Look for suspicious signs.,
Change topics.,
Think about whether or not you want to be friends.,
Understand their motives.,
Know that they're not the only one.,
Think up some respectful ways to bring up the topic.,
Bring it up.,
Steer the conversation away from turning into an argument.",How to Tell when Your Friend Is Lying," Asking questions and taking time to find out the answer will mean you will be able to understand and empathize with what your friend is talking about, if it is true. If your friend is lying, they will probably try to avoid eye contact, dodge the question, stutter for a minute before answering, change the subject quickly, or come up with an answer that makes no sense.


If your friend talks about getting a bunch of positive comments on a social media app that you don't have, maybe ask them what all of the comments say. If he or she gives a vague answer such as, ""They all say I'm really pretty or whatever"" or ""I got so many, I can't keep track,"" then they're probably lying. Just remember that some people do a lot of these things normally, so it really depends on the person.;
, While everyone has incredible experiences, if your friend is always telling you about those VIP passes she got to the movies, or how her mom is cousins with the president, it's safe to say your friend's making most of these things up.

, Whether a sibling or parent, a relative is likely to know all of this stuff. Ask nonchalantly by bringing up the suspected lie like this in conversation, ""It's so cool that Adam's play is on YouTube! I can't believe it got 200,000 views!"" Relatives will be honest in most cases on whether or not it is true.


Just remember to be a courteous house guest instead of focusing all of your time on this.  If you do this more than a few times, though, they will probably get suspicious of you and think you're trying to accuse your friend.

, Everyone has certain ""tells"" which are certain ways they act when they are lying. Learning to recognize tells can help you distinguish fact from fiction.

, Say something like ""Cool"" as if you don't fully believe them (without being sarcastic) and switch to a different topic abruptly. If they immediately go back to the topic or tell you that they're not making it up, they're probably lying. Make it subtle that you don't believe them, so they'd have to be looking for it. Defensiveness is one of the telltale signs that someone's lying.

,  While everyone's got quirks and friendships are about accepting both the good and the bad, if you feel your relationship is completely built on lies, it may be time to let go. If you are in a bad relationship but want to give your friend a second chance, tell them respectfully what they are doing that makes you so upset, rather than being passive aggressive, which will get you absolutely nowhere.

, There must be a reason for why they're constantly lying to you. Are they bullied in school? Do they have a hard time making friends? Are they jealous of your looks or your house or your significant other? All of these things (and more) can lead to a friend lying. Understand that your friend isn't perfect and they, like you, make mistakes.

, While having a friend who lies can be annoying, frustrating, and even hurtful, understand that you probably lie as well. Even little ""white lies"" can be harmful. You're probably feeling the same way! Trying to lie to your friend as little as possible makes the relationship much more meaningful, and makes them lie less to you.

, Lines such as ""You're one of my closest friends, and we'll be friends forever, but sometimes, I get the feeling that you lie."" are good. Try to mention yourself and the fact that you lie too, sometimes, and you're working on not lying, but don't mention yourself too much. Make sure to have a rebuttal against some arguments your friend is sure to give.

, Make sure to keep your voice even toned and not to get mad. Listen to what your friend has to say, but don't let the discussion become all about things you've done wrong. If your friend wants to discuss that with you, he/she can create a time, just like you did.


Remind your friend that you're not angry, you merely want to talk so that this happens less. Make sure to go about the discussion in a mature way so your friend can fix their actions.

, Let your friend know that you don't like being lied to in a respectful tone, even if they raise their voice. Try not to be super accusatory, or your friend will become defensive and angry. Ask them why they lie to me, and let them know that you don't fall for it, it only makes you feel stupid because they think you will fall for it.

Reflect on why you lied.,
Decide if you want to post a letter or send an email.,
Make an outline.,
Write a first draft.,
Be concise.,
Take a break.,
Re-read and edit your letter.,
Draft a final copy and send it.",How to Confess to Lying2," If you keep a journal, try writing about the lie in an entry that questions your motives and what impact the lie has had on you and others. Writing as a means of personal reflection has been shown to have multiple mental and emotional benefits, and it can be one of the best ways to understand yourself better and organize your thoughts.No journal? No problem! Open up a Word doc on your computer and do a free-write, or jot down some ideas in an old school notebook. If you have a personal blog, try writing about the lie in the blog.
If you see a therapist regularly, you can ask for their help in thinking about the problem.

, Think about what would be best for the person you are communicating with rather than what feels most comfortable to you. While it used to be thought that email is an inappropriate mode for conveying serious emotions or problems, it has since become widely acceptable as a suitable medium for both casual communications and serious discussions. That being said, mailing a real letter can be a special gesture as it shows effort and respect.


If you don’t have the person’s email or postal address, try checking with friends for a way to get in touch.
Don’t write a letter by hand if you have messy handwriting. You’re already asking someone to read your confession and apology; you don’t want to additionally ask them to puzzle over your handwriting.

, Once you’ve thought about your actions, think about what you want to say in your letter and how you want to say it. Put these thoughts into a structured outline so that you won’t get off track in the course of writing your letter.


Your outline should be no more than one page. Write just one bullet or the topic sentence for each paragraph and then fill in the surrounding text later., Flesh out the points on your outline so that you have at least three full paragraphs. The first should explain what you lied about and why you’re writing the letter. The second should express your remorse for your actions and an apology. The third should express the hope that your apology helps in some way but also clarifies that you don’t expect to be forgiven.You can (and should!) include more specific and personal details in your letter, but don’t stray too far from the simple formula of disclosure, apology, and conclusion.

, Your letter can be elegantly written but it shouldn’t be overly verbose. Too many words will dilute the impact of a clear, direct, and responsibility-acknowledging apology., We’ve all impulsively fired off an email or text when we were emotional, and most the time it doesn’t end well. More often than not, we find ourselves regretful of the rash missive because, even if you stand by its intent, you ultimately deem its timing or language as less than optimal.So take a lesson from your past and set your letter or email aside for a night.


If you’re writing an email, save it as a draft but don’t enter the addressee yet. This will ensure that you don’t mistakenly send the email before it’s all prepared.
If you’re mailing a letter, wait to buy the stamps you need until the next day so that, even if you get the urge to send it off right away, you won’t be able to apply the necessary postage.

, Find some time the next morning or afternoon to review your letter. You’ll be able to fix any overlooked typos or awkward phrases and, more importantly, your fresh perspective will allow you amend bigger problems like rationalizing language or sentimental, mealy-mouthed platitudes.


If you have a close, trusted friend who knows the situation, think about reading your letter to them and asking for their feedback., It can be tempting to edit something to death as a way of delaying the ultimate, scary step of pressing ‘Send’ on your email or dropping your letter in the mailbox. At a certain point, though, you need to accept your final draft and send it on its way. The sooner you do so, the sooner you can begin to move on.

Consider obtaining the services of a mediator.,
Choose a mediator.,
Meet with the mediator to explain your goals.,
Have the mediator set an appointment for the mediation.,
Be punctual and calm.,
Approach the meeting with an open and positive mindset.,
Let your mediator guide the discussion.,
Walk the talk.",How to Confess to Lying3," If you want to confess your lie and apologize in a face-to-face conversation, but you’re worried that you don’t have the emotional control or wherewithal to facilitate the discussion, you can hire a trained professional to assist you.If you’re in school or college, your institution might provide a free counseling service that performs conflict mediation and relationship counseling. Look over your school’s website for information about this possibility, or talk to an administrative official who can direct you to the right place.

, Whether you are taking advantage of a free service offered by your university or paying an independent professional, base your decision on a variety of factors including cost, personal compatibility, and convenience.Feel free to consult with a few different mediators before you choose one.
Fees for therapists who perform mediation vary significantly, so get a written quote before you commit to one.Make sure the party you choose is a disinterested party and trained in conflict resolution. Even if your parent or relative wants to help and thinks they can be objective, they are only a good option if they are a lawyer or therapist, or if they have completed some kind of conflict resolution training.Even if you like the looks of a mediator, take a little time to review the counselor’s client feedback on sites like Yelp or Better Business Bureau. This is particularly important because some states don’t require professional mediators or conflict resolution counselors to possess a special license or affiliation in order to practice, so you’ll need to do your own research to make sure you’ve found a good one., Before carrying out the conflict mediation, you should sit down with the mediator you’ve chosen in order to explain your situation, needs, and objectives for the session. The mediator can also inform you about the procedure and give you some helpful tips to prepare.Remember that your mediator is a valuable resource and can refer you to a long-term psychological professional if you’re interested. Seeing someone regularly can help you work on living more honestly and avoiding similar mistakes in the future.

, Your mediator can extend an invitation to the person you want to talk to and find a time that works for both of you.


If you work or study full-time, you should try to make the appointment for after work rather than during lunch. This will help avoid distraction and work-day stress., Arriving on time and with the right mental approach is crucial to the success of your mediation.Don’t drink coffee or alcohol before your meeting as these can make you jumpy or overly emotional.

, Gather your thoughts before the session and make sure you keep your emotions in check.Try meditating, drinking green tea, or doing relaxing exercises like yoga or controlled breathing beforehand. A centered mindset will help you organize your thoughts and be a better participant in the mediation.You can also try visualizing the meeting going well to calm your nerves and make sure you approach it with an open mind.

, Instead of jumping right in and confessing, have your mediator set some ground rules and facilitate the discussion.


When it’s your turn, admit your lie as clearly and concisely as possible. Use “I-statements” to avoid sounding accusatory or blame-shifting.
When it’s your friend’s turn, listen attentively. Chances are, you haven’t understood or considered their side as much as you could have, so listening to your friend will provide you valuable insight.Practice active listening as well. Provide nonverbal indicators that you are paying attention and repeat back what you hear them saying in your own words.

, Show that your confession and apology were sincere by changing your ways and being more honest in the future. You can't guarantee you'll be forgiven, but you can improve your integrity and character in any case.

Pay attention to problems happening at school or work.,
Consider your loved one’s money habits.,
Look at their physical appearance.,
Watch for the signs of drug addiction.,
Be aware of how different drugs affect behavior.",How to Tell if Someone Is Lying About Using Drugs1," This may include suddenly missing more work than usual, losing interest in a career or failing grades in school subjects that would normally not be challenging to the person at all.While missing work or school can be a sign of drug use, sometimes spending too much time working can also be a sign there is drug use occurring. It is not unusual for some adults to start using drugs as a way to add more awake time to the day, so suddenly working nearly non-stop can point to a substance problem.
Friends at school or work may also change if there is a new drug problem. Your loved one may no longer want to see anyone socially due to fear of being caught. Or, they may have made new friends who share the same habit. If it is a change for your loved one to skip happy hour with co-workers not once but every week , this may mean there is something to hide.;
, Sudden changes in spending or missing money can be a sign of a problem they are trying to hide. Even small changes like not being quite as open as they have been in the past about money can mean there is something to hide like a drug or alcohol issue.Changes in money habits can also include a sudden use of credit cards or obtaining new lines of credit when that was not something they did in the past. Overdue bills are another sign that money is being spent on things that are out of the ordinary as well.

, Significant changes in both the physical body as well as mannerism may be a sign of drug use. Take a closer look at your loved one’s appearance. Is something different?Examples of physical changes may include losing weight, facial signs indicating lack of sleep, poor hygiene, and other changes like not keeping hair cut for work or being clean-shaven.
Depending on the drug of choice, they may also suddenly seem like they have endless energy and more movement due to “nervous energy”.
Beyond the physical body, you may also start to notice the same clothes being worn for a longer amount of time than usual. If the drug use includes the use of needles, you may also notice that they often wear long-sleeved clothing year round to hide the arms.

, Things disappearing at home may be a sign that property is being sold or traded for drugs, especially if the person has built up a tolerance to drugs. They may need more and more money to fund the drug use. This may include electronics or other items that are easily sold coming up missing.


Other signs of a problem may include family members noticing prescription drugs coming up missing like pain killers, attention meds or a variety of other drugs.Major changes in sleep patterns including either not sleeping for days on end or the reverse can mean drugs are in play. Certain drugs can cause one to stay awake for several days at a time and then cause a crash that sends one into days of sleeping.

, The previous steps can help you identify general changes in behavior, mood, and appearance that may point to a loved one using drugs. In addition, it is also wise to be knowledgeable about the effects of using specific drugs. For example, use of these drugs may result in the following signs and symptoms:Marijuana: increased appetite, euphoria, dry mouth, memory impairment, and paranoiaCocaine: increased agitation, hyperactivity, cold symptoms, and lowered inhibitionsEcstasy: lowered inhibitions, heightened sexuality, increased energy, tightness in mouth/jaw, increased heart rate, and muscle tensionMeth: increased body temperature, jaw clenching, insomnia, loss of appetite, sweating, and paranoia"

Compare the person's behavior to past behavior.,
Ask unexpected questions.,
Note how much the person says.,
Listen for repeated questions.,
Pay attention to how slow or fast the person is talking.",How to Tell if Someone Is Lying About Using Drugs2," Sudden changes in behavior can be a sign of drug use. Think about how your loved one used to act and how they act now. Subtle changes could indicate they are using drugs.Isolation can be a major sign of drug use. If they are normally outgoing but are suddenly spending a great deal of time alone, this may be to hide a drug problem or due to embarrassment based on the addiction.
Mood swings can be another sign of trouble. Mood swings can occur when they need to maintain a certain level of drug or alcohol in the body to not go into withdrawal. When the level drops below the needed supply, they may sweat, become irritable, feel sick, have anxiety or even become depressed. These can all indicate withdrawal from drugs.Missing important events or just simply disappearing from home or work for random amounts of time can also be a sign that something else is going on.

, Often lies are rehearsed so they sound believable, asking unexpected questions pushes for real answers. Beware of answers that are too vague or go to the other extreme with too many details.For example when you ask your husband why he was late getting home from work, if he tells you he had a “stop to make” without providing any more information, that is a red flag. The same is true if he says he stopped at the grocery store and launches into a ten minute description of each item he bought, who he saw or other details that don’t really matter. This can indicate that he is overcompensating with details to mask a lie.
Also, listen carefully to the answers to see if they really make sense. Are you being told the stop was made on the way home from work but you know there was no work today? Was the stop was at a grocery store but there are no groceries?

, When people are lying, they tend to say only the bare minimum. If the person gives you a short answer to your question, then they may be lying to you.For example, you might expect a detailed explanation if you ask something like, ""Where were you all day yesterday?"" However, if the person is lying then, they might respond with a short explanation such as, ""At the mall.""
If you challenge the person's story, then someone who is lying may still provide few details. However, someone who is telling the truth may provide lots of details to help confirm their story.

, When people are lying, they may also repeat questions to give themselves more time to think of an answer. If you notice that the person repeats every question that you ask them, then this could also be a sign that the person is lying about using drugs.For example, if you ask, ""Have you been using cocaine again?"" then the person might echo this question back to you.

, People who are telling a lie may start out talking really slow to give themselves a chance to think. However, people are also aware that talking slowly is considered suspicious, so after a slow start, the person might start speaking rapidly. Pay attention to these changes in the speed of the person's speech for extra clues about whether or not they are lying."
"
Consider whether your loved one is in denial about a drug problem.,
Determine if the person thinks they are invincible.,
Decide if you have been enabling drug use.,
Know that lies and manipulation are customary to addiction.",How to Tell if Someone Is Lying About Using Drugs3," They may think the drug use is just a good time or nothing to worry about so it might be easy to lie away the behavior. The lies may even start out as a way to somehow protect the person being lied to from worrying or overreacting since they do not see the problems associated with the drug use., Someone who abuses drugs may sometimes believe that they are exempt from the negative consequences of drug use. Often, someone using drugs does not see the full effect the drugs have on the body and one’s health, or the people around them. Your loved one may lie about the behavior because they don't think negative consequences like overdose or legal troubles could happen.The need for the drug often clouds the fear of getting caught buying illegal drugs, stealing to obtain drugs or even taking risky chances in the name of the next high. They may not see things like stealing to sell items to buy drugs as a real crime because they are not physically hurting anyone.
They may also not consider the risks of sharing needles or having sex for drugs with other drug users as a way to get exposed to HIV, Hepatitis or other infections. These consequences of drugs use can be almost shocking to them.
They may also not understand—or want to acknowledge—the strain the drug use puts of personal relationships and family bonds.

, Ignoring a drug problem or finding a way to justify going against a gut feeling of something not being right does not help the situation. This includes giving your teen surplus money without knowing where it’s going, consistently bailing your spouse out of jail after being arrested, or covering for a friend who is using.When you turn your head the other way you are almost condoning the behavior and preventing the person from getting help. Think about your actions and see if there is a chance you have been enabling your loved one to use drugs.

, Accept that being lied to did not happen because you are a bad person or easy to trick. Drug addiction drives the need to manipulate to continue to have access to drugs, and this would be the same for any person coming into contact with the problem.It is not something you caused, nor is it something you should ignore out of shame.

Try to bend the truth instead of making up an entire story.It is much easier for a person to believe something that could actually happen.For example, instead of making up a story about going to a party, you may go to a party but lie about some of the details such as who else went and what you did.
If you went out to eat with your family at a specific restaurant, you may lie and say you went to the restaurant with a date but tell the truth about what you ate.;
, Ask yourself if you would believe the lie that you are telling. If it is hard for you to believe, the other person probably will not believe it either. Place yourself in the other person's shoes and think of the questions they may ask. This will also help you identify any holes in your story.


For example, you probably shouldn't lie about going to a party if your friend knows that your rarely go to them.
Also think about the personality and traits of the person that you are lying to. You know the things that are likely to believe. What works on one person may not work on another., Stand in front of the mirror and practice what you are going to say. If you are not well prepared, you are more likely to make something up on the spot. When you make something up on the spot, it is easier for the other person to notice that you are lying.Consider audio and/or video recording yourself lying. This will help you identify any awkward pauses or mannerisms that you do that may give you away.
The more you can practice the better.If you rehearse a lot, it should feel very natural when you talk to the other person.

, If possible, do not include any other people in your lie. The more people that know you are lying, the more likely you are to get caught. If you do need someone else to cover for you, only tell them what they need to know. Do not tell them your entire plan.

For example, if you are sneaking out of the house to go to a party, do not tell your friend what you are doing. Only tell your friend, “If anyone asks where I was on Friday night, tell them you have no idea.”
If you are lying about who you were out with, tell your friend your location, but do mention the people that were there. This way, your friend could confirm your location without blowing your cover.

, When you lie, there is a tendency to add a lot of extra information and details that you usually would not. The other person may wonder why you are talking so much. Also, you may start to provide details that do not make sense.For example, it is better to say, “I woke up late this morning,” than to say, “I drank coffee to stay up and work on this project last night and then I couldn’t fall asleep. I finally went to sleep and then it was so hard to get out of bed this morning.”
Only answer a question that a person asks you.

, If you do not tell the lie like you believe it, the other person will not believe you either. Believe that you can successfully deceive the other person.If you are unsure of yourself, it will show in your delivery. The other person may be able to tell that you are lying.


If you become anxious while you are lying and the person questions you, have an answer ready.
For example, if the person asks if you are alright or why are you stuttering, tell them, “I’ve just been really stressed by school/work, sorry.”, Telling the truth is natural, but telling a lie requires you to control your natural urge and access your inhibitory control. When you have to use the bathroom, you are activating inhibitory control to not use the bathroom on yourself. Practicing self-control in one area makes it easier for you to control your urge to tell the truth. You will be a more convincing liar if you lie with a full bladder.Drink a lot of water 45 minutes before you plan to tell your lie.
This will only work if you have to pee while you are telling the lie. Practicing self-control earlier in the day will not help you when it is time to tell your lie.

, When you talk, you typically move your body and make small movements. If you stand completely still, the person will notice that something is wrong. If you usually talk with your hands, be sure to use your hands when you are telling your lie.


Avoid covering your mouth, throat, chest, head, or stomach when you are lying. These are all signs that you are not telling the truth., Also avoid making excessive eye contact. You naturally look away and move your eyes around when you talk. Staring at the person without blinking is a clue that you may be lying.

Avoid making awkward head movements as well. People tend to tilt their head to the side or bow their head down when they lie.

, Once you have told your lie, you have to live like it is the truth. This can be hard when you do not remember what you said. After you tell the lie, write down the details of the conversation you had with the person.Write down what you said, any questions they asked, and your response to the questions.


The person may come back and ask you something about the lie you told. You must keep the same story you had before.
Telling the lie is often the easy part. Keeping up with the lie is more difficult.

, Do not leave any evidence behind that you told a lie.Be extra careful with social media. If you lie and say you did something, but your social media says something different, you will definitely get caught.


Avoid using a computer or mobile device to carry out your lie. These things are easy to check and can get you in a lot of trouble.
If you wrote something down, cut up the paper and throw it away.

, Lying requires you to have a good memory. The more lies you tell, the harder it will be to keep up with them. If your brain is required to keep up with multiple lies, you may end up telling on yourself.To cut down on the number of lies you tell, do not lie to multiple people.
Over time, it will be easier for you to remember the lie you told.

, If you get caught lying, it will be harder for people to believe you. You will have a reputation as a liar. People may even assume you are lying even when you are telling the truth.


Plan out your lies and keep them to a minimum.
Tell the truth the majority of the time. It will make you more trustworthy.

, When you get caught telling a lie, you have to continue to lie to cover it up. You will end up telling more lies than you initially planned to. Instead of one, you have now told 5 or 6 lies. In this case, it is best to just confess.


If you confess, you may say, ""I didn't tell the truth about ____. I'm really sorry.""
If you are feeling guilty, confessing will make you feel better."

Perhaps you learned as a child that you could get your way more often if you lied, and you continued the practice as a teenager and beyond as a way to navigate the difficult situations we all encounter in life. Knowing the root cause of your lying is the first step to making a change.


Do you lie as a way to gain control over situations? When you can see a clear path to getting what you want through telling a lie, telling the truth is tough. Maybe you routinely lie as a way to make other people do what you want them to do.
Do you lie as a way to make yourself look better? The pressure to compete inundates us from the moment we are able to comprehend what it means. Lying is an easy way to boost your status at work, in your social circle, and even with your loved onesMaybe you lie as a way to comfort yourself. Telling the truth is often very difficult; it causes tension, awkwardness, and discomfort. Lying to others, and sometimes to yourself as well, prevents you from having to confront uncomfortable situations and feelings.;
, Why stop lying when it makes life so much easier? If you don't have clear reasons for quitting, it's a lot harder to become a more honest person. Think hard about what effect lying has on your sense of self, your relationships, and the course of your life. Here are a few good reasons to stop lying:


To feel like an upright person again. When you lie, you distance yourself from reality. You hide parts of yourself and project something false to the world. Doing this over and over is going to have a negative effect on your sense of goodness and self worth. You deserve the relief of being able to tell the truth about yourself to the world. You are worth getting to know for who you really are. Regaining the ability to take pride in your true identity is probably the most important reason to stop lying.
To connect with others again. Lying to other people prevents true connection from taking place. Good relationships are based on people's ability to share themselves with others. The more you mutually reveal, the closer you get. If you're not able to be honest with other people, it's going to have a negative effect on your ability to make friends and feel truly part of a community.
To gain back other people's trust. Lying may not cause physical harm but when serves to manipulate other people's behavior, it whittles away at their free will and their right to make choices based on truth. If the people you know have caught you in a lie, they'll protect themselves from further manipulation by no longer placing their trust in you. The only way to gain back someone's trust is to start being honest, and continue being honest until they trust your word again. This could take years, so it's a good idea to start now.

, Treat lying as you would any other addiction, make a serious commitment to quit. It's going to require a lot of hard work and thought, so set a date after which you vow to be honest and get a plan in place to help you be successful. Reading this article is a great first step.

, You might feel like you're alone in your quest to stop lying, but there are people who have been through this and can provide support. It's tough to quit any kind of addiction by yourself. Reach out to people who can provide good advice and help hold you accountable to your goal.


Work with a therapist. Talking with someone with a background in psychology and experience helping people who have gone through the same thing will be extremely valuable as you transition from frequent lying to honesty.
Talk to the people you're close to. Certain people in your life will want to help you stop lying, even if they've been hurt before by your dishonesty. If you feel comfortable doing so, tell your parents, siblings, or a close friend about your plan to stop lying, so they can provide some support.
Join a support group. Talking with other people who understand exactly what you're going through is invaluable. Look for an online support group or a group that meets in person in your community.

, To successfully stop lying, it helps to identify the situations, emotions, people, or places that tend to cause you to avoid telling the truth. Once you know what triggers your lies, you can either avoid the trigger or find a way to confront it with honesty.


Do you tend to lie when you're feeling a certain way? Maybe you're anxious about doing well in school or at work, for example, and you lie to temporarily ease that emotion. Figure out ways to handle your anxiety differently.
Do you lie to particular people? Maybe you tell your dad falsehoods instead of dealing with his reaction to your poor grades. You'll have to learn to deal with this particular trigger in a healthier way.

, When you're faced with a trigger and tempted to tell a lie, stop yourself from speaking at all. If you simply can't be honest in the moment, it's better to stay quiet or change the subject. You are not required to answer questions you don't want to answer, or reveal information you don't feel like revealing.


If someone directly asks you a question you don't feel you can answer truthfully, it's fine to tell them you'd rather not answer the question. It might make things a little awkward, but it's still better than telling a lie.
Avoid situations that have typically made you feel you have to say something untrue. Big group conversations in which everyone brags about accomplishments, for example, can stir up the need to ""keep up"" by lying.
Pay attention to the physical symptoms telling you that you are about to tell a lie. You might cast your eyes down and feel your heart beating faster; when you feel this happening, disengage from the situation so you won't tell a lie.

, If you've been lying more often than not, telling the truth really does take practice. The key is to think before you speak, and decide to say something true instead of false. Again, if you're asked a question you can't answer truthfully, don't answer. The more you tell the truth, the easier it will become.


Try practicing with strangers, or in an online forum. Telling the truth to people with whom you don't have a relationship can be freeing, since it has no consequences.
When it comes to people you know, practice being honest by talking about neutral subjects you feel confident discussing. Offer true opinions, or start with basic information about what your plans are for the weekend or what you ate for breakfast.
If you have trouble talking about yourself, discuss the news, local politics, sports, philosophy, business ideas, a recipe you tried, your favorite show, a band you want to see, the other person's life, your dog, or the weather. The point is to practice saying things that are true.

, At a certain point, telling the truth will put you in the type of situation you've always told lies to avoid. You'll have to own up when you didn't follow the rules, or reveal that you are unemployed, or confess that you didn't get the part for which you auditioned, or tell someone you aren't actually interested in a relationship. Facing the uncomfortable consequences is still better than lying; because it strengthens your character and builds trust with other people.


Prepare to deal with other people's reactions. Maybe hearing the truth causes someone to make a negative comment or have a reaction you don't like. Even if this happens, you can be proud that you told the truth, and know you're dealing with problems with strength and honesty instead of using the easy way out.
Work on building trust with people who may not believe you at first. If you've been caught lying a lot to a particular person, it may take a while before they believe that you're telling the truth. Keep working at it, since the only way in the world to gain back trust is to keep being honest. The next time you tell a lie, you're back at square one.

, As you get into the habit telling the truth, the patterns in your thinking that lead to lies will become more apparent. It's important to stay aware of what tempts to you lie so that you won't slip back into the habit of lying.


Learn how to disrupt the patterns by addressing anxiety at its root. If you're faced with a life event that is making you anxious, and about which you don't feel comfortable telling the truth, learn how to deal with your anxiety in a different way.
Don't be too hard on yourself when you slip. Being honest is difficult, and we all slip from time to time. Remember that there's only one way to correct the problem: don't lie. Keep being honest. Don't let the pattern take over your life.

, Honesty is a character trait that is highly valued across cultures and societies. It's a quality that is honed through the hard work of being strong in difficult situations year in and year out. Let truth, rather than lies, become your automatic response when you're faced with the trials of life.


Recognizing honesty in other people can be helpful when you're trying to live an honest life. Who do you admire? Ask yourself what he or she would do or say if you're having trouble coming up with the most honest approach.
Seek out other honest role models - spiritual leaders, honorable characters in literature, philosophers, leaders of social movements, and so on. Everyone fails to be honest sometimes, but honorable people pick themselves up keep trying to do the right thing with every challenge.

, The more you tell the truth and are accountable to the expectations of other people, the more they'll trust you. It feels good to be trusted by other people. Trust leads to great friendships, intimate relationships, and a feeling of belonging. It banishes loneliness and creates community. When you stop lying, you gain the freedom to be yourself and be accepted by others for who you really are.

A person may spin an elaborate lie, but they may be giving the lie away by their body language.",How to Detect Deception2,"


A person who is lying will be trying to focus on the lie, and will probably be focused on not giving anything away, so any movements they do will be short, and stiff. Body movements will be directed towards the person, for example, the movement of the legs will always be towards the person. If standing, the person may move backwards. This is because they will be trying to make themselves ""smaller"".
Hand movements may be to touch the nose, and/or throat/mouth. This is because a person who is lying may be feeling quite tense, and as such will feel dry in the throat, get itchy on the nose etc. If a person looks thirsty, and makes gestures like licking their lips this can be a good indicator of a lie.
The person may be unable to make eye contact with you because they feel that their eyes will give themselves away.
Another good indicator is when the person being questioned will move stuff between the person who is questioning them, and themselves. This will be to create a sort of 'shield' between them, to create a sort of buffer/shield between the two.;
"
"
Conversation is a good way to judge if the person you are conversing with is lying.",How to Detect Deception3,"


A person who is lying will be worried about silence, and as such will try to fill it with questions, or different topics. This could lead to peculiar questions, that seem out of character for the person.
The person may simply reconstruct any question you ask them into a question. For example; Questioner: ""Did you see my black dog, Jimmy?"" The liar will most likely respond with something like: ""No, I did not see your black dog, Jimmy.""
Does the person speak in a monotone? If so they may be preoccupied with keeping up the lie, and as such will be to busy to focus on tone, and dynamics in the voice.
Sentences may be confusing, grammatically incorrect, or simply just wrong, because the person is focusing on topic rather than pronunciation and grammar.
A good indicator of a liar is to monitor if they use pronouns. To see if the person is holding a deception, try to change the topic suddenly. The liar may suddenly show happiness, or relief at the fact that the topic has been changed away from the deception.

"
"
There are a few other things that always give away deception.",How to Detect Deception4," These can come in a variety of manners.


Look For Micro-expressions. These are expressions on the face that flash quickly on their face showing for a brief second their true emotion.
A person may cough, sneeze, or rub their nose during a period when a lie is being told. This will occur quite frequently if the person is constructing a lie, especially if it is on the spot
The liar may even use sarcasm or humour, especially if pressed about the lie. This is an attempt to change the topic away from the topic of the lie.

Admit you have a problem.,
Realize why you lie.,
Understand.,
Be the new you.,
Own it.",How to Stop Telling White Lies," It may sound cheesy, but it is a problem. Admit to whoever you have told lies to that you've lied to them, and you're trying to kick your habit of lying.;
, There are many reasons why someone would tell a lie. Maybe you were embarrassed, scared, or did it for gain, to get more friends, or be popular, or just out of a habit. Run the list through your head of all the reasons you lie.

, If you lie because you are embarrassed, realize that everyone has that feeling. Lying makes it worse, and you have to tell lie after lie to cover up those white lies until you are buried so deep in lies that you can't get out. What's more, in the end you'll still be embarrassed. Lying to get gain is a little different. If you feel like everyone hates you, or that you have no friends, talk to a close friend or family member, or even the school counselor. They'll tell you lying about yourself, your family, and your possessions is not wise.

, Make a promise to yourself that you will not tell white lies. Begin with, say, a week. So, you will not tell a lie for a week. If you pass that goal, make a new one: two weeks. Keep going and going with your goals, until you've completely stopped lying.

, To change any habit first of all you have to accept it completely. So own that fact that you have a lying problem and don't feel embarrassed about it and the work towards changing it."

Cut out the behavior that you feel you must lie about.,
Disclose anything that you would want to know.,
Avoid abstractions.,
Be honest about who you are.,
Be direct.",How to Stop Telling Lies of Omission1," Take some time to reflect on all of the lies of omission that you have told to others lately. Try making a list and seeing what connections you can make. Perhaps there is some negative behavior that you have allowed to have a stronghold in your life. Work to eradicate this behavior.


For instance, when your spouse asks about your day, you might neglect to mention that you have lunch daily with a coworker who you flirt with. Cease having lunches or alone time with this person so that you don’t have any bad information to omit to your partner.;
, In taking some time to reflect on the things you have lied about to others, think about the things that you would like to know were you in their shoes. Perhaps you are having more than the one drink per day that you told your wife you have. Consider if you would want to know if she were drinking more heavily than you thought and use this as an incentive to be more honest., One other way to begin telling the full truth to others is to avoid speaking vaguely. Rather than using abstract language, answer questions fully without being overly detailed. For instance, if you were asked what you did that day, don’t just say that you went to work. Talk about how you got a promotion, had an argument with a coworker, or missed a project deadline.Honesty will help bring you closer to others.
Know that you also don’t have to tell people things just because they ask. You can simply say “I prefer not to talk about it with you.”

, Allow people to get to know you, flaws and all. Know that many of the mistakes that you make, others make as well. Avoid protecting yourself with lies and give others an opportunity to be honest with you about themselves, as well.For instance, perhaps your professor made an error on your exam costing you a few points and you tell people that you failed the course. If you neglect to tell however that you missed half of your classes that semester, you are lying by omission.

, Sometimes, you might lie by omission because you are spending too much time on minor details of an event rather than focusing on larger, more important things. Begin being more direct and avoid beating around the bush when disclosing something to someone. The more you delay the truth, the less likely you are to tell it.For instance, if you got a traffic ticket that day and are avoiding telling your mom or partner, instead of chatting endlessly about other details of your day, address that first and admit to your guilt.

Look for pursed lips.,
Notice if they shield their eyes or mouth.,
Watch for nervous fidgeting.,
Watch the movement of their eyes.,
Consider how they speak normally.,
Watch for impersonal distancing.,
Look for long-winded responses.,
Watch their manner when speaking.,
Ask probing questions.,
Consider previous behavior and offences.,
Ask the suspected liar for help.",How to Spot a Lie," When a person lies, their mouth usually becomes dry at the same time as a result of the anxiety and nervousness from lying. In response to this, the liar might purse their lips or make a sucking motion.If you see white on their lips, it’s an indicator that they are pursing their lips and may be lying.;
, Our brains subconsciously give away little clues through our behavior when we lie. For example, it is common for people to cover their mouths when they tell a lie or to hide their eyes from the person they are lying to.If a person puts their hand in front of their mouth, this can be an indicator of a lie.
The most common way that someone shields their eyes is by closing them. This doesn’t include normal blinking – but prolonged eye closing counts.

, Liars often have a spike in anxiety levels because they are nervous about hiding the truth and being caught in a lie. The body feels the need to dissipate this anxiety and it often manifests in nervous fidgeting of some sort.This can include grooming gestures like pulling your hair behind your ear, adjusting your tie, or straightening your skirt.It can also include hand to face motions like pulling on your ear, wiping your forehead, or adjusting your glasses.
Additionally, this might manifest as tidying up the area around you like straightening the pencil on the desk in front of you, repositioning your phone, or moving a glass of water.

, When people are lying, the brain often gives little indicators through the eyes because the person is uncomfortable or anxious about the lie. Watch for rapid blinking or eyes darting back and forth as signs of lying.Eyes darting back and forth indicate that a person feels trapped and they are looking for a way out – this could be both physically (they want to get out of the room and get away from the situation causing them to lie) and emotionally (they want to get out of telling the truth).
People blink about once every ten seconds. If someone blinks more frequently than that, it could be an indicator that they are lying – especially if they blink 5 or 6 times rapidly in a row.

, If a person usually speaks slowly and deliberately but they are talking very quickly and jumbling their words, it’s probably a sign that they are lying. Watch for changes in verbal behavior as a sign of lying.If you are trying to determine if a person is lying and you don’t know them very well, try asking them some questions that you know the answer to (like their name or profession) to gauge how they speak normally. Then ask them about the thing you think they might be lying about.
A person’s normal behavior in low-stress conditions is called their “baseline.”

, People who lie typically try to distance themselves from the lie. This means that they typically refrain from using personal pronouns about themselves like “I,” “me,” or “mine.” Sometimes they will have to use these words in normal speech, but watch for decreased usage compared to how they normally speak.Liars might also use “him” and “her” instead of people’s names more frequently.

, Sometimes people who lie give indirect, long-winded responses to straight-forward questions that could have received a simple answer. Rambling is a sign of nervousness that often occurs when someone is lying.Of course, you should consider the person’s normal manner of speaking. Some people just ramble when they speak normally. So keep this in mind.

, The liar will seem nervous, speak quite quickly, and want to change the subject or leave as soon as they can. They may get defensive if you repeatedly ask them probing questions such as ""Are you sure?"" and ""Is that the complete truth?"" because they want to deflect attention away from the lie.

, The more questions you ask them, especially questions requiring depth and detail, the more uncomfortable they will become because they will have to make up more and more. They may contradict themselves or lead themselves into a trap.It is very hard to completely fabricate a detailed story on the spot so look for chinks in their armor. If you really give them the third degree they might even eventually crumble and admit they are lying (though don't rely too heavily on this happening).
Ask them several times to explain the sequence of events. This is very hard to keep straight for someone who is lying and it is likely they will make a mistake.
Ask them small details about the thing they’re lying about – like what color their shirt was or how they felt when they saw someone.

, If the person you suspect of lying has lied before, they are more likely to be lying now. Think about how the person would normally act in this situation and compare it to their suspected lie. Try reflecting on the kind of excuses they have come up with for specific situations in the past.For example, if you are a teacher and you think your student is lying about why they haven't done their homework again, compare their excuse to previous excuses to see if they always tend to be elaborate, far-fetched, or related to a particular reason.

, If you’re having trouble figuring something out, an honest person will help you brainstorm to come up with an answer. A liar will not want to give you any more details or information than they are required to.Try asking questions like, “Can you think of anyone else who might have had access to this computer?” If the person tries to help you figure out another possibility, they are probably telling the truth. But if they say they have no idea or react negatively/aggressively, they are likely telling a lie.

Pause when you are thinking of omitting something.,
Practice in the mirror.,
Accept that the truth is less messy.,
Admit when you lie.",How to Stop Telling Lies of Omission2," Work on deautomatization your lies. Perhaps you have become so accustomed to omitting the truth that it has become almost second nature to you. When you are thinking of lying, take a few seconds to pause. Take as much time as you need to gather the courage to be fully honest.Perhaps you will even need to excuse yourself for a few moments until you feel ready to be honest. Simply say “Hold on for one moment, I’ll be right back.”

, If you will soon have to discuss something that is uncomfortable for you with someone, try practicing in the mirror beforehand. This will help you become more comfortable with the truth and prepared to be honest.Look in the mirror and practice saying something like “Jenny, I was fired today because I was late on several assignments. I was irresponsible with them and it cost me my job.”

, Once you tell one lie by omission, you will typically always have to tell more. If you tell the truth, you will never have to try to remember what story you told or worry about others telling the truth for you. Be honest so that you don’t get caught up in a web of lies.For instance, if you don’t tell your partner about hanging out with an ex, know that that doesn’t mean that your ex won’t tell someone or that someone didn’t see you. You run the risk of your partner finding out through someone else, which will make you look dishonest and untrustworthy.

, Know that during this process of being more honest, you will not be perfect. You may slip up and neglect to tell important information or you may outright lie about some things. However, there are ways to rectify and correct your lies. Confess immediately once you omit something or lie. Though the person may be upset, at least they will know the truth.Say something like “Hey babe, I know yesterday I told you that I went to the mall, and that was true, but I got a guy’s number when I was there. I already deleted it from my phone, but I wanted to apologize both for doing that and for not telling you sooner.”

Pick the right time to talk.,
Find healthy and thoughtful ways to express yourself.,
Be calm when others tell you the truth.,
Surround yourself with people who are understanding.,
Keep your promises.",How to Stop Telling Lies of Omission3," You can create an environment conducive to honesty by first choosing the right time to talk. Don’t want until very late at night or early in the morning to tell someone something that could upset them. Instead, tell them when you both have time to talk.


If this person is your spouse or parent, avoid doing so when they first arrive home. Give them some time to settle in before having a difficult conversation.

, Perhaps having a face to face conversation disclosing something bad that you did is a bit hard for you right now. This does not mean, however, that you should neglect to tell the truth. If you cannot have a face to face conversation, try writing a letter or sending an email until you can build up the courage., When others tell you uncomfortable truths, don’t blow up in anger with them for whatever wrong they have done. Approach the situation with calmness and patience. The same negative energy that you put in when you are honest is often what others will give back to you.This does not mean that you don’t have the right to be angry, but avoid expressing that anger is harmful ways. Don’t yell, curse, or repeatedly bring the issue up.

, Some people you will find may place impossible standards upon you. While this is still no reason to lie, know that many do not encourage the truth because their expectations are beyond reason. Avoid such people and find people who will love and respect you


For instance, perhaps you have a coworker who you are strictly friends with and your partner does not like it because they are overly jealous. If you know there is no flirtation and has never been a relationship between the two of you, don’t feel the need to lose this friend because your partner cannot control themselves.

, In addition to letting go of lying by omission, you should also work to keep any and all promises that you make to others. Avoid making promises that you may be unable to keep. After you have lied to people, they will not have much trust in you, and in order to build that back up, keep your word to others.

If they shake your hand in an up and down manner, they see you as an equal.If they twist your palm up towards the ceiling or crush it, they see you as inferior.If they present you with their palm facing the ceiling, they see you as superior., There are many other hand gestures that show that a person is either in distress or dishonest. Research has shown, most of these gestures are caused because of natural chemical reactions in the body., Bill Clinton famously touched his nose 88 times, when he was being questioned during his Lewinsky testimony.,, You can learn a lot about a person by studying their eye movements. We, as human beings, are hard wired to look in certain directions, depending on what we are thinking about. This information is based off numerous research studies and specifically in a branch of psychology known as neuro-linguistic programming. This is what a person's eyes do when they are thinking:


Up and to the right: Thinking about something that happened visually






Sideways and to the right: Thinking about something they heard






Down and to the right: Talking to themselves






Up and to the left: Constructing or thinking up a lie visually






Sideways and to the Left: Constructing or thinking up a lie orally






Down and to the left: Thinking about something they did. An action they did perform.






Look straight ahead with a haze: Thinking of something that happened visually.






This is true for 75 to 85% of people in the world.What is great to know, is that the other 25 to 15% of people just perform in the opposite manner.So, to find out how a person's eyes work, ask them a few questions that you know will produce truthful answers and study the eyes. With this ability you are well on your way towards becoming a human lie detector.






There are a few more ironclad ways to find out if someone is being deceitful or distress, by watching the eyes. When you meet someone for the first time, the first person to look away is submissive to the other. This is always going to be true.People who lie often will maintain uncomfortable eye contact. By uncomfortable, they will look you in the eyes for 70% or more of the conversation. 50% eye contact is considered normal.Finally, a person's blink rate will increase dramatically during long periods of lying. These are the main clues all experts agree on, concerning detecting a liar through eye analysis.







, When a person is going through long periods of lying they will start to act very oddly.Lying is very hard on a person. They will begin yawning compulsively (body starving for oxygen). They’ll begin having trouble swallowing (dry mouth). And at the worst, they will start moving in a very mechanical way rather than fluidly. Example: When reaching for a cup, they will seem to be moving in a series of steps like they have never reached for anything before.;
, This is also a great sign of distress and dishonesty.People have a hard time controlling their leg movements unless they are paying attention to them exactly. It has been proven that feet will point toward that which they want.So if you are giving a speech and everyone’s feet are pointing towards the door, it’s time to switch topics.

, If you are talking to someone and their face flushes they may be being dishonest or they are might also be distressed. (Note: There are some people who are just naturally shy and flush easily around people.), If a person's physical gestures don’t match with their words, trust the body language to help you detect a liar.

Have before you the image of a person in front of you when you start this tutorial.,
Imagine If that person moves their eyes to THEIR left; this would be to your right.,
Try to think about this from the other person’s eyes.

,
Bear in mind that the eye signals you will read about are not 100% accurate.,
Know that basic questions are unlikely to elicit eye signals.,
Take notice of the eye signals when the topic is important to the other person.,
Consider first the eye signals that look to the left hand side.,
Try out this good tester.,
Consider now the eye signals the right hand side has to offer:


Imagine for a moment you are talking to your friend about your car that you lent to him for the weekend.,
Please note that what you have read may not be 100% accurate and that people vary immensely.,
Remember that just because someone looks to a certain side, this does not automatically mean they are lying or making something up.",How to Spot a Liar by Their Eye Movements," Pretend that you are there talking to them.;
, But you will be doing these directions from the other person’s perspective. So when you read that the person’s eyes are to the left and up, this would mean they would be looking right and up, from your perspective.

,, Only use the person’s eye signals to how they react to what you say or ask them.

, When speaking with someone and you ask them about how their day has been, they usually will reply “Oh, it was fine. How was yours?” You won’t see a lot of eye signals from this; these are almost programmed responses.

, When engrossed in a conversation with someone and the topic you are talking about has some impact on them, or they are fully giving you their attention, you will generally be able to receive unconscious eye signals that will allow you to get a deeper insight into what is going on in the other person’s head.

, The left hand side is predominantly to do with accessing material from your past, like images and sounds:


Imagine for a moment that you are speaking to a friend of yours. You are discussing the plans for the weekend and what you want to do.
You mention to your friend about a new disco that opened recently, downtown.
Your friend looks up and to the left and says to you that he has been there already and that he had a great time.
You ask your friend what the music was like the night he went to the disco.
He looks left, towards his left ear, then says the music was great and he really enjoyed the night out.
So what has popular psychology told us about the responses from the friend?
Well firstly he looked up to the top left. This reaction tells us he is looking up to access images in his memory. This means he is “looking” at images of his time at the disco, a strong suggestion that he is telling the truth. Up and to the left signifies accessing images, therefore it has happened in the past.
Be careful though, as he could be accessing images for “downtown” so make sure you pick your questions carefully. He may say he hasn’t been there and still look left, thinking of “downtown”.
You asked your friend about the music at the disco. He looked left towards his ear. This tells us he is accessing the audio part of his brain and is trying to recall the music.

, Ask your friend to describe to you what their doorbell sounds like. Watch as their eyes move level with their left ear as they access the audio part of their brain. Even if they don’t have a doorbell they will still look left, looking for a sound that they may have had.

,
He hands you the keys and doesn’t mention anything about the smashed headlight.
You ask him about it and he looks to the top left. This suggests he is looking for images to associate with the smashed headlight. He then immediately looks to the top right. Now you await his response.
He tells you someone must have reversed into him at the supermarket and driven off.
Looking to the top right suggests the creation of images. This is a strong indication that he is lying to you.
Bear in mind that your friend may not react in this way, as he may have had a lot of time over the weekend to conjure up an excuse. In this case, always try to ask something that they may not necessarily be unaware of, like were they smoking in your car, as there is a cigarette hole in the seat. See how the eyes move!
Next take a look at creating sounds; yes, you guessed it. Looking to the right ear is a strong indication your test subject is creating a sound.
There aren’t any strong examples that can be used in this context, only that you should be aware of it happening.
You could try asking your friend to imagine a really loud noise, the loudest noise they could ever imagine, and watch their eyes move.

, This can be used as a guide only, to help you with your investigations.

, They may be a nervous person, easily distracted, have seen something to their right or whatever the case may be. So be careful if you are going to accuse anyone of telling fibs!

Take an acting class.,
Take a debate or public speaking class.,
Establishing similarity You can do this by method called 'pacing', where you can mirror their body language,your intonation pattern and so on.,
Be charismatic.,
Learn from the masters.,
Learn to read people.",How to Manipulate People1," A big part of manipulation is learning how to master your emotions and make other people receptive to your contrived feelings. If you want to know how to appear more distressed than you really are, or to use a variety of other emotional techniques to get your way, then taking an acting class is a perfect way to improve your powers of persuasion.


Don’t tell other people that you’re taking an acting class if you’re only doing it to learn how to manipulate people. Otherwise they’ll grow even more suspicious of your tactics instead of believing you.;
, While acting classes can help you master your emotions and convince others that you’ll be very distressed if you don’t get what you want, taking a debate or public speaking class will help you learn how to convince people to give you what you want in a calm and rational manner. Not only will you learn to organize and present your thoughts in a more constructive way, but you’ll also learn techniques for making your needs sound very convincing.

,


The calm and persuasive method is great for convincing your boss or coworkers to do something. Being emotional may not work in a professional setting.

, Charismatic people have a natural tendency to get what they want. If you want to manipulate people, then you need to work your charisma. You should be able to smile and light up a room, have approachable body language to make people want to talk to you, and be able to hold up a conversation with absolutely anyone, from your nine-year-old cousin to your history teacher. Here are some other ways to be charismatic:


Make people feel special. Make eye contact when you talk to them, and ask them about their feelings and interests. Show them that you really care about getting to know them—even if you don’t.
Exude confidence. Charismatic people love who they are and what they do. And if you have faith in yourself, then people will be much more likely to take you seriously and to give in to your needs.
Be confident when you say something whether it's true or just another creation. Try to be glib while speaking out with your subject.

, If you have a friend, family member, or even an enemy who is a master manipulator, you should study this person and even take notes to see how he always manages to get what he wants. This will give you new insight into how to manipulate people, even if you end up getting tricked in the process.


If you’re really committed to learning how to manipulate people, then you may even find yourself equipped with the skills to manipulate one of the people you’ve been studying.

, Every person has a different emotional and psychological makeup and is therefore manipulated for different reasons. Before you start plotting your latest manipulation scheme, take the time to study the person you want to manipulate to understand what makes him tick and to see the best approach for getting this person to bend to your needs. Here are some different things you may find when you read people:


Many people are susceptible to emotional responses. These people are emotional themselves, cry at movies, love puppies, and have strong powers of sympathy and empathy. To get them to do what you want, you’ll have to play to their emotions until they feel sorry for you and give you what you want.
Other people have a strong guilt reflex. Some people were raised in a restrictive household where they were punished for doing every little thing wrong and now go through life feeling guilty about everything they do. With these people, the answer is obvious—make them feel guilty for not giving you what you want until they give in.
Some people are more receptive to the rational approach. If your friend is very logically minded, reads the news often, and always needs facts and evidence before he makes a decision, then you’ll have to use your calm persuasive powers to get what you want instead of using your feelings to manipulate him.

Follow an unreasonable request by a more reasonable one.,
Make an unusual request before your real request.,
Inspire fear, then relief.,
Make the person feel guilty.,
Use bribery.,
Play the victim.,
Use logic.,
Don’t break character.",How to Manipulate People2," This is time-tested tactic for getting what you really want. It’s simple. If you want to manipulate someone, you should first make an unreasonable request, wait for the person to reject you, and then follow it up by a more reasonable request. It will sound much more appealing to your victim in comparison to the first request as used by salesperson.For example, if you want your employee to come in early the next day, just say, “Would you mind leading the new project? You’ll just have to come in to work two hours early for the next few months.” When your employee shakes his head, just say, “Oh, all right. But would you mind coming in early tomorrow to help me wrap up this report?” He’ll be much more receptive after the first request.

, Another way to ask someone to do something for you is to make an unusual request that throws the person off guard so much that he can’t think to say no. If you ask for the usual request right away—money, a ride, help with homework—people will be more likely to say no because their minds have been conditioned to avoid these tasks. For example, if you want to ask someone on the street to sign a petition, you can first ask that person to help you tie your shoe because you sprained your back and can’t bend down. This will establish a relationship with the person and will make him less likely to turn you down when you ask him to sign the petition.

, If you want to get what you want, you can first make a person fear the worst, be relieved, and then be happy enough to grant you whatever you want. This is a mean little trick but it’ll get you results.For example, you could tell your friend, “You know, when I was driving your car, I heard the most terrible noise and was sure that your engine died. But then I realized it was just coming from the radio—isn’t that funny?” Pause and wait for your friend to recover before you say, “Which reminds me—do you mind if I borrow your car again over the weekend?”

, Guilt is another excellent tactic to getting what you want if you’re manipulating the right person. First, pick someone who is prone to feeling guilty already. Then make that person feel like he’s being a bad parent, friend, or boyfriend for not giving you what you want, no matter how ridiculous it is.


If you want your parent to feel guilty, just make him feel that your life or childhood is suffering because he’s not letting you have enough experiences.
If you want your friend to feel guilty, remind him of all the great things you’ve done for her, or casually mention all the times she’s let you down.
If you want your boyfriend to feel guilty, just say, “It’s okay—I expected this,” thus making him feel like he always lets you down.

, Bribery is another great way of getting what you want. You don’t have to blackmail someone to use this trick to achieve your goals. You can even bribe someone with a reward that isn’t so appealing, or with something that you would do anyway. For example, you can ask your friend for help studying for the math test, and offer her a ride to class in exchange, even if you’ve given her a ride before and it’s no big deal.


Figure out what the person wants and try to give it to her. If your friend has a crush on the new guy in school, promise that you’ll try to get his number if she does what you want.
Don’t make it obvious that you’re bribing. Just make it seem like you really want to do something nice for that person in return.

, Playing the victim is a great way to get what you want as long as you don’t overdo it. This is a great tactic that should be used sparingly, but which will pierce the heart of your victim when done in the right way. Just act like you’re a wonderful, altruistic person, and that all of the evil in the universe has somehow fallen upon you.


Play dumb. Say, “I just don’t know what I keep doing wrong.” Make it sound like you’re genuinely baffled by why things never work out for you.
Say, “It’s okay—I’m used to this.” Make the person feel guilty, like you’re surrounded by people who will never help you out.
Be pathetic. If your friend won’t give you a ride across town, say, “It’s okay—I’ll just walk. I could use the exercise.”

, For the rational-minded people in your life, logic is the great persuader. Come armed with at least three results-oriented reasons for why the thing you want would benefit you and even the person you’re asking. Talk calmly and rationally as you present your case and don’t lose your cool. To reach a rational person, you have to keep emotion out of it or you won’t get what you want.


Act like what you want is the only logical thing to do. Make the person feel ridiculous for not seeing it your way without saying so.

, Whatever your method, if your friend, coworker, or significant other calls you out on using a manipulative tactic or for pretending to be more upset than you actually are, don’t ever admit that it’s true. Instead, look even more hurt and say, “I can’t believe you would think that,” which will make the person feel even more guilty and sorry for you.Once you admit to using manipulative tactics, it will be very hard to manipulate the same person again.

Manipulate your friends.,
Manipulate your significant other.,
How easily a person can fall in your hands also depends upon the impression you have on them.Be swift and flexible about your image projection(be deceptive).,
Manipulate your boss.,
Manipulate your teacher.,
Manipulate your parents.",How to Manipulate People3," Manipulating your friends can be a bit tricky since they’ll know you well enough to call your bluff if your manipulation skills aren’t up to par. But don’t worry – you can still get your friends to do anything you want. First, you have to butter up your friend. The week before you need a big favor, be nice, do small favors for her, and try to mention what a great friend she is. Do whatever you have to do to be a model friend without going overboard.


Use your emotions. Your friends care for you, and they won’t want to see you upset. Use those acting skills to look much more upset than you really are.
Remind your friend of what a great friend you are. Be prepared with examples of times when you’ve done amazing things for the sake of friendship.
Lay on the guilt. You don’t have to play the “bad friend” card, but you can casually mention some other times that the friend has let you down. Make it sound like you’re used to this kind of uncaring behavior from your friend without being too accusatory.

, Manipulating your significant other to get what you want doesn’t have to be hard. The most obvious way to do it is to turn him on and then ask for the favor, implying that he won’t be able to get it on if he doesn’t give you what you want. But if you don’t want to take this extreme route, there are a number of more subtle ways to manipulate your significant other.


Whatever your approach, make sure that you look sexy when you make your request. You’ll be more likely to get what you want if your significant other is reminded of how cute or hot you are.

,


Use your emotions. Does your significant other want to see you crying or being very visibly upset? Of course not.
If you really want to get what you want, use the waterworks approach in public. Just as a parent is more likely to give in to a child who is throwing a public tantrum, your man will be more likely to give in if you’re crying in public. Use this technique sparingly though.
Use small bribes. If you really want your man to take you out on a romantic picnic, offer to go to the baseball game with him the next day. Then this becomes less like manipulation and more like ordinary compromise.

, Using the rational and logical approach with your boss will work best. If you show up at your boss’s desk crying or talking about your personal problems, you’ll be more likely to get fired than to get what you’re after. Instead, be logical and firm with your boss, providing concrete reasons for why you need to get what you want.


Try to be a model worker on the week before you make your request. Work a little late, keep a big smile on your face, and even bring in bagels or pastries in the morning “just because.”
Ask in an offhand way. Ask your boss like it’s no big deal, and just casually make the request instead of saying, “There’s something really important I wanted to ask you.” This will alert him that what you’re asking really is a big deal.
Try to ask at the end of the day or during a break. Don’t talk to your boss at the beginning of the day, when he’s stressed out by all the work he has to do. Instead, ask him when he’s about to leave for lunch or go home at the end of the day—then he’ll be more likely to grant you the request than wasting his free time arguing with you.

, To manipulate your teacher, you have to mix professionalism with a bit of emotion. On the day you make your request, you should try to be a model student. Arrive to class early, show that you’ve done the reading, and be active and engaged in the classroom.


Tell your teacher how great he is without sucking up. Just casually mention how inspiring he is or how much you love the subject matter.
Mention that “a lot of stuff is going on at home.” This will make things awkward and your teacher will feel sorry for you without wanting to know more.
As you continue to talk about your personal life, wait for your teacher to get uncomfortable and offer to give you an extension or to let you rewrite your paper. If this doesn’t happen, start in the negative. Say, “I know you don’t normally give extensions…” and let your voice trail off as your eyes get misty and you look out the window longingly.
If this still doesn’t work, go for the heartstrings. Start crying while being mysterious about the stuff “going on at home” and wait for your teacher to get so uncomfortable that he has no choice but to give you what you want.

, Your parents are supposed to love you unconditionally and are therefore already a lot more susceptible to manipulation. If you have a baseline of love and support, then all you have to do is be a model offspring for a while before you make your request. Don’t miss your curfew, spend time studying, and help out around the house as much as you can. Then, go in for the kill.


State your request like it’s perfectly reasonable. If you want to go to a concert on a school night, casually ask in an offhand way instead of sitting down to have a big talk about it. Make it look like you couldn’t possibly see why your parents would say no.
You can even try asking while you’re folding laundry or doing the dishes. This will remind your parents of what a great son or daughter you really are.
Talk about how all of your friends are doing this thing, and how their parents are okay with it. Don’t make this a big deal.
Make your parents feel guilty. If you wanted to go to a concert, just say, “It’s no big deal. I’ll just get my friends to get me a t-shirt or something after the show.” Make them feel like they’re really making you miss out on a major social or another type of experience. Don’t say, “You’re ruining my life!” If you play your cards right, they’ll reach that conclusion on their own.

Thinking of something amusing can help.
Even forcing a smile can cause you to feel better; just be careful not to let it appear as a smirk!
In some cases, it can help you to smile if you realize that smiling in front of someone who really upsets you can unsettle that person if they want you to be unhappy.;
, Find something funny to watch online or something funny to read that is short and amusing. Or, think of something that makes you happy, whether it is a joke someone recently told, a person that makes you laugh a lot, or a fond memory in general. As with smiling, laughter can help to cheer you up.

,, We all suffer from personal and office problems. Ensuring yourself every time that you are the happiest person is unusual at first but it really helps. Not believing in yourself leads to very harmful diseases and no one wants to live a life which has nothing but suffering from problem until your last breath.

, A lot of unhappy feelings come from feeling overwhelmed about all the things you have to get done. Thinking about them doesn't get them done, so try getting stuck into the things bothering you and in the doing, you will likely start to feel better.

, Tap your pencil on a table, drum your fingers on the edge of your seat, daydream, stretch out, hum quietly. Do whatever you do on your average good day, do on this day.

, Keeping up appearances is a lot of effort and can cause you to feel even less happy. By participating in something you love to do, the feelings that come from being in the flow and enjoying yourself will be genuine and unforced. Give yourself the space and the time to get involved in such things more often and you won't need to pretend to be happy!

, It's a mini vacation and you will discover your own very self. It will help you to grow stronger with your emotions and handling matters which are a bit difficult. Make a personal diary; it can be helpful for sure.

, Sometimes it is just better to stop pretending you're happy and start letting out some of your sadness or anger instead. Talk to someone you trust and vent.

If you think that there is a massive imbalance, this might be a telltale sign that something isn't right for you, whether it's your job, your studies, your relationships or something else. If this is the case, it is time to focus more on the source of your pain and do something constructive about managing, reducing or removing it from your life.

Avoid being accusatory.,
Show empathy.,
Make it seem like the truth isn’t a big deal.,
Tell them they aren’t alone in the blame.,
Offer protection.",How to Make Someone Tell the Truth1," You reduce the chances of getting someone to confide in you if you come off as accusatory. Stay calm and keep your body language neutral. Shouting, banging your fist on a table, and standing with your arms crossed looks intimidating. The person will be more willing to share information with you if they feel like you will understand.


Sit down, if possible, look the person in the eye, and speak in a soft and reassuring tone. Place your hands on your lap, at your sides, or on the table and keep your facial expression neutral.;
, Part of establishing trust is showing the person you understand them and are empathetic to their situation. They will be more willing to tell you the truth if they think you won’t blow up at them. Act like you understand why they would do what they did.


For instance, let's say you catch your son along with a group of peers smoking. You could say “You are denying the fact that you were smoking. But I want you to know I would understand it if you actually were. Sometimes, our peers can pressure us into things we wouldn't normally do.”
Giving the impression that anyone would do what you suspect they did may make it more likely for them to divulge the truth., People are often scared to tell the truth because they are afraid of the consequences. If you minimize the severity of the situation, however, they may be more likely to confess.


You could say, “It’s really not that big of a deal. I just want to know the truth.” Assuring them that the wrongdoing isn’t all that serious may make them tell you what really happened.However, only go this route if the offense is really not a big deal. For example, it would probably not work with something that has legal consequences or jail time.

, Make the person feel like they aren’t the only one being accused. If they have the impression that others may also share the blame—and consequences—of the situation, they may be more willing to tell the truth. They will likely clam up if they think they are going to suffer the wrath all by themselves.


You could say, “I know you weren’t the only one involved. There are plenty of other people who are at fault, too.”, Tell the person that you will do what you can to protect them. Convey to them that you are on their side and will do everything you can to help them. They may open up if their fears are eased."
"
Distinguish between a suspicion and evidence-based accusations.,
Tell a version of their story.,
Change things up.,
Choose your words carefully.,
Bluff, if necessary.,
Avoid physical coercion.",How to Make Someone Tell the Truth2," How you approach the situation depends on how much evidence you have supporting any wrongdoing. You will have to handle situations that are based on strong suspicions differently than you would those with clear evidence.


For suspicions, it's best to present what you suspect in a non-confrontational manner and try to tease out the truth during the interaction.
For evidence-based accusations, you should state your claim and present the evidence that you have. In these cases, there's little room for the person wiggling out of the responsibility.

, Lay out the facts you know by telling the story from your perspective. The person may interject and correct you on part of the story if there’s a detail that is wrong. This may give you a partial confession.


You can also deliberately change part of the story to entice them to correct you. For instance, you could say, “So you went to the bar last night,” even though you believe they went somewhere else incriminating. This may prompt them to correct you, which could lead you to the truth., Ask the same question over again in different ways. Be mindful of them saying the same phrases when answering, as this could indicate they’ve rehearsed what they’re going to say. They may also be inconsistent with their answers, which could show they are lying.


You could also ask them to tell their story starting from the end and leading up to the beginning or ask them to start in the middle. Relaying the story back may cause them to create errors in their story, which could show they aren’t telling the truth., The language you use can play a huge role in whether a person tells you the truth or not. Using language that implies fault may cause the person to withhold. Selecting less harsh words can encourage the person to tell the truth.


For instance, use the word “took” instead of “stole” or “spent time with someone” rather than “cheated.” The person may be more apt to admit guilt if you use more favorable language., Bluffing is a dangerous, yet often effective, tactic. It involves you making a threat or coming out with what you think is the truth, even though you may not really plan to fulfill the threat or have evidence. Your bluff may tempt the person to tell the truth because they feel like they’ve been exposed or are afraid of the supposed consequences.


For example, you could say, “I have witnesses that saw you at the scene of the crime.” This may be enough to scare the person into the telling you the truth. You could also threaten to go to the authorities or someone in power if the person doesn’t stop lying.Keep in mind that verbal threats such as bluffing should only be made if you are certain of the person's involvement or guilt. Also, try to avoid making any sort of threats if at all possible as doing so causes defensiveness, and decreases your chances of getting to the truth.

, If a person stares you in the face and tells you a lie, it may be hard to control your reaction. If you must take a break to collect yourself, do so. But never assault a person or use any physical means to coerce them to tell the truth.

Notice if they answer your question.,
Listen to their voice.,
Watch their body language.",How to Make Someone Tell the Truth3," Evasion is often a hint that someone is lying to you. Trying to change the subject or simply refusing to answer at all is a big clue. Most times a person will talk about anything if they aren’t hiding something., The sound and pitch of a person’s voice will often change if they are lying. Their voice may get higher, they may speak quicker, or you may even be able to hear a quiver in their speech. Any type of change could be a signal they are lying.


You’ll need to become familiar with the person’s voice to know if they are lying. Start by asking questions you already know the answer to and notice the way they sound as they answer. Move on to questions you don’t know the answer to once you’ve become comfortable with their voice. They are likely lying if there are changes in their voice.However, this would not be the case with a pathological liar or sociopath.

, The appearance of a person can dramatically change if they are lying. Not telling the truth makes people nervous and their bodies often act accordingly. Even the smallest change in their behavior may indicate a lie.


For instance, a person may try to hide their mouth or their eyes when they are telling a lie. You may also notice them fidgeting, swallowing more, and clearing their throat excessively. They may also avoid looking you in the eye and laugh nervously."

Rent a luxury car.,
Wear a nice watch.,
Wear a fancy hat.,
Own a designer pet.",How to Make People Think You're Rich1," One of the most powerful symbols of status and wealth is a luxury car. You can appear wealthy by renting a very nice car and driving it to public events. Look into luxury car rental opportunities in your area., Another excellent symbol of wealth is a high-end watch, such as Rolex, Panerai, or Jaeger-LeCoultre. You can gain the air of wealth by shelling out for one these numbers, or by finding a knock-off that looks like the real-deal., Another subtler symbol of money is a high-class hat. For men, this likely means a nice fitted fedora or bowler. For women, this can mean a dress hat paired with a matching outfit. Wear a designer hat confidently to exude wealth., Designer pets are the latest symbols of status and wealth. Generally, this means dogs that have been specially bred to be small, docile, and cute. This includes breeds such as Labradoodle, Puggle, Chiweenie, Goldendoodle, Cavachon, and Chorkie. Be sure to dress your designer dog in a cute outfit when you bring her out!"

Look your best.,
Give yourself a new name.,
Banish “filler words” from your vocab.,
Associate with wealthy people.",How to Make People Think You're Rich2," Maintaining a well-groomed appearance will be pivotal to pulling off this charade of wealth. Be sure to wear clean, fitted, and pressed clothing, groom your hair and nails, and maintain a healthy figure.Don’t worry about dressing in all designer clothes. Look for a few high-end items in resale shops or discount stores, and keep the rest of your staple items clean and pressed.
Have your nails and hair done professionally. Manicured nails and a professionally cut, colored, and styled do is important to propagating the illusion of money.
Hit the gym and watch what you eat. Although true rich people come in all shapes and sizes, you can create envy by looking as hot as possible. Tone your body in the gym 5-6 days a week. Eat vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains.

, Your name has the potential to make you seem like a pauper or a prince. Even just a nickname you go by can convey a lot about your social class. Select a new name or nickname, and begin introducing yourself this way. This is most convenient if you will soon be entering a new social circle.Nicknames that sounds like they belong to baseball players (such as Chuck or Gordy) can actually sound like wealthy names.
Names that sound old-fashioned (like Benjamin, Alistair, or Bernadette) can make it sound like you come from old money.
Think of ways to slightly alter your existing name, such as using Christopher over Chris, or going by your last name.

, Nothing makes you sound low-class like filling your sentences with “like,” “uh,” or worst of all, the “F” word. These words (and others like them) are known as filler words, and they clutter up the talk of the lower classes. If you want to seem rich, work to banish these words from your patterns of speech., Wealthy people tend to travel in packs. Find out where the rich people go and head in that general direction. If you frequent places where rich people are found, you will naturally make connections.Try a country club. If you are going for “old money” consider going for the country club haunt. Unfortunately, you will need to find someone to get you in, so scan your list of wealthy friends and find reasons to hang with them when it’s time to play mixed doubles.
Check out restaurants or clubs. This may take some planning, but securing the “reserved” table or area at a club screams, “I have money!” Reserve the VIP table at the hottest club in town and order Grey Goose and grapefruit juice--the drink of the money gods.
Visit vacation spots. Head off to Club Med, Aruba, Hawaii or the Hamptons: wherever you could possibly catch Megan Fox or Brad Pitt sunning themselves on the beach. You don’t have to stay in a five star hotel, either. Many hot and happening places offer affordable accommodations.

Cultivate knowledge of gourmet food.,
Know your wine.,
Know how to talk about art.,
Bolster your general knowledge.,
Drop some important names.,
Mention people who work for you.",How to Make People Think You're Rich3," Wealthy people tend to enjoy expensive, gourmet food. If you want people to think you are rich, you need to have a pretty good knowledge of these foods. You need to know how to pronounce the names, have a sense of what various foods taste like, and know how to consume them properly. Visit some high-end restaurants in your area, and take a photo of the menu. When you get home, do some internet research to familiarize yourself with several of the dishes., Along the same lines, most wealthy people have a good understanding of wine. Begin to expand your knowledge of fine wines by visiting wineries near you and participating in wine tasting. You can learn a great deal from the sommelier leading the tasting. Visit several different wineries, and begin drinking wine at home., Visiting art galleries and collecting art is a common hobby for the wealthy. You will not need to purchase expensive artworks, but you will need to know how to talk about them. Pick up a beginners guide to art history, as well as a beginners guide to art theory at your local library. Spend some time reading each book. Pick out 3-4 favorite artists, and 2-3 favorite art concepts to memorize. You can use these tidbits to speak about art in an educated way., Although there are exceptions, most wealthy people are well-educated, and they come from well-educated families. This means they can effortlessly converse on a wide range of topics, from history to economics to popular culture. If you want to fit it with the rich kids, you’ve got to be able to keep up in conversation. Purchase or borrow the game “Trivial Pursuit” and begin memorizing factual tidbits. If you find a subject area that appeals to you, do further research to bolster what you know., Dropping little hints in conversation is a perfect, nonchalant way to come off as wealthy. Sprinkle the names of rich and famous people you've come into contact with (celebrities, athletes, or well-known financiers) into conversation. Or mention the names of fancy places (Paris, Dubai, Tokyo). Do you best to sound natural, and be sure to have enough background information on the person/place to answer questions, if asked.

, Wealthy people must hire others to help manage their affairs. These people may be accountants, lawyers, personal assistants, or other types of hired help. Casually mentioning that you are ""waiting to hear back from your accountant,"" or that your ""assistant is picking that up"" lends an air of class and wealth to your personality.

Notice if he is grooming or adjusting something.,
Listen for throat clearing and swallowing.,
See if her hands keep touching her face.,
Watch for lips pressed firmly together.,
Look for decreased blinking.,
Monitor the person’s body movement.",How to Know if Someone is Lying1," Many liars are suddenly distracted by a need to smooth down their hair, align a pen on the desk, or push in a chair at a table. These actions can be indicators that the person is lying., Someone who is lying might clear their throat more frequently or swallow significantly before answering a question., While many liars are not fidgety, they may still bring their hands to their face. Under the stress of fabricating a story, a liar may experience some level of anxiety. This may cause blood to drain from the extremities, including the ears. Sometimes, this can cause tickling or another sensation, and the individual might bring his hands up to touch the ears., Liars often press their lips together more firmly and frequently when not telling the truth.Sometimes, this might indicate concentration, which a liar often has to have in order to fabricate his story.

, Lying requires more cognitive energy, since the liar needs to concentrate harder while exerting mental energy. People tend to blink less frequently when they are expending cognitive energy, so look for decreased blinking if you think someone is lying.


The same can be said for fidgeting. People often fidget less when they have increased cognitive function such as when they are lying., Many people who are lying tend to stand very still. Some attribute this to the body’s reaction to a threatening situation. Similar to the fight-or-flight response, the body stands still, ready to fight."

Listen to the person’s word choices.,
Watch for a deflection.,
Listen for repeated words and phrases.,
Listen for sentence fragments.,
Recognize when the person corrects what she says.,
Look for lack of details in a story.",How to Know if Someone is Lying2," Language in a fabricated story usually becomes more impersonal. The person may decrease the use of first-person words, such as “I,” “me,” and “mine.” The person may avoid using people’s names, instead using words like “him” and “her” with more frequency., , When you are questioning a liar, he may deflect your questions to steer you off-course. He might switch topics altogether, or he might answer your question with a question., Someone who is lying may repeat certain words or phrases. It can seem as though he is trying to convince himself of a lie. It’s also possible that certain phrases or words may be part of his rehearsed lie.A liar might also repeat the question that you ask him, likely trying to buy time to think of a suitable response., Often, liars will start to give an answer to a question and stop. They will then start over or not complete a sentence.This may be an indication that they are already finding holes in their own story and are trying to cover up any mistakes they’re saying.

, Spontaneous corrections occur when the liar is trying to make up and edit the story as it is being told. If you notice that the person is correcting herself often, their story may be fabricated., People who are lying tend to leave out little details that truth-tellers leave in. Minor details are harder to keep track of and remember, so liars usually find it better to omit them.Someone telling the truth might describe the music playing in the background in a certain scenario, while a liar will probably omit this detail. A story will be vague so that she can remember the details she has to say.
A liar might also have inconsistent details, so pay attention to the details of the story."

See if the person’s face fully shows emotion.,
Ask a question the person won’t anticipate.,
Read microexpressions.,
Watch for verbal/non-verbal disconnects.",How to Know if Someone is Lying3," When a person fakes an emotion, his face often betrays him, because he may only show emotion on the upper or lower half of his face. For example, if someone is smiling, see if this emotion carries to his eyes. Similarly, if someone is crying, does this emotion seem consistent with the expression on the lower half of his face?, Many liars have their stories lined up for questions that they anticipate. When you throw them a curveball by asking something unexpected, they might not have an appropriate response.For example, if the person says that he went to eat at a particular restaurant, he might anticipate that you’ll ask about their food, the waiter, and how much the meal cost. But he might not expect a question about where the bathroom was located.

, Microexpressions are very minor facial movements that capture a person’s true feelings. These are fleeting emotions, sometimes lasting for as little as 1/125th of a second.Microexpressions will indicate emotion, but they do not necessarily give you clues as to why the person is feeling that emotion. For example, a lying person might show fear in a microexpression because she is scared she will be caught. But a truthful person might show fear in a microexpression because she is scared that she will not be believed.

, Sometimes a person will say one thing and his body will react in another way unintentionally. For example, he may answer yes to a question, but his head may shake side to side, indicating no.Keep in mind that nonverbal cues vary widely from person to person. What you recognize in one person may not translate to another person."

Know the difference between sarcasm and common jokes.,
Listen to your surroundings.,
Choose a target.,
Think before you act.,
Say the comment.,
Keep that one-of-a-kind poker face.,
Make sure the person understands that the comment you just made was a joke.,
Calmly walk away knowing that you are better than the rest.",How to Enhance Your Sarcasm Skills,"


For those of us who are incapable of understanding the difference between sarcasm and common jokes, they are clearly not up to the level that you are at. Sarcasm uses wit often coming across as the common joke. Common jokes are for those who are incapable of comprehending higher levels of intelligence. If someone were to begin with telling a knock-knock joke, begin to walk away because you are better than they are. So what have you learned? If someone says ""just kidding"" after a joke or begins to laugh at their own joke, clearly they do not understand how to use sarcasm in any shape or form.;
,


In our social world, it is easy to overhear conversations. Half of the time, people feel the need to talk about useful information that they think will interest the people that they are around. False. Really, the people listening to the conversation could care less. In this situation it is important to listen carefully because often, people set themselves up. In this case, it's time for action!

,


If you have followed step two, you are ready for step three. If you find that someone has just set themselves up for a so-called ""burn,"" it's your chance to step in. This is your target. However, if you haven't been listening to a conversation, choose a target that looks the weakest, like the runt of the group. This way, it is easy to make fun of them or blurt out an inappropriate comment. The truth of the matter is, always go for the one that looks like it would be easy to put down.

,


Before you use a witty comment, think before you act. You don't want to look stupid because you already know that you are better than everyone else, so act like it. If you say something stupid, you will look like a fool, but if you say something that was well thought out, you will look like a champion.

,


Now here is your chance to really utilize your talent. When you say the comment have a set tone to your voice, like you could care less what the other person's response will be. Make sure your comment is bitter and ironic. This helps confuse the other person and make them feel uncomfortable.

,


Once the comment has been said, make sure you keep a straight face. If you start to smile, you obviously do not possess the ability that the rest of sarcastic people do. The importance of the face confuses the person hearing the remark who once again becomes uncomfortable in the situation.

,


If you just delivered the remark and you are caught in an awkward stare with the person, explain that it was a joke. If you have to explain it was a joke, you are definitely more intellectual than the other person (but you already knew that). It is necessary to explain the situation, especially when you can tell that the other person is getting upset.

,


Even if the other person did not understand your sarcasm, walk away from them knowing that you are better. Your confidence drives every move that you make. So self-satisfaction will improve your sarcastic experiences for the future.

People who lie a lot, like pathological liars, can’t help themselves and tell a lot of little lies that can easily get them caught. It’s difficult to keep track of a lot of lies and people know that they can’t trust you once you’ve been caught lying several times., Work out all the details prior to telling your lie. Like anything, practice makes perfect. The more you tell the same lie, the easier it will become. It’s easy to find out if a person is coming up with a lie on the spot as details become vague and nervousness begin to set in., The more truth you can add to a lie the easier it will be to tell. It is more like you’re leaving a false impression rather than blatantly lying. Attempt to avoid follow-up questions by colouring in as much truth as you can., Get inside the head of someone listening to your head. A good liar uses the same tools as a good communicator. Empathize with your listener and anticipate what he wants to hear. Learn what your listener knows and identify his interests and schedule to avoid any missteps in your story that may trigger any suspicion., Lying can make you nervous and scared. You may not notice yourself fidgeting, stuttering, or breaking eye contact. People can pick up on your non-verbal cues so try to limit gestures that aren’t already natural to your personality.Some people talk faster than normal or give too much eye contact to overcompensate for a lie. Rehearse in front of a mirror or a friend to get the most natural delivery you can.

, Liars will memorize the details about the lie but may get caught off guard when asked about the emotions associated with their actions. They may sound mechanical when delivering their answers. Be prepared to add emotion to the details of your lie., Lip compression may be a negative reaction when telling a lie. People testifying often compress their lips just before relaying something negative. Get through a tough line of questioning with relaxed lips., Whether your breathing increases or even hyperventilates, it’s usually a sign that you are nervous or psychologically uncomfortable. Even taking a long deep breath can be a sign that you are collecting yourself before a lie., Many people unconsciously touch their neck when they are nervous or anxious. Usually people reach for the dimple of their neck. Many may adjust their tie or fidget with it instead of touching their neck., A contentious topic or difficult conversation may cause you to turn your body away. You may subtly shift in your seat and turn your stomach away from an accuser or from someone you are lying to. You may even create a barrier by crossing your legs while still keeping eye contact. Keep your torso facing your listener especially if they have just asked you a question that you need to lie to answer., People may reach for their glasses or rub their eyes when in a difficult conversation. Keep your hands in a neutral and natural position when telling a lie to avoid suspicion., Hiding or lowering your thumbs may reveal that you are insecure or aren’t committed to your statement. When people are more emphatic they tend to have their thumbs straight and apart., Any changes in your regular speech patterns and behaviours may raise suspicions. Some people may talk faster, high-pitched, or give more errors in speech when nervous. Liars also want to convince you of a lie so they may repeat details to hammer it home. Avoid overly repetitive information as you speak naturally.Liars may probe with repetitive information and their spoken words may be weaker at the start and end of a statement as they try to read their listener to see if their lie is being believed.
Repetition may be difficult to read especially if using a cellphone as coverage may become spotty and cause repetition.

, Cultural context may dictate how you utilize pauses in your delivery. However, if you use a pause, it may come off as regrouping to deliver a lie. Saying something like, “That’s a good question” may come off as you delaying to gather your thoughts as you commit a lie.Both honest and deceitful people use pauses in speech so this will be a difficult factor to detect without proper context.

, Keep consistent. Depending on how big of a lie you tell, it may be hard work keeping everything in order. Remember every detail you lay out even if it is not asked of you. Make sure not to give different information to different people., You must commit to your lie. Any wavering makes it obvious that you’re lying. Lying may feel unpleasant as fear and guilt set in. Your body language and facial expressions may give away your emotions as you want to get the lie over with. You must commit to your lie as if your were telling the truth.Some people enjoy the thrill of lying and don’t show shame or remorse. Lying is not a socially acceptable activity so it’s okay if you don’t get any joy from what you’re doing and find it difficult to commit.

, If you are being accused of a lie, turn the table and manipulate your accuser. You may ask questions like “Why were you there, do you not trust me?” or “I’m sure you don’t want your friends hearing what you’ve been up to either”., Politicians use this technique to drive people away from other issues. People are uncomfortable accusing others so any chance they have to change topics may be seen as welcomed relief. For example, if a politician is asked about his views on the economy, he may drive the conversation to immigration. Similarly, if you are being accused of missing curfew, you may move the conversation to your brother driving without a license., Avoid responsibility from your lie by softening or even erasing anything you’re being accused of by admitting to things that your accuser will find satisfactory. If you can deflect blame you will also deflate the anger associated with it., People may ask you questions several different ways to try to catch you in a lie. Make sure that you not only know the details but also the specifics when more precise questions are asked."

Before you do anything, you need to get a box to mail your item in.,
Padded envelopes can be put in the mailbox, but there is a size and weight limit.,
Find out where the nearest post office is.,
Decide where you're going to mail the package from.,
Consider your methods of transportation and how you're going to get home.,
Come up with a good story to tell little siblings who are going through the tattletale phase, strangers who ask where your parents are, or your angry parents who found out you took a detour after school.,
On the big day, act normal.,
Hide your package in your backpack, or if it's really big, get it out of the house when your parents aren't around and hide it somewhere.,
After mailing the package, either destroy the receipt or throw it out somewhere that isn't at home.,
Get home as quickly as possible and give yourself a pat on the back!

",How to Mail a Package Without Your Parents Knowing," Find an extra one lying around the house, ask a friend or relative if they have one, or buy one.


If you need to ask your parents to buy you a box, say you need it for storage or a school project.
Another thing you can do is give a friend some money and ask them to buy a box. Or if you have an older sibling with a car, take advantage of that.;
, Make sure you don't exceed that.


Watch the mailman for a few days and record the time s/he comes. Then wait outside and when s/he comes, run over and give the package to him/her personally so your parents don't find it if they need to mail a letter.
If they mailman comes while you are at school, give the package to him/her on a Saturday.

, Some stores will mail packages for you, but make sure you know if they do ahead of time. Print a map and circle the post office, your home, and your school.

, Are you going to bike to the post office when your parents are napping? Lie and say you're meeting up with a friend? Take a trip to the post office after school?


If you're going to leave the house when your parents think you're home, then you're sneaking out. This is an extremely dangerous thing to do in the daytime and not the best choice. You should only do it if it's the only choice.
If you lie and say you're going to meet up with a friend, you should either make sure your friend in with the plan (so if they're questioned about your 'day out,' they'll have a good story ready) or actually meet up with a friend. That way you won't be caught in a lie.

, You don't want to have a friend's mom drop you off at the post office five miles away, then realize you're stuck and have to call your parents. Have a backup plan and carry the supplies you need. Always assume the worst so you'll be prepared


Bring money for a cab in case your friend realizes she can't take you to the post office after all or you hurt your ankle while walking back from the post office or your bike gets a flat tire. Have the cab drop you off about a block away from home.
Think about the amount of time it will take to get to the post office, mail the package, and get back, then add another fifteen minutes for safety in case you your friend needs to stop for gas or the lines at the post office are longer than expected.
Remember it will cost money to mail a package.

, Practice it several times to make it sound believable.

, Don't stutter a lot, don't say you might be late from school that day, and don't ask if they are going to go to the post office that day.

, Keep in mind that lugging a package that size around will be very inconvenient and a lot harder to hide from your parents.

, You don't want your parents finding that.

Observe distancing language.,
Pay attention to idioms.,
Notice excessive word usage.,
Review their story for inconsistencies or contradictions.,
Listen for too much detail.",How to Catch a Liar1," Someone who's lying may unintentionally try to distance themselves from the words they use. Instead of using the words ‘I’ or ‘me,’ they might overuse ‘they,’ ‘we,’ or ‘theirs.’ This is an indication that the person subconsciously wants to separate from the lie., If the person is using phrases like, “To tell you the truth,” or “I honestly,” they may be lying. Unless these are normal idioms that the person uses, this affirmation of the truth can be a sign they are actually lying. It is an attempt to convince you, and themselves, of the lie., Liars tend to talk more. They will use extra words to keep you distracted from what they are actually saying. They think this allows them to get by with the lie.For example, if someone says “I went out to the park on the far side of town to take a nice relaxing walk,” instead of “I took a walk in the park,” they may be lying about their whereabouts.

, If the story is unbelievable, that could be a clear sign of a lie. Also, if the story seems to have small details that don’t add up, it may be fabricated. These inconsistencies are a sign of an underdeveloped lie., If the person is telling you needless specifics, they may be trying to convince you of the richness of the truth. Unless the person is usually verbose, they may be trying to fill in gaps with unrelated data. It also shows that they have put a great deal of thought into the story.In practiced liars, the opposite can be true. They may only offer the very bare bones of the story. Keep in mind that only about four percent of people are talented liars.

Watch their face as they tell you a suspected lie.,
Notice a fake smile.,
Note if they look away from you frequently.,
Look for changes in the person’s behavior.",How to Catch a Liar2," As they say ""Yes,"" they may shake their head, or vice versa. These subconscious ""tells"" signify a possible lie. These tells are hard to pick up on, and take practice., Real smiles and fake smiles look very different, because most people smile with their eyes, cheeks and whole face. If the person seems to be fake smiling at you, they may have something to hide. The smile is an attempt to reassure you that all is okay., Eye contact can be difficult for liars to keep. People can react to this uncomfortable feeling by looking straight in your eyes the whole time or looking away frequently. Eye contact in either extreme may signify a lie., If a person is normally energetic and loud, they may get quiet when they try to lie. On the other hand, if a person is normally calm and quiet, they may be anxious and restless when lying. Keep in mind that these changes can come from a stressful state."
"
Pay attention to a feeling of unease.,
Notice mismatched emotions.,
Try to trust the person.",How to Catch a Liar3," If you are talking to someone and something seems out of place, they may be lying. You can sometimes pick up on subtle cues that you are not even consciously aware of. These cues manifest as a feeling of unease or a ‘gut feeling’ that tells you something is wrong., When someone is lying, their emotions may not match their words or actions. If someone is saying that they are sad, but seem to be laughing, they might be lying about something. They also may be lying if their emotions do not match the situation.For example, someone who is having a good time at a funeral may be lying about how sad they are.

, If someone is breaking bad or uncomfortable news, they may look like they are lying. Likewise, if they are under stress, their behaviors may be a little odd. When you have no reason to assume the person is lying, it is best to trust them.For example, if someone tells you that they were in a car accident earlier that day while laughing, do not assume that they are lying.

Change the subject.,
Ask a question that is unexpected.,
Insist on an answer to the question.,
Account for the mode of conversation.",How to Catch a Liar4," If a person is lying, they will gladly move subjects. If they are not lying, they may act confused by the sudden change in conversation. A person telling the truth may also try to circle back and finish clarifying., Instead of following their line of thinking, think of a question they may not have rehearsed. This can throw them off and make the lie obvious. If the answer is consistent with what they have been telling you, it may be the truth.For example, if someone is telling you they lost your purse and you think they are lying, you may ask them to give you a few names of some people who may have seen it recently, instead of asking where it was last. Making them accountable suddenly requires them to change their lie or come clean.

, If the person answers your question with another question, they are probably trying to change the conversation. Put them on the spot and hold them accountable to your question. This can further agitate them and make it harder to keep up with the lie., People are more likely to use the phone or email to tell a lie. Try to meet the person face to face to ask about important issues. They may come clean or refuse the direct contact altogether. Either way, it will be easier to catch the liar face to face.

Look for digital proof.,
Have a stakeout.,
Verify their story with friends or family.",How to Catch a Liar5," If someone is lying to you, there’s a good chance that electronic proof exists. People often log their locations and activities on social media. Texting and instant messaging also make up a large portion of person to person communication. If you can gain access to someone’s phone or social media account, you will likely know who they are talking to and what they have been doing., If you believe someone is lying about where they are going, you can find out with a simple stakeout. Go to the place that they claim to be and keep yourself out of sight. Watch closely to see what time they arrive, what time they leave, or if they were even there at all. If their story checks out, they were telling the truth. If not, you have proof that they were lying to you., If you suspect someone is lying to you, you can always ask other people they know. You can ask bluntly if you are comfortable doing that. If not, you can try to get the information you need through casual conversation.

For example, if you were going to ask bluntly you might say something like, “Were they really with you last night?”
If you were going to try to be casual, you could ask something like, “Did you two have a good time last night?”

Understand the terminology.,
Lie with mean averages.,
Lie with median averages.,
Lie with mode averages.,
Lie with representational numbers.",How to Lie with Statistics1," The word “average” gets thrown around an awful lot when statistical data are being discussed. At first glance, the term sounds straightforward enough: the average is the amount that falls roughly in the middle. However, there are actually few different types of averages, all of which can be misleading if not properly understood.


The mean average is reached by adding up all the numbers in a data set and dividing them by the number of entries in the set. In other words, if you have the numbers 3, 3, 5, 4, and 7, the mean average can be reached by adding them together (to get 22) and then dividing the sum by 5 (since there are 5 numbers in the set).

In this example, the mean average is 4.4.


The median average is the number in a data set that falls midway between the lower numbers and the higher numbers. Using the same data as before (3, 3, 5, 4, and 7), the median average is 4, since 2 of the numbers are lesser and 2 are greater.
The mode average is a representation of the most common number in the data set. Using our example set, the mode average is 3, since it appears twice.;
, The mean average might seem like the most foolproof of all the methods described above, but that actually isn't the case. This is because abnormally high or low numbers in the data set can significantly swing the average. To lie with a mean average, gather outlying data and use it in your equation.


For example, imagine you survey 50 households in a neighborhood for their income. Most households make between $40,000 and $60,000 a year, but one household makes $5 million a year. When you compute the mean average, the number will be significantly higher than the “real” average income in that area, because the $5 million number is so much bigger than the others.
In a similar way, if you had data showing that 9 people each had $1,000 in their bank accounts, but a tenth person only has $1, the median average would work out to $900.10 – almost 10% less than the most common amount.
Reputable surveys often throw out the very highest and very lowest numbers before computing the mean average. However, not every survey you see in the news is reputable. Unless you either have access to the entire data set yourself, or see a written assurance that the outliers were removed, it's safer to assume they weren't.

, The median average is actually the toughest number to “lie” with, because it can never be too high or too low compared to most data sets. It must lie in the center by necessity. However, you can use the median average to hide a very large or small number. For instance, if your data set is 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 3000, the median average is 3.


When you have an even amount of entries, you can reach the median average by finding the mean of the two entries in the middle. This still doesn't account for outliers.
Beware of median averages being used to describe changes over time. A company that raises the price of its services by 3% every year could raise them by 20% this year and hide it by presenting a median average of 3% over the last 9 years.

, In some things, mode averages are almost impossible to lie with – the average number of tickets purchased per person for a ball game, for example, is almost always going to be accurately reflected by the mode. Nevertheless, mode averages, too, can exclude important data, especially in smaller data sets.


For instance, if you have a data set of all numbers ranging from 1 to 100, but the number 1 is included 3 times, 1 will be the mode average of the set, even though the mean (and in this case, more sensible) average is much closer to 50.
Any survey that rates on a broad scale can be manipulated to emphasize the mode. If you survey 100 people on a scale of 1 to 10 about their feelings on a subject, and more people rate it “10” than any other number, then even if only one more person gave a 10 rating than gave a 1 rating, 10 is the mode average.

, If you have a set of data that's defined by abstract, rather than concrete numbers (for example, a customer satisfaction survey), it's almost frighteningly easy to lie with that set. If you ask people to rate their satisfaction on a scale from 1 to 3, that doesn't necessarily prove that customers who chose 3 are three times as happy as those who chose 1. This fact is used to skew mean averages in particular, but can also be applied to median and sometimes, even mode averages.

Use a small set.,
Use a controlled set.,
Use an imbalanced set.",How to Lie with Statistics2," Any good statistician knows that the only way to approach a useful average or spot a real trend is to gather data from as broad a set as possible. If you can get information from 100 people, that's good; 10,000 is even better. The more items of information you put into your data set, the more likely it is to end up with accurate averages. By using a set of, say, 3 or 5 data, you can produce results that don't accurately reflect the state of affairs.


For instance, if you find two people who have recently been injured by something silly – like a pillow – and use them as your whole data set, you can make an argument that pillows are categorically dangerous to everybody. No matter which averages you choose to show, as long as you don't reveal your sample size of only 2 people, there's no clear way to refute your claim.

, The most accurate data sets are not only large, they're also broad. A geologist surveying the types of minerals in a desert will have a more accurate list if she collects many samples from every part of the desert, rather than collecting 1,000 samples from the same spot. By limiting the scope of your data set, you can significantly influence the results.


Sometimes, this is useful and done on purpose. People who research using demographic data, for example, might want to find out specifically about the types of jobs that men tend to hold, and therefore will only survey men. As long as this is clearly stated in the data, there's nothing shady about it.
Data from small college research projects in particular tends to get misused to equate a controlled data set with a general result. This is because many research projects at the college level don't have the time or resources to use a broad, random sample of average citizens, and rely only on college students instead. Again, this is fine as long as that information is clearly stated, but news organizations looking for sensational headlines have often obscured the details of a small college study to make it seem much more sweeping.

, This technique is especially sly, as it can lie even with a lot of detail provided for the viewer. The trick here is to use data that can't be fairly compared, and treat them as though they're on equal footing. For example, if you have a city of 100,000 that gained 10,000 residents in 10 years, and you compare it to a town of 10 that gained 10 more residents over the past 10 years, the percentages for each gain will seem to show that the small town grew much more rapidly.


This is sometimes used by people who analyze market data to present a misleading picture of sales figures. Let's say you're tracking sales of apples and oranges, but halfway through the study, there aren't any oranges left because there's a shortage. If you continue to compare data for the rest of the study, there'll be a huge spike in apple sales relative to orange sales, even though apples probably didn't suddenly get more popular.

Leave the y-axis blank.,
Use very large or small numbers on the y-axis.,
Start the y-axis partway through the range.,
Use improper scaling.,
Use graphics to omit data.",How to Lie with Statistics3," Nothing gives a clearer picture of data than a graph or chart, but even those can be subtly manipulated to give different effects. This is because people tend to look at the shapes and sizes on the graphs before bothering to check the numerical specifics attached to them. The simplest way to manipulate the y-axis is to simply not label it.


If you have a set of 5 bars on the x-axis, but no indicator of how tall they are relative to one another, there's no way to gauge whether or not there's any actual significant difference between them.

, Let's say your data set ranges between 1 and 50. To hide the differences, measure your y-axis in increments of 100; to accentuate them unfairly, measure the y-axis in increments of 1/10th. A difference between 3 and 10 looks huge when measured in tenths (it's 70 units apart!), but is barely even noticeable on a graph where 100 is the first increment (it's much, much less than 1 unit apart!).

, If your data ranges from 11 to 51, you can make the lowest number look even lower, and the highest number look even higher, by labeling your y-axis so that it starts at 10. This makes the bar representing 11 just barely higher than the x-axis. It'll appear as almost nothing unless someone is savvy enough to actually look closely and see that the graph was started from 10 instead of 0.


The bar representing 51 becomes 50 times higher than the bar representing 11 on such a graph, since the smaller bar is only 1 unit high. If the graph had started at 0, the bar representing 51 would have been less than 5 times the height of the bar representing 11.

, Any time you see the words “not to scale” in the fine print, chances are you've run across an example of this. It isn't always done maliciously; sometimes, the numbers involved are so vastly different that there isn't a way to accurately represent them on the same page. However, it can easily be used for unsavory purposes.


For example, a visual representation of size could be drawn to height scale but not width scale, making a taller object (such as a building) also seem much thinner or wider than it actually is.

, This is commonly seen in broad surveys that divide results by certain categories, such as the famous chart showing which term for a carbonated beverage is most popular in what county all across the United States. At first glance, such information seems very detailed, but questions soon arise: how broad is the survey data? What is the threshold for determining the result? Is mean, median, or mode average used?


If you were to only use one result from every area you surveyed, and threw out all the rest, you could easily control the results by area without ever divulging that your sample size per area was tiny. Again, it's a lack of concrete information that makes the results so hard to quantify.

Stop saying yes when you really mean no.,
Identify your defense mechanisms.,
Acknowledge when you're scared.,
Make a conscious effort to notice moments throughout the day when you're trying to be someone you're not.,
Recognize when you're exaggerating your abilities, accomplishments and skills.,
Be wary of when you tell yourself that things are going to change but you do nothing to make this happen.,
Acknowledge your tunnel vision.,
Hold yourself to a high standard of internal truth telling.",How to Stop Lying to Yourself," This is one of the biggest problems for many people who feel obliged to say ""yes"" to others for all sorts of reasons. If those reasons aren't being true to caring for your own needs and time resources, then it's important to say no instead. Saying ""no"" will, like everything else, take practice but you'll soon learn that people prefer to know that you mean it and that you're not going to let them down by saying yes but never doing it. While some people may seem offended by a ""no"" when you'd usually say yes to them, often this indicates more about their own need to use you, in which case it's good for them to learn that you're standing up for yourself.;
, Using defensiveness, victimization, anger, intellectualizing or outrage as means to promote your point of view while ignoring all others is a form of self deception. When you get on your high horse and claim that others should adhere to your point of view, you are lying to yourself because your reactions are defense mechanisms, and disrespectful of the viewpoint of others. That is not the real you. The real you is the one whose passions, beliefs, values and preferences matter but should be vocalized and shown in constructive ways that help and nurture others, not treat them as targets to be won over to your point of view.

, Lies are often something we tell when we want to protect ourselves. The desire to protect is a response to something that you fear. The more you acknowledge your fears, the less you'll need to lie. Whenever you find yourself rationalizing something, or your intuition triggers some introspection, ask yourself: ""What am I scared might happen?""

, While it's great to learn from others and copycat things that have worked for them, taking this too far and trying to be them will result in you losing your sense of self and trying to be someone you're not. Similarly, contorting yourself to meet others' expectations will erode your individuality, and break your spirit. Don't do or say things just because another person does or expects you to; source the need to behave that way from within and if it's not true to yourself, either don't do it or tailor it completely to reflect your own self.

, These sorts of lies to yourself will eventually cause you confusion, frustration and loss when you overestimate what you're capable of. For some people, this can lead to fulfillment of the ""Peter Principle"", where you allow yourself to be promoted beyond your skill set yet spend your time trying to vainly prove you're capable. This can lead to burnout, a sense of failure and even a reduction in reputation as others discover you can't keep up in the way you said you would. Exaggeration of this sort doesn't help you to get ahead and prevents you from being true to yourself.


Learn to be humble.
Share your vulnerabilities with other people. This helps you to better connect with people who recognize the same vulnerabilities in themselves and it also shows them that you are authentic.

, Saying that you'd like things to be different is one thing. Action is another. Many people lie to themselves by wishing that they'd win the lottery, receive an inheritance, find the perfect job, etc., and then simply get on with all they can't stand about their lives, passively waiting for... who knows what to happen. You'll know this lie if you find yourself saying a lot: ""If only."" If only won't make changes for you; only your action and determination can do that.

, Everyone has it, to some extent. Realize that your truth is just that––your truth. Don't lie to yourself by thinking that the way you see the world is the only way to see the world. It's this kind of narrow approach that gets people into endless arguments from which they won't back down, as they try to enforce their reality onto others, denying the reality of anyone else.

, It will probably take practice but once you're alert to the need to be more self-truthful, you'll catch yourself when you lie to yourself and start stopping it from happening. Amazing things will happen as you are more truthful to yourself––you'll trust yourself more, you'll feel your self worth increase and you'll understand your limitations and when to rely on others rather than trying to ""do it all"" yourself. You'll be more inclined to get on with things instead of moping or falling into self-piteous moments, and you'll have more energy because you're not holding up a front, concealing your true nature or worrying about hiding your vulnerabilities. Ultimately, not lying to yourself is a way of giving others the gift of the real you, and on that they can rely.

Consider the nature of suspected lies.,
Listen for other people's stories being retold.,
Observe whether the person dodges questions.,
Watch out for manipulation.,
See how a person reacts when caught lying.,
Consider their mental health history.",How to Spot a Pathological Liar1," You may come to suspect a friend, family member, or co-worker is habitually stretching the truth. Pick apart the suspected lies and consider what they have in common. Pathological liars may lie to gain sympathy, boredom, or insecurity.Part of the reason the pathological liar feels compelled to lie is because he or she may feel as though being in spotlight has eluded them.This person feels that he or she should be the center of everyone s universe and will do what he or she can to make it happen. Upon tasting the spotlight it becomes self-reinforcing and the lies grow bigger each time just to keep on being the center of attention. Some pathological liars may be actively trying to gain sympathy in a situation. They may tend to exaggerate or make up pains and illnesses, for example, or exaggerate small issues in their lives to ridiculous proportions in order to gain sympathy from anyone within earshot.
Pathological liars may also have low self-esteem. They may lie to make themselves look more important than they truly are. They may exaggerate accomplishments in personal or professional areas in order to make their lives seem impressive and worthy. In this case, they may be lying to convince themselves rather than to mislead you.
Some pathological liars simply lie out of boredom. They will fabricate events and make up lies to hurt others. This creates drama, alleviating boredom in the pathological liar's life.
Some pathological liars may enjoy the attention that they get from others by telling extravagant stories about themselves. In order to keep up appearances, they may spin larger and more complicated lies.;
, Pathological liars may often get caught lying. Frequently, you may hear someone else's story retold as if it happened to a pathological liar. If something about a story sounds familiar to you, stop to consider whether you've heard that story before.You may hear a pathological liar repeat the story of a friend or family member. They may also repeat stories from movies or television shows. The stories may be embellished slightly in the pathological liar's version.
For example, your co-worker tells a story that sounds familiar to you, but you're unsure where you've heard it before. Later, you see a similar story on the news. If your co-worker is a pathological liar, they may very well have lifted the story from the news and presented it as their own.

, When confronted, a pathological liar may find a way to avoid answering a question. Pathological liars are manipulative by nature, so you may think they've answered something when they really have failed to do so.For example, your friend reveals she had a falling out with her best friend fairly recently. You've been having issues getting along with this friend, and wonder whether her relationship difficulties may be a pattern for her. You ask her something like, ""Why did you and Eliza stop talking?""
The friend may respond with something like, ""We haven't really talked for a year."" She's not really answering the question. She may dodge more direct questions. For example, you ask her something like, ""Did you used to blow off Eliza the way you blow me off a lot?"" She may reply with something like, ""Do you really think I'm that kind of person?""

, Pathological liars are experts at manipulating others. They tend to study others to find ways to divert their attention away from their lies. Pay attention to how a pathological liar interacts with you. You may detect subtle manipulation.Pathological liars frequently use sexual tension as a means of emotional manipulation. If you're attracted to the suspected pathological liar, they may flirt with you when confronted about their lies.
They will also study you carefully and learn where your personal limits are. Pathological liars have a good sense of which people will believe which lies. They may realize, for example, you will not believe lies about sickness, but may believe lies about emotional problems. If you hear the liar talking to someone else, they may fabricate claims of aches and pains but not mention these ailments to you.

, No two pathological liars are the same. However, most of them will react aggressively when caught in a lie. If someone seems to get angry in response to accusations of lying, you may be dealing with a pathological liar.A pathological liar may become very defensive. They may blame someone else for their lies. For example, ""The only reason I had to make that up was because our boss is so difficult.""
They may also come up with another lie to cover up the first one. For example, ""No, I did use that money to get the car fixed, but I also used half of it to pay for those groceries. I forgot to tell you I stopped at the store.""
They also may become angry when caught lying. They may become angry and begin yelling, or start crying in order to elicit sympathy.

, Lying can be associated with some mental health issues, such as borderline personality disorder, depression, bipolar disorder, and narcissistic personality disorder. If you are close to this person, you may be able to learn about their history of associated mental health issues and encourage them to get the right help.

You may be able to use this history to discover the patterns of their lying. Are they only lying in certain circumstances? Do they try to reinvent themselves or impress others with their lies? Are they lying to avoid talking about certain situations?

Look for micro-expressions.,
Look for nose touching and mouth covering.,
Notice the person's eye movements.,
Do not use eye contact or lack of it as a sole indicator of truthfulness.",How to Detect Lies1," Micro-expressions are facial expressions that flash on a person's face for a fraction of a second and reveal the person's true emotion, underneath the lie. Some people may be naturally sensitive to them but almost anybody can train themselves to detect these micro-expressions.


Typically, in a person who is lying, his or her micro-expression will be an emotion of distress, characterized by the eyebrows being drawn upwards towards the middle of the forehead, causing short lines to appear across the skin of the forehead.;
, People tend to touch the nose more when lying and a great deal less when telling the truth.This is perhaps due to a rush of adrenaline to the capillaries in the nose, causing the nose to itch.A lying person is more likely to cover his or her mouth with a hand or to place the hands near the mouth, almost as if to cover the lies coming forth. If the mouth appears tense and the lips are pursed, this can indicate distress., You can usually tell if a person is remembering something or making something up based on eye movements. When people remember details, their eyes move up and to the left if they are left-handed. When right-handed people make something up, their eyes move up and to the right. The reverse is true of left-handed people. People also tend to blink more rapidly (""eye flutter"") as they're telling a lie. More common in men than in women, another tell of a lie can be rubbing the eyes.Watch the eyelids. These tend to close longer than the usual blink when a person sees or hears something he or she doesn't agree with.However, this can be a very minute change, so you will need to know how the person blinks normally during a non-stressful situation for accurate comparison. If the hands or fingers also go to the eyes, this may be another indicator of trying to ""block out"" the truth.Be careful about assessing the truthfulness of someone's statement based on eye movements alone. Recent scientific studies have cast doubt on the idea that looking a certain direction can help pinpoint someone who is lying.Many scientists believe that eye directionality is a statistically poor indicator of truthfulness.

, Contrary to popular belief, a liar does not always avoid eye contact.Creatures may naturally break eye contact and look at non-moving objects to help them focus and remember. Liars may deliberately make eye contact to seem more sincere; this can be practiced to overcome any discomfort, as a way of ""proving"" that truth is being told.


Indeed, it has been shown that some liars tend to increase the level of eye contact in response to the fact that investigators have often considered eye contact as a tell.Clearly, only use eye contact aversion as one indicator in a general context of increasing distress when being asked difficult questions."

Tell the person how you will make up for it.",How to Lie," Include details that make your lie seem legitimate, but not so many that it becomes complicated. An elaborate lie means more details that you have to keep track of and can often mean more explaining. A simple, straightforward lie is easier to maintain.


For example, an elaborate lie might be, “I’m late because when I got onto I-70, it was so backed up that I had to reverse all the way down the entrance ramp and I ended up taking country roads instead.” A simple version of that lie would be, “Traffic was pretty backed up on I-70.”
The simplicity of the lie can show that you don’t have any other details to add to it.;
, Using someone as a witness or alibi makes your lie more complicated than it needs to be. If the person you lie to checks your alibi, they may find out you lied.


If you use someone else in your lie, be sure to tell them. Some people may not appreciate being part of your lie.
If you are planning a lie ahead of time, at least talk to the person and see if they are willing to cover for you, as opposed to telling them after you already used them in a lie.

, When you lie, only include information that is believable. Don’t exaggerate to a point where the listener will start to question what you are saying. Make your lie as realistic as possible.Be critical of your own lie and see if it seems reasonable. Don't use only your own judgment but think about if the person you are lying to will find it reasonable.
For example, telling your wife that a bird flew in the house and broke her lamp is not a plausible lie. Telling her you stumbled over the dog and knocked the lamp over is more plausible.

, Completely false lies may be more easily detected, but if you sprinkle truth into the lie it is more believable. Find a way to show proof that part of your lie is true to strengthen the lie as a whole.It is easier to express real emotion when you tell the truth than it is when you lie. If you emphasize the true part you can mask your emotions.
For example, you stayed out late with a group of friends that included your ex-girlfriend Holly. Tell your current girlfriend, “I was hanging out with Carl, Stacy, and Steve.” It’s true that you were with those people, but you’re lying about Holly being there, too.

, You can avoid lying under pressure by initiating the conversation about the subject you are lying about. Lie voluntarily before you are asked anything. The listener may not think you are lying since you volunteered the information.


If the person you are lying to is already upset or suspicious, they are more likely to be critical of the lie you offer. If they have not thought of the situation yet, they may be more likely to accept what you say without further questions.
If you go see your friend’s band and they sound terrible, go up to them after the set and say, “You guys rocked!” before they have a chance to ask you about it.

, One of the hardest things about lying is keeping what you have said straight. It's even harder if you have to repeat the lie to many people over the course of time. The best way to avoid this is to write down the lie.


If you have time to plan the lie out, write it down first. If you lie spontaneously, write down who you lied to and what you said.
If the lie is time sensitive and will go away, you may not have to keep track of the paper you wrote the lie on for very long. If the consequences of the lie are long term, you’ll need to put the paper somewhere safe.
Writing helps you make things clear and remember them. Even if you immediately throw the paper away, writing can help you establish the lie in your mind.

, If something is true, it is often easier to remember, but if you are lying you may forget exactly what you want to say. Repeating a lie over and over again will help you deliver it more effectively.When you are lying on the spot, you may not have the chance to practice your lie. You can repeat what you said later on so you remember exactly how you lied.
If you have time to practice the lie ahead of time, you can recite it in different ways to find the best delivery of the lie.

, For small lies, the video camera is not necessary, but if you are preparing a big lie, video can help. Watch yourself on video to decide if the lie sounded convincing. If not, figure out a way to adjust it.This is like saying the lie to yourself in a mirror, but saying it to a mirror is actually more distracting. Taking a video of yourself will help you see whether your delivery looked convincing or not.
If your delivery is believable, watch the video a few times to memorize the wording and presentation of the lie.

, Liars tend to fidget with their hands a lot. Keep your hands at your sides if you are standing or on your lap if you are sitting. Don’t rub your chin or your nose. Don’t run your hands through your hair., Swaying back and forth, tapping your foot, or generally moving a lot are signs that you are lying. Don’t shrug your shoulders a lot either. Keeping your whole body relaxed and unmoving adds poise to your appearance, and it will keep people from being suspicious.

, Folding the arms is considered closed off posture and when you lie it is a giveaway to people. Don’t cross your arms. Keep them at your sides, or if you are sitting down, lay your hands on your lap., Liars tend to blink nervously, and it’s an easy sign for people to notice. Also be aware that keeping your eyes open for too long can become suspicious, so make a conscious effort to blink as you normally would.

, One of the surest signs that someone is lying is shifting their eyes away from the listener. You can control your eye contact to mask your lie. Make enough eye contact to make the person believe you.You have to find a balance between too little eye contact and too much. If you stare at the person without looking away you will seem as suspicious as if you never meet their eyes.

, Turning your body to the side or turning away is seen as a sign that you are trying to hide something. Make sure that your body stays angled toward them. Keep your eyes in their direction, as well, and don’t stare off in the distance.

, When you are lying, appropriately touch the person you are lying to. Place your hand on their shoulder, grab their hand, or gently touch their leg if you are sitting by them. By touching them you will soften them toward you and make them more trusting.


You need to take account of whether or not you are in a close enough relationship with the person to initiate physical touch with them. In many situations, this won’t be the case.

, Another unconscious change that occurs when you lie is that the pitch of your voice gets higher. Actively moderate the pitch of your voice so that stays at the your usual level. Make sure your voice is appropriate to the situation.The fact that the voice pitch rises during a lie is somewhat common knowledge, so people may be listening for it if they suspect you of lying.
You can even speak slightly lower than you normally would to balance out the tendency to go higher.
Also pay attention to your tone and volume so that it is appropriate to the situation. Don’t speak with a cheerful tone if you need to sound sorry or a serious tone if your lie should sound encouraging.

, When you are asked questions, give a full answer but don’t let yourself start to ramble. Don’t pause a lot or add filler words that are unnecessary. Rambling or getting off topic is one sure sign that you’re lying.It will take practice, but find the balance between an answer that is too short and one that is too long. Both can seem suspicious.

, A natural tendency during a lie is to become overly formal. People will notice the difference from your typical demeanor. Use contractions like “didn’t” and “wasn’t” as opposed to “did not” and “was not.” Don’t be afraid of slang or colloquial terms because these will appear as normal for conversation.For example, say “I don’t know,” as opposed to, “I am not entirely sure.”

, After you tell the lie, you may be asked to tell the story again, or give a fuller explanation. Do not back down and take back the lie you told. Stick to it and repeat it as closely as possible to the way you told it the first time. Asking the same question multiple times is a tactic to get you to give up the lie.

, When you are asked for more information, don’t add too much to the lie so that it becomes complicated. Do your best to add one small piece of information that will enhance the lie but not make it too hard to maintain.

, Sometimes you can disorient people and distract them by answering a question with another question. Say something like, “Why don’t you believe me?” or “Did you hear a different story from someone else?” This puts the person questioning you in the hot seat to answer.

, At some point, you may be caught in a lie and it is obvious you can’t get out of it. Someone may have found video that proves you lied, or documents of some kind. Rather than extend the lie and make things worse, admit what you did and face the consequences.You’ll usually gain some credibility back with the person by admitting it rather than lying again.
Learn from your mistakes and try to avoid them the next time you need to lie about something.

, Once you admit the lie, you are likely to be questioned further. Don’t try to justify why you lied, but explain what your thought process was. Tell the person why you felt you needed to lie and why the truth would not have worked for you.The person may not accept your explanation, or may say it doesn’t make sense or isn’t good enough. Don’t argue, but affirm to them that you stand by your reasoning, even if it ended up being wrong.

, Lying is likely to cause damage in one way or another, so once you are caught you will have to fix things. Give the person some concrete steps you plan to take to remedy the situation. Be honest about what you are going to do and then follow through on doing it.The things you need to fix may not be problems as much as strained relationships. You may need to do some emotional work to show your remorse and make up for the lie.

Pay attention to eye contact.,
Notice if someone seems too relaxed.,
Pay attention to the tone of voice.,
Observe someone's smile.",How to Spot a Pathological Liar2," Many people assume pathological liars refrain from making eye contact. While typical liars may dodge eye contact, this is not usually the case for a pathological liar. Instead, you may notice too much eye contact. This is the pathological liar's attempt to look believable.A pathological liar may not break their gaze when speaking to you. It's normal to look away on occasion in conversation. A pathological liar, however, will stare you in the eyes for as long as you talk.
You also may notice subtle signs of lying in the eyes. A pathological liar's pupils may dilate slightly, and they may also blink slowly.

, When normal people lie, they may fidget excessively and show other signs of nervousness. In contrast, a pathological liar feels little remorse over lying. Therefore, they may seem almost too relaxed when lying. Pathological liars may actually appear quite sociable and laid back. Even when you know someone is lying, they may not demonstrate typical signs of distress or nervousness.For example, you hear your co-worker tell a story at lunch. Later, during downtime, the suspected pathological liar repeats the same story, as if it happened to them.
While you know this person is lying, they seem completely unbothered. They tell the story without any signs of distress or agitation and seem at ease with themselves. If you didn't know better, you would have no trouble believing the story.

, Small changes in vocal tone may indicate lying. While not all pathological liars change their tone, some may. A shift in vocal tone, in conjunction with other symptoms, may indicate someone is a pathological liar.You may notice a slight change in pitch. A pathological liar's voice may get higher or lower when lying.
A pathological liar may also lick their lips or drink water when talking. The stress from telling lies may cause adrenaline or the constriction of vocal chords, leading to an increased need for water.

, While pathological liars may not demonstrate typical body language when lying, they may display a fake smile. Smiles are very difficult to fake successfully, so pay attention to their mouths.With a genuine smile, you will notice changes in the entire face. The corners of someone's eyes typically crinkle. With a fake smile, the only noticable change is near the mouth."

Look for underlying secret habits.,
Consider whether the person lives in reality.,
Think about the person's relationships with others.,
Study the person's career.",How to Spot a Pathological Liar3," If this person has a problem with substance abuse, gambling, binge eating, or other destructive behaviors, there's a good chance they're a pathological liar.For example, you may notice a co-worker drinking extra at a company party. You may see them filling up their drink when no one else is at the bar, or even notice them carrying a flask.
You may also notice you don't see one co-worker eat at lunch, but sometimes find evidence of food having been in their office. They may be very secretive about eating habits, and habitually turn down offers to get food with co-workers.

, Pathological liars are often disconnected with reality. A lot of times, they may believe parts of their lies themselves. They may be deluded about themselves and their abilities.A pathological liar may have a tendency to exaggerate their importance. They may see something innocuous, like a compliment from a boss, as a sign of personal greatness. When recounting the compliment, they may fluff it's importance.
A pathological liar may lack basic life skills, but may not see this as a problem.
If the person has a distorted view of reality, they may honestly believe what they are saying. While this is not true of all pathological liars, consider the possibility that the person is not lying out of malice.

, Pathological liars tend to have unstable relationships. Consider anything you know about this person's relationship history. Look for any warning signs of instability.Does this person have stable friendships or romantic relationships? A lack of longterm friends, and a series of failed romances, may indicate a pathological liar.
A pathological liar may also be estranged from their family.

, A pathological liar tends to bluff their way into jobs. A pathological liar may have many jobs on their resume. However, most of these jobs will be short term. They may also dodge questions about why certain jobs did not work out longterm.For example, a pathological liar may have a long resume. Most of the jobs will only have been short term. If you ask the pathological liar about their career, they may dodge questions.
In some cases, a pathological liar may have moved around a lot due to sudden career changes. Pathological liars often burn bridges with employers.

Pay attention to the person's voice.,
Pay attention to exaggerated details.,
Be aware of impulsive emotional responses.,
Pay close attention to the person's reaction to your questions.,
Be conscious of the person's usage of words.,
Notice when the person repeats sentences.,
Notice the mid-sentence jump.",How to Detect Lies2," A person's voice can be a good lie indicator. He or she may suddenly start talking faster or slower than normal, or the tension may result in a higher-pitched or quavering tone. Stuttering or stammering may also point to a lie.

, See if the person appears to be telling you too much. An example might be, ""My mom is living in France, isn't it nice there? Don't you like the Eiffel tower? It's so clean there."" Too many details may tip you off to the person's desperation to get you to believe what is being said.

, Timing and duration tends to be off when someone is lying. It's either because the person in question has rehearsed their answer (or is expecting to be questioned) or rattles off something, anything, in order to fill the silence.


If you ask someone a question and he or she responds directly after the question, there is a chance that the person is lying. This can be because the liar has rehearsed the answer or is already thinking about the answer just to get it over with.
Another tell can be omission of relevant time facts, such as saying ""I went to work at 5 AM and when I got home at 5 PM, he was not there."" In this glib example, what happened in between has been all too conveniently glided over.

, Someone who has told the truth doesn't feel much need to defend themselves, well, because they're telling the truth. Someone who hasn't told the truth needs to compensate for their lie by perhaps going on the offensive, deflecting, or another stalling tactic.


A truthful person will often respond with even more detailed explanations to expressions of disbelief in his or her story. Someone aiming to deceive won't be ready to reveal much else but keeps repeating what has already been established.Listen for a subtle delay in responses to questions. An honest answer comes quickly from memory. Lies require a quick mental review of what they have told others to avoid inconsistency and to make up new details as needed. Note that when people look up to remember things, it does not necessarily mean that they're lying — this could just be a natural instinct.

, Verbal expressions can give you clues about whether a person is lying. These clues include:


Repeating your own exact words when answering a question.
Stalling tactics, such as asking for a question to be repeated.Other stalling tactics include stating that the question asked is excellent, Using words and phrases such as ""basically..."" and ""what happened was...."" indicate that the answer isn't so simple as yes or no, or confrontational style responses such as ""It depends on what you mean by X"" or ""Where did you get this information?""Avoiding use of contractions, namely saying ""I did not do it"" instead of ""I didn't do it."" This is an attempt to make it absolutely clear what the liar means.Speaking in muddled sentences and not making sense; liars often stop mid-sentence, restart and fail to finish sentences.Using humor and/or sarcasm to avoid the subject.
Using statements such as ""to be honest,"" ""frankly,"" ""to be perfectly truthful,"" ""I was brought up to never lie,"" etc. These can be a sign of deceptionAnswering too quickly with a negative statement of a positive assertion, such as ""Did you wash those pots lazily?"" answered by ""No, I did not wash those pots lazily,"" as an attempt to avoid the impression of a delayed answer., If the suspect uses almost the exact same words over and over, then it's probably a lie. When a person makes up a lie, he or she often tries to remember a certain phrase or sentence that sounds convincing. When asked to explain the situation again, the liar will use the very same ""convincing"" sentence again.

, The mid-sentence jump is when a clever liar tries to distract attention away from him or herself by interrupting themselves mid-stream and talking about something else. Someone might try to change the subject in this clever way: ""I was going — Hey, did you get a new haircut this weekend?""


Be especially cautious of compliments from the subject in question. The liar knows that people respond well to compliments, giving him or her a chance to escape interrogation by complimenting someone. Be wary of someone who delivers a compliment out of the blue.

Check for sweating.,
Watch when the person nods.,
Watch out for fidgeting.,
Observe the level of mirroring.,
Watch the person's throat.,
Check the person's breathing.,
Notice the behavior of other body parts.",How to Detect Lies3," People tend to sweat more when they lie.Actually, measuring sweat is one of the ways that the polygraph test (the ""lie detector"" in all the movies) determines a lie.Yet again, taken on its own, this is not always a reliable indication of lying. Some people may sweat a lot more just because of nervousness, shyness or a condition that causes the person to sweat more than normal. It's one indicator to be read along with a group of signs, such as trembling, blushing and difficulty in swallowing.

, If the head is nodding or shaking in opposition to what is being said, this can be a tell. This is called ""incongruence.""


For example, a person might say that he or she did something, such as ""I cleaned those pots thoroughly"" while shaking the head, revealing the truth that the pots were wiped briefly but not scrubbed. Unless a person is trained well, this is an easy unconscious mistake to make and such a physical response is often the truthful one.Also, a person may hesitate before nodding when giving an answer. A truthful person tends to nod in support of a statement or answer at the same time it is being given; when someone is trying to deceive, a delay may occur., A sign that someone is lying is that they fidget, either with their own body or with random things around them. Fidgeting results from nervous energy produced by a fear of being found out. In order to release the nervous energy, liars often fidget with a chair, a handkerchief, or a part of their body.

, People naturally mirror the behavior of others with whom they're interacting. It's a way of establishing rapport and showing interest. When lying, mirroring may drop as the liar spends a lot of effort on creating another reality for the listener. Some examples of failed mirroring that might alert you that something's not right:


Leaning away. When a person is telling the truth or has nothing to hide, he or she tends to lean toward the listener. On the other hand, a liar will be more likely to lean backward, a sign of not wanting to give more information than is necessary.Leaning away can also mean dislike or disinterest. They want to get out of it.
In people telling the truth, head movements and body gestures tend to be mirrored as part of the interplay between the speaker and the listener. A person trying to deceive may be reluctant to do this, so signs of not copying gestures or head movements could indicate an attempt to cover up. You might even spot a deliberate action to move a hand back to another position or to turn a different way.

, A person may constantly be trying to lubricate their throat when they lie by swallowing, gulping or clearing their throat. Lying causes their body to increase production of adrenaline, which gets their saliva pumping and then creates very little. While the saliva is surging, the subject might be gulping it down. When the saliva is no longer surging, the subject might be clearing their throat.

, A liar tends to breathe faster, displaying a series of short breaths followed by one deep breath.The mouth may appear dry (causing much throat clearing). Again, this is because they are putting their body through stress, which causes the heart to beat faster and the lungs to demand more air.

, Watch the person's hands, arms and legs. In a non-stressful situation, people tend to be comfortable and take up space by being expansive in hand and arm movements, perhaps sprawling their legs comfortably. In a lying person, these parts of the body will tend to be limited, stiff, and self-directed.The person's hands may touch his or her face, ear, or the back of the neck. Folded arms, interlocked legs and lack of hand movements can be a sign of not wanting to give away information.


Liars tend to avoid hand gestures that we consider a normal part of discussion or conversation. With some caveats, most liars will avoid finger pointing, open palm gestures, stippling (fingertips touching each other in a triangle shape often associated with thinking out loud), etc.Check the knuckles. Liars who stay motionless may grip the sides of a chair or other object until the knuckles turn white, not even noticing what's happening.Grooming behaviors are common in liars, such as playing with hair, adjusting a tie, or fidgeting with a shirt cuff.Two caveats to remember:

Liars can deliberately slouch to appear ""at ease"".Yawning and bored behavior may be a sign of trying to act just a little casual about the situation so as to cover up deception. Just because they're at ease doesn't mean they're not lying.
Keep in mind that these signals may be a sign of nervousness and not a sign of deceit. The subject in question might not necessarily be nervous because they're lying.



"
"
Be careful.,
Look at the big picture.,
Take time to establish rapport with the alleged liar and create a relaxed atmosphere.,
Establish a baseline.,
Learn to spot deflections.,
Ask the person to repeat the story over again.,
Stare at the alleged liar with a look of disbelief.,
Use silence.,
Follow through.",How to Detect Lies4," Although it is possible to detect dishonesty and lying, it is also possible to misread deception where there is none. A range of factors could be causing a person to appear as if he or she is lying when the ""signs"" might be due to embarrassment, shyness, awkwardness or a sense of shame/inferiority. A stressed person can be easily mistaken for a liar, as some of the manifestations of stress mimic the indicators of lying indicators. For this reason, it is important that any observation of a person suspected of lying involves drawing together a ""cluster"" of deceptive behaviors and responses, as there is no single ""aha!"" sign., When assessing the body language, verbal responses and other indicators indicative of lying, consider factors such as:Is the person unduly stressed in general, not just from the situation in which he or she is in now?
Is there a cultural factor involved? Perhaps the behavior is culturally appropriate in one culture but is seen as dishonest behavior in another.
Are you personally biased or prejudiced against this person? Do you want this person to be lying? Be careful of falling into this trap!
Is there a history of this person lying? Namely, is he or she experienced at it?
Is there a motive and do you have a good reason for suspecting lying?
Are you actually any good at reading lies? Have you taken into account the entire context and not simply zoomed in on one or two possible indicators?

, This includes not showing any signs that you suspect the other person of lying and making an effort to mirror his or her body language and pace of conversation. When questioning the person, act in an understanding, not overbearing, manner. This approach will help to let down the other person's guard and can help you to read the signs more clearly.

, A baseline is how someone behaves when he or she is not lying. This will help you tell if the way the person is acting currently is any different from how they usually act. Begin by getting to know the person if you don't already and proceed from there — people usually answer basic questions about themselves truthfully. For someone you already know, checking for a baseline might include asking the person about something the answer of which you already know.

, Usually, when people are lying, they will tell stories that are true, but are deliberately aimed at not answering the question you asked. If a person responds to the question ""Did you ever hit your wife?"" with an answer such as ""I love my wife, why would I do that?"" the suspect is technically telling a truth, but is avoiding answering your original question. This may indicate that he or she is lying or trying to conceal something from you.

, If you're really not sure whether they're telling the truth, ask them to repeat the story multiple times. It's hard to keep track of information that isn't truthful. In the process of repeating their made-up story, the liar is likely to say something inconsistent, outright false, or telling.


Ask the person to tell the story backwards.This is very hard to do, especially when requiring no loss of the details. Even a professional liar can find this reversal of approach a hard one to tackle effectively.

, If the person is lying, he or she will soon become uncomfortable. If the person is telling the truth, he or she will often become angry or just frustrated (lips pressed together, brows down, upper eyelid tensed and pulled down to glare).

, It's very hard for a liar to avoid filling silence created by you.He or she wants you to believe the lies being woven; silence gives no feedback on whether or not you've bought the story. By being patient and remaining silent, many deceitful people will keep talking to fill that silence, embellishing and possibly slipping up in the process, without even being asked anything!


Liars try to read you to see if you've bought the tale.If you don't show any signs of something to monitor, many liars will feel uncomfortable.
If you're a good listener, you'll already be avoiding interruptions, which in itself is a great technique to let the story unfold. Practice not interrupting others if you have this tendency — not only will it help you to detect lies, but it'll make you a better listener generally.

, If you have the means, check out the facts behind what the liar is saying. A skilled liar might give some reason why you shouldn't talk to the person who could confirm or deny a story. These are probably lies themselves, so it might be worthwhile overcoming your reluctance and to check with the person you've been warned against. Anything factual that can be checked should be checked.

Tell the story in your own words.,
Use leading questions to ferret out a lie.,
Surprise the person.,
Try a volatile conundrum.,
Gather evidence.,
Hold up your evidence for a confession.",How to Catch Someone Lying1," When you suspect someone of something, tell the story how you think it happened. Most people can't resist filling in details, despite the fact that the person won't confess or hasn't told the truth beforehand.For instance, you could say, ""Here's what I think happened. You saw there was only one milk chocolate bar left, and you wanted to save it for yourself, right? And then you decided to sneak it away to hide it in the night stand.""
You can even replace details you know to be true with lies, such as calling it a milk chocolate bar when it was actually dark, as the person will want to jump in to correct you.
This technique often elicits more of a response than direct questions.;
, Oftentimes, you can't determine a lie just from talking with a person. However, you can use nonverbal cues to help point you in the right direction, so you know what to check up on to see if the person is lying.For example, if you're wondering if your spouse hid the last bar of chocolate, you could ask a series of questions to help lead to the answer, such as ""If you had hid the chocolate, would you have hidden it in the night stand? Would you have hidden it in the refrigerator? Would you have hidden it in your purse?""
If your spouse reacts to one of the questions, such as rubbing their eyes, that could indicate where the chocolate is hidden, though you should check up on it to make sure, not accuse your spouse of lying outright.

, Sometimes catching the person off guard is enough to bring out a lie. That is, the person has probably practiced what they were going to tell you, particularly if it's a big lie. In that case, try asking questions that are surprising or startling, which can throw the liar off their rhythm, possibly catching them in a lie.For example, you could ask your spouse, ""Did the chocolate have nuts in it?"" That question may seem out of the blue, particularly if you're asking whether your spouse ate or hid the chocolate.

, A volatile conundrum is in someways similar to catching the liar by surprise. However, you can question a person using this technique without them knowing. Basically, you're forcing them to answer a question that could catch them in a lie either way, and they have to think on their feet to answer the question.For example, if your spouse is saying they didn't hide the last bit of chocolate, you could ask, ""Well, that's funny, because I thought I saw a bar of it last night.""
The key here is you don't even have to be telling the truth. The other person doesn't know if you are or not. If they're telling the truth, then they'll likely reply quickly with something like, ""Silly, we finished that box last week."" If they're lying, they're more likely to say something like, ""Oh, um, yeah, I'm not sure what you're talking about,"" or ""Um, no, I don't think there was.""
If you think the person is telling the truth, you can play it off as a mistake, such as, ""Oh, I guess I forgot I ate the last one a week ago. So, what's for dinner?"" A redirect after the question can help move the conversation onward.

, Once you've figured out a direction to investigate, you can gather evidence. Check up on the lead you figured out. For instance, if you suspect you know where your spouse hid the chocolate, you can go and check that location.In another example, you could check a car's history if you suspect a salesperson is lying to you about it.
One way to gather evidence is to use social media. Sometimes, a person may contradict themselves by posting on social media. For instance, they may tell you they are going out with friends to movie, but they might accidentally check in at a bar with their phone.

, If you find evidence to the contrary of what the person is saying, you can confront them. However, if you want more information out of the person, you should only allude to the evidence, rather than addressing it directly. If a person has direct evidence against them, they may not want to talk any more about it.For example, you could say, ""Isn't it possible you hid the chocolate in the night stand?"" when you've already gone and found the chocolate.
You can also use social media evidence the same way: ""So, did you only go to the movie, or did you go anywhere else?""

Calm down.,
Watch your body language.,
Smile.,
Act casual, and even bored.,
If you're nervous, laugh.,
Act like you don't care.",How to Be a Convincing Liar," You don't want to be nervous while you lie. It's good to think of the positive thing while you lie. Say, for example, 'If I lie about this, everyone will be happy', so think about the smiles you will make. Don't think about if you're going to be in trouble or anything negative. Nervous wrecks usually get caught immediately.;
, There are certain telltale signs that people look for if they suspect you of lying, so study these signs and make sure you don't betray yourself with body language. Don't tap your finger on anything for any reason. Don't look around everywhere - make solid eye contact with those you're talking to. Keep your voice exactly as smooth and sure as it is normally - if you usually speak with a stutter, don't stop, as this will be suspicious.

, Not the kind of smile that makes people suspicious, but the one that makes it look like you don't care if you're in trouble or not. Be authentic and carefree.

, Lean back in your chair like it's a normal conversation. You can even sleep. Act like you're bored. Be lazy. Calm down and act as if you haven't even given the situation any thought. Or if you're standing up act bored and tired. Maybe yawn and look at them with eyes that look like 'Really? You're wasting OUR time.'

, If you're not the one for calming down, then laugh. But it's got to be something that'd sound ridiculous if you hadn't actually done it.

, If you seem really defensive and all of that, denying everything, then you most likely will be caught eventually. Just sit back, relax, and stick to your story.

Use sincere body language.,
Be an active listener.,
Understand another's point of view.",How to Be Sincere1," Body language can convey a great deal about your attitude, and it can easily reveal sincerity (or a lack thereof). When you interact with others, try to be mindful of your posture, mannerisms, and behavior.Make steady eye contact, but don't stare. Look away every now and then, and don't forget to blink.
Maintain a relaxed posture, but keep your body slightly poised. You can do this by very slightly leaning toward the person you're talking to, or reaching out/gesturing towards that person.;
, One easy way to show sincerity to others is by being an active listener. As someone speaks to you, keep an open mind about what that person is saying.Practicing active listening skills show others that you are taking a sincere interest in what they have to say, and that you genuinely want to know more about the thoughts and feelings of others.


Face the person you're talking to. When you have a genuine reaction to what someone else is saying, your facial cues will give that reaction away. Your eyebrows will raise, your eyes may widen, and your mouth will reveal your emotional reaction. Facing someone will let them see your reactions, and it will convey to them that you are engaged and interested.
Ask open-ended questions to allow the other person to elaborate. For example, don't just ask, ""Did you like living there?"" This type of question will elicit a yes or no response. Instead, you can ask something like, ""Wow, I've never been there before. What was it like for you? What are some memories you have of living there?"" This shows your engagement and your curiosity.
Reflect on what has been said by the other person before giving your own response. Your conversational partner may be thinking of how to phrase something, or simply leaving a pause in the conversation for dramatic effect. If you rush to say whatever is on your mind, it will not convey a sincere conversational interest in that person's thoughts and opinions., If you refuse to consider why another person thinks/feels the way they do, you will not be able to have a sincere conversation with that person. Understanding someone else's point of view does not necessarily mean abandoning your own perspective. Rather, you should try to understand what motivates others, and what life experiences may have shaped another person's point of view.Once you are capable of seeing the world through someone else's eyes, you'll develop a more sincere understanding of who that person is and what made him the way he is.


Instead of criticizing someone else's musical tastes, for example, try to understand what about that music might be appealing. Perhaps the lyrics speak to the other person. Or perhaps the loud bass lines of a dance song allow someone who is normally shy to break out of her shell and make moves on the dance floor.
Before you argue with someone about politics, try to understand why that person holds his or her values. Someone who was raised by immigrants who grew up very poor might have strong opinions about the experience of immigrants, which could affect that person's political ideology.
Seeing the world through someone else's perspective helps you become less judgmental and more compassionate.

Start with a baseline of questions.,
Pay attention to their eyes.,
Check where their body is pointing.,
Watch for fidgeting.,
Understand why nonverbal cues may not be indicative of lying.",How to Catch Someone Lying2," When looking for nonverbal cues to indicate deception, you have to establish the person's normal behavior. In other words, what may indicate lying in one person may just be a nervous habit in another person.To establish a baseline, ask a few easy-going questions at first to put the person at ease. Pay attention to any body language the person normally employs before moving on to harder, more relevant questions.
For example, you could ask things like, ""It sure has been hot, hasn't it?"" or ""How have you been today?""

, When someone is lying, they tend to do one of two things: They may avoid eye contact altogether, looking around the room or at your forehead rather than make eye contact. On the other hand, they may make too much eye contact, meaning they stare at you more than is normal. Both of these tactics could indicate someone is lying.A person may also lower their eyes when lying or rub them to block your gaze.A person may also blink more if they are lying., Sometimes, a liar will physically move their body when they're lying. Usually, that means they will point their body away from you. One place to check for this type of body positioning is a person's feet: what direction are they facing? If the person moves them to point away from you, they could be lying., Some people are just fidgeters, meaning they can't keep still no matter what. However, an increase in fidgeting is likely an indication of nervousness. In turn, that could mean the person is not being completely truthful, so be on the lookout for fidgeting., While certain nonverbal cues are supposed to indicate lying, these cues are generalities taken from observing a variety of individuals. In other words, not everyone will display the same nonverbal cues, and some cues, such as extraneous blinking, are difficult to distinguish from normal blinking.In addition, when you're looking for nonverbal cues, you're making the assumption that lying puts the person under stress, to the point that their body will betray them. That may be true when it comes to big lies, such as when a person is trying to get away with murder. However, most people tell little white lies all the time, so it becomes natural to them. When lying comes naturally, the body is less likely to betray the person, so everyday lies are much harder to pick out.
It's also true that sometimes these nonverbal cues will be present in a person who's telling the truth because the truth is stressful. It's the stress of the situation that produces these nervous habits rather than telling a lie.

"
"
Check if they use contractions.,
Request the person tell their story backwards.,
Check if they keep their answers short and sweet.,
Listen for verbal tics.",How to Catch Someone Lying3," Often times, people become more emphatic when they are lying. In turn, they may mean they use fewer contractions, as contractions are less emphatic than using more words to emphasize the lie.For example, a liar may say ""I absolutely did NOT eat the last ice cream bar,"" rather than, ""I didn't eat the last ice cream bar.""

, Another way to check for lies is to request that the person tell you their story again, but backwards this time. If the person is lying, they are much more likely to slip up when telling it backwards than when telling it forward. Plus, they are more likely to show nonverbal cues of lying when telling it backwards.However, some people may just find telling a story backwards difficult and will show signs of nervousness.

, Often, someone who is lying will shorten rather than elongate answers. That's because the person has to come up with the details of a lie, while real life provides ample details when a person isn't lying. If a person seems particularly recalcitrant, that could indicate they are lying., While everyone inserts an ""um,"" ""ah,"" ""erm,"" or ""like"" sometimes, liars may rely on this verbal tics more often because they are trying to fill in the details. If you notice someone suddenly starts using more of these inserts, they could be lying to you."

Assess your strengths and weaknesses.,
Acknowledge your experiences.,
Be honest and forthright.,
Practice mindfulness.",How to Be Sincere2," Part of being more self-aware (and, by extension, more sincere) involves recognizing your best qualities, as well as your weaknesses. This can help you recognize your true self, and avoid being pretentious or insincere.


Ask people you know and trust for an honest evaluation of your best and worst qualities, as well as your strongest and weakest talents.Practice self-reflection on a daily basis. This can help you become more aware of yourself and keep negative qualities/characteristics in check.
Think about what (if any) types of people seem to dislike you. This can give you some idea of how strangers perceive you and why.
Reflect on what situations you perform poorly in. This can help you determine where your strengths and weaknesses lie., Your life experiences shape and define the person that you are. Pretending to be something that you're not, or pretending to have lived through experiences you do not understand, will quickly reveal you to be a fraud. Instead of trying to hide your roots or your true persona, embrace who you are and where you came from. Others will recognize that you are being true to yourself and will respect you for it.Examine your life's experiences and your set of personal beliefs to find what resonates with you most. That is most likely a part of who you really are.
Take time to recognize and evaluate your thoughts and feelings on a daily basis. They will help you realize whether or not you are being sincere and genuine.
You cannot be ""real"" if you don't know what real is for you as an individual. Search your feelings and you will know whether or not you're being true to yourself.

, Honesty requires a certain amount of vulnerability on your part. But when you make yourself vulnerable, others usually respond in kind. Being honest and direct about your thoughts, feelings, and beliefs will help others get to know you on a mutually-sincere level.Don't exaggerate your responses, reactions, or feelings.
Let people know how you really feel without beating around the bush or misleading anyone.
If you think someone is an interesting person, show it by offering your full attention. Take a genuine interest in what other people say and think.
Remember that being honest and forthright doesn't mean hurting other people's feelings. If you think an honest, direct answer could upset someone, you may want to consider approaching that situation with a little more tact.

, Being mindful means learning how to be aware of yourself, your actions, and your feelings in the present moment.When you practice mindfulness, you force yourself to confront the way you think and feel in the immediate now, which can help you get a better, more sincere sense of self.Focus on your breath. If you find your thoughts wandering, just return to your breathing. Concentrate on the physical sensation of air blowing in and out through your nostrils, as well as your abdomen moving up and down. Notice the way your stress or anxiety seems to melt away as you continue breathing.
Engage your senses in everything you do. Try using as many of your senses as possible when you perform daily activities like eating. Use your sight, smell, touch, and taste to fully experience an orange before you eat it.
Practicing mindfulness helps you block out any internalized expectations you may have placed on yourself, and instead allows you to experience the present moment as your real, authentic self.

Acknowledge your mistake.,
Express your regret.,
Try to atone for your actions.",How to Be Sincere3," If you want to offer a sincere apology, you'll need to own up to your mistake. Whether you said or did something hurtful, made someone feel bad, or let someone down, you need to address the fact that what you did was wrong and it hurt someone's feelings.If you cannot understand why someone's feelings were hurt, try putting yourself in his shoes. Think about how your words or actions might have affected that person, and also consider how his life experiences may have made that person more sensitive to the issue at hand.
Even if you still cannot understand why the other person's feelings were hurt, try to accept the fact that it happened, and that your words or actions caused it.
Accept responsibility for your mistake. Don't try to blame it on someone else. A sincere apology requires an honest admission of guilt.
Start by saying something like, ""I recognize that I hurt your feelings with my behavior.""

, It may go without saying, but part of any apology requires you to actually say the words, ""I'm sorry."" Let the other person know that you understand that you've hurt him, and that you feel remorse.Don't give a false apology, like saying ""Sorry you took it the wrong way."" Be genuine and apologetic for your mistake.
Research shows that sincerity can make or break an apology. If you cannot give an honest, sincere apology, take some time to cool down and reflect on how you've hurt someone. Then apologize when you're ready.
Say something like, ""I'm truly sorry for hurting you. I don't know what I was thinking.""

, Once you've acknowledged your mistake and given a genuine apology, offer to make it up to the other person somehow. If there is any way you can correct or repair the mistake, do so. If not, you may want to make an offer to make it up to them somehow.If you joined in on making fun of someone, you can atone for your actions by telling others to stop when you see them making fun of that person in the future.
If you let someone down by your actions or inactions, correct the mistake. For example, if you promised to give someone a ride and then forgot, you could give them a free ride for a week to make it up to them.
End your apology by telling the other person something like, ""I will do whatever I can to fix this, and I promise it will never happen again.""

Use local outreach and social media to attract youth.",How to Start a Boys and Girls Club," Typically it takes several well-connected people to get a new Boys & Girls Club off the ground. People who are involved in your community and are respected by community members can be a good starting point.You might want to pass out fliers at your local school, library, or community center and hold an informational meeting for those interested in becoming involved.
Reach out to school board members, community organizers, and others who you think would benefit the organization and be able to contribute in a robust and meaningful way.;
, If Boys & Girls Clubs are organized in your country on a national level, they will have a list of requirements that your organization must meet if you want to be affiliated as an official Boys & Girls Club.If there's another Boys & Girls Club in a nearby community, you may be able to get information there. You also can go to the national Boys & Girls Club website. To find it, just do an internet search for ""Boys & Girls Club"" (in quotes) along with the name of your country.
Requirements typically are extensive and will require you to submit documentation of your organization, location, and plan for programs, as well as the names and personal information for anyone on the Board of Directors or directly involved with the organization and its planning.
Keep in mind that it may take you a year or longer to get your Boys & Girls Club off the ground. The membership requirements can serve as a road-map to organize yourself during the planning stages.

, In the initial planning stages, you must create a detailed document that specifically details your community's need for a Boys & Girls Club, and the way your particular club will help fulfill that need.The key here is to identify unmet needs. This means any other resources available to young people in your community should be clearly described. Then, you must explain why your Club would not duplicate those services.
You also should pinpoint a desire in your community for a Boys & Girls Club. You can do this by creating a survey for parents or young people to fill out. Make the survey available online or go door-to-door and talk to your neighbors.
At the same time, address the ability to fund your organization. Boys & Girls Clubs are nonprofit, so your community must have sufficient resources to keep the Club going. Research whether funding is available from other community organizations in your area.

, Once you've researched your community and understand what kinds of unmet needs there are, get together with the other people who have agreed to help and start coming up with ideas for how to fulfill those needs.For example, if you have uncovered that your local school has the lowest math and science grades in the region, you might develop a series of programs and activities designed to make math and science learning fun. You also might plan to hire tutors who could help students who are struggling in those areas.

, The level of involvement your national organization has in the development of your Boys & Girls club will depend on your country. However, at this stage it's appropriate to contact the national organization to find out what your next steps should be.Typically, a member of the national organization will be directly involved in the planning stages, and in helping you get your Boys & Girls Club off the ground and running successfully. They also can provide you advice and give you access to resources that will help you in the planning stages.
In the United States, you should contact one of three BGCA Service Centers. These Centers support Boys & Girls Clubs nationwide, and will help guide you through the next steps. Your group will be assigned a BGCA Director of Organizational Development, who also will connect you with directors of other local clubs in your general area.

, After the first planning phase is complete, you should have a better idea of what your Boys & Girls Club is going to look like. At this stage, you're ready to choose a volunteer Board of Directors who will make all decisions related to the organization.Typically you'll want to choose people who have been instrumental during your first phase of planning, as well as community leaders whose reputation will lend your organization some clout.
The size of your Board of Directors is to a large extent up to you, but also depends on incorporation law. Some states require a minimum number of people on the Board of Directors. Since you will ultimately have to incorporate, check the law that will apply to your organization or contact an attorney who specializes in nonprofit law.
Generally, having someone with legal expertise in founding a nonprofit will be a benefit to the Board. Someone with a background in financing and bookkeeping of a nonprofit also would be an asset.

, The operating agreement provides the basic rules regarding how your organization will operate, how donations will be collected and managed, and who will be in charge of various aspects of the organization.You can find forms or look at the operating agreements of other Boys & Girls Clubs near you to get an idea of how this document should look and what should be included.
If you will be partnering with any other nearby Boys & Girls Clubs to pool resources, these agreements should be described specifically in your operating agreement.

, At this point, you have a general understanding of how much it will cost to keep the doors open. You also can determine costs for equipment and supplies that will be necessary for your programs.Work with a real estate professional to get a good idea of how much you can expect to pay to lease facilities. You'll need to work this into your budget.
Identify whether costs are one-time costs or regular costs. For example, buying exercise equipment for a gym would be a one-time cost, while paper and pencils would be a regular cost.
Talk to other Boys & Girls Club directors to get a general idea of what a reasonable budget should be, and adjust yours accordingly.

, Look for a building that has the space necessary for you to offer the programs you've planned. Your facility should be large enough to accommodate the number of young people you anticipate will participate, based on your research.It may help to seek out a realtor who has experience with nonprofits to help you identify a location that fits within your Club's budget.
Generally, you want to make sure the location is in a relatively safe area where the young people in your care will not be at a significant risk if they are outside your facility.

, Since you're going to be incorporating, you'll need to create a business plan for your Boys & Girls Club. These documents are fairly standard for nonprofit and for-profit corporations alike, and detail your mission, the programs you plan to offer, your budget, and your plans for funding.You can find templates for a nonprofit business plan online, or you can get samples from your national Boys & Girls Club office. You also might ask nearby chapters if you can look at theirs.
If you have no experience drawing up a document like this, it might be better to delegate this task to someone who does have experience, or talk to an experienced attorney. While your business plan is not a legal document, nonprofit planning attorneys will have experience creating them.
You also want to include a summary of the data you gathered when you researched your community to identify unmet needs.

, Your national organization may have sample documents or templates that you can use to create the legal documents you'll need for planning your organization.Templates take a lot of the guesswork out of these documents, which can get complicated – especially if you have no experience establishing a new business or nonprofit.
If you can't access the templates or samples you need, or if you find them too confusing to follow, contact an attorney who specialized in nonprofit organization and planning. It wouldn't hurt to have an attorney with nonprofit experience on your Board of Directors.

, Before you can officially open as a Boys & Girls Club affiliate, your organization must be incorporated as a non-profit corporation. The specific process varies greatly depending on where you are located.Generally, if you are located in the United States or Canada, you must become incorporated and then apply for tax-exempt nonprofit status with the national government. Keep in mind that this can take some time.
Expect to pay several hundred dollars (or the equivalent) in fees to become incorporated. There also are specific documents that must be filed with your state, local, and federal government.
If you have no experience with incorporating a business, leave this to someone who does or hire an attorney.

, Once your business and legal documents are in place, you'll want to name a specific person as director who will oversee the daily operations of the Club as well as being the point person for any communication.Since you're the one who wanted to start a Boys & Girls Club in your community, the director may very likely be you. However, you should be willing to pass the title to someone who has experience directing a Boys & Girls Club, if such a person is available.
You also can talk to staff at other Boys & Girls Clubs in your area to identify potential recruits. However, ideally you want your first director to be someone from your community who is extensively involved and has connections within the community.

, After your Club is incorporated, you can start soliciting donations for your Boys & Girls Club. While you're free to accept donations before incorporation, make sure your donors know that their donations will not be tax-deductible.Get together with your Board to brainstorm fundraising ideas. Invite directors of other Boys & Girls Clubs in nearby communities – you may be able to develop some joint projects.
Community leaders and elected officials can be a great source of funds. You might consider holding a dinner or raffle to get them involved.

, Your national Boys & Girls Club will probably have an application you must complete to gain provisional membership as an affiliate Club. After a set period of time, you can apply for full membership.While you have provisional status, you typically have to submit documents to the national organization regularly, and your activities and programs may be monitored or observed.
During this time, you also will receive guidance from the national organization that will help you build a strong foundation and get your club started on the right track.

, Established Boys & Girls Clubs in your area can be great resources when you're just getting your club off the ground. If there are still people involved in these clubs who were there at the founding, find out what mistakes they made and lessons they learned during that process.Connecting with these groups also gives you an air of legitimacy when you're just starting out – especially as you go looking for funding.
You also can learn from their experience and benefit from the roots they've put down in your region. If they see unmet needs in your community, they will be willing to help you make sure those needs are fulfilled.

, Because you are a nonprofit organization, the bulk of your staff will be made up of unpaid volunteers. Depending on where you're located, the Boys & Girls Club may have regulations to follow regarding how you recruit and screen volunteers.Since you're working with young people, all of your volunteers will have to submit to a background check to ensure that they can work with children. For example, someone who had been convicted of molesting a child should not be accepted as a volunteer.
Many of these background checks can be completed for free, while others require a small fee. Check with your national Boys & Girls Club office as well as your government to find out how to conduct thorough background checks of your applicants.

, Fliers at schools, public libraries, and community centers in your neighborhood may get the attention of young people (and their parents), but the internet may be your best bet to reach the most people.Set up a Facebook page for your Boys & Girls Club chapter and send invites to people in your community, encouraging them to ""like"" the page and spread the word.
When you're just starting out, holding an open community event, such as a board game night, can be a great way to get people interested in participating in your Club. Make sure you start each event with a brief presentation of your Club and the programs you have available.

Greet people in a refined manner.",How to Be Refined," You don’t need to spout of a list of facts or quote the entire Sunday paper in order to impress people with how refined you are. In fact, when it comes to being refined, less is more. You should say what’s on your mind in a succinct and clear way that leaves little up to doubt. Don’t bog your peers or strangers down in facts or in an effort to show off; instead, state your opinions briefly and confidently, and you’ll be showing that you’re a refined person who doesn’t need to ramble on to make a point.


You don’t need to speak in long, elaborate sentences to try to impress people. Short, concise sentences with clear words are best.
You also don’t need to use million-dollar words to make your points, either. It’s better if everyone can understand you.;
, Refined people are never in a rush because they’re sophisticated enough to give themselves time to do everything they want to do. They don’t rush to dinner, they don’t speak too fast, and they don’t rifle around their purses at top speed to find something because they already know that everything is in place. If you want to be refined, then you should work on moving in a confident, precise manner instead of moving fast, talking fast, and acting fast.


Instead of speaking fast and saying “um” and “like” every two seconds to fill the pauses, practice talking more slowly and really thinking before you speak so you can avoid using those conversational fillers.

, Though refined people do get their feathers ruffled on occasion, they tend to keep their cool in public. Therefore, they avoid cursing when they get upset or saying anything untoward in the heat of the moment. In fact, they generally avoid being vulgar by mentioning sex, going to the bathroom, or any other subjects that are likely to be distasteful to some people. This doesn’t mean that refined people are boring, but that they’re just classy. Cursing is a sign of bad breeding and refined people avoid it at all costs.


If you do lose your cool and curse, however, just apologize.

, Nobody can be refined all the time, and sometimes, our bodies betray us and make noises that make other people giggle. It’s okay if you find yourself belching after a meal or passing gas, but the best thing to do, if you want to be refined, is to politely excuse yourself instead of pretending like nothing happened. Swallow your pride and do this and you’ll be projecting refinement in no time.


Just a simple “pardon me” before moving on is perfectly fine.

, Though you don’t have to talk like Prince William, you should avoid using too much slang in your conversation if you want to sound refined. Avoid colloquialisms like “ya’ll” “you guys,” or “hella,” if you want to sound like a refined person who is cultured and well-mannered. Be aware of the regional phrases you use, or which terms come from pop culture, and try to find a way around them when you can. Refined people speak in a way that is timeless, not based on popular terms, such as “BFF” or “selfie.”


Of course, if everyone around you uses a ton of slang, you don’t want to stand out completely by using proper language, but you should avoid slang as much as possible to sound refined.

, If you want to be refined, then you should avoid talking about anything that can be viewed as offensive, especially if you find yourself in mixed company. Remember that something that might go over well with your best friend may not work well in a crowd; avoid talking about sex, body parts, using the bathroom, or any statements that may be seen as offensive or off-color that relate to politics. It’s better to assume that the people around you can be easily offended than to make what you think is an innocent joke that ends up really hurting a person’s feelings. To be refined, you can still discuss interesting topics while making sure that you’re not scandalizing anyone.


If someone else brings up a vulgar topic that you’re not comfortable with, you can also do your best to steer the conversation in a direction that makes you feel more comfortable.

, Refined people rarely say something that is thoughtless or offensive and don’t often find themselves apologizing for misspeaking because they’ve thought everything through. They don’t blurt out the first thing that comes to their heads and stop to ask themselves how the comment would be received and if their intentions would be clear before they said anything. Refined people literally take the time to “refine” their words before they say them, so that they are said with elegance and grace.


Before you say something, look at the person you’re talking to and think about whether the statement would make the person upset, or, if you’re in a large group, if the statement would be better made privately.

, You don’t have to give fake compliments you don’t believe in just to sound refined, but you should work on making people feel special when they deserve it. The art of giving a compliment is a difficult one to master, and once you learn how to compliment a person’s important traits without overstepping your bounds, you’ll be on your way to sounding even more refined than ever. Refined people also have an eye for detail and are quick to notice a new piece of jewelry or footwear that is truly worth complimenting.


To sound truly refined, you can say something like, “That’s the most exquisite scarf I’ve ever seen” instead of, “Oh my god, what an awesome scarf!”

, Refined people are confident that what they say will be heard because they’ve chosen their words carefully. Speaking so loud that the person across the restaurant can hear every word you say is a sign of bad breeding, as well as a lack of respect toward others. Make sure you modulate your voice when you talk to people, and wait to grab their attention instead of speaking so loudly that they are forced to listen.


Don’t loudly interrupt people to try to get your point across, either. Wait your turn if you want to be refined.

, People who are refined have opinions, but they tend to keep them to themselves when they involve other people in a negative light. If you want to be refined, then you should be above gossiping about other people, starting rumors, or asking if your two co-workers or classmates are hooking up. If you have the reputation of being a gossip, then people won’t think of you as refined at all; instead, they’ll see you as an unsophisticated, immature person. To be truly refined, you should be positive if you plan on talking about a person who isn’t in the room.


Instead, practice saying nice things about people “behind their backs.” Say nice things about people who aren’t in the room and it will get back to them.

, Refined people don’t pick fights with people and don’t make a big deal about it if they disagree with something. They are still comfortable stating their opinions, but they don’t do so to make other people feel bad or to look superior. If you find someone challenging your ideas when you’re having a conversation, then you should be polite about disagreeing, and not resort to name calling. Refined people should be easy to get along with, and are easygoing and tend to go with the flow instead of being prickly or confrontational.


If you’re asked to settle an argument and know the answer — lets say people are debating about whether a quote is attributed to The Bible or Shakespeare — then it’s best to say you’re not sure of the answer even if you do. There’s no need to cause conflict.
If someone is trying to tell you your opinions are worthless, do not engage. Take the high road and exit the conversation instead of being determined to prove the person wrong.

, Refined people are knowledgeable and interesting, but they don’t need to brag to make it known. Even if you’ve memorized every scene in every Goddard film or speak eight foreign languages, you shouldn’t go telling everyone you know. Instead, wait for your areas of interest to come up in conversation so that people can be impressed by how much you know instead of thinking you’re obnoxious for showing off. When you share what you do know, don’t act like an authority but just casually mention the information in a friendly way instead.


You should praise people on their achievements as often as you can instead of harping on your own.
If you’ve really accomplished a lot, then people will hear about it. If they mention it, be modest instead of acting like yeah, you know you’re pretty great.

, If you really want to be refined, then it’s important for you to spend time with like-minded people. Refined people spend time with other people they can talk to about politics, wine, traveling, other cultures, foreign films, cultural events in their areas, and other subjects of interest. They don’t spend time with too many people who can’t contribute much to a conversation or who don’t listen to anything other than Top 40 and watch Judge Judy for a cultural good time. They tend to be friends with people who can stimulate them and encourage them to be even better than they are.


Though it’s not refined to completely ditch someone in your circle because you think that person makes you look bad, you should think about the company you keep. If you think you spend too much time with people who are vulgar, lack class, and who bring you down, then it’s time to reconsider those relationships.

, People who are refined have interesting opinions about politics, sports, cuisine, wine, and other subjects, but they try to avoid being a bore and talking about them all night long. They also tend to avoid being self-absorbed and talking about themselves incessantly. They’d prefer to talk about other people or about interesting world matters instead. It’s not refined to do 90% of the talking in a conversation, no matter how interesting you may think you are.


If you’ve noticed that you’re dominating a conversation, switch gears and ask the people you’re with light questions, from what they’re doing this weekend to what their favorite sports team is.

, Good manners are a sign of refinement. In order to have good manners, you’ll need to eat with your mouth closed, avoid cursing, wait your turn, hold doors and pull out chairs for people, and generally conduct yourself in an admirable fashion. People with good manners are sensitive to the needs of others and make sure other people, whether they are guests or serving you coffee, are feeling comfortable. Ask people how they are, respect their space, and avoid making a mess if you want to have good manners.


Be polite. Always greet people in a friendly fashion, introduce yourself to people you don’t know if they join a conversation, and avoid being unnecessarily rude to people even if you think they deserve it.

, You don’t have to speak seventeen languages to be cultured, but it does help to know something about other cultures, whether it’s knowing how to correctly pronounce “foie gras” when you order at a French restaurant, or you know that, in certain cultures, it’s polite to remove your shoes when you enter a person’s house. There’s no one way to suddenly become cultured, but you can make an effort to get to know how people live in other parts of the world, to watch foreign films, sample the cuisines of other countries, and most importantly, avoid having the attitude that everything is done the “right way” in your country.


Make a point of attending cultural events in your area, whether there are local theatres or museum openings.
Read, read, read. Become knowledgeable on everything from ancient philosophy to contemporary poetry. Refined people tend to be very well-read.

, Refined people speak with extreme tact and understand that they have to choose their words and timing carefully when it comes to saying something. They don’t overstep their bounds and get too friendly with people they don’t know that well, they deflect negative comments from others, and they are able to be discreet when it’s necessary. They are masters at being gracious and don’t make people feel embarrassed in public.


Have a sense of a person’s sense of humor before you try to make a joke.
Avoid mentioning how much money you make or asking about a person’s salary. That is seen as crude and not tactful at all.
If someone has something in his teeth, for example, a tactful person would try to tell him privately.
Tactful people also know that timing is important. You may be excited to announce that you’re pregnant, but you should see that you should avoid doing this when your friend is gushing about her engagement.

, Refined people take great care with their dress because they understand that an appearance of refinement is crucial to forming their refined persona. They pick clothes that are flattering, that match the season, that aren’t too revealing, and that look good together. Their clothes are tucked in, free of stains, and appropriate for the season. They tend to wear clothes with subtle colors, such as greys, browns, and blues, and don’t call too much attention to themselves with their dress.


Refined people also tend to dress more elegant than most; men often wear suits or business casual wear even if in occasion doesn’t call for it, and refined women tend to wear dresses and heels along with tasteful jewelry.
Your clothes don’t have to be expensive for you to look refined. You just have to make sure they fit well, match, and are free of wrinkles.
Excessive shiny jewelry or accessories won’t make you look more refined. In fact, just one subtle watch or pair of silver earrings will do the trick and will be far better than looking flashy.
Refined people tend to avoid graphic tee shirts or anything else that would make people laugh.

, People who are refined take the time to comb their hair and make sure that they never look unkempt. Refined men tend to shave their faces or to maintain a very well-manicured beard. Refined people also generally look neat, clean, and like they put time and effort into their appearance. If you want to be refined, then you have to make a point of grooming yourself so that you are presentable when you step out.


Make a habit of carrying a comb and using it in private when necessary.
Women can wear subtle makeup, but they should avoid going over-the-top or they won’t look very refined. Just some subtle lipstick, a bit of mascara, and some light eye shadow will do the trick.

, If you want to be refined, then you should shower daily, wash your hair every day or at least every other day, wear deodorant (if you believe in it), and add some cologne or a light perfume into the mix if you like the effect. You should also brush your teeth at least twice a day and generally make sure that you smell nice and clean and look fresh anywhere you go. It’s hard to look refined if you have greasy hair and smell like B.O. Along with grooming yourself, maintaining proper hygiene is an important aspect of being refined.

, Refined people know how to carry themselves. They stand up straight and maintain good posture even when they’re sitting. They keep their hands respectably folded across their legs when they sit and avoid putting their elbows on a table when they dine. They don’t slouch, fidget, or pick their noses in public. In general, they act respectful toward their own bodies as well as the people around them. To be refined, have body language that shows you have self-respect without making yourself too much at home anywhere you go.


Avoid sitting with your legs spread wide, because this can be seen as a bit vulgar.
Avoid scratching yourself in public. If you have an itch you really have to scratch, you’ll be better off scratching it in the bathroom.
When you talk to people, stand at a respectable distance away from them. Close-talkers tend not to be refined.

, You may have an image of a refined person as a snob who would sooner turn his nose up at a new person than smile or make eye contact, but people who are truly refined know that other people deserve to be treated with respect. Making eye contact with people and smiling when you meet them or approach them is a common courtesy and shows them that you look at them as individuals who are worthy of your time. Eye contact also shows people that you have their attention, which is very respectful and refined.


Avoid checking your phone or texting when you’re talking to people and focus on the eye contact instead. Not paying attention to people is not very refined.

, If you want to be refined, then you should treat people with respect when they come up to you. Don’t be too lazy to stand up to shake the hand of a new acquaintance or to introduce yourself by name. If a person you already know is approaching, it’s still polite to stand to greet that person if you want to be refined. If you just lift a hand and say, “hey,” then you may be seen as being a bit socially lazy, which is a sign of a lack of refinement.


It’s also polite to repeat the person’s name if you meet him or her for the first time. You can say something like, “It’s great to finally meet you, Jason.”

Be polite and charming.,
Understand etiquette.,
Dress well.,
Know what you're talking about.,
Read a quality publication.,
Be respectful.",How to Become a Sophisticated Adult," Being polite and charming is mostly about being aware of your companions and their feelings. Is your dinner companion an avid golfer? Then let him/her discuss golf. Express an interest in the subject. Respond intelligently with whatever knowledge you may have that relates. If you know nothing about golf, let them talk. Human beings like to talk; the best conversationalists let others talk and keep the conversation moving with leading questions and the occasional meaningful, insightful, or witty comment. A leading question is one that ""leads"" your conversation partner to speak at more length than a simple yes or no answer. Never interrupt and never forcefully assert your knowledge. Being selflessly aware of your companions' interests can give the impression of charm.;
, Etiquette is a system of manners and customs that each individual culture devises. The main purpose of etiquette in most modern cultures is to make those around you more comfortable or at ease. Be careful, however, because etiquette is different in each culture. It's important to study the rules of etiquette that your culture/society has adopted. There are plenty of online resources for that type of research. Use them. Study what is appropriate at various types of social functions, not just at the dinner table. And, when in doubt, ask yourself ""What will make my companions more comfortable--behavior A or behavior B?""

, It's important to know what colors and what clothing styles suit you. By reading fashion magazines, you can get a better understanding of current trends but be wary of being too trendy--you can go broke keeping up with this season's latest. It's better to build your wardrobe on a solid foundation of classics that don't change much from season to season but that can easily be accessorized to keep them current. Do your research and find out what doesn't change much but also works for your personal style and body type. Get the advice of a professional if you don't know.

, It's important to be as knowledgeable about as broad a range of subjects as you can be. Read! Read everything, from newspapers to non-fiction books to magazines to scientific journals to literature. Being actually knowledgeable about a subject keeps you from appearing like that know-it-all buffoon who talks too much at parties and doesn't really know much about anything. You know who I mean. You've seen him/her before. Avoid that by actually being knowledgeable and by not speaking up when you don't know anything. Abraham Lincoln once said, ""Better to remain silent and thought a fool than to speak out and remove all doubt."" If you want more specific direction, read up on your friends' interests. At least you'll be able to listen intelligently.

, Do you feel overwhelmed by the amount of material that one can read? Start with newspapers. Find a good national or local paper ,preferably one that covers international events. Good magazines like TIME are easy to read and entertaining. If you can't subscribe to a newspaper www.nytimes.com is a good place to start. Here's a secret to coming across as well read - read abridged ( shortened) versions of classics or read book reviews. Book reviews give you enough information to carry on conversations about famous or award winning authors. Find a category of fiction you like and read up at the local library. If the size of books frighten you, you are not ready to become a sophisticated adult. Don't forget about poetry - start with a poet whose work you studied at school and go on from there. And one more final advice- if you are truly desperate and absolutely can't read the book- see a movie version of it!

, First, it's important to respect yourself. Understand your strengths and weaknesses. Learn to appreciate your strengths and forgive your weaknesses while improving those that you can. From this base, you'll have the sensitivity and confidence to be respectful of others' feelings and needs.

Progressive muscle relaxation.
Listening to soothing music.
Taking a walk.

Meditation.;
, Unrealistic thought patterns can intensify feelings of anger, so try to identify and challenge these as they occur.For example, an unrealistic thought might be something like, “My roommate never does anything to help keep our apartment clean! I do everything!”
Before you allow yourself to get angrier due to this thought, take a moment to decide if this is really true. Does your roommate do different things than you do to keep the apartment clean? If so, then the word “never” in this statement is not realistic.
Try rewriting the thought or statement into something more realistic, such as “I wish my roommate would pitch in a little more than she does with household chores.”

, Having good problem solving skills can also help to reduce feelings of anger and frustration. It may help you to feel more in control, even if you are dealing with something really frustrating. This is a skill that takes time to develop, so try to be patient.When you are facing a problem, try taking time to identify the problem before you try to solve it. Then, make a list of all the possible solutions available to you and choose the best one. After putting your solution into action, reflect on how it went and see how you can adjust your strategy for a better result in the future.

, When you don't say anything, and you're frustrated, bottling up your anger is not the best thing to do. Instead of letting frustration build to rage, speak up and confront the source of your frustration. Don't be afraid of making a situation awkward, because talking it out is better than being mean in the future.


If you've felt disrespected or hurt by someone, you may want to inflict the same emotional pain upon them. Instead of doing this, let them know that they hurt your feelings and that you felt disrespected by their actions.
Instead of letting your anger build, let the person know what they did wrong. Say something like ""I don't like that you did that. It really makes me angry and upset.""

, Instead of using your energy to be mean to others, redirect it to a sport or hobby that you want to pursue. Make sure to stay active. When you exercise or do something active, it releases positive endorphins in your brain that make you happier.You can do a team sport like football, baseball, soccer, or hockey.
If you don't like physical sports, try doing something creative like learning how to play an instrument or learning how to paint.

, Identify when your anger starts to escalate and be aware of how mad you are. When you feel like you're reaching that place, take a step back from the argument and walk away.Be polite and explain why you're walking away. Don't leave the situation up in the air forever. Regain your composure and talk to the person again when your anger has subsided.


You can say, ""I need to take a walk because I'm getting really angry and I'm trying to stay calm. I need some time to think about this, but we can talk when I get back.""

Practice being more compassionate.,
Develop your communication skills.,
Be more patient.,
Don't be cynical.,
Practice empathy.,
Stop being defensive.",How to Become a Nicer Person to Others2," Make it a point to be kinder to others, and try to see things from their perspective. Instead of making comments that would hurt someone's feelings, think of ways to make their day better. If you have the time, go out of your way to do small things for others, and they will come to appreciate you more.


For instance, instead of making fun of someone to make yourself feel better, give them a compliment and make their day better.
Practicing compassion can make you a healthier and happier person.You can also buy a friend a small gift like candy or a book to show your appreciation for them.

, Being able to listen well and communicate in a constructive, assertive way may also help you to feel in control of your anger and be kind to others.Communicating your feelings and emotions will help other people understand your frame of mind and relieve a lot of stress. Often arguments or disagreements can arise because of a lack of communication and a lack of understanding when it comes to people's motivations. Try to be more truthful in conversation, even if it makes the situation less than perfect, or you think that the person may not like you for it. Do not skirt around issues that make you feel uncomfortable.


Put away distractions and give the person your full attention. As you listen, try to suspend judgment. Just try to understand what the person is saying and where they are coming from.
When you express yourself, use “I” statements instead of “you” statements. Try saying things like, “I feel frustrated when you forget to pick up your dishes.” Don’t say things like, “You never clean up after yourself!”
Communicating effectively also means sometimes being vulnerable and talking about things that could be embarrassing.
For example, if a friend does something you don't approve of, instead of yelling and saying things that you'll regret, say something like, ""When you made that joke, and everyone laughed, it made me feel sad. I was humiliated, and even though you didn't think it was a big deal, it really hurt my feelings.""

, People can't read your mind and for some, learning new things may take longer for them than it takes for others. Instead of escalating to anger immediately, be more patient with people. Think back to when you were doing something for the first time or when you needed help. Realize that not everyone's perfect. If someone is doing something that annoys you, instead of letting it go until you're angry, confront the person and have a conversation.


If your roommate is tapping their pencil and it's stopping you from doing your work, say something like ""Hey, I know this seems crazy, but I really can't get this paper done while you’re tapping that pencil. Do you mind stopping while I do my work?""

, Being cynical all the time can put you in a bad mood and make you more irritable. Typically cynicism is a defense mechanism that you're likely to employ when you are disappointed or feel let down. Instead of expressing your emotions in a healthy and constructive way, you bottle them up and minimize the impact of your feelings to other people and yourself.This can spiral into having a negative view of the world, and it can put you in a constant state of anger.


Don't put down other people's work or effort. Admire someone when they excel at something instead of dismissing it or minimizing it.
Try to reduce the amount of judgment you put on others. If you don't understand a subculture or demographic of people, look to immerse yourself in their world instead of senselessly hating it.

, Empathy involves understanding and internalizing the feelings and emotions of another person. Try to put yourself in the person's shoes, and talk to people without passing judgment on them first. When someone is experiencing pain, relate to their emotions instead of dismissing them. Engage in active listening instead of waiting for the other person to stop talking. Internalize what they are saying, and try to feel the emotions that they feel. This can give you a better understanding of their perspective and actions.


To improve your active listening, concentrate on paying attention to what the person is saying, provide feedback to show that you're listening, and defer any judgment you may have. Instead of criticizing them, try supporting the person.
Think back to a time when you were under similar circumstances and try to reflect on how badly it felt.

, Don't put walls up and don't be suspicious of everyone you meet. This hurts your interactions with others. If you've done something wrong, take personal responsibility for your actions and don't blame other people for things you've done. Be open to making new friends and improving existing friendships.If someone makes a valid suggestion, instead of getting angry at them for pointing out a weakness, say ""You're right. I need to work on it, and I am, but it's a process.""
Instead of automatically taking comments in a negative light, ask the person ""What do you mean by that?"" Once they explain, it may not be as harmful as you initially thought.

Help people when you see them in need.,
Be there for your friends when they need someone to talk to.,
Work on improving your community.,
Do more things around the house.",How to Become a Nicer Person to Others3," Instead of turning away or thinking that it's someone else's responsibility, do your best to help people that are in need. Think of easy things that you can do during your day to help people that can't help themselves. You could help a younger family member set up their computer or help an elderly person with their groceries.


The more you help others on your accord, the happier you'll be., Friendship is a critical aspect in your happiness. Having a support system to talk to when times are bad gives us a sense of belonging. Having friends will lower your blood pressure and you'll be less prone to depression.However, friendship is built on communication and vulnerability. If you're mean or judgemental, friends will not want to come to you, and will not be as supportive when you need them.


Stay attentive and listen.
Sometimes friends don't want advice, just someone to talk to.
If you've talked to your friend about a serious issue, it'll be easier to talk to them about serious problems in your life.

, If you have the time, consider volunteering at a local community center, homeless shelter, or soup kitchen near you. Look into other projects locally, like efforts to that plant trees or work to beautify your town. The more you get to know other people who are working for a positive future, the more fulfilled you'll feel, and less prone to angry outbursts.


Volunteering with a group of people will also give you a sense of belonging to a community which will increase your happiness and make you less angry. Having a support system when times are hard can help us cope with daily stress., If you're younger, this means doing your chores without being asked and genuinely trying to help when you see that your family is overwhelmed. If you are a parent or in a relationship, do something for your partner like fixing something that's been broken, or making dinner for them. Find extra things to do around the house to alleviate your partner's stress.


Communicate with your family and ask them if there's anything else that needs to be done around the house.
A clean and organized house can actually boost your energy and make you happier."

Reflect.",How to Become a Decent Person," Part of being decent if giving others a reason to trust you. Part of building trust involves being a dependable person. Work on following through on promises and obligations.Keep up with your promises. If you promise to be somewhere at a certain time, be there. If you say you'll do a favor, do it. While it's okay to slip up every once in awhile, as everyone does, you want to be as consistently reliable as possible.
Decent people follow through because they want others to feel safe and secure. People need reliable friends and family members to have a sense of security in their lives.;
, Decent people withhold judging others too harshly. Remember, you cannot fully understand what it's like to be inside someone else's head. Therefore, avoid trying to pass judgement on a behavior or a decision.Try to be accepting of other people's decisions. Even if you would not act the same way, withhold passing judgement. It's okay to put yourself in someone else's shoes and try to understand their decision, but do so without the intent to judge.
Everyone is different. Therefore, it should not be surprising if another person's choice differs from your own. In the event you find someone who's lifestyle is confusing to you, see this as an opportunity to embrace difference rather than pass judgment.

, Think about times in your life that were hard. You probably had friends, family members, and other loved ones helping you along the way. If you want to be a decent person, you should strive to provide support in return. When people go through difficult times, put yourself out there and help.It can be difficult to know what to do to help in certain situations, but keep in mind just listening and showing you care is often enough. You can phone a friend going through something stressful and just let them talk.
If there is something tangible you can do, do so. For example, in the aftermath of a family death, you could offer to do small chores like dishes and other errands for a grieving friend.
In addition to showing support during bad times, show support during good times as well. It's important to feel genuinely happy for people's successes rather than fostering feelings of jealousy.

, It's very important that you listen to others if you want to be a decent person. In addition to making another person feel valued, you learn through listening. If you listen to those around you, you will become more open-minded by learning about the experience, opinions, and feelings of others.You should always listen to others as much as you talk. In addition to listening, make sure you understand. Ask follow up questions about an opinion or thought that intrigues you. If you're confused, ask for clarification.

, Relationships are not about maintaining a perfect balance 100% of the time. There is a give and take that changes across time. Avoid score-keeping in your personal relationships, as this can create feelings of hostility and resentment.Don't worry about petty things, like who initiated the last hang out or bought the more expensive birthday present. In the long run, things should all balance out.
Remember, you will never be completely evenly balanced with another person. That's okay. You may be better at returning phone calls, while your friend may thrive at planning get-togethers. If you have a healthy relationship with another person, score keeping is not important.

, Being a decent person means being honest, even when it's difficult. You should be comfortable sharing your beliefs and opinions with others, even if you sometimes put yourself in opposition to the group.There is a difference between expressing a contrary opinion and being judgmental. It's okay if you, say, disagree with a friend's opinion or even a decision they make. As long as you've considered the other side, it's okay to disagree. Just remember you're disagreeing with an opinion or action and not judging your friend as a person.
Sometimes, you may have to be honest if you're worried about a friend's well being. In these cases, try to be objective in your take on the situation. How would you see this friend's behavior if you weren't emotionally invested in the situation?

, Part of being decent is fostering a sense of positivity. It's hard to be good to others and pleasant to be around if you harbor a lot of negative thoughts. Work on seeing humor in negative situations. This will build your resiliency and make you easier to be around and to rely on for support.If you have a setback, try to laugh it off. You can, for example, crack a self-depreciating joke if you don't get a promotion at work. If you run late to a meeting due to a late train, laugh about your typical bad luck.
If you're unable to laugh at yourself, you may build up negativity over time. This can lead to you becoming hostile and resentful, making it more difficult to be decent and kind to others.

, You do not want to hold on to past hurt and resentment if you want to be a decent person. Work on practicing forgiveness in your daily life so you can be better and kinder to others.Always look at the bigger picture. The second you feel anger building, stop and think, ""Will I still be mad about this in a month? A year?"" You'll find many small indiscretions will fade with time.
Try to have empathy for the other person. Maybe someone, for example, had a bad day and took it out on you. You've probably done the same thing yourself in the past. Maybe, therefore, it would be better not to judge.
You always have a choice as to whether or not you accept someone's apology. Try to usually accept. It may take time to get your relationship back where it was. You may, for example, not want to go out with a friend for a bit after they hurt you. However, accepting the apology is an acknowledgment you want to work on repairing the relationship.

, Anger can be detrimental to your emotional well-being. If you live with a lot of anger, you're more likely to be hostile to others. Becoming a decent person often means letting go of some anger and resentment.If you find yourself becoming angry, take physical means to calm down. Take deep, steady breaths. Tense and release one muscle at a time. This will release some tension, lessening some of your anger.
Avoid taking things personally. Even if someone personally upset or offended you, remember there's a good chance it was unintentional. If someone, for example, cuts you off during a work meeting, assume they probably did not realize you weren't finished talking. Don't take it as a slight.
If you do encounter someone who's overtly hostile and mean, resist the urge to get angry at that person. Instead, focus on yourself. Think something like, ""I am so lucky I'm decent and good to others. I would not want to act like that.""

, You will feel better about yourself and the world if you're kind to those around you. This can make it easier to be a decent person, as you'll feel happier and more fulfilled. You won't have as much brain space focused on negative thoughts.Try to compliment people as much as you can. Congratulate a co-worker on her successful presentation. Let your older brother know how much you appreciate his sense of humor.
People love being around those who are genuinely positive and kind. To be a decent person, you want to bring people up rater than down. In addition to making others feel good, you will feel better as well. Positivity is infectious, and the kind words you say to others will influence your own inner monologue.

, It can be difficult to be kind to others if you feel bad about yourself. You need to make your own self-esteem a priority if you want to be a decent person. Take time working on your own self-image to make sure you feel good about yourself.Strive for realistic self-esteem. You should be able to accept you have flaws, and admit to them, but also embrace your good qualities. Like everyone, you're a mix of good and bad qualities. Being comfortable with this is key to solid self esteem.
If you struggle with your self-esteem, you may want to talk to a therapist. A qualified therapist can help you work out any underlying mental health issues potentially affecting your self-esteem.

, Being empathetic requires attention to the world around you. If you want to foster a greater sense of empathy, focus on the needs and emotions of others in the larger world. This will teach you to make thinking about other people a priority.Empathy requires more than just base knowledge. You also have to analyze and consider that knowledge to help you get a more accurate sense of someone else's experiences. When you hear news about another person, work to interpret that news.
For example, you hear a friend lost his brother to an undetected heart condition. Naturally, your friend will feel sad but push deeper. This loss was completely unexpected. Your friend likely feels shocked, cheated, and angry.
What does your friend need from you? Your friend may need someone to vent to, but you can expect your friend may be angry. They experienced a senseless loss. In addition to normal crying, your friend may need to express their anger and resentment.

, Part of empathizing is finding a way to relate to others. In your day-to-day life, be on the lookout for the values we all share. This will help you feel connected with everyone around you.If you've never experience someone's exact situation, stop and think if you've experienced something similar. For example, a friend loses a parent. Both your parents are still alive, but you lost your grandfather. While it is not the same as losing a parent, you still have a sense of loss. This can help you connect with a grieving friend.
Always be looking for these kinds of shared values. Think about the emotions behind a situation. A friend finds out her husband has been unfaithful, for example. The base emotions here are likely loss, heartbreak, and betrayal. You have probably experienced all of these feelings, even if you have not experienced that exact situation.

, If you are judging or critiquing the behavior of others, this blocks your ability to empathize. You do not need to agree with everyone's behavior, opinions, and actions. However, try to keep your initial reactions empathetic. Do not judge as an initial response to a situation.Remember, people often do not want solutions or critiques right away. If someone comes to you with a problem, do not respond by explaining how the person can fix the problem. Initially, just try to empathize with what the other person is experiencing.
With time, someone may want honest judgement or critique. However, initially, a friend or family may just want an empathetic ear. Therefore, it's often best to withhold initial judgement.

, When interacting with someone, try to imagine what they're going through. Think about what the other person is feeling or thinking. This will make your interactions far more genuine.Remember, you don't have to agree with someone 100% of the time. However, try to go into each conversation with the primary goal of understanding. You may, for example, think your friend should be over their ex by now. Focus on why they're not when you talk.
Always force yourself to imagine when you talk with others. Why is this person feeling this way? How would I feel if I were in their shoes? If you're having trouble understanding someone, ask open-ended questions like, ""What do you mean by that?"" and ""Can you explain more?""

, Empathy requires a lot of reflection. After gathering information about a person or a situation, work hard to digest that information.Process any information you are given. If you know a lot about a friend's personal history, for example, use this information to try to understand their actions.
For example, your friend Jess is very nervous about her boyfriend having tea with an ex-girlfriend. While the reaction seems over-the-top, pause and reflect. Maybe Jess has been cheated on many times in the past. This would explain her insecurity.

Ask open questions.",How to Be Yourself Around Someone You Admire or Like1," Smiling has been shown to give people a better impression of you. When you smile, you show that you’re friendly and confident. If you want to make a good impression on someone you admire, it’s best to smile when you meet them., One of the key strategies for keeping calm when you’re nervous for any reason is simply to breathe and focus on your breathing. Your heart will naturally slow down and you’ll feel calmer., When nervous, we tend to speed up our speech, and this can cause another person to miss what we say. When talking to someone you like, you won’t want them to miss what you say. Speed-talking will make you seem nervous. Just repeat to yourself, “Slow down. It’s going to be okay.”, Making eye contact will make them feel as though you’re paying attention.You’ll want to keep a good posture by standing with your back straight and your arms at your side. If you’re meeting this person for the first time, be careful not to act overly familiar by waving as though you know them., In addition to helping you keep calm, paying attention to what they are saying will allow you to have something intelligent to say back. You may find yourself getting lost in anxiety or overthinking what you want to say to them. If that happens, think to yourself, “Listen.” This should help you return to the moment., By asking open questions, you can get to know who they really are, not just your impression of them. It's okay to be quiet and listen while they talk. Give yourself time to think about an open question they've asked. You might say, ""Let me think about that for a second."" As long as you answer the question openly and honestly, such a response won't make you seem like you're dodging something uncomfortable.It's also perfectly okay to set boundaries when they ask something you don't feel comfortable asking. You can say something like, ""I appreciate how curious you are, but I'm not really comfortable answering that right now."""

You may wish to write it down, or simply make a list in your head. Exploring your reason will help you commit to a decision and discover your priorities.


You won't automatically gain points for being ""correct."" This isn't a math test.
You are allowed to say whatever you want to say. Similarly, other people are allowed to voice disagreement, and free speech won't protect you from the consequences of your words. Your voice is your choice.
No one is an angel. You will slip up sometimes, and that's normal. What's most important is that you make an effort, apologize if you hurt someone, and listen to others.;
, Consider any conscious or unconscious prejudices you may hold. This can also include stereotypes you believe about groups of people. If you are aware of any negative feelings or stereotypes you hold towards individuals or groups, it will help you adjust your language and behavior towards your goal of being a respectful person.


There are a few ways to assess your own prejudices. What do you think when you hear an ethnic last name? What is your first instinct if you learn someone is gay or transgender? Being honest about your initial reactions can help you identify your prejudices.Besides acknowledging your prejudices, one excellent tool to identify any negative feelings you might need to work on is the Implicit Association Test (IAT). You can find this psychological test online to determine your prejudices., Understanding the prejudice in your society and around the world can help open your eyes. Learning about the struggles of others different than you can help you reevaluate your own preconceived notions. Education is an excellent way to overcome prejudices, understand those different than us, and become politically correct.


Individuals and groups are discriminated against for many different reasons including race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, culture, and socio-economic status. If you're unsure of these groups, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has information on groups who experience discrimination.
Taking a course at a university or doing some research online can help you learn more about prejudice.

, Stepping outside of your comfort zone is an important step for gaining awareness. Being politically correct doesn't just mean being mindful of what you say. It also means learning about those different from you and respecting those differences. Reach out, interact, talk, and befriend those who have a different background than you.Find coworkers or classmates who are different from you. Ask those people from a different ethnicity, religion, sexuality, or country to go to lunch. If you're not that close, just start a conversation with them. You can talk about your differences, but you may be surprised how much you have in common.
Find culturally diverse events and experiences. Developing your thoughts and understanding that all people are equal through interactive learning will foster a respectful attitude.

, Especially if you are a member of a privileged group, you may not understand the lived experiences of oppressed groups. This can be counteracted by asking questions and listening closely to the answers.


Check a search engine to see if any writers have answered your question online.
Keep your questions respectful and not too personal. ""What pronouns should I use when referring to you?"" and ""Do you know of any good online resources where I can learn more about transgender issues?"" are both reasonable questions. ""What do your genitals look like?"" is a very private question that should only be asked if you want to have sex with them, or you are a doctor and you need to know for medical reasons..

, If you educate yourself and monitor your thoughts, this will help control and change your language and behaviors. People may interpret and draw inferences from the language you use. When you are interacting with people, you want to be an open, respectful, and informed individual instead of a careless, disrespectful person.


Avoid racist, sexist, homophobic, etc. jokes because they are always hurtful.

, Recognize racist roots of words, whether they are as inflammatory as the n-word or as subtle as referring to immigrants as illegals.


Many common expressions have roots in discrimination caused by cultural arrogance and a lack of exposure to cultural diversity. Terms such as ""Chinese auction,"" ""Indian giver,"" ""Jew down"" (negotiate), and ""gyp"" (a bad deal, from the derogatory term ""Gypsy"" for the Roma) are racist.
Many common words also have implicit discrimination in them and are thus considered harmful. For example, words such as ""gypsy"" and ""oriental"" are derogatory. Instead use ""Roma"" for ""gypsy"" or ""Asian"" for ""oriental.Some common actions, including wearing Halloween costumes, involve cultural appropriation—cheaply borrowing cultural aspects that people of color often face discrimination for doing authentically, and turning it into a trend or game. This includes wearing headdresses or feathers like many Native Americans. ""Black Face,"" which is using makeup to represent a black person, ""Yellow Face"" (mimicking Asian people), and other similar things are extreme versions.

, Some people are bisexual, transgender, asexual, genderfluid, etc. and they deserve respect and inclusion. Work on substituting gender-neutral language to include people of different sexual orientations and gender identities.


Ask ""Do you have any partners?"" rather than ""Do you have a boyfriend/girlfriend?""Don't assume that people are heterosexual and monogamous.
Don't generalize about genitals. Some women have penises and some men have clitorises. Furthermore, intersex people exist.
Respect gender identities. There are more than two genders, and agender, genderfluid, etc. people exist. A person's real name is the name that they accept as the one that matches their gender.
If you're unsure how to be respectful towards someone's identity, just ask them. They'll appreciate your good intentions.

, Gender-specific language can be extremely harmful. Sexism, or discrimination against a person due to their marginalized gender identity, is used often (and frequently inadvertently). Try to avoid giving things genders in your mind, or out loud things, such as jobs; additionally, refrain from claiming actions, occupations, or items are ""male"" or ""female.""


Use gender-neutral job titles when you aren't referring to a specific person. For example, say ""chairperson"" instead of ""chairman""; ""firefighter"" is preferable to ""fireman""; a ""police officer"" includes all genders; and ""flight attendant"" replaces ""steward"" and ""stewardess.""The use of gender-specific titles is usually acceptable when addressing an individual. For example, if you are in a meeting and introducing Mr. Christopher Smith, the CEO of a company, then you may say, ""Please welcome Mr. Smith, our Chairman of the Board.""
Using terms and titles such as ""woman's work"" or ""secretary"" (instead of ""administrative assistant"") is demeaning and belittling.
Calling women ""girls"" (instead of ""ladies"" or ""women"") is infantilizing and discounts that the place of women in the world is equal to men.

, Violence is a serious issue that many people reference or joke about in casual conversation, alienating victims and making it difficult for them to speak up. You can help by respecting them and taking them seriously.


Recognize that most (but not all!) victims are female. Use gender-inclusive language when discussing these social issues.
Making comments like ""she asked for it"" about rape victims or statements about a woman's physical appearance are dismissive and cruel.
Avoid rape jokes, as these can be hurtful to survivors.

, The world has innumerable different religions and not everyone shares the same beliefs. When speaking to a group of people, you may be talking to people from many different religions, or speaking to people who are agnostic or atheist. Limit the amount of religious terms in your language, especially when speaking in groups of people.Save the religious discussions for when you're with people of your religion.


Avoid religious statements when talking to non-religious people, or people of an unknown religion. For example, instead of telling a sick atheist you'll pray for them, say that your thoughts are with them and their family.
It's also a good idea to avoid referencing ""God/god."" Every religious group has different names for and rules for saying the term. Jews do not say the name of god, Muslims refer to their god as Allah, and Hindus worship many different gods.Asking questions like ""what would Jesus do?"" to an individual or group that is not Christian is ill-advised.
There is an exception to using religious terms: to describe either academic or specific characteristics of a religious group. You may say ""Evangelical Christians hold certain beliefs..."", or ""members of the Jewish faith celebrate Yom Kippur..."".

, Some people prefer identity-first language (""disabled person"") while others prefer person-first language (""person with a disability""), and it's best to respect their individual preference. Make sure not to use derogatory terms such as ""ret*rd"" and ""midget,"" and avoid using words rooted in disability as insults.


Words such as ""dumb,"" ""crippled,"" ""derp,"" and ""psycho"" are examples of disability-based insults/slurs.They imply that disability is demeaning, and that disabled people wouldn't agree with your opinion.
Treat disabled people like ordinary people, accommodating any needs without resistance, and treating the disability as natural. Offer help if they're struggling, and don't push it on them if they say they can handle it.
Use person-first language for most disabilities, such as ""person with Down Syndrome"" rather than ""Down Syndrome person."" The Autistic, Blind, and Deaf communities are a few notable exceptions (e.g. ""autistic person"").When unsure, ask an individual about their preferences.

, Heavier people, especially women, experience discrimination and hardship because of social attitudes about weight. Be conscious of hurtful stereotypes regarding fat people being lazy, unhealthy, greedy, et cetera.


Don't tell someone to gain or lose weight, or offer unsolicited advice or orders on how to do so. It's best not to mention their weight at all. Their body is not your business.
Watch your language closely. Some people, particularly fat acceptance advocates, self-identify as ""fat"" and encourage the destigmatization of the word. Other people could be very hurt by that adjective.

, Become familiar the terms that various communities view as acceptable, and which ones are hurtful. Then start using them in your own speech.The more you practice consideration and respect, the easier it will be and the less likely you are to offend someone.

, In conversations or discussions with groups or individuals, remember what you've learned while working on yourself. Your goal is not to knowingly hurt or offend any person or group of people with your language or actions.

, Are you in the workplace? A conference? A friend's party? Or maybe a family dinner? Each of these situations has different social rules for polite behavior. If you are aware of your surroundings, it will guide you to what words and actions are appropriate in any situation.


Formal situations such as the workplace or professional events have the highest standards and largest consequences.Informal and private situations are more relaxed, but sensitivity still matters. You may be talking to someone of an oppressed group, and even if not, private attitudes shape how people respond to minorities.
Consider the individual or persons in the group. As you speak, think about their relatives, friends, and acquaintances. This will help you avoid making any politically incorrect statements or actions.

, Don't lump people together based on religion, sexual orientation, gender, and ethnicity. Not everyone in a group is the same, acts the same, or believes the same things. This kind of language reduces a person to that one category, when people are so much more.


For example, don't refer to groups by saying things like: the deaf, the gays, the Jews, or the Blacks. If you are referring to a social group, acknowledge differences. ""Many blind people feel that...""
Use language that makes a person or group feel like they are equal and included in any situation.

, When speaking to or about other groups, refrain from unnecessarily using the words ""we"" or ""they."" This suggests a separation instead of equality and inclusion.

, Every individual and group has the right to choose the language that best describes their race, class, sex, gender, sexual orientation, culture, religion, or physical ability.


If you're not sure of someone's preference, you can ask them. For example, ""I don't want to offend you and was wondering if you call yourself Black or African American?"" If they are neither, show interest and ask how they'd like to be referred to. If you make your good intentions clear, they will most likely take it well.
Don't use controversial terms if you aren't a group member. For example, many Roma self-identify as gypsies. Unless you are a member of the Roma community, avoid using ""gypsy"" and always use Roma. It isn't your word to reclaim.
Skip the trendy terms. Most of these terms are used by members not part of the group. For example, don't call a person with disabilities ""handi-capable"" or ""differently abled"" or a short person ""vertically challenged."" Many people find these terms to be weird. This also means taking the words of those directly affected over those of ""allies"" in psychology or sociology who may stress the use of certain terms.

, It's not personal, so don't get defensive. Accept any individual or group's choice to reject language that offends them. If you accidentally use the wrong language or offend someone or a group, apologize for your mistake and use the term they have chosen for themselves.

, If you run into someone who is acting hurtful or being degrading about someone, take a deep breath and try to stay calm. You want to avoid fighting with someone, being superior, or criticizing them. Instead, talk to the person about the term. Open the lines of communication and engage in dialogue instead of humiliating them or telling them they are horrible.


When in doubt, assume that they meant well.
Bear in mind the possibility that the person in question may not match your expectations. Some people choose to ""pass"" as the status quo in order to avoid harassment, and others may not fit neatly into a stereotype or your assumptions of what an oppressed or privileged person would look like or how they would act.
Criticize the actions, not the person. ""Please stop making fun of Hispanic immigrants. As a person who has Hispanic friends, I feel that those jokes really hurtful and demeaning to them.""
Protect their ego while critiquing their actions. ""I'm surprised to hear a considerate person like you say something so hurtful about people with Down Syndrome.""
Try leading and ending with a compliment when you correct someone. Start with a compliment, like how you think the person made a good point or wrote a good article. Then, follow that with your correction or critique. Remember, do it in a nice way, not a rude way. Then finish it up with a compliment, like how you pointed it out because they seem like a thoughtful person., If you want to talk about touchy subjects, such as religion or politics, make sure that you are open to other opinions. People form their opinions based on backgrounds and experiences. If you are going to share your opinion, be open to listening to others. You may learn information or a perspective that helps inform your own opinion.Everyone has something to teach you.


Share the spotlight. Let other people be heard too.
Opinions focused on degrading others, e.g. ""Black women are disgusting welfare queens"" or ""Autistic people should be eliminated from the gene pool"" do not need to be treated as valid. This is hate speech.

, Your first reaction to someone who is different may be confusion or fear—so take a deep breath, remember that the other person matters, and let your second reaction be one of acceptance and respect. Work on viewing individual differences as important and meaningful.

Prepare yourself.,
Don’t lie or exaggerate about yourself.,
Find common ground.",How to Be Yourself Around Someone You Admire or Like2," If you’re going to meet someone you admire or like for the first time, make sure you have researched a bit about them. This will help you know how to connect to them.You may also want to prepare by listing out your good qualities on a sheet of paper before the meeting. This will remind you that you are worthwhile too, no matter how the interaction goes.If you're around someone you like you may want to look on their social media to see what they like, or by asking a mutual friend.

, It may be tempting to lie about connections, positions, or even personality qualities in order to make yourself look better to someone you like or admire. However, simply put, with the internet, it is often easy to find out any lies, especially if you are going to have a working relationship with the person for any amount of time. Secondly, when you lie about your abilities or personality, it can make you less confident about yourself, and make the interaction even more tense.For someone you like and may want to date, it is especially important not to lie, as dishonesty can quickly destroy trust in a relationship.

, Finding something in common is one of the quickest ways to make a connection. While the research you have done about them will help you with this, it is important not to mirror them too much, as this will make you seem creepy. However, simply talking over a recent show or book that has come out can foster conversation. Talking about common interests can help connect you with a crush as well."

Stay in the moment.",How to Be Yourself Around Someone You Admire or Like3," Remember that even if you make a mistake, it is unlikely that it will seem as big a mistake (if they see it as one at all) to the person you admire. When getting ready to meet someone, talk the negative thoughts down, and remind yourself that it is extremely unlikely that the worst, or even something very bad will happen when you meet the person you like., A lot of times we get nervous around our heroes or crushes because we’ve built them into something they’re not. They aren’t perfect, but they are human. They’ll do some things better than you, but it is just as likely that you will have some skills they don’t. Remember to value their contributions, as well as your own., Staying in the moment can help you keep perspective, as it allows you to forget what the moment will look like to your friends, or to think the worst of any mistakes. Taking the interaction moment by moment will help you listen, as well as say what you want to say."

Keep the mood light.",How to Be Nice to People," Just the simple act of smiling can make you seem -- and feel -- like a nicer person. Whether you're smiling at strangers or people you know, it will also encourage people to smile back at you. Many people may think you're cold or not nice just because you're the kind of person who is a bit more shy and who doesn't smile as freely. So, the next time you pass someone you know a little bit, or even a perfect stranger, make a habit of smiling. Smiling will also make you feel happier, even if you're not in the best mood, so it's a win-win situation.;
, If you're in a room with someone you don't know and everyone else seems to know each other, take the time to introduce yourself. If you've struck up a conversation with the person in line next to you at the coffee shop, introduce yourself when the time is right. This is a nice and polite gesture and can help break the ice. Just say something simple like, ""Hi, I'm Joe, it's nice to meet you"" and you'll get the ball rolling. Nice people tend to introduce themselves to others because they are excited about meeting new people.

, Talk about small stuff that you know the person would be interested in. If you don't know the other person well enough to know about their preferences, try to talk about things happening around you. (The meeting you've both been to an hour ago, the new guy in Math class, the fantastic new shoes your colleague has been wearing, etc.) Incorporating humor always helps; people enjoy someone who can make them laugh or has a sense of humor and can understand them.


Don't be one of those people who thinks that small talk is meaningless and a waste of time. You have to start out with small talk to make meaningful connections with people.

, Everyone loves compliments, so don't be afraid to say something positive about the other person. But be careful, though, not to flatter them too much. Too much flattery can give the impression that you are sucking up to them, and especially if this new friend is a superior, they will think of you as a lapdog. Just find something simple to compliment, like the person's sweater or a piece of jewelry that the person is wearing.


You can even use the compliment to strike up a conversation. Say something like, ""I love your Lakers socks. Where did you get those from""?

, If you've met a new person and things are going well, it would be nice to follow up and ask if the person wants to hang out. If it's a new friend, invite him or her to a low-pressure setting like a basketball game or a concert with friends, or a fun day with a few others at the park. You don't want to do anything too personal or private with someone you just met. Just exchange contact info, tell that person it was really nice to meet, and say that you're excited to hang out.
, You should be just as polite to strangers as you would be to your family members. That stranger you see at the coffee shop might be lonely, and you may be the only one they have talked to that day. Even if you're having a bad day, take the time to say ""excuse me,"" to hold doors for people, and to treat people with a basic level of respect. Don't hog two seats on the bus and talk loudly on your cell phone; instead, be polite and offer someone else a seat.

, This will make you look vulgar, rude, and definitely not nice. If people see you cursing and getting angry, they'll feed off of your negative vibe and won't want to be around you. The next time you're angry or feel like cursing, try to curse in your head or even to combat those curses by smiling instead.

, It's important to offer to help the people you see around you, whether it's a person with his arms full who can't open a door, a child who dropped a toy, or an elderly person who has difficulty walking. One day, you may need to rely on the kindness and help of a stranger, so you should get the good karma going while you can. This will definitely be a way of being nice to the people around you, and you'll feel better about yourself in the process.

, People who you just meet love it when you use their names during or at the end of the conversation. Even if you only say that person's name once or twice, the person will feel special and like you're paying attention to him or her. Saying something like, ""I know exactly what you mean, Eliza,"" or, ""It's been nice to meet you, Eliza,"" can make people feel like you've taken the time to get to know them a little bit. Plus, this is a great trick to help you remember that person's name the next time you see him or her, which will also be very nice of you!

, You don't have to only be kind to the people who are nearest and dearest to you. When you're shoveling the snow off your driveway, take the time to shovel the snow off your elderly neighbor's driveway, too. Let someone step ahead of you in line; put an extra dollar in the tip jar. Taking the time to do something nice for someone you don't know will make that person feel appreciated and will spread the good karma.

, One thing that is definitely not nice is judging people before you know them. Give people the benefit of the doubt and assume they are good people unless you are given reason to think otherwise. Learn to see people for who they are instead of judging them for how they look or how they are dressed. It can take a long time to be able to look at a person you don't know without judgment, but this is definitely a great way to be a nice person.

, Whether it's your friend's birthday or a random Tuesday, giving your friend a small gift is a nice way to show how much you care about that person. Make it thoughtful, like a sweater your friend was ogling last week at the mall, a book your friend has been meaning to read, or an album you know your friend will really love; that way, your friend will see that you really care. You shouldn't do it to suck up or for ulterior purposes; just do it to be nice.

, Whether you're at a party thrown by an acquaintance or you're in the aftermath of the birthday party at your cousin's house, you should offer to help clean up. This is a nice way of showing you care and to make people feel appreciated for all that they do for you. Get a whole cleanup crew going and you'll see that it can actually be fun to help out. Plus, this means that when you throw a party, people will be much more likely to help you in turn!


Some people will say that they don't need your help and that they can do it on their own, but most likely, they will just be saying that to be polite. Insist on helping them out unless they really don't want the help for some reason.

, One of the best ways to be nice to the people you know is to take the time to truly listen to them. Stop texting your other friend or looking around, and give the person you care about all of your attention as you fully absorb what that person is telling you. Don't interrupt the person right away and let him or her finish before you speak up, and don't automatically try to ""solve"" the person's problem before fully understanding the situation. This will show the person how much you really care.


When you're listening, don't try to relate everything back to yourself or you'll look self-absorbed and like you don't really care.

, Just simply taking the time to say, ""How are you?"" and really meaning it is a great way to be nice to a person. Don't just ask this question in passing, but ask it in a way that really shows you mean it and care about the person and what he or she is feeling. You can of course be more specific, asking how the person is coping with a cold, dealing with a new job, or just how he or she is experiencing a new change.


Don't ask the person just to look nice; make the effort to really care about others and how they are feeling.

, Gossiping about the people you know and love is just plain mean. It will definitely get back to them and will make you look like a person that nobody can trust. If you want to be nice to the people you care about, don't talk about them behind their backs; if you have an issue with them, bring it up to that person in a constructive way instead of broadcasting it to everyone in town. Gossiping is mean-spirited and will make you a meaner person.

, There's something incredibly nice about sharing, whether you're giving a friend half your sandwich or sharing your chemistry notes with a few friends during your study sessions. Sharing your clothes with friends or siblings is very nice, too. This doesn't mean you should let people take advantage of you, but it does mean that it's nice to let people benefit from the things you own and care about. Remember that it's not really that nice to share something you don't care about, but it is really nice to share your favorite sweater with your best friend.

, You don't have to let people walk all over you to put other people first every once in a while. Let your friend order first at the restaurant. Let your boyfriend pick the movie you're going to watch. Let your little sister eat the last ice cream sandwich in the freezer. Being nice means caring about other people instead of always wanting to do everything only for yourself.

, Even if you're around a Negative Nancy who is driving you crazy, try to steer the conversation in a positive direction. Whether you're talking to a grumpy classmate or a drama queen sister, try to talk about the good things in life, such as the sunny weather, the holidays coming up, or what fun things you're going to do after school. Get the other person to talk about happy subjects, and you'll be much more inclined to be nice to that person.

, The golden rule is that if you are nice to people they will treat you in the right manner, and if you are horrible and nasty to people they will think that you're mean and ignore you. However, you may be stuck with someone who is just being nasty to you -- does that mean you have to stoop down to his or her level? Absolutely not. Instead, you should just keep killing that person with kindness -- and get out of the situation any way you can.


Of course, this doesn't mean that you should let a rude person walk all over you. You should stand up for yourself, but do so in a kind and respectful way. If that person feels like being rude, don't stoop to his level.

, If you're around a person who you don't generally get along with, avoid the things that you know will make that person upset, or the things that will make you more annoyed. Try to stick to the safe, polite topics, like your health, the weather, or school or whatever it is you have to talk about, and you will be far better off than if you tread on territory that is touchy or immediately controversial. If you want to be nice, then you should avoid pushing a person's buttons -- or having yours pushed.


While you're at it, see if you can find some common ground, whether you and that person like the same sports team or grew up in the same hometown. You may be surprised by how much you and the person have in common -- and by how much easier it suddenly is to be nice.

, Sometimes, the best thing you can do to keep being nice is to say goodbye. Learn to pick your battles and stop engaging with a person who routinely annoys you if you can avoid it. If it's a person you have to see regularly, like a sibling, then just remember that it's better to say nothing than to say something that isn't nice. If you know the conversation is getting heated and is likely to make you say something you regret, just excuse yourself.


Walking away at the right time doesn't make you a coward. It actually makes you more mature for being able to recognize when something is futile.

, You may find it hard to be nice to a person because you just feel like you're such completely different people that you'd never be able to get along. But if you take a minute to think about where that person is coming from, you may have a better understanding of that person's thought process and intentions. You may not end up being best friends with a person just because you know him or her better, but you may find it easier to be nicer to that person.


For example, you may think that a person is really stuck up and mean, but you'll see that the person is treated poorly by his or her own parents, which can lead him or her to act a certain way. This can help you have more sympathy for where that person is coming from.

, If you're stuck spending time with someone who annoys you, try to be funny, goofy, or just plain silly to lighten the tension. Don't take yourself so seriously and don't dig in to the deeper topics. Just try to keep things fun and easygoing, and you'll see that the person is much easier to get along with and be nice to. If you're talking about serious subjects with a person you don't like that much, you'll be more likely to act mean.

Take a moment to step back from the situation emotionally. Count to ten in your head if you need to in order to calm down and prevent reacting negatively.;
, Cancel out something hateful that a bully says with something positive. This will throw the bully off of their game as they are not likely to have ever experienced this kind of positivity after they say something unkind. If they find that their bullying is unsuccessful in making you feel bad, they will likely retreat. For instance, if the bully says something negative to you about your shoes, you can say something like “Oh wow, I’m sorry you don’t like them because I love them! These are my favorites! I got them on a really good sale.”
If the bully makes a sarcastic, fake compliment, thank them. This will throw them off as well., Sometimes removing yourself from the possibility of an interaction with a bully can help. Try taking a different route, increasing your privacy online or making sure you’re not alone with the bully.

, Just because you want to be nice to a bully doesn’t mean you have to be a pushover. A bully is more likely to show kindness to someone they respect, and if you allow yourself to be treated unkindly with no pushback, the bullying will likely progress.


Redirect the focus away from the insult and onto the attacker, without bullying back, with a brief response such as ""Why do you say that?""Prepare and practice your responses. Come up with some responses and practice saying them in the mirror when you are home.Do some role playing of the kinds of situations that might come up. Practicing makes you more comfortable when you need to do it in a real situation., This establishes boundaries to appropriate behavior. Part of working out a bullying relationship is setting these limits. Being verbally assertive helps communicate these bounds. And making these limits explicit can help change the conscience of both the bully and others watching.Assert yourself with words such as: “Please stop that.” “It’s my turn.” “Please don’t touch.” “It’s not okay to do that.”, Write down everything. Record what happened: when, where, how, and who was there. Enter it in your journal or diary; print out material from online bullying. This is important if you want to have a logical conversation with the bully or be able to demonstrate to an authority figure what has been happening., Rather than thinking of them as a “bully” and you as a “victim,” think instead on their action in an isolated way. Think to yourself “this is one action out of one million that they will take today” rather than allowing that one act to define who they are and how you think of them. Instead of thinking of the person as a “bully” consider their actions as an “act of bullying.”


Just as you are not the sum of all of the worst things that you have done or said, your bully is not either. Do your best to separate the person from the bad things that they do.

, Understanding the bully will allow you to respond more appropriately to their actions. Consider the information that you have about the bully like their age, educational background, family, home, and job. More often than not, a bully comes from a family or a home where they are also being bullied and they respond by releasing their pent up hurt and anger on others.


Remember that hurt people hurt people. Your bully is probably dealing with emotional issues that they do not know how to handle. This can be the first step in you developing empathy for them.
You do not need to invest a lot of time in finding out this information; sometimes the information we already have is telling enough.

, When someone is rude and unkind, it can be easy to judge them for their faults. Instead, focus on not critiquing them for these inadequacies, but instead practicing empathy and compassion in dealing with them. Consider the ways you too may have been rude or hateful to others in the past not as a way to excuse the bully for their actions, but as a way to relate to them.


Show your bully the kindness you want them to show to you. Respond nicely and with compassion even when they are rude to you.The bully may be very unaccustomed to people being nice to them, so show them the kindness missing in their life.
If the bully always does something like closing the door in your face, open the door for them. These small acts of kindness add up and teach the bully how to treat you and others.
Greet your bully with a smile and a “hello” each day that you see them. They will marvel at your continued positivity and joy.

, There are few people on this Earth who are singularly evil or unkind. Ponder the things that you and the bully may have in common to allow you to further develop compassion for them. This will make it easier for you to be kind.


Perhaps you and your bully both share a love for baseball or for a certain type of food. When they are rude, think on these similarities to help you be kind in return.

, True kindness and empathy often stem from being able to understand a person’s perspective. If you know that your bully has faced bullying in their life also, this could explain their negative actions towards you. Your bully may also be dealing with a difficult personal situation that is causing them to lash out at you. This does not make their actions okay by any means, but it can help to inform your responses to them.

, Including the bully can help to build relationships and relating skills. Ask them to help you with something or pick them to be on your team.Keep working towards changing the bully relationship into an appropriate and productive relationship. This can take time, but to stop bullying, we all need to work together to encourage healthy relationships and civil communities., If you see your bully being spoken to in a way that is rude, approach the situation and calmly intervene. You can tell the person doing the bullying that you don’t think what they’re doing is right in very subtle ways by saying something like “Not cool at all” to the person being mean and by asking your bully if they’re okay or want to talk.

, You may see your bully struggling to lift a heavy box or having difficulty carrying a lot of items; help them. They will likely remember all the times that they treated you unfairly and begin to feel remorse.

, Bullies are often looking for an emotional response, so it helps if you avoid bringing emotion into your response. You can protect your feelings from hurtful insults by ignoring the unkindness or by using positive self-talk.Breathe deeply. Deep breathing can help you maintain your cool in tense situations.
Another way to remain calm is to reflect back on a time when you felt happy or at peace. It can be helpful to think back on a recent beach trip or moment with friends to recenter yourself back to positivity.

, Often times, a bully is hurling so much negativity towards you that it can be difficult to think positively about yourself. It is important that you don’t let yourself get trapped by the message of the bully and that instead you develop positive messages about yourself. If a bully is constantly telling you that you are ugly, try looking in the mirror at yourself every morning and night and repeating something like “I am beautiful. I am strong. I am worthy” to yourself repeatedly until you begin to acknowledge that it is true.


Remember that the message of the bully is an opinion. How you feel about yourself is most important.
Meditate in the mornings and at night before work or school. Meditate on principles of positivity and thankfulness. These messages will give you strength as you start your day.

, Though the bully may count for one of your interactions in your daily life, make sure that they are not the only. Surround yourself with positive and affirming people who will lift you up so much that the bullying will begin to affect you less and less.


Seek community at church, with your current friends, with family, and with others that you trust. You never know if someone you speak to has been bullied before and may be able to give you advice on how to handle it with grace, respect, and kindness.

, Being kind to others is intertwined with showing kindness to yourself. Take time to yourself when you are alone to do things that you enjoy like reading, watching films, or exercising. These things can often get the bullying off of your mind and help transport you back to a place of joy and positivity, despite the bully’s actions.


Remember that you can’t help others unless you are good to yourself first.

, You may find the the bully can overwhelm you. If you feel that you are becoming depressed, seek out help from your family and friends. You may find it necessary to seek the help of a therapist. There is no stigma in reaching out for help when you need it!

Remove yourself.",How to Be Nice and Cheerful," Being positive will help you stay happy, even if you are having a bad day. A smile improves your outlook, and makes people think of you as a confident and happy person. Smiling at people also helps them feel good about themselves! Besides, nobody likes a person who bores them with his own problems.;
, Don't be afraid to talk to people. Introduce yourself, and then ask them about their day. Don't just talk about yourself throughout the whole conversation. Ask them questions about their interests and who they are.

, Don't be afraid to put forward your opinions even if they contradict those of the person you are talking to, but make sure to be civil. A good way to express a contradicting opinion is to start by saying ""Yes, you are right when you say that, but I feel that..."" Don't agree with people just so that they will like you - nobody likes a clone. People will like you for having your own thoughts and opinions, especially if they are mature and expressed in such a manner. Of course, don't say something that might offend people, especially if they feel strongly about the subject.

, Backbiting about people only makes you look bad to the people you backbite to. You lose any confidence people may have in you. Also, if you make sure to speak about people only in front of them, you are most likely to speak in a civil manner and avoid saying anything very offensive. Bear in mind that whatever you say about people behind their backs will reach them - and when it does, it will be worse than if you had expressed your thoughts in a civil manner in front of them.

, Don't smile strangely: just a small smile will make them think you are nice.

, Be patient with people, even if it is hard. If you feel very angry about something, sit if you are standing, and lie down if you are sitting. Drink a glass of water - preferably cold. If this does not help, wash your face. Breathing slowly also helps control anger.


Many angry outbursts can be avoided if you deal with irritation as it arises. Expressing that some things irritate or upset you is better than bottling it up.

, This will make people think of you as a person with self-control, and create respect for you. If you are nice to everybody, no matter how mean they are, nobody will have any reason to hate you. Being nice to your enemies will also drive them mad!

, Don't just be nice to popular people. Being nice to people whom others consider losers or geeks will help create an image of you as a genuinely kind and friendly person.

, Don't drone on boringly about something; be more exciting and interesting when you talk. Include little jokes and funny stories in conversations and never be boring when talking to someone.

, As long as you are being yourself, that's fine! There will always be people who don't like you, and you should learn to ignore them and get on with your life!

, If you find yourself in a bad situation with someone, just remove yourself. Obviously, it is rude to ignore or avoid someone, but just try to reasonably distance yourself from the situation.

Don't be two-faced.,

Take the high road.",How to Be Nice," Smiling at people lets them know that you are pleasant. Look the person in the eye and give them a small smile or a wide grin - it doesn't matter which. This sets the mood of the encounter, and usually encourages the other person to smile back. If they don't, then maybe they are just having a bad day. That's OK; being nice doesn't guarantee a positive response, but it usually helps.


Smile when you pass people in the street, when you buy something from a shop clerk, when you walk into school in the morning, or anytime you make eye contact with someone else.
Smile even when you're feeling low. You can still be nice when you're in a bad mood. Why spread your negative energy to other people?
If you are in a bad mood and don't want to listen to people, try listening to music, drawing, or something else you enjoy to prevent yourself from acting harshly towards people or being rude (even if you don't mean to be).;
, When you're walking past someone, even a stranger, acknowledge their presence with a simple ""hello!"" or ""hi!"", or even just a wave or a nod in their direction. Letting people know you see them is nice; it makes people feel a little more special.


If you're walking through a crowded city, it can be hard to acknowledge everyone you pass. Try to at least be nice to the people you end up sitting next to on a bus or plane, or those who accidentally bump into you.
Say ""good morning"" to your fellow classmates and teachers or coworkers in the morning when you walk into school or your work place. You'll soon earn a reputation as a nice person.

, Take the time to ask someone how things are going in their lives, without being nosy or intrusive. If they seem resistant to talking, don't push them to say more than they feel like saying

, Listen when other people are talking to you. It isn't nice to just ignore other people's opinions and stories. Give them time to speak, just as you'd like them to give you time to speak if your positions were reversed.


If you find that someone is becoming rude or pushy, never put your hands on your mouth or make a rude face. Just politely wait for them to finish and change the topic after they've discussed theirs.
Being nice doesn't mean letting yourself get pushed around. If you're talking to a stranger who starts to make you uncomfortable, it's okay to excuse yourself and walk away.

, Always use your manners, say please and thank you. Be patient, caring, observant, and considerate. Treat people with respect, even those you don't particularly want to get to know.


Don't forget to always say ""Excuse me"" instead of ""MOVE!"" when someone's in your way. People aren't the ground that you can just spit on, they are living beings like you. If you are respectful to that person, that person will usually act the same way.
If you're on public transportation and an elderly, disabled or pregnant person gets on board, offer your seat. It's the nice thing to do.
If you see someone in need of a little help picking up something he or she dropped or reaching something from a high shelf, help out.

, If you want to be a truly nice person, you've always got to be nice to animals too. Don't tease them or think of them as little robots you can treat however you want. Animals deserve respect just like other beings.


Never hit or otherwise hurt an animal, whether it's your pet, someone else pet, a stray, or a wild animal.
Never tease an animal for your own amusement. This goes for bugs, spiders, mice, birds, squirrels, fish, and any other creatures you might come upon.
If you find an animal or bug in your house, use a humane way of putting it outside or keeping the population down.

, When your friends look to you for advice or just to set the mood of a conversation, don't be negative or critical. Keep looking for the positive in any given situation. Cheer them up. There are two sides to every situation: the positive side and the negative side. Nice people help others see the bright side of things.


Praise your friends' accomplishments. If your friend does a good job on a test or wins a prize, tell him or her congratulations!
Complement your friends. If you have a friend who doesn't like her hair, tell her you think it's gorgeous, or compliment her on her pretty smile. Even if you lie, you will still make her happy.
Sometimes people need to let you negative steam. You can be positive and nice without being overly cheerful; make sure the tone of your feedback isn't out of touch with what your friend is trying to tell you.

, Do you tend to look down your nose at people who are different or ""weird""? It's not nice to believe that you are better than other people. You're an individual, but everybody has their struggles, and being nice to one another makes life better for everyone. Everybody is equal, and when you talk about how great you are, you make others feel less valuable.


Don't brag or have a high ego. If you accomplished something great, that's certainly something to be proud of - just make sure to acknowledge the people who helped you along the way.
Don't judge people until you really know them. Don't make assumptions about people based on how they look or speak. Realize that first impressions don't always reveal the truth. As the saying goes, don't judge a book by its cover.

, Don't be nice like it is the end of the world. If you just want to be nice so that you can gain preferential treatment, it's quite the opposite of being nice-it's deceptive, shallow and cruel. Be nice because you want to look back on your life and know that you were a nice person, no matter what. Be nice because you feel like you willingly want to.

, Do not brag too much. Don't talk about people and don't be a backstabber. Being nice to people's faces helps you gain their trust, and you're betraying that if you talk about them behind their backs. Don't ever gossip about other people you don't like. It's bad karma, and it makes you look shallow, not nice.

, Those little, everyday things, like holding the door for a teacher you don't know, or smiling at someone who isn't always nice to you - they don't seem to matter much, but in the end, doing these will make you seem like a much nicer person.

, Be equally nice to everyone. Even if you're nice to your friends and teachers, but you aren't nice to people who aren't cool or popular, you may not actually seem as nice as you actually are. Do not judge others by race, age, gender, sexuality, ability, or religion.

, If you see your mom or dad struggling to juggle all the chores that need to be done, offer to help. Put others before yourself when you have energy and time to spare. Your nice acts will definitely be rewarded in the long run, so don't be self-centered.


Don't wait to be asked to help out. Learn how to spot times when other people are in need.
Find creative ways to help! Help your siblings with homework, listen to your spouse's idea for a new project or idea, make breakfast for your family, walk the dog, drive your sister to school, and so on.

, Sharing can mean dividing your dessert in half to give some to your younger sibling, or it can mean giving up something bigger, like your time, space or words of wisdom. Being generous is part of what it means to be nice. Try not to take more than you give, and when you are able, give more than you take.

, Part of being nice to family members and others you love is being there for them in times of need. Respond to emails, answer the phone when people call, don't flake out on plans, and spend time talking when the other person asks you to listen.


If someone leaves you a message, call them back promptly. It's not nice to leave them hanging for days on end.
If you say you'll be somewhere, be there. If you say you'll do something, do it. Being flaky hurts people's confidence in you, and it's not a nice way to act. Commit to your friendship.

, Sometimes it's not easy to be nice. You'll encounter situations that will test your ability to be a nice person. Even people you love may at times be flaky, judgmental, egotistical, selfish, or outright mean. You've got to avoid sinking to their level. Don't turn from nice to cruel just because your patience is being tested.


If your brother or sister is trying to pick a fight, don't let it escalate on your behalf. Calm down and refuse to act mean.
When you become angry and feel you're going to act in a way that isn't nice, take it out in a different way instead of being cruel. Go for a run, beat up your pillow, or calm down with a video game. You have control over your actions and behavior.

Acknowledge those around you.,
Anticipate the needs of others.,
Gather information about people in your life.,
Mark important events.,
Ask permission when your actions involve others.",How to Be More Thoughtful1," Always greet the people you share space with when you become aware of their presence. Even if you feel tired or shy, make the effort to acknowledge that others exist, and that you exist with them.


When you enter a room, say hello to everyone within. Make eye contact, and smile if you are up to it. When someone else enters a room you are in, do the same. If you and they have a moment, ask how they are and share how you are in return.
Use everyone's name, and make sure you know how to pronounce it.
Say goodbye when you leave or when someone exits a space you are in.
If you bump someone, apologize.
Acknowledge the needs of those you share space with. If there is food to share, take a proportionate amount.
Ask real questions. When you chat with someone, ask them specific questions about their life. If you get a friendly answer to a question, ask follow up questions. Try to learn how someone lives, what is most important to them, and what they enjoy over the course of your conversations.
If you pick up on how someone is feeling, acknowledge it! Ask how they are. If they seem upset, ask if there's something you can do. If they seem happy, say they seem well and ask if they're having a good day.
Acknowledge moments of difficulty and moments of celebration in the lives of those around you. Offer sympathy when someone is unhappy, and warm congratulations when they achieve something.;
, It's great to help when asked, but it's even more thoughtful to anticipate the kind of help that would make the biggest difference in a moment. If your partner is coming home with groceries, meet them outside to help carry the bags into the house. If your coworker has a flight at an early hour, you might offer to drive them to the airport.


If someone you know is going through something difficult or labor-intensive, think of a way to help relieve them of ordinary activities.If you learn, for instance, that your friend is finishing a big grant proposal over the weekend, offer to bring her a meal or to watch her kids.
Organize with others who might also want to help. If someone you know is going through a health crisis, get in touch with their closest friends and organize a meal train so that they don't have to cook.
With some thoughtful attention, you can become an expert on the needs of your loved ones. For instance, you may be the only person who understands a close friend's moods—when she starts making tons of exciting plans, you may be the only one who can anticipate that she will overbook herself and burn out, and the only person close enough to remind her that she may be attempting too much at once.

, When you learn something about someone in your life, make a mental note of it. This is material that you can return to when you wish to act in a thoughtful way.


Listen actively. Pay attention to people who speak to you. Show that you are listening by nodding occasionally, reacting with your face, asking questions, and occasionally repeating what is said to make sure you have it right.Write things down. If you learn something you think you may forget, such as the date of a friend's upcoming surgery, write it down in your calendar so that you can send them a card or check up on them when the time comes.
Consider keeping a birthday calendar—write the birthdays of everyone you know on a calendar, and update it with the birthdays of new babies and new acquaintances. This should be separate from your yearly calendar, as you will refer to it year after year.

, When something important happens in the life of someone you know, mark the occasion. Write cards, call, or send flowers or another gift. If you're only casually acquainted, you might comment on social media or just make a note to yourself to say something when you see them.If you know that your friend prefers one form of contact to another, it is thoughtful of you to respond in that way.
Write cards. Write thank-you cards, condolence cards, birthday cards, retirement, birth-of-child, thinking-of-you, and graduation cards. It may seem fussy, but they really do make people feel good. Write someone a card, and consider giving them a call as well.
You don't have to buy occasion-specific cards each time: keep a few packs of blank-inside beautiful cards around the house, and write a personal message inside that is appropriate to the occasion. One cheerful pattern and one calming pattern is all you need: send cheerful cards for birthdays, graduations, and other good news, and send the calming image for condolence cards and other more sober moments.
It is perfectly appropriate to send a card when someone is sick, has lost a job, or is otherwise struggling with personal or familial hardship.
It may feel awkward to mark a sad or complex moment, but it will feel more awkward later when you see the person and don't know what to say face to face.

, It's thoughtful to consider how your acts will make others feel. Even if it isn't clear how much your act will ultimately affect another, it is still thoughtful to consider that they might want to have some say. For instance, if you have a funny experience with a friend, ask their permission before you tell the story to others.


Get consent before touching someone. Even a hug or a friendly pat on the back can feel uncomfortable for some people, and others just want to be asked before they are touched.Even kids deserve this sort of consideration. Ask your child before you post her picture on social media—she may want to keep it in the family instead.

"
"
Learn what makes your loved one feel loved.,
Acknowledge what your loved one does for you.,
Check in.",How to Be More Thoughtful2," Everyone expresses and receives comfort in different ways. To be thoughtful, learn what makes the most difference to your loved ones. Your mother may want a call every day, for instance, while your father doesn't care if you call much but would be hurt if you didn't mark his birthday with a thoughtful gift.


What kinds of loving acts mean the most to your loved one? Do they respond most to acts of service, to gifts, to quality time, to affectionate words, to physical touch?Do they need to feel like you understand their motivations? Is it important to them that you are physically present at certain kinds of event?
If you're not sure, ask yourself what you have done for your loved one that they speak of often, or that made them cry. If you're not sure, ask them.
Brainstorm things that they like, and work them into your routine. For instance, if your parents feel supported when you do housework, assign yourself more regular chores. If your kid gets clingy when they need comfort, get into the habit of giving them regular hugs.

, Take a moment every day to consider the things you are given. Express your appreciation to those who give to you: from the barista who makes your drink to the spouse who stays calm while you panic about your missing keys.Notice the small things. You might not notice all the things people give to you—apart from materials goods, someone may give you time, emotional energy, or even thoughtful attention. When a loved one does something that affects you, think of their motivation. They may be doing it to make you feel good.
Ask yourself if there are things your loved one does for you that you could do in return. Oftentimes, the things you think to do for other people align more with your own needs than with theirs. Therefore, if you want to find out what your loved one needs, you might look to what they give you.
For instance, if your partner always gives you nice shoulder massages, you might offer them a massage in return. It's possible that they have shoulder pain and are unconsciously assuming that your shoulders hurt too.

, When you greet one another and when you have a moment alone, try to see how your loved one feels. Ask, but also observe. Do they look focused and alert? Do they look tired, sad, or worried? Are they frowning, tapping their hand, or checking their phone every three minutes?Ask your partner how they are feeling. ""How are you? Have you had a good day?""
Ask specific questions about things you think they might want to talk about
If your partner seems distant, anxious, or sad, ask: ""is anything bothering you?""
You can say what you perceive: ""You seem a little preoccupied. Is there something on your mind?""

Think before you speak.,
Reflect on your days.,
Step away from your decisions.,
Take your time with projects that matter.",How to Be More Thoughtful3," Thoughtful people tend to consider a statement before they make it. While there are some familiar situations where you can freely respond to a question or comment without fear of saying the wrong thing, in most cases it pays to consider your response.Think of the best way to word what you are saying. You might have a generous thought that, if worded incorrectly, will make the hearer feel terrible. Think of the words that will best communicate to your listener what you wish to say.
Listen to your gut. If you feel a pang of misgiving, pause and consider the implications of what you are saying.
Similarly, you may choose to re-read an email before you send it.

, You will be more thoughtful in all things if you take the time to remember and analyze your day. Talk about your day with your friends and family, so long as you also listen to their account of their own. Write what you did and how you felt about it in a nightly journal. This is a way of dedicating thought to the mundane, a practice which will necessarily make you more thoughtful.Consider getting a therapist if you feel you have more to sort through than you can possibly cover in a conversation.

, If you are faced with a big decision, or even a medium-sized one, take your time making it. Come up with careful questions and run them by people in your life. While you may feel strongly inclined one way or another, letting your thoughts settle in your mind will result in a more satisfying decision. If you can, sleep on it before you give your verdict.If you don't have the time to actually get a full night's sleep before making a choice, do try to step away briefly. If you are making an important decision at work, for instance, try taking a brief walk or giving yourself a long lunch break before you express your decision.

, The old saw that ""anything worth doing is worth doing well"" has some merit. Work produced thoughtfully tends to impress. Allocate enough time to give every project the attention it deserves. Keep the main aim of your project in mind while exploring possibly related themes that may end up informing the end product.


As with decisions, taking time away from projects will help you see them more clearly.

Have a healthy, realistic impression of yourself.,
Seek out advice and constructive criticism.,
Resist the urge to brag about yourself.,
Accept compliments without an ego.,
Strive for selflessness.,
Live within your means.,
Buy used or discount items whenever possible.,
Try not to worry about whether others are impressed.,
Wear clothing that is not revealing.,
Avoid extremes in appearance.,
Use language that is positive and uplifting.",How to Be More Modest," Being modest begins with how you see yourself and your place in the world. By being aware of your own strengths and weaknesses, you can avoid the pitfalls of arrogance and start to live more modestly.Try to see yourself the way others see you by asking your closest friends how they perceive you. Ask about both the good and the bad, and let your friends know you'd like a fair and honest assessment.
Acknowledge your good qualities and your positive accomplishments, but don't let these things inflate your ego or define your life.;
, A modest person is defined by his or her humility. If you're trying to live more modestly, you should accept the fact that you do not know everything about yourself, and that you may need advice and guidance from others.Accept that you may be wrong from time to time. Remember that there's nothing wrong with this; no one is perfect, and no one can be right all of the time.Don't interrupt when someone is criticizing you or giving you advice. You may be tempted to defend yourself, but by listening actively you'll learn a great deal about yourself.
Don't dismiss the criticism others offer you, but don't accept or believe it all at face value. Ask other people who know you if they've noticed similar patterns of behavior, and assess your need to improve while keeping your ego in check.

, Another facet of humility is personal restraint. Modest people do not brag about their wealth or accomplishments, and they don't let these things define them. That doesn't necessarily mean that you should hide anything about yourself; it simply means that you shouldn't boast about anything.Telling a new acquaintance in conversation about something significant that you've done isn't necessarily bragging if it's relevant to the conversation.
Telling someone about your accomplishments repeatedly, or reminding someone who already knows about them, could be seen as bragging.

, A modest person should not let compliments get to his or her head. You can accept a compliment graciously, but you should not let it feed into your ego or make you think that you're better than others.Recognize that everyone has strengths and weaknesses, but don't let those qualities define you or anyone else.
If someone compliments one of your strengths, you can practice being modest by thanking that person and complimenting them on one of their strengths.

, A modest person puts the needs of others ahead of his or her own needs. That doesn't mean forcing yourself to suffer; it simply means being considerate of others and fostering a desire to help others in some way.Be kind to others and think about whether their needs are being met.
You may find that it is ultimately more important and more rewarding to elevate others than to try to elevate yourself.

, The key to living a modest lifestyle is living within your means. That means avoiding extravagance and settling for the basics. You don't have to deprive yourself to live modestly - you just have to value function and practicality over luxurious status symbols.Drive a car that is safe, comfortable, and works well. Don't choose a car for its flashiness or status value.
Buy or rent a home that is sturdy, comfortable, and in a safe neighborhood. If you only need two bedrooms then don't rent or buy a place with three bedrooms.
Find out the average cost to purchase a home in your area and try to work within that price range (if it fits your budget).

, One easy way to live a more modest lifestyle is to buy items that are used or discounted instead of paying full price. This can help you save on the basics when you're at the store. Look for items on sale, discount, or clearance when you're at a retail store. You can also check thrift stores for gently-used items available at a fraction of the cost of new items.


Gently-used items are often in like-new condition. You can find these at thrift stores, consignment shops, and pawn shops.
Many clothing stores put out-of-season garments on clearance. These can typically be purchased at a very low cost.
Check stores that are going out of business, as they often have good deals to move products out the door.

, Living modestly and humbly means emphasizing your values ahead of the opinions of others. Don't trouble yourself wondering whether others are impressed with you or with your possessions. Instead, focus on living a meaningful and upstanding life., Many religious and cultural institutions encourage people to dress modestly. The goal of dressing modestly is to provide a good, morally-sound influence to the people you interact with.Generally speaking, modest clothing is any article of clothing that is not sexually suggestive and does not show off the body.
This means avoiding any clothing that reveals too much skin, and it may also entail avoiding clothes that are tight-fitting.

, Modest dress may also include a general avoidance of extremes, depending on one's culture. This may mean being neatly groomed and manicured, conforming to prescribed fashion trends, and abstaining from getting tattoos or piercings.Someone who wants to live modestly and also wants to have pierced ears may find that a single pair of plain earrings will accommodate both desires.

, Modest speech means refraining from vulgarity or negative language. Instead, a modest speaker should strive to be a positive role model for others and should try to make others feel happy.Don't use swear words.
If you're trying to be modest for spiritual purposes you should also avoid blasphemous language.
Ask yourself whether the things you say would inspire and uplift others, or them feel uncomfortable or upset.

Be confident because you're awesome.",How to Be Liked," You've probably been preached it a billion times already: In order to get people to like you, you gotta like yourself first. Easier said than done, huh? But you know it's true -- think about someone you know that has really low self-worth. They're probably a little negative, overly sensitive, and not a ton of fun to be around. If only they were comfortable with themselves, their entire world would treat them differently.


Write down a list of good things about yourself. Do something that makes you feel happy and confident. Don't be afraid to try something new and scary. Don't even think about skipping this step -- it's crucial. You don't have to be outgoing and hilarious, you just have to have a healthy level of self esteem.;
, Once you're comfortable with yourself, stick to it. Putting on false pretenses and self-presenting and trying to maintain an image, apart from being downright exhausting, is just a huge turn off. Who you are is good, flaws and all. Instead of being a second-rate version of something else, be a first-rate you, you know? What's the point in doing anything else?


Believe it or not, research has shown that embarrassing yourself in front of other people can actually get them to like and trust you!After a second thinking about it, it makes sense: you show everyone you're real, just like them. What a relief! You're no longer perfect. Phew. Close one. The more genuine you are, the better.

, Let's get down to brass tacks here: Imagine you're in bed with someone, doing the deed. That person is going through the motions, but you can't really tell how they're feeling one way or another. Would you be anxious to jump into bed with them again? Probably not. The same goes for life! Everyone wants to be around that one person that likes up the room with their excitement. There's no reason that can't be you.


Once you realize the little things in life can be thrilling, the enthusiasm will flow. After all, life is short. Not every cup of coffee has to be the best cup of coffee you've ever had (in fact, it could be the worst), but you can still be enthusiastic about it. Woo, coffee! Finally! Morning jitters! It feels so good.

, This is mainly about other people, but really you should be curious about the entire world. When something is presented to you, actually think about it. Don't just accept it. If there's something you don't understand, seek to learn more about it. This should go for concepts, sure, but it should go double for people.


So the next time you meet someone who's 24 and they're telling you about the time they spent making chainmail and sous-chef-ing at one of your favorite French bistros, allow your jaw to drop in subtle incredulity and ask for an explanation. Pry a little. You're interested!

, In case you've been living on a deserted island, turns out humans prefer contact with those who don't smell. Science is still out on why. So do yourself a favor and shower, brush your teeth, and dress with the lights on. People won't give you the time of day if you don't.


It's best to put a little effort in (read: more than just a shower). Humans go off of looks probably more than they should. If you've read Malcolm Gladwell's ""Blink,"" you're familiar with the Woodrow Wilson effect (and how he got elected based on his authoritative good looks and good timing (photojournalism being new and all) and even if you're not, you probably know enough about JFK to see the link. Whether we like it or not, being pretty has its definite benefits. No two ways around it.

, Humans interact on three different levels: verbal, non-verbal, and paraverbal.You're probably okay with the first two, huh? But paraverbal is how you say your words. You know, the tone, the pitch, the pacing. That stuff matters just as much!


Start by observing someone who's really well-liked on these three levels. How do they stand in relation to others? When they're on their own, do they seem easily approachable? Now how do they talk? What do they say and how do they say it? When you start noticing patterns, start observing yourself. What patterns could serve you to emulate?

, While this is true for every environment, it goes double in the workplace. Men and women get away with very different things when it comes to being liked. A man can be assertive and even angry and it's a display of his passion; a woman shows the same emotions and she's deemed out of control.Take any advice you get with a grain of salt and as for any observations you make, it may be wisest to account for gender.


Though it doesn't go for everyone, it's usually safe to say that women are more liked when they're a bit softer. Two words: Hillary Clinton. The butt of more jokes than possibly anyone ever. And why? Because she acts like a man in a man's world when she's not one. She's also awesome and a great role model, so if you're a woman, aim for something between her and June Cleaver.

, Take an interest in other peoples hobbies and interests. When they see that you like them, they will like you in return. Humans are funny creatures -- once in a while they may sense!


If someone walks in the room and you immediately light up and smile, they'll recognize it. How awesome would it feel to be received like that? You're capable of giving everyone warm, fuzzy feelings just be seeming genuinely interested in them because you just plain ol' like them. It's not making yourself vulnerable; it's being real.

, Be kind. Whatever you say, mean it. Don't mess with people, don't get caught up in lies or manipulation. When it comes down to it, you should treat others like you want to be treated. If you wanna get your foot in the door anywhere, being sincere and warm will do it.


Start by being as patient and polite as you can with people. Listen and try to help if you can. Do things for people because you want to, not to get something back. No matter how much of a bad mood you're in, be as nice as you can to people. Remembering to be kind and sincere when you're not feeling like it can actually turn your mood around.

, Most everyone loves talking about themselves. They love people who want to listen to them talk about themselves. Unfortunately, there are people in this world who are just waiting to pipe in with something that can steer the conversation in their direction. Take advantage of this by getting them talking! Ask them something about themselves and let them run wild.


Let's say you walk up to Darrell (it's spelled like Darrell, but it's pronounced Darrell) at work and you say, ""Hey, Darrell, how's your weekend?"" and he replies with a simple, ""Good, good. Got to spend some time with the fam."" Instead of saying, ""Oh, that must've been nice,"" keep it open-ended. Respond with, ""Oh, do you not get to see them much?"" Soon he'll be relaying you with the moving patterns of his second cousins. As long as you seem interested he'll keep going!

, This one is a toughie -- if you do it too seriously, people may be confused as to whether you're being funny or if you just genuinely hate yourself. If you do it with a smile and a laugh though, you'll be safe. When Conan O'Brien quipped about Michael Phelps being ""out of shape,"" he added, ""If he's out of shape, I've been dead for five years.""Showing you're lighthearted and willing to poke fun of yourself is an incredibly endearing quality.


Being able to take a joke is a very useful quality. When people get to know each other, there's a level of crap-giving that builds solidarity and allows for bonding. If you can do this for other people, it shows that you're fun, flexible, and comfortable with yourself.
Use other kinds of humor too! It's all good. If you can use the kind that unites the group, even better. Getting people on the same level allows them to feel more at ease around you. So make 'em laugh!


, Everyone likes being flirted with. It just feels good. It's playful and makes us feel like someone is paying attention to us because we're attractive. What's not to like about that situation? What we enjoy less is flirting with someone who doesn't show us they're receptive to it. So do the initial deed and start flirting. You'll show them you're personable, open, and playful. Awesome.


Touching a person can create an immediate bond. Think of someone saying hi to you, giving you a wave, and passing by. Now think of someone saying hi, brushing you affectionately across the shoulder, and passing by (probably smiling and making eye contact, too). Which person do you feel more connected with?

, This doesn't have to be some grand gesture. In fact, it shouldn't be. The smaller things often speak volumes. So go ahead, get a little personal. Let them know you're interested in them as a person and they'll likely return the favor.


Use the person you're talking to's name. Work it in. Per Dale Carnegie, it's the sweetest sound to any person. And if you've just met them, it'll help you remember it!
Remember details. Did your boss mention his daughter's cookie sale randomly and in passing last week? Ask him how it's going. You may or may not have a sweet tooth that needs squelching.

, Sometimes insecure people try to make up for their low self-worth by coming off as really self-absorbed. They think they're coming off as awesome when they're really just coming off as selfish. They should really be doing the opposite -- putting the focus on the other person. They'd be more comfortable and be more well-received!


When people compliment you, just say ""Thank you."" If you find an opportunity to talk about how great you are, let the moment pass. People don't have to know how many awards you've won or how many names you can drop or how many things you've seen and done. Those will come out naturally in conversation. You don't need to insert them.

, This one barely needs explaining. Happiness and positivity is contagious. People like happy people. If you have a positive spin on something, it's refreshing. While it's tempting to want to appear modest by beating yourself down or to try to appear intellectual by hating everything (we all know that person), don't do it. It's no good for you, your wrinkles, or the people around you.


That being said (you knew there was a caveat, didn't you?), know when to commiserate. Complaining is a tool that can drive people together. Just make sure you don't do it all the time! Did your boss just take away casual Friday and insist everyone work late? Appropriate. Did Sheila just take the last donut? Not appropriate. Again, pick your battles.

, There is no conversation on the entire planet that is or should be infinitely long. None. Zero. Zilch. Nada. And some should be shorter than others. When you sense yours dying down, let it. Tell the person how interesting the conversation was (unless it was terrible; in which case, why are you wasting your time on this person?) and tell them you'll talk soon. Boom. Done.


If it's getting awkward, politely excuse yourself. A simple, ""Well, I have to get going. I'll see you later!"" is not something to be questioned. And don't think it's just you: Awkward conversations make up 17% of all conversations. Maybe. There will be science on it eventually. Probably.

, When's the last time you hung out with someone who was straight up rude? If it was recently, it was probably one of your old, embittered relatives. If you really had the choice, you wouldn't. So don't be your cranky grandpa. Use ""please,"" ""thank you,"" and hold the door for the person behind you. Can you think of one reason not to?


It is not impressive to treat people beneath you as if they're beneath you. So tip the waitress. Ask her about her day. Don't scowl at the grocery clerk about the clean-up in aisle 5. Be polite to everyone.

, The most likeable people are those who are calm, laid back, and easy-going. People (especially strangers) may get turned off if they see that you are overly neurotic, difficult, or paranoid. Try not to get angry or overreact when things don't go your way. It will only make you feel more stressed out and strangers uncomfortable.


That doesn't mean you should be aloof to the emotional needs of others, but try to help others in a comforting and reasonable way. People want to see a person that is stable and happy. Try not to get easily offended by harmless jokes, and have a good sense of humor about things in general.

, Just getting yourself out there is half the battle! If you're on someone's soccer team, for example, it gives you ammo for making conversation and it also shows them that you're similar. We humans like to know when people are like us! So join a club or group and get around people. You can't be liked if you're at home by yourself!


This will also put you around people that you may naturally get along with. It's hard getting along with strangers and people that you don't have anything in common with. A club or group is a great place to test your new social jiujitsu!

, You can say all the nicest, most interesting things in the world, but if you're frowning and staring at your cup of coffee, no one's going to pay you any mind. Soon enough, you'll be the person in the corner talking to their morning cup of Joe. So smile! Let people know you're approachable and in the moment. And when they talk to you, look at them! Rocket science, huh?


When we're nervous, it's tempting to avoid eye contact. If this is an issue of yours, make it a point to look at you. If you don't, it can be a little offensive -- especially if they're talking! They'll not know of your issues and just assume you're not paying attention. A good rule of thumb is if they're talking about something that seems important to them, make the effort. If it's just casual, off-hand remarks, let your gaze wander.

, To hold your own in conversations, it's imperative to use the right tone, have approachable body language and a general aura of positivity, but if you have nothing to say, you'll feel pretty useless. So read up on current hot topics! Treat yourself to some TV and some mindless Internet surfing. You'll feel better having interesting things to say.


Not everyone shares the same interests. Because of this, not everyone will like you. Reading up on NASA's latest findings and getting tickets the Doctor Who one-night special won't get you into the group that spent last night watching Real Housewives of Alcatraz. Stick to what interests you -- it's all that really matters.

, We all know that person that's too nice for their own good. They're constantly complimenting others, going out of their way to accommodate everyone, and not making any decisions because they don't want to rock the boat. Don't be the doormat, trying to please everyone! You'll be better liked if you do have a backbone and a sense of self. Without a personality, there's no one under that skin of yours to like!


It deserves to be said once more: there is no pleasing everyone. You will get along with some people and you won't get along so well with others. This is how the world works. So when you don't jive with someone, don't stress. You'll jive with someone else.

, Seriously. If you think people don't like you, there's a large possibility it's all in your head. You have a unique personality that has value in this world. You just gotta show off your stuff to know it! So get out there! Can't win if you don't play.

This will often include redness in and discharge from your cat's eyes. Eye infections are also serious on their own, so if you notice your cat has an eye infection, you should take it to the vet immediately., Because histoplasmosis is an infection, your cat might develop a fever. If your cat has a fever up to 104 degrees Fahrenheit (40 degrees Celsius) along with other symptoms, they might have histoplasmosis.If your cat has a fever, you should take them to the vet immediately, regardless of what you believe the cause to be. This can be indicative of other serious health issues.

, If your cat suddenly becomes lame – unable to walk or use any of its limbs – take it to the vet. This is another symptom of histoplasmosis.

Use your common sense and intuition.Some of your best lie detection tools are your mind and heart; Listen to what they are telling you.,
Use past experience.,
Use logic and reason.,
Think about what this person has to gain or lose.How will lying to you benefit them?,
Ask for details about what they are telling you.,
Ask them to repeat what they previously said.,
Ask different variations of the same question.,
Keep asking questions.The deeper into the lie they get, the harder it will be for them to make up information and stick to it.This will also lead to them panicking, therefore giving off vital clues to their deception.,
Ask them if they are lying in a non-accusatory way.,
Listen to their words.Listen closely to what they are saying and think about what they are telling you.,
Listen to how they sound.Lying can be stressful and as a result people often have a different pitch, cadence, or may stutter when they are lying.,
Notice if they change the subject.,
Look at general body language.,
Look at their hands.People often unconsciously make small movements with their hands when they are lying.,
Observe their eyes.People often don’t realize just how expressive their eyes are.,
Study their face.Just like with the eyes, people are often not aware of the small unconscious movements in their face.",How to Spot Lying," If you just have a “gut feeling” that something isn’t completely true about the person is telling you, you’re probably right., If the person has lied to you in the past, be cautious of anything he or she says. Unfortunately, lying can be a habit for some people.For example, if the past three times your friend said he was staying in for the night, you saw him posting selfies from a nightclub; you might not want to believe him when he says he’s staying in tonight.

, If what they are telling you sounds unbelievable or too good to be true, it probably is. If their story just doesn’t make sense, then it’s most likely a lie.Often when people have to come up with a quick lie, they will say the first thing that comes to mind, even if it isn’t logical or reasonable. Even people that have time to craft their lie sometimes add in details that don’t make sense.Also,their reaction to the question might tell you more than their answer. For example, do they get extremely defensive or start behaving differently after you ask?

, Will it keep them out of trouble? Will it get them something they want? People may lie out of fear (of punishment, for example), in order to manipulate or even just out of habit.If they have a good reason to lie to you, it’s reasonable to think that they just might do so.

, For example, what time were they there; who did they go with; when did they leave? Liars often haven’t worked out the details of their story, and can get nervous or trip themselves up when they try to flesh it out., For example, you might say, “Wait…I’m confused, what did you say happened again?"" Especially when making up the story as they go along, liars can't always keep track of what they have said. If you ask them to repeat the story, they may not remember exactly what they told you before and you may reveal that they are lying., For example, first you might ask, “How long were you there”. Then, a few minutes later you might ask, “So you stayed there about how long”. This technique is often used on surveys to check for consistency, and can be used in the same way when trying to determine if someone is lying.,


Ask who, what, when, where, why, and how questions. For example, you might ask, “Who did you see there?”; “When are you getting here?”; “Where did you find it?”, etc.
Vary the pace of your questioning in order to keep them off-balance. Ask a few questions back-to-back, without really giving them a chance to completely answer. Then slow down, and wait a few seconds between their answers and the next question. Then pick up the pace again.
Try not to ask rhetorical questions like “Do you think I’m dumb?” or “Do you really expect me to believe that?” Questions like this can make people become immediately defensive

, While most people will answer “no”, regardless of whether they are actually lying or not, many people feel bad about lying and may admit it when gently confronted.For example, you might try saying, ""I feel like you're not quite telling me everything"" or ""I think there might be more you want to tell me"".Also, their reaction to the question might tell you more than their answer. For example, do they get extremely defensive or start behaving differently after you ask?

, Also, consider how they are saying things. People often have both obvious and subtle changes in their speech patterns when they are lying. Do they take a long time to respond to your questions? This might mean that they are thinking up an excuse or a lie.
Do they answer your questions with questions? For example, if you ask where they were, do they ask “why” instead of giving you an answer? They may be stalling to think up an answer or trying to steer the conversation somewhere else.
Sentences with contractions are more likely to be truthful. Liars use contractions less frequently and also use more unnecessary words than people who are being honest.Do they refrain from saying ""I"" a lot? Liars often try to distance themselves from the lie by speaking passively rather than actively.For example, rather than saying ""I dropped the glass"", they might say,""The glass dropped on the floor"".

, Try to see if their voice is strained, in a lower or higher pitch than normal, or just sounds plain weird for some reason., Liars will often want to get out of the subject as fast as possible. To do this, they may try to quickly change the topic or end the conversation.Skilled liars are good at subtly shifting the focus of the conversation to something they are more comfortable with, while inexperienced liars may be more obvious about it.

, Paying attention to what a person’s body movements (or lack of movement) are telling you can often reveal more to you than what they are actually saying.Look for behavior and body language that is different from what they normally do.Is their body shaking or obviously tense? This is usually a sign of nervousness and nervousness is common when people lie.
Liars sometimes try to make very little movement with their body in effort to control their “tells”. This also gives away the fact that they are lying, because usually they are unnaturally still.
Are they sweating? This is a nervous reaction people cannot control. So, if they are sweating for no reason, it might be because they are lying.

, This is often something children do. Fidgeting (tapping fingers, playing with hair, etc.) can often be a sign or “tell” that someone is lying. Wringing or clasping and unclasping their hands may also be an indicator of lying.

, Small eye movements such as slight narrowing or widening, darting around, and even closing (for longer than a blink) can be indications that someone is lying to you.


If someone immediately and quickly looks away when they begin to tell you something or when you ask them a tough question, they might be lying. Especially young children are often not able to make normal eye contact when they are lying.
However, skilled liars have no problem making eye contact. People normally glance away a bit when talking. A person who's making a point of keeping eye contact is more likely to be lying as they're probably trying to convince you and themselves that they aren't lying.

, Things like jaw clinching, lip biting, forehead wrinkling, etc. can all be small signs that the person isn't being completely honest with you.


Expressions on a person’s face, especially skilled liars, can often be limited to their mouth instead of the whole face, particularly when they are trying to control their expressions.Is their nose red or are they scratching it? Called ""The Pinocchio Effect"", blood rushes to the nose when a person is nervous, such as when they are lying."

Take your cat to the vet.,
Administer medication.,
Arrange inpatient care.",How to Diagnose and Treat Histoplasmosis in Cats2," Your vet will have to perform a variety of tests to distinguish between histoplasmosis and other conditions. These tests might include a chemical blood profile, a blood count, or a urinalysis. They will have to do this to determine the proper treatment – and intensity of treatment – for your cat., If your cat hasn’t had Histoplasmosis for long, or has not suffered overly severe effects, your vet will probably recommend medication and outpatient care. This medication will usually take the form of anti-fungal drugs like fluconazole or itraconazole, which you will give to your cat orally.Be sure to follow the specific directions for the drugs your vet prescribes your cat.
This medication may be need to be administered for up to six months.

, Your cat may need inpatient care for histoplasmosis. This is most likely if your cat has become dehydrated or malnourished as a result of their illness. Your vet can tell you if this is the case and how long that care will last."
"
Keep your type of pet in mind.,
Consider practicality.,
Decide what services you need your vet to provide.,
Make a list of veterinarians in your area.,
Ask others in your area about their experiences with local vets.,
Prepare a list of questions to ask the vet.,
Call the veterinary offices on your list.,
Visit your top one or two offices.,
Make an appointment, even if it's just for a healthy pet to have a check up.,
Ask the vet your questions.,
Make your decision.",How to Choose a Vet," Not all vets will treat all species. Make sure the vet has experience with your species of pet. For instance, even if a vet has a very good reputation as a canine vet, this is useless if you own a rabbit, because the two species are very different.


Most vet clinics are happy to treat 'companion animals,' which is another way of saying cats and dogs. If you own rabbits, some vets class them as 'exotic' animals and may not be able to treat them.
If you own a pet such as rabbits, guinea pigs, mice, or rats, always ask before registering if the vets are experienced with that species. A veterinarian should have special training in the species and have practice treating them.
Ideally, chose a practice with that has a vet who is a specialist in the species, or is happy to treat them. Some vets have a special interest in rabbits but without having extra qualifications in exotic animals. These vets have often gone to the trouble of learning more about the species but haven't taken exams on treating the species, and will do a good job by your pet.
Consider a single-species vet. If your have a cat, then you may not want it stressed by dogs in the waiting area. It is increasingly common to find single species clinics, such as ""cat only"" clinics.;
, There is little use in registering with a perfect practice if they are a two or three hour drive away. In an emergency situation you may not have two or three hours' time to spare. Always consider how quickly you can get to the practice in the event of an emergency.

, If you have a low income, then cost may be a deciding factor. If your pet has a very specific health issue then you will need a vet that has the equipment, and knowledge, to treat that issue.


If you have a vet school in your community the care there is often cheaper than at a private practice. A small animal teaching hospital still provides excellent care under trained supervision, but it'll be more affordable.
Be aware that lower fees are usually only achievable if the practice does not invest as heavily in modern equipment and state of the art facilities. Be aware that more sophisticated and well-equipped clinics have to finance the equipment through higher fees, so if your priority is the pet has access to an on-site MRI scanner then be prepared to pay for the privilege.
Factors you may want to consider include the level of in-house facilities (blood machines, lab work, x-rays, ultrasound, MRI or CT scanners), location, highly-qualified specialists on site, overnight care, emergency care provision, ease of parking, ease of getting an appointment, and also more emotional aspects such as if your pet likes the vet., Do an internet search or look at a telephone directory, or the local press for adverts. Most clinics have websites so go to the website to get an idea of how many staff the clinic has, the facilities, specialities, and for the overall feel of the practice.

, A good starting point is to ask other pet owners which vet they use and if they are satisfied. If you own a dog, then ask the other dog walkers in your area who they would recommend. Word of mouth recommendations are very valuable because you can ask questions and weigh the responses.


You can also approach local animal shelters and animal clubs who will have experience with many different vets.

, Be aware that veterinary practices are busy places. You don't want to waste the staff's time, but likewise you should feel you can trust and work with that clinic.The questions you ask the clinic should include:


Opening times - these are especially important if you need to have flexible access to your vet, for instance evenings and weekends.
Fees – find out their standard consultation fees, also their fees for standard treatments such as vaccinations, worm and flea treatments etc.
Emergencies – what are the arrangements for out of hours emergency care for your pet, for instance do they do home visits?
Alternative medicine – find out what their attitude is towards alternative and complementary treatments for your pet.
Consistency of care: How likely are you to see the same vet each time you visit?
Overnight care: If you pet is ill and needs to be admitted for overnight care, who looks after the pet? Is there someone on site 24/7 and what are their qualifications?, Never be afraid to ask a vet anything. If you feel afraid to ask them something to do with your pet and it's wellbeing, this obviously isn't the right vet for you.


When you call a veterinarian it's likely a receptionist, rather than the vet, who answers the phone. However, the attitude of the staff is usually a reflection of the clinic's ethos. For example, a well-organized clinic will have well-trained reception staff who handle your call efficiently. Even during busy times, a well-trained receptionist will explain she'd like to give your call full attention but she's in the midst of a busy clinic, and then offer to take your number to call you back.
Further narrow down the list from these phone calls.

, Drop by and see what sort of welcome you get. If you own a dog, take the dog with you. Are the reception staff welcoming and interested in your pet? Are the premises clean and inviting? Are the noticeboards well kept and with interesting, relevant displays, or the same-faded pictures from years ago?

, During the visit, assess how your pet reacts to the vet. Does the vet seem to understand the pet's psychology and know how to react to put it at ease?


If you own a dog, be aware some vets will deliberately ignore a shy dog, so as to let the dog gain confidence. This is a good thing, but it helps if the vet explains to you what they are doing, so you don't think they are just being rude. If you find the vet who knows to ignore a dog AND explain why, then it's likely you've hit gold.
If your pet especially doesn't like a certain vet, but doesn't mind others, consider following your pet's instincts.

, Don't feel bashful, remember you need to be able to trust this person with your pet's health. It's important you feel comfortable enough to get all the information you need.


Consider asking about referral procedures if your pet needs to see a specialist. Who does the practice deal with and how far away are they? You may also want to consider the 'extras' that the clinic provides, such as puppy classes, and weight loss clinics.
A final factor, is if you have pet insurance, does the clinic accept direct claims, or do you have to pay the vet and then seek reimbursement from your insurer., Pick the veterinarian that is the best fit for you and your pet at this point in time. Go to your veterinarian when your pet has a medical problem or when it is time for your pet's regular check-ups.


Remember, however, that you can change vets at any time, so don't think that this is the only vet you can go to now that you've made your decision.

Usually, it's because the spurs have made it more difficult for the cat to move. If you notice that your cat is not walking normally, contact your vet.The cat may also start limping.;
, This disease can also affect how much the cat moves its spine. Therefore, you may notice the cat isn't turning over as easily as it used to, or that it's having trouble stretching or cleaning itself., Another symptom that can appear with this condition is the atrophy of muscle along the spine. This symptom can take longer to appear than other symptoms., While this condition doesn't appear to be painful for every cat, it can be. You may notice your cat wincing, pulling back, or crying out in pain when you stroke parts of its back where the spurs are located., Most of the time, your vet will begin with a physical examination. They will note whether they see any problems in the cat's gait or flexibility, as well as if the cat seems in pain. However, this condition cannot be definitively diagnosed with a physical examination.While the examination is going on, let the vet know if your cat has had any spinal issues in the past.

, The most common way to diagnose this condition is through the use of x-rays. The vet will use them to examine the cat's spine. In turn, the vet will be able to determine if the cat has spurs in that location.The vet may need to take x-rays from multiple angles to see the bone spurs properly.

, In some cases, an MRI may be needed to properly diagnose this disease. Your vet might do this test, or they might send you on to a specialist for more finessed diagnostic tools., Often, your cat will not need any treatment for this condition, as the spine degeneration is usually due to aging. If your cat is not in any pain, your vet may decide that treatment isn't necessary., When a cat is in pain from this condition, the vet will often prescribe a pain mediation. However, make sure you only give pain medication under the direction of a vet, as many human pain relievers are toxic to cats. Usually, the vet will prescribe an NSAID pain reliever., If your cat is overweight, it may help for the cat to lose weight. Ask your vet about whether your cat is a good candidate for this option. If the vet says yes, have them discuss a weight loss plan with you.Generally, to help your cat lose weight, you need to decrease how much food it eats. A typical indoor cat needs 20 calories per pound of weight to maintain its weight; an 8 pound cat needs 160 calories to maintain its weight. For the cat to lose weight, you need to decrease its caloric intake by 40 calories. Therefore, an 8-pound cat would need 120 calories a day to lose weight.
For outdoor cats, you can increase the caloric intake to 35 calories per pound to maintain its current weight. The adjustment for losing weight is the same., Surgery may be necessary if the spurs are affecting the cat's spine. However, often the vet will not recommend this course of action. Most of the time, the spurs grow back, since they are trying to stabilize the spine."

Make sure that you have a reason for coming in when you call the vet’s office. This doesn’t have to be a problem for your pet, as just regular check-up can be a good reason. You don’t want to come in without an appointment, because your risk having other people in line, and the vet won’t be able to see you and your furry (or feathery or scaly) friend.


Whatever your reason, be clear about it when you talk to the receptionist. If you have something you want to discuss with the vet along with regular shots or other examinations, let the receptionist know so you can get the proper amount of time.It can also be a good idea to ask the receptionist if there is anything you should do ahead of the appointment. Give a brief explanation of the problem and ask if you need to bring a urine or stool sample, not feed your pet, or do anything else in particular.
Not all vets treat all kinds of animals. If you have a more exotic pet, like a bird, reptile, or rodent, make sure the vet you call treats that kind of animal. Even if the vet doesn’t, his office will probably be able to refer you to someone who does.;
, This includes brushing his fur or teeth, and trimming any nails, claws, or talons as necessary. This will also help keep your pet clean and healthy, hopefully reducing the need for additional vet visits. In additional to regular care, make sure to touch your pet regularly. This isn’t normal petting, but doing things like checking their face, legs, tail, and any other part of their body you don’t normally touch. The familiarity with handling will ease a lot of the tension for your pet and it also makes it much easier for you and the vet to look for health problems and to administer medication., If something is bothering you about your pet, it is really helpful to keep notes about the things that you notice, such as reduced appetite, biting one area of the body, pacing, making strange noises, or vomiting. You should be able to provide information about the duration of the problem, the precise symptoms, and any reactions that you have noticed in your pet.

, You’ll want your visit to go smoothly and quickly, so be prepared when you come in with a list of questions to ask the vet. There is no set list of questions, as they will be dependent on your pet’s condition. It can help to write them down so you have all the information and don’t forget anything when talking to the vet.Some things to think about having questions for include asking about weight, diet, and vaccinations. These are good things to ask about on every visit, as the answers may change depending on your pet’s age., Because you will transport your pet using a carrier, you don’t want him associating the carrier with a painful experience like the vet. Before the appointment, leave the carrier out with some treats or toys in it to let your pet get comfortable with the idea of going into it. If he does go in, give him warm praise as a way to reinforce the good behavior., Avoid feeding your pet the night before. That way, if you or the vet offers a food reward to encourage good behavior, your pet will be hungrier and more likely to respond. Of course, don’t do this if your pet’s medical condition means he needs to eat., This is especially important for a first time visit, as the vet will need them to learn a little more about your pet. Plus, with the records, you won’t have to remember every detail about your pet’s history, as it will be in their records. This includes a medical history and any vaccinations your pet has gotten., Vets are busy, with many patients to see, so you should be prompt and ready to go. Showing up late means the vet will probably have less time to meet with you and your pet. The best thing to do is try to be a little bit early, so you’re ready when the appointment starts, or you have some leeway if there is a delay in your travelling., Unless you have a big dog, or other animal that you can’t physically carry around, they should be kept in a carrier. Holding your pet, even on a leash, can give them the opportunity to escape, or get into other trouble. Once in the vet's, do not let your pet wander about freely. Many other owners with their pets will be in there and it is very easy for things to get out of control when pets confront one another. Most vets will expect that you keep your pet in its box or on its leash., You will probably need to ask the receptionist’s permission for doing this, as they like to keep a handle on where everyone is. This will avoid waiting, which can make your pet nervous. Instead, getting him into the room will help him get comfortable in the new setting., This is not the time to check your cell phone or read a book. Watch what the vet is doing, and pay attention if he tells you anything important about your pet’s condition. If you have any questions about what the vet is doing during the exam, feel free to ask.Don't be afraid to ask the vet to show you how to give a prescribed medication. Vets are more than happy to show you and be reassured that you fully understand what needs to be done.

, Most animals can sense your fear or anxiety. Keep your voice soft and calm, and try to act as normally as possible. This will help keep your pet from getting nervous or agitated., Use them to reward good behavior, not to calm your pet down. You want your pet to associate a visit to the vet as positive., Taking care of a pet can be expensive, especially if she needs some additional medical treatment. If the vet suggests something, be willing to discuss possible options. This can include cheaper procedures, or paying large bills in installments. Your vet probably knows several different treatments, and can help if you are honest about your ability to pay., Before you leave, make sure you have an appointment for next time. When that is will be determined by what kind of animal you have, your pet’s age, and any medical conditions he is facing. Schedule while you are at the office to make sure you don’t forget. If you are worried about conflicting with something else, schedule in advance, and call again when check your schedule to change the appointment as needed.

, Visiting the vet can be stressful for both you and your pet, so take it easy for the rest of the day. Consider giving your pet a treat, or doing something fun together., Sometimes you won’t remember everything the vet told you, or something else will come to your attention after the visit. That’s fine, just be sure to call and talk to the vet in order to get those sorted out quickly. Write your questions down as you think of them, which can help you remember what they are.A call with the vet after your appointment is a good thing to schedule while you are at the vet’s office. That way, you’ll have some time to process what you’ve been told (especially if it isn’t good news), and you know both of you can be available to discuss your pet."

Gather your veterinarian’s basic information.,
Search for your state veterinary license board.,
Fill out the online search verification form.,
View the results and verify licensure.",How to Check a Veterinarian License1," Most states have an online license verification system in which you can input basic data to verify a professional license. Depending on your state, you may need to gather different information. This is because state license verification systems are not standardized and information requirements vary from state to state. The most likely information will be:


Your veterinarian’s full name.
Your veterinarian’s physical address.
Your veterinarian’s license number. In almost all cases, your veterinarian will post his or her license in a visible location in the lobby of their business.;
, In the United States, individual states are responsible for licensing and regulating veterinarians that practice within their borders. As a result, the first thing you need to do to verify a veterinary license over the internet is to search for your state veterinary license board.


Each state’s website will vary. Often times, veterinary licensing boards will fall under the state department of business and/or professional regulation.
The easiest way to find online verification for your state is to search for the term “verify veterinary license .” In most cases, one of the first results will link you to a verification page for your state.
If searching for “verify veterinary license ” does not work, search for “veterinary license information .”
If you still are having trouble finding your state’s license verification page, search for your state’s department of business regulation website. From there, search that website for veterinary license verification., Once you’ve found your state’s online license verification system, you’ll need to fill out on the online search verification form.


Use the information you gathered to populate the form.
Make sure you have selected all of the appropriate boxes. Some forms may require you to select the licensure board in order to go ahead with the search. In this case, you’d search for a veterinary licensure board.
Hit enter., Once you’ve entered the required information and hit enter, the website will generate a list of licenses that match the information you’ve provided. From there, identify and verify your vet’s license.


The website may show several licenses for the same person. Depending on the state, it may generate a veterinary license and a business license for your vet.
Make sure that the veterinary license is “current.” It may also show “active.”
If the license shows as “expired,” “suspended,” “in process,” or anything similar, your vet may be practicing illegally."

By contacting the licensure board directly, you’ll be able to find out the status of your vet’s license and other relevant information.


Many states have one department dedicated to business and professional regulation and licensure. This is the department you will probably contacting.
In some cases, you will wind up speaking to someone directly at the veterinary licensure board for your state.
Be prepared to be put on hold for a short or moderate amount of time., Make sure to get the appropriate information that you will need to identify your vet and verify a current veterinary license.

Make sure to have your vet’s full name.
Have your vet’s physical address on hand.
If you can locate it, have your vet’s license number at hand. Very often, vets will post their license in the lobby of their practice., You won't have to work too hard to find the phone number of your state’s licensure board. However, you’ll have to do a little work to get the number.


Use your web browser or telephone directory to find the number for your state’s department of professional and business regulation.
If you have trouble finding the direct number to the department of professional and business regulation, find a number for your state’s department of state. The department of state will be able to transfer you to the correct department or division.
If someone offers to transfer you to the appropriate department, make sure to get the department’s direct number before being transferred. This way, if you get disconnected, you’ll be able to contact that department directly., After you’ve finally made it through to someone in the correct department, provide your vet’s information. Soon after, the attendant should be able to provide the status of your vet’s license.


The state representative will be able to explain exactly what the status of the license is.
If you have any questions about the licensing process, ask the representative on the phone.
If it turns out that your vet is practicing without a license, you should notify the state representative you are on the phone with."

Make sure the bandage doesn't loosen or tighten.",How to Care for a Bandage or Splint on a Cat1," Check your cat's splint or bandage at least twice daily to make sure that it is dry and secure. Time these observations with other normal activities, such as brushing or after-meal relaxation. If your cat demonstrates unease when you check the bandage, use treats or gentle petting to calm it down.If your cat resists contact with its bandaged area, simply observe it visually to assess its condition.;
, To ensure that the wound under your cat's bandage or splint does not get infected, check for signs of infection around the edge of the wrapping. An infection may lead to more serious complications and should be treated immediately. Bring your cat to the vet as soon as possible if you see:Swollen or red skin
Foul odor
Discharge
Sores

, Observe your cat's bandage or splint at least twice a day to make sure it doesn't get loose or tighten around your cat's limb. The latter may be evident if your cat's toes begin to swell, indicating that circulation is being cut off. Call your vet immediately to have your cat's wound re-bandaged.While you wait for your cat's wound to be re-bandaged by a vet, confine it to a single room to supervise it and keep it from further damaging the wound covering.

Identify pet insurance companies.,
Make sure they offer policies you want.,
Look at company reputation.,
Make sure you are eligible.,
Check to see if you are restricted by veterinary networks.,
Compare coverage.,
Understand pre-existing condition policies.,
Request written quotes.,
Find a low deductible.,
Compare premiums.,
Identify the maximum payout.,
Understand claim procedures.",How to Compare Pet Insurance Companies," There are only a few pet insurance companies that offer policies. In fact, four providers comprise roughly 75% of the market share.So while your list of pet insurance companies to compare may be small, you do need to spend some time comparing the different aspects and costs of their policies.


You can ask your veterinarian about pet insurance companies or identify companies by searching for them on the Internet.;
, Pet insurance policies aren’t standardized so you need to pay careful attention to the fine print to make sure you know what you are purchasing. The primary types of pet insurance are health and life insurance. You can find policies that cover preventative care, death costs, and routine care.You will also need to make sure that they cover your type of pet. Most companies cover dogs and cats, but you’ll have to check with the company if you have a more exotic pet.
Exclusions refer to the things that a plan does not cover. It is important to look at the exclusions for the policy to make sure they work with your needs. For instance, some plans may exclude hereditary or congenital disorders., Even though there are relatively few pet insurance companies, reputation is important. Ideally, you'll find a company that has a good reputation as being honest, quick to review claims, and reimburses their customers consistently. You can find online reviews by searching the name of the pet insurance company plus reviews.


Look for customer reviews from people who have either purchased these policies or have worked with the company as a veterinarian.
You can also talk with your veterinarian to see if there is a particular company they think is best or that is the easiest to work with.

, Every pet insurance company will have different requirements for the pets that they will cover.


Pets with pre-existing conditions are typically the most difficult to insure. Some insurance companies will deny any pets that have pre-existing conditions or they may cover certain claims as long as they aren’t related to the condition.Your pet may or may not be eligible based on their age, medical history, or breed., Some pet insurance polices will let you remain with your current licensed veterinarian while others will make you change veterinarians to a clinician who is part of their network. Ideally, the pet insurance company does not use a veterinary network and you can use any vet that you’d like.If your current vet is part of the company’s coverage network, you won’t have to switch providers.

, Pet insurance typically covers pets for injuries, accidents, and illness. Health insurance policies may also pay for wellness care and veterinarian visits. Additionally, life insurance can cover death costs for your pet.Policies may cover alternative therapies for issues like behavioral problems, hereditary or congenital conditions, and chronic conditions., No pet insurance company will cover medical expenses related to pre-existing conditions. However, some companies may still allow pets with pre-existing conditions to enroll. They will only cover future issues that are unrelated to the pre-existing condition.Most pet insurance policies will exclude your pet if they have a pre-existing condition.

, Some pet insurance companies may offer quotes online that are based on information that you enter on the website. These quotes can be helpful to get a general idea of what your policy would look like, but a written quote will give you much more detail.You will need to be prepared to offer information about yourself and your pet so the company can make an accurate quote.

, The deductible is the amount of money that you’ll have to pay out of pocket for vet visits and treatments before you are eligible to get reimbursed by your insurance policy. You want to find a policy that has a low deductible so you can start to get reimbursed as early as possible.Most companies will make you pay a deductible per incident rather than per year. This means that if your deductible is $500, and your vet visit costs $200 you will not be reimbursed. However, if your pet has to have a treatment that costs $800, you will be eligible for reimbursement.
Make sure you know whether the policy has an annual deductible or a per incident level.
The amount that you have to pay out of pocket before you reach is called a co-payment.

, In a pet insurance policy, the premium is the amount of money that you will pay for the policy. Pet insurance companies determine premiums based on your pet’s age, their medical history, the type of coverage you want, and the likelihood you will submit a claim.Ideally, you want to choose a plan that has a relatively low premium.


You will pay your premium either monthly, quarterly, or annually., Most policies will determine a maximum amount of money that the insurance company will give you. This can either be a certain amount each year or for the policy’s lifetime. Once you reach this amount, you will not receive any more money.Higher maximum payouts usually mean you will pay higher premiums.
Unless your pet develops an expensive chronic condition, like cancer, it is unlikely that you’ll reach the maximum payout amount., When you want to get reimbursed, you’ll have to file a claim with the pet insurance company. Like with human insurance, the company will evaluate the claim and either accept or deny it. Each company will have a different policy for submitting claims, but it is important to get an idea of how long claim submission takes when you’re looking at policies.You will want to find out how long it takes for claims to be submitted and processed. Ultimately, this determines how long it’ll take for you to get reimbursed.
Companies that allow online claims will typically be faster at processing claims than those that require submissions by mail.

Keep your cat indoors.,
Purchase protective bandage-covering clothing.,
Avoid intense play.,
Ensure that your cat doesn't chew on its wound dressing.",How to Care for a Bandage or Splint on a Cat2," While your cat is recovering from an injury and wearing a splint or bandage, it should be kept indoors at all times. The odds of your cat's wound wrapping getting wet or loosening are greater outdoors, which could lead to infection or further injury. If you do choose to let your cat outdoors, be sure that its bandage or splint is protected with a waterproof covering (available in many pet stores, or online.), To prevent your cat's bandage from getting loosened, ripped, or chewed, purchase protective bandage-covering clothing for them to wear. Veterinary jackets or boots can keep your cat's bandage or splint dry and clean while they heal. Check with your veterinarian to make sure that such a product would be appropriate for your cat's specific wound, and look online for models that are waterproof, well-made, and properly sized for your pet., While your cat is healing, avoid playing games that involve too much excitement or heavy exercise (e.g. chasing or hunting games). Activity restriction is important, and will help to keep you pet's bandage or splint intact. Increase petting or grooming to keep your cat occupied and content during this time., Monitor your cat to make sure it doesn't chew on its wound dressing. If it does, your cat may need to wear an Elizabethan collar to cut off its access to the wound site. Contact your vet if your cat suddenly begins chewing its bandage or splint after previously leaving it alone, as this may indicate an infection or irritation."
"
Schedule regular bandage or splint changes.,
Change your cat's splint.,
Replace bandaging at home.",How to Care for a Bandage or Splint on a Cat3," When your cat's bandage or splint is put on, ask your veterinarian if you can schedule appointments to have the dressing changed. Your veterinarian will advise you about how often this should occur, as bandages on infected wounds may have to be changed up to twice a day (or every 2 days for uninfected wounds) while splints may stay on for up to a week before being changed. Ideally, dressing changes should be done by a veterinarian to prevent infection, further injury, or an inadequately covered wound., If you are not able to bring your cat to the vet to have its splint changed, do it yourself using gauze pads, cotton roll, stretch gauze, elastic bandage, and wooden sticks. Gently remove the original splint entirely and apply a new gauze pad if there is a wound present. Wrap cotton roll and stretch gauze around the wound, place flat wooden sticks on either side of your cat's injured limb, and wrap the entire limb with an elastic bandage.To prevent your cat from wriggling away or ruining its new splint, have a friend or family member hold it while you change the splint.
As you change the splint, inspect the injury for any signs of irritation or infection.

, Gently remove your cat's bandage the way you would remove a splint, then re-wrap the limb with cotton roll and stretch gauze (3-4 layers of each). Wrap the wound tautly enough to stabilise the limb and attach it with adhesive tape.After bandaging your cat's limb, check it's paws to make sure they are not cold from lack of circulation.If they are, unwrap your cat's limb immediately and start again.

Look for difficulty with urination.,
Assess whether your cat has been stressed.,

Approve diagnostic testing.,
Approve immediate treatment.,
Give your cat medication.,
Minimize the cat's stress.,
Increase the cat's water intake.,
Make sure litter boxes are clean and appealing.",How to Diagnose and Treat Feline Interstitial Cystitis," The most obvious and clear symptoms of interstitial cystitis are connected to difficulty urinating. With an inflamed bladder, the cat could have a variety of problems when trying to evacuate its bladder. These include:Frequent urination
Difficulty passing urine
Urinating outside of the litter box
Painful urination or crying out while urinating
Blood in the urine;
, While the exact cause of interstitial cystitis is unknown, stress has been connected to bouts of the condition occurring. If your cat has been under stress, for instance if you have recently moved or you have brought a new pet into your home, then your cat is more likely to get FIC.


In general, stress can make a cat more likely to get a variety of health problems, including urinary tract problems., There are a variety of behavioral changes that may occur in your cat when it has FIC. For instance, it may begin over-grooming itself, particularly in the area around the urethra opening. The cat does this due to the discomfort of not being able to urinate easily.Other behavioral changes could include aggression and general irritation.

, While interstitial cystitis is a serious condition that needs to be monitored by a veterinarian, the symptoms connected with this condition can also be connected with other urinary tract problems that are much for serious, such as a total urinary blockage. Because of this, you need to take your cat to a veterinarian right away if it is having trouble with urination.


Call your veterinary office, tell them about all of your cat's symptoms, and then ask to be seen right away.

, Your veterinarian will likely do a thorough exam on your cat but most importantly they will feel around your cat's abdomen. When the veterinarian feels the abdomen they are looking for signs of pelvic organ pain, bladder wall thickening, and a small bladder.Doing a physical examination of the abdomen may require you, or the veterinary staff, to restrain the cat. This may be especially true for a cat that is frightened and in pain.

, In order to definitively diagnose interstitial cystitis, your veterinarian will need to do some diagnostic testing. Some tests that your veterinarian might suggest include:


Urine samples: bacterial culture and analysis
X-rays of the bladder
Ultrasound of the bladder

, If your cat is in distress or pain, your veterinarian will give it immediate care for pain, discomfort, or life-threatening problems. This could include an IV of fluids, pain relievers, or other types of medication for the infection that the veterinarian decides are needed.If your cat is unable to urinate, your veterinarian may need to put in a catheter to allow the cat to empty its bladder. This will require sedation but is necessary for the cat's health.

, The medications used for interstitial cystitis treat the symptoms of the disease, not the cause. However, they are important for helping your cat with any discomfort or continued problems urinating. Your veterinarian may prescribe one or more of these oral medications:Amitriptyline hydrochloride: This medication reduces frequency of urination but may have side effects, such as making your cat sleepy, have excess salivation, or constipation, among a variety of other side effects.Pentosan polysulfate sodium: This medication reduces pain from this condition in particular.
Ketoprofen: This is an anti-inflammatory medication. It should reduce your cat's pain.
Tolfenamic acid: This is also an anti-inflammatory medication that reduces pain and discomfort.

, The best thing you can do to prevent further bouts of FIC is to reduce the cat's stress. Above all, make sure the cat is in a stable and comfortable environment that includes proper nutrition, mental and physical stimulation, and love and comfort on a regular basis.Reducing your cat's stress means that you should not yell at it, pick it up in ways that it doesn't like, and avoid scaring it if at all possible. Avoid yelling or screaming around the cat, even if you are not directing it at the cat in particular.
You should not bring new pets into your home or change your cat's way of life dramatically. If you need to bring a new pet into the home you should make the change gradually and make sure that your existing cat is comfortable and not bullied by the new pet.Allow your cat space from new pets by giving it a space of its own and its own feeding area, so that it can get proper nutrition without having to interact with other animals.

, Increasing the cat's water intake will dilute its urine, allowing the urine to flow more easily. Be sure that you have water available for the cat at all times and try to encourage it to drink by putting fresh water out often. You should also begin to feed your cat wet food if you don't already, as this can dramatically increase the cat's water intake.You may also want to consider getting a water fountain for your cat. These are sold at pet stores and online retailers. The movement of the water can really encourage cats to drink more water.

, If your cat does not like its litter box this can prevent it from going to the bathroom when it needs to. An unappealing litter box setup can also create a lot of stress in the cat. Make sure to clean litter boxes daily and use a litter and litter box type that your cat seems to like.Whether you are a one cat household or you have more than one cat, you should have more litter boxes out than you have cats. Giving your cat the option of several litter boxes will reduce its stress and increase the likelihood that it uses a litter box when it needs to.

Assess why many deer fight.,
Know when deer are provoked.,
Know the consequences of a deer fight.,
Know when to never interfere during a deer fight.,
Identify if it is, in fact, two deer fighting.,
Assess why the deer are fighting.,
Only intervene if it appears that the fight is so intense that one or both of the deer could get killed.,
Drag the deer away from each other.,
Distract the deer.,
After you successfully break up the deer, get away from the area as soon as possible, as the deer can pursue you if angry enough.,
Don't go near areas where deer are known to roam.,
Do not feed the deer.,
Don't encourage competition.,
Tell authorities whenever you feel uncomfortable around competitive animals like deer.",How to Break Up a Deer Fight," While there are multiple reasons about why deer choose to take on a brawl, there may be other conclusions to support your theory. As unusual as it may seem, many game wardens and park rangers know the many environmental factors associated with deer fights, such as food, territory, other deer, radiation, and other factors. Knowing one or more of these factors can help you recognize why deer fight, and may also help you break up a brawl whenever one may occur.


Many deer most commonly fight whenever they are encouraged by other deer to see environmental factors as items to be fought over for. This is known as competition. You may need to know what competition is in order to understand why deer fight, as this is one of the most important forms of niches in nature.
Does will sometimes fight male bucks in order to protect their young fawn or fawns. In cases such as these, killing options are limited.
And very rarely, fawns will get into a fight with another fawn for much of the same reasons as adult deer do. However, fawns are vulnerable to more severe injuries than adults due to their small size and stature.
Humans usually prefer to steer clear of fights unless one is so intense that one or both the deer could get killed easily.;
, Whenever deer toss their head up and down (similar to a bull, but in an up and down motion) they are telling either you or another deer to stay away. Also, when male bucks shake or rattle their antlers, this means they are getting annoyed. You should learn to identify warning signs from a deer before a fight breaks out in order to escape or break it up before it gets too intense.


You should also listen for any snorting sounds from both genders of deer.
Female does commonly kick their back legs in the air if they are annoyed. This is similar to bucking from a horse.
Fawns make a slow, rasping sound from their throats.
You may need to notify game wardens if any deer is acting aggressively towards you, as deer, especially bucks, can be very dangerous.

, The consequences of a deer fight can be damaging if intense enough. A very large buck might hurt a smaller buck, for example. A fawn can easily get injured by a buck's antlers, too. Make sure you know how to attend to any severe wounds a deer might have after a fight.


This step only will apply if you're a game warden, a park ranger, or an experienced wildlife specialist. This will not work if you are just a tourist visiting a national park, for example.
If you are a tourist visiting a national park, let the experienced game wardens handle the deer. They have more experience and knowledge, and know how to break up an animal fight more easily.

, As stated above, let the experienced game wardens handle the deer. This includes biologists, field biologists, park rangers, etc. Don't put yourself in a bad position by attempting to interfere during the fight.


If you must absolutely interfere during a fight, however, refer to the steps below for more information.
This step is not guaranteed to work 100% of the time. You may get severely injured by putting yourself in a bad position. When in doubt, ask a game warden or a park ranger about the deer. They are there to help you, not harm you.
Never interfere during a fight if you think one or both of the deer are intending to harm you.

, You don't want to interfere during a fight, only to find out that it is two moose fighting. You must recognize that it is actually two deer fighting, instead of just two other bovines fighting.


Deer are generally skinnier and have a different skin type than other bovines.
A deer's hooves are really elongated toes, but they are very sharp, capable of ripping flesh and leaving gaping holes.
Deer also have a black nose and snout.
A deer's antlers are made up of bone, just like other bovines. They can be straight, curved, etc.

, Who or what are they fighting for? Is it territory, a doe, food, or just something valuable in general?


If you cannot tell what the deer are fighting over, then it is best not to interfere during the fight at all. It's not worth getting injured and then having to go to the hospital. Leave the fight to a professional.
If you can tell what the deer are fighting over, however, notify the authorities immediately. If you are able or absolutely have to break up the fight, follow the steps below.

, If you are able to intervene successfully without getting yourself seriously injured, then you may do so, but proceed with caution.


Get in between both of the deer. Hopefully you won't be trampled by the deer's hooves.
Grab both of each of the deer's legs to pry them apart. This is more effective if you have a partner with you, as they can handle one deer while you can handle the other.
Be very cautious and stay out of reach from the deer's sharp hooves, as they can cut you. Watch the antlers as well.

, This step is more effective if you have a partner with you. If you cannot get in between the fighting deer or are afraid of getting hurt, approach them quickly from behind and grab their back legs to drag them away from the other deer. Your partner should do the same.


Be very careful with this step, as a deer can easily kick you out of fear or anger.
Male deer may also become aggressive.

, If you are not able to separate the deer physically, then you'll have to distract them without actually putting yourself in harm's way. Throw something at the deer, such as a stick, a ball, your backpack, a book, anything to distract the deer before they hurt each other further.


Be cautious, as deer can perceive your actions as threatening.
You can also throw a blanket or something similar over the deer to blind them. If they can't see each other anymore, then they'll most likely stop fighting.
Notify game wardens if one or both deer turn on you.

, Call the authorities immediately and let them know what has happened.


Do not go looking for either of the deer involved in the fight as proof. They may still be angry. Leave the searching to the authorities.

, If deer sense that humans are in their territory, they may become fierce and attack other deer. This method only applies to bucks, not does or fawns.


Common areas where deer are known to live include swamps, forests, taigas, tundras, and national parks. In national parks, ask authorities if any deer that are living in the forests are considered safe before heading out.
Read laws and regulations concerning deer before going out in unknown terrain. Better safe than sorry.

, Feeding only encourages competition, as well as fights breaking out between deer.


Feeding deer also encourages deer to see humans as nonthreatening, which may put them too close to human resources, such as roads or farms. Bucks may also become aggressive.

, Competition is one of the many reasons why deer fight because it pushes them to a certain level in order to get what they want. So don't feed them or bother them constantly.


Do not assume deer only compete with their own kind. They can compete with all other kinds of animals, such as foxes, rabbits, birds, coyotes, wolves, or even bears.
Bucks are most aggressive during mating season, when they have does to defend from other bucks.

, Always notify authorities whenever you see deer fighting. They will handle it.


Park rangers and game wardens know what they're doing. Allow them to handle the situation, because they are experienced at this.

Bring your cat to the vet at least once a year.,
Discuss your cat’s medications and any related symptoms.,
Ask the vet if they recommend further tests.,
Get your cat tested for underlying conditions.",How to Detect and Treat Heart Murmurs in Cats1," Routine vet visits are the best way to identify heart murmurs, as nearly all are detected at annual checkups or vaccination appointments. During a routine exam, the vet listens to a pet’s heart with a stethoscope. If they detect a murmur, they’ll let you know how significant it is and if it requires further testing.Heart murmurs in kittens often go away on their own. The vet will likely suggest a follow up visit after a few weeks.;
, If the vet detects a murmur, they’ll ask several questions about your cat’s overall health. Tell them if your cat takes any medications and if you’ve observed symptoms such as:Poor appetite
Weight loss
Lethargy or weakness
Difficulty breathing
Pale gums

, Not all heart murmurs are the same, and the vet will grade the murmur’s intensity on a scale of one to six. The vet will base their diagnosis on this grade, as well as the murmurs' duration, when they occur in the heart cycle, and the cat’s age. They'll either recommend imaging tests or let you know that the murmur is innocent, which is the term given to murmurs that don’t impact overall health.Imaging tests, like an x-ray or echocardiogram, will help the vet detect signs of heart disease or deformity.
Depending on test results, the vet might refer you to a veterinary cardiologist, or heart specialist., Heart murmurs can also indicate conditions like anemia and hyperthyroidism. The vet will likely recommend tests for these and other issues.An underlying medical issue, like hyperthyroidism, can often be treated with a good outlook and without complications. Treating hyperthyroidism usually resolves the related heart issue.

Give your cat medication for high blood pressure.,
Discuss cardiomyopathy treatments with the vet.,
Seek immediate veterinary care if you observe signs of heart failure.,
Ask if a congenital disorder can be surgically corrected.",How to Detect and Treat Heart Murmurs in Cats2," High blood pressure, or hypertension, sometimes accompanies heart murmurs in adult cats. The vet will recommend a daily medication and suggest frequent checkups.If your cat is overweight, you should also ask the vet if they recommend any dietary changes, like switching from free feeding to scheduled meal times.

, Cardiomyopathy isn’t one specific condition, but is the name for any disease that affects the heart itself. An echocardiogram will help the vet identify a specific form of heart disease. After making an accurate diagnosis, they will recommend an appropriate medication, like a beta-blocker or a calcium-channel blocker., If your cat struggles to breathe or can’t move its hind legs, take it to the vet or emergency clinic immediately. Advanced cardiomyopathy can result in heart failure, so you should monitor your cat if it’s diagnosed with heart disease.Other symptoms can include cold ears and paws, and pale or bluish gums and eyes.

, If the vet finds a heart defect, ask them about its type and severity. Many minor congenital heart defects are tolerable and won’t make a major impact on a cat’s overall health. Larger deformities might require surgical treatment.Unfortunately, some defects are too severe for treatment.

Diagnose and treat feline anemia.,
Discuss hyperthyroidism treatments with the vet.,
Monitor your cat if the vet can’t detect any other problems.",How to Detect and Treat Heart Murmurs in Cats3," The vet will have to order further blood work if your cat tests positive for anemia, or too few red blood cells. Anemia can be related to issues including feline leukemia virus, cancers, and blood parasites.Unlike anemia in humans, feline anemia is rarely due to a dietary deficiency. Treatment will depend on the underlying cause. Options include transfusion, deworming medication, and corticosteroids., Hyperthyroidism can either cause an enlarged heart, leading to a murmur, or can result from heart disease. Treatment options include:Medications to manage the hormonal imbalance
Surgically removing the thyroid
Radioactive-iodine therapy, which is highly effective but only available at specially licensed facilities

, If the vet can’t detect any problems and your cat is otherwise healthy, they’ll likely recommend monitoring your cat. Bring it to the vet every few months, and keep an eye out for symptoms like lethargy, weight loss, poor appetite, and difficulty breathing."

Start prepping in high school.,
Work towards vet school in college.,
Explore holistic medicine during college.,
Attend veterinary school.,
Pass the licensing exam.,
Take supplementary classes and certifications in holistic medicine.,
Consider joining one or more of the holistic medicine associations.,
Look for a job in a clinic that practices holistic medicine.,
Write a great resume and practice good interview skills.,
Seek clients as a holistic vet.",How to Become a Holistic Veterinarian," Ideally, your journey towards becoming a holistic veterinarian should begin in high school. Start getting involved academically and otherwise early on as a student.


Take science courses in high school like chemistry, anatomy, biology, and physics. If possible, try to enroll in AP courses. Having AP courses on a college application, especially if you score high on the AP exam, can set you aside from other applicants at the schools where you're applying.Study for your ACT or SATS, especially for the science and math portions. High scores can help impress an admissions board. You might want to consider enrolling in an ACT or SAT prep course.
Volunteer at animal shelters, rescues, and veterinary clinics. Look for a holistic vet in your area and ask how you can be involved. Having experience working with animals can help bolster your application and give you the hands-on experience you'll need for your career down the road.
Try to land a job or internship working with animals in high school. You can ask teachers or counselors where and how to apply. There might also be volunteer programs for animal rescue activities, and you may even get the opportunity to travel or go overseas to aid in a rescue.;
, Once you've completed high school, you need to get an appropriate college degree that will help you get a spot in vet school once you graduate.


You should choose a major that gives you a strong grounding in the biological and physical sciences. Ask your college adviser about the best major or combination of majors if your ultimate goal is to enroll in vet school.
Keep your GPA high. Your GPA should be a 3.5 or higher if you want to get into a solid vet school after college. This is especially important later in college, while you're taking more advanced courses, as most vet schools pay close attention to your GPA during the last three to four semesters.You should be gaining clinical experience while an undergraduate. Volunteer at a veterinary clinic and seek internships that involve veterinary science during your summers.Take the Graduate Records Examination (GRE) sometime before you graduate. Most veterinary school require a high GRE score for admittance, so study hard. You may even want to enroll in a GRE prep course the summer before your senior year to assure a high score.Most vet schools ask for two to three Letters of Recommendation from professors or people who you worked with professionally during your time as an undergraduate. Some schools actually require 2 letters from a veterinarian, so staying in touch with those you worked with during your clinical training is also important. You should also strive to make good impressions on any professors you have classes with so you'll have someone to ask for a recommendation down the road., If your ultimate goal is to work in holistic medicine, find ways to explore this interest while an undergraduate student.


Join student organizations that advocate for the use of holistic medicines. Most schools, especially larger schools, have a litany of organizations available that cater to a wide-array of interests. See what you can find at your university.
If your school offers curriculum and courses about holistic medicines, try to take a few as electives.
If you're interested in holistic medicines, try getting involved with things like organic farming. Many colleges have an organic farm and those interested in natural foods and ethical practices probably also share some interested in holistic medication. This could also potentially give you an opportunity to work with animals if the farm houses livestock, which could look good on a veterinary school application.

, Once you've completed your undergraduate degree, you'll need to attend a veterinary school. In the United States, vet programs are typically four years long. Look for a program that seems open to holistic medicine, such as through a club or courses on holistic practices.


You should aim to apply to around five or seven schools. You will probably not be admitted everywhere, as vet programs are competitive, so apply to some back ups and safety schools. You also will probably need some kind of funding for vet school and different programs will offer you differing amounts of money. You want to keep your options open and choose a program that makes the most sense for you regarding your goals and financial situation.Veterinary school is an intensive four year experience. Not only will you learn the basics of animal health and anatomy in a classroom setting you will have a good deal of clinical, hands-on experience.You will have to select a speciality sometime in vet school, depending on what type of animals you want to work with and the kind of medicine you want to practice. Make sure the program you choose has professor who are studied in holistic medicine.Understand that you will likely run into some issues trying to pursue holistic medicine while in school. Currently, holistic practices are not well regarded by most of the veterinary community. Do not expect to get much training in holistic medicine while in veterinary school.

, In order to become a licensed veterinarian in the US, you must take the North American Veterinary Licensing Exam upon completing your studies in veterinary school.


You have to apply to take the exam, which can be done online or through mail. There is a $605 application fee and if you're an overseas student there will be an additional $282 fee. There are testing windows during fall and spring each year during which you can take the exam.Testing centers are found throughout the country and you can select a testing center near you when you sign up to take the exam. Usually, testing centers are in small office settings with six to 12 individual stations equipped with a computer. You have a total of 7.5 hours at the testing center, divided into six blocks, to take the exam and it consists of 360 multiple choice questions.Unlike many licensing exams, your scores are not displayed on site when you complete the exam. You will receive your score about four weeks after the close of each testing window.If you do not pass, you can retake the exam in the next testing window. You have a total of 5 chances to pass the exam., Once you've taken the exam and received your license, you should get further involved in the world of holistic medicine. Many organizations throughout the country offer classes and seminars about holistic medicine and there are other certifications you can earn regarding specific medical practices.


The American Veterinary Chiropractic Association (AVCA) offers classes and subsequent certification if chiropractic medicine is an aspect of holistic medicine you are interested in. Chiropractic medicine involves treating neuromuscular disorder through manual, non-invasive adjustments of the spine rather than medication or surgery.The Academy of Veterinary Homeopathy (AVH) is an organization of veterinarians that practice and support the use of non-traditional, homeopathic practices. They put out an annual journal and have yearly conferences and seminars throughout the country. Looking into becoming a member is a great way to expand your skill set in homeopathic medicine.You can get training and certification to perform acupuncture through the International Veterinary Acupuncture Society (IVAS). They offer a variety of coursework and are affiliated with American Holistic Veterinary Medicine associate. Acupuncture is a form of alternative medicine that involves inserting needles at specific points of the body to provide pain relief to patients., After engaging in some training and learning some special skills, thinking about joining some associations. This is a great way to keep your practices up to date and network with veterinarians that hold similar philosophic beliefs regarding medicine.


The American Veterinary Society of Animal Behavior (AVSAB) is a research organization constantly seeking out new and innovative veterinary practices. Many vets interested in holistic medicine are drawn to the society as it helps them stay up to date with new research.
The American Academy of Veterinary Nutrition (AAVN) is an association of animal scientists and veterinarians committed to understanding and improving the nutrition of animals across the United States. They're always looking for assistance of holistic veterinarians as they tend to be invested in keeping animal nutrition natural and healthy.The American Holistic Veterinary Medical Association (AHVMA) is an organization committed to holistic medication specifically. If you want to practice holistic medicine, joining the organization and participating in conferences, seminars, and educational outreach programs is a must.You may find other institutions and organizations as you begin working in your career. Read the latest veterinary medical journals and keep your eyes out for articles discussing holistic medicine. Look up the CVs of the authors and see if they belong to any organizations you'd be interested in joining. You should also review the CVs of any vets you meet at conferences or seminars and see if they belong to any associations that are relevant to your interests and goals.

, As you begin your job search, keep an eye out for veterinarian clinics that match your values. It may be difficult to open your own practice right away. Even if your ultimate goal is to start your own clinic, you will need to spend several years working for someone else so keep your eyes open for clinics that match your values.


If you're a member of any of the above organizations, many post job listings on their websites. You can also network with other vets you meet at conferences and workshops and get in touch with them. Ask if they're hiring or know anyone looking for vets with experience in holistic medicine.
Seek to move to a bigger city. A smaller town or suburb may only have a few clinics available and they may all practice traditional medicine. A larger metropolitan area is more likely to house a diverse range of veterinary clinics and holistic medicine tends to be more accepted and sought out in larger areas.

, In order to land a job, you'll want good interview skills and a solid resume.


Take advantage of career centers while you're enrolled in school. Take your resume to a career center to have it workshopped professionally. If you're already out of school, it's a good idea to have friends in veterinary medicine and other peers and co-workers look over your resume and give you feedback.
Remember, you're looking for work in holistic medicine and your resume should reflect your values. Include any clinical experience you've had in holistic medicine as well as any certifications you have any organizations you work with. If you've presented at any conferences, this also looks great on a resume.
If you're called in for an interview, always research the clinic and its values beforehand. At the end of the interview, be sure to ask questions. Do not limit questions to logistics, such as asking when you can expect to hear back. Ask open ended questions about the clinic's philosophy, values, and work atmosphere.Always arrive early. Showing up about 15 minutes before your scheduled interview time looks impressive to prospective employees. Maintain eye contact during the interview and give visual cues, such as nodding occasionally, to show you're interested.Use your alumni status to your advantage. Look for alumni associations in your area. If you apply for a job from a clinic where many vets graduated from the same vet program as you, you may be more likely to get an interview.

, Once you've secured a job in a clinic, you need to market yourself as a holistic veterinarian.


Put up advertisements at food co-ops, organic grocery stores, and other places where you're likely to find clients interested in holistic medicine.
Develop a professional website. This is one of the fastest and most efficient ways to seek out new clients in your area.
Ask the organizations you're a member of to advertise about your skills on their web pages and social media.
Participate in a variety of conferences to get your name out into the world of holistic veterinary medicine.

Use fencing.,
Try sound.,
Use negative reinforcement or the element of surprise if you happen across a coyote in your yard or campsite.,
Eliminate food sources liked by coyotes.,
Keep pets away from coyotes.,
Remove junk piles from your property.,
Try wolf urine.,
If these humane solutions don't help, consider calling in a professional.",How to Keep Coyotes Away from Campsites or Homesteads," It is recommended that the fence be at least 6 feet (1.8 meters) high, and also extend 1 foot (30cm) underground. The vertical spacing of such a fence should be no more than 4 inches (10cm). Since coyotes are so smart, they will sometimes jump over, or dig under fences. This is often the case on livestock farms, where the temptation is so great that a hungry coyote will do anything to get in.


Barbed wire placed at ground level can deter the coyote from digging under the fence.Yards and livestock can be protected from coyotes if the fence is high and deep enough. Be sure to keep the livestock inside the fence, or have someone on proper guard if they are being moved or are feeding somewhere else for some time.
More expensive fencing includes underground aprons and overhangs; these can be reserved for feedlots, a shelter area, corrals, or a confinement area to save on costs.Electric fencing can provide a very useful option at a reasonable price for surrounding large areas of livestock.Provide a secure shelter for livestock overnight.
Llamas and donkeys can be used as guard animals for livestock protection. The donkey should be a jenny or a gelded jack; ungelded jacks are too aggressive.In the case of donkeys and llamas, care needs to be taken that they're not able to socialize with other donkeys or llamas or they may neglect their livestock herd. Multi-species grazing can offer protective benefits, such as having sheep, goats, and cattle together rather than separated.;
, Sound can have an excellent impact on a coyote that has wandered into your yard or campsite.


Try banging trash can lids or anything else that is noisy to scare the coyote off.
Yell and make a lot of noise in any way possible.
Motion activated alarms can be useful. An even more tech-savvy option is the new Anti-Coyote sound system. This system relies on the fact that cougars occasionally kill coyotes. The systems emit replicated cougar sounds, and may keep coyotes away.
Propane exploders can be used to deter coyotes on farms and ranches., As well as the noise steps above, there are some other things you can try when you discover a coyote in your locale. Coyotes dislike novel stimuli and frightening tactics can scare them off initially.However, you should never make eye contact with the coyote, turn your back to it, or run away from it, as these will signal aggression or offer a temptation to chase and attack. If you wish to leave, do so calmly, or try one of these scaring off tactics:


Spray the coyote with a water hose.
Make yourself appear terrifying with noise and lots of body movements; wave your arms about, kick your legs up. This will let them know that you are the boss, and to stay away.
Use children's toys that make noise, such as bangs, whirs, jingles, etc.
Use motion activated lighting that will be triggered by the coyote crossing a particular area of the yard. Having lighting on from dusk to dawn can deter coyotes from entering the lit area.There are also strobe lights with sirens which can deter coyotes if used in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.
While a vehicle can temporarily deter coyote behavior, especially if moved about a lot, it can also act as a hiding spot (or blind) prior to attack, so be careful about relying on this method., While coyotes love flesh food (especially rodents), they are very opportunistic feeders and will eat anything they come across. As such, it's important to make it impossible to get food from our environs. Before all else, never try to feed a coyote as a means to try to tame it or help it; feeding it is simply reinforcing poor behavior that will encourage them to return and will not tame them. Some of the ways you can keep down food sources around your yard or campsite include:


Keep all garbage in a coyote-proof box or container. Basically if it's secure and cannot be opened with ease, it will deter the coyote. Ask your local municipality for details if your local store cannot help provide such a container.

Dispose of all food waste properly both at home or at a campsite. Either place edible waste into a secure garbage container or into a secure compost bin. Do not leave food waste lying around.

Pick ripe fruit from your trees and remove fruit that has fallen to the ground before it becomes the subject of a coyote feast.

, Cats, dogs, and other pets can present a reason for attacking, mating, or as a potential meal. To protect your pets, if you live in a coyote area or you're camping with a pet, do the following:


Keep pets (dogs and cats) in at night and to keep an eye on them during the day, to prevent encounters and to prevent them from being a possible source of the coyote's next meal or attack.
Keep pet food inside or away from where a coyote can forage. If you want pets to eat outside, bring in all uneaten food as soon as the pet has finished eating.
Spay or neuter your dogs. When dogs are ready for mating, coyotes will try to mate with them.
Don't use your dog as a coyote guard dog unless he has been properly trained to do so. Such a dog needs both proper rearing and training to be able to protect livestock from coyote attacks, otherwise he can become prey.Cover fish ponds. Coyotes eat koi fish that are not protected.
Don't scatter birdseed around. Even though it doesn't seem like coyote food, coyotes are attracted to birdseed. Collect such birdseed up after the birds have eaten or use a non-spilling method of feeding (keeping it up high) if you want to feed birds.

, These can serve to hide both predator and prey. Rabbits and other prey liked by coyotes might use junk piles to breed and live in, thereby attracting coyotes. Moreover, coyotes can use junk piles to hide behind before making an attack. Removal of junk piles has several other benefits, such as reducing habitat for snakes, poisonous insects, and spiders or scorpions, and it looks better.


Remove all water sources around the yard or campsite; these can attract coyotes.

, One natural, and innovative answer to the growing coyote problem is the use of wolf urine as a deterrent.Wolves are one of the coyote's natural predators, and coyote populations drop as wolves are reintroduced into an area.


Another odor that might deter coyotes is the common mothball or ammonia soaked rags. Place these at strategic locations around the yard or campsite.

, Many professional wildlife catchers will use live traps, so that the coyote doesn't have to pay with his life for trespassing. However, be aware that relocation isn't effective, so it is much better to provide the barriers suggested above so that you can continue to live in harmony with the coyote population.

Decide where you’re going to observe wildlife.,
Research the wildlife in your chosen location.,
Prepare for your expedition or outing.,
Blend in with your surroundings if required.,
Be still and wait.,
Approach wildlife carefully.,
Use your ears.,
Figure out what wildlife is doing.,
Record your observations.,
Learn more about watch you observe.",How to Watch Wildlife," Obviously if you want to observe a particular type of animal or bird, you’ll have to go where that creature lives. If you’re more flexible, however, you can find wildlife just about anywhere, even in the middle of the city. Consider your budget and the amount of free time you have available, and then go out and meet nature. Your own garden or the nearest park or green space can work to if you can travel easily. You can even watch wildlife through a widow.;
, Find out what creatures you can expect to see, and find out a little bit about them. Pay special attention to information about their daily lives and behavior—their feeding, sleeping, and breeding habits, for example—and what environments they prefer so you’ll know where and when you’re most likely to see them. A little research will also help you figure out what animals and birds are doing when you see them. Look up specific species on the internet, read about them at your local library, or visit your local nature center or wildlife-watching club for more information. Don't have to high expectations. It takes patience and time to see rare animals and birds exhibiting unusual behaviour. Don't forget that common species can be fascinating too. Insects, Sparrows, Grey Squirrels, pigeons and Starlings are wildlife too. Watching a Starling feed it's chick may not be as exciting as watching a Timber Wolf hunting, but you have to start somewhere!

, The preparations and equipment you will need will vary depending on where you’re going. Make sure to bring appropriate clothing for the climate, and dress in layers if it's cold. Let somebody know where you will be and when you expect to be back. Research the area if you’re unfamiliar with it, and get a map and compass or GPS device if appropriate. Remember to take a pad, pen, and camera to record your observations. You may also want to take binoculars. If you like to sketch, why not take a sketch book and pencil. You can challenge your self by taking a list of things you hope to see and ticking them if and when you spot them. Field guides can be useful for helping identify what you see.

, Wear camouflage clothing appropriate for the setting, or simply wear earth-tone or drab clothes—avoid flashy, bright attire that will call attention to you. Don’t wear colognes, perfumes, scented lotions or hair products. Above all, be quiet. Keep talking to a minimum (use hand signals whenever you can), and step lightly, being careful not to break twigs underfoot. Turn off your cell phone or pager, and wear clothing that does not make excessive noise (cotton is usually a good choice in warm dry weather; wool or polyester fleece for pants and sweaters is smart for safe, comfortable viewing in cold or wet conditions)., Perhaps the best way to get a chance to observe wildlife, especially at a wildlife viewing area, is to simply wait for animals or birds to show up. Find a comfortable, partially concealed place from which to observe wildlife. You can use a constructed implement, such as a duck blind, or your can simply crouch low to the ground or hide behind rocks or trees. Be patient. Animal and birds may hear you coming and go into hiding, or they simply won’t show up if they sense your presence, but if you wait long enough and quietly enough, chances are they’ll either not notice you or not feel threatened by you., Usually your best bet is to sit still in one place (a place where you know you have a good chance of spotting wildlife), but sometimes you’ll see something in the distance and want to get a closer look. Remember to remain silent and try to stay downwind from it. Move slowly, and use the cover of trees, rocks, and other natural features to your advantage. If it is a potentially dangerous anima, you’re better off keeping your distance and viewing it with binoculars or your camera’s telephoto lens. Even if the creature is harmless, respect its space and don’t disturb it., Whether you’re searching for wildlife or observing it, you’ll be more successful if you rely on more than just your eyes. Listen for cracking twigs or branches, animal calls, or the flutter of birds’ wings to help you locate wildlife. While you’re watching animals and birds listen to the sounds they make. Soon you’ll be able to distinguish different types by sound alone. To amplify sounds, cup your hands behind your ears., If you’ve done your research you should know a bit about the behavior of the wildlife you’re watching. Try to identify certain behaviors as you observe them in the wild, and make a note of behaviors that you’re not familiar with., If you really want to get serious about wildlife watching, you should keep a journal of your observations. Note the types of creatures you see and their characteristics, and jot down what they are doing and where. Make sketches or take pictures and paste them into your journal., Once you return from the field, review your journal and do some more research to answer any questions that came up during your observations.

Understand the dangers and balance these with common sense.,
Look out for blue ringed octopus.,
Beware the box jellyfish.,
Avoid the stonefish.,
Take care to keep away from the stingray.,
Don't swim with sharks.,
Avoid picking up shells if you don't know what they belong to.,
Avoid touching a Portuguese man of war (blue bottle jellyfish) on land or going near one in water.",How to Identify Dangerous Marine Animals in Australian Waters," The dangers in Australian waters are real and that is not even to mention rip currents and high waves that sweep away unsuspecting rock hopping tourists. A number of venomous marine animals inhabit Australian waters and knowing their habits can help to keep you safe from encounters, meaning that it is perfectly possible to come to an arrangement where you can enjoy your water activities without being harmed by the resident wildlife.;
, This pretty but deadly little creature resides in rock pools and other still areas of water all around Australia's coastline. They are also known to make a home inside beverage cans and other containers that make their way to the bottom of lakes, artificial water spaces and the like, close to beaches, such as in Adelaide's foreshore area. If accidentally trodden on or picked up, this creature inflicts a fairly painless bite.Unfortunately, its toxin is highly lethal and fast acting. To avoid it, don't pick up anything that could harbour this octopus - rocks in rock pools, cans lying in water or other containers. Never provoke it and watch where you tread. If bitten, immediate hospitalisation is required, with mouth-to-mouth resuscitation should breathing cease in the interim - mouth-to-mouth can keep a victim alive.Place pressure on the wound, as for a snakebite. Note!: The blue ringed octopus is often harder to spot than one might think. In addition to being able to camouflage themselves to blend into their surroundings, their rings and namesake aren't quite as vivid as people think-- at least not until they're ready to bite. When at rest, a blue ringed octopus' rings are often very thin and can appear almost black, depending on the lighting. The neon blue that is often shown in pictures appears only as a last warning.

, Box jellyfish are found in northern Australia's coastline. This jellyfish has long tentacles that reach around 3 metres in length. These tentacles contain a highly venomous poison that can kill within minutes of contact. To avoid this creature, obey the signs. Most beaches will be signposted when these creatures descend en masse and you would do well to stay out of the water - New Scientist labelled these creatures as not ""dim-witted ocean drifters"" but ""fast, active predators that hunt and kill with incredible speed and brutality.""Their season is usually October - May, so be especially cautious during this time. Get immediate medical help if stung and tell them it is a box jellyfish sting so that the ambulance or lifesaving club staff can bring antivenom. Use vinegar to neutralise the stingers that haven't fired and keep the sting ""gravity neutral"" - if it is too high, it will carry to the heart faster and if too low, it will cause swelling.Apply limb pressure immobilisation if appropriate.Cold packs can ease pain for conscious victims.

, Stonefish are masters at the art of camouflage. They are found in the tropical coastline of Queensland and the Northern Territory. Stone fish have 13 venomous spines along the back that produce intense pain on contact. Most encounters are accidental, as waders tread on them unwittingly. Avoid the stonefish by not wading with bare feet, watching where you put your feet and being aware of where stonefish are known to reside. If stung, seek immediate medical assistance. In the interim, assist a victim by placing the sting into hot water (as hot as the victim can tolerate) and mouth-to-mouth if the victim stops breathing. Do not constrict movement of the venom in this instance., Stingrays are mostly all over Australia, and can impact swimmers, divers, kayakers and other unsuspecting water lovers. They are bottom dwellers most of the time, tending to feed on the sand surface. Often they cannot be seen as they sit under the sand, with an eye possibly poking out. Generally, stingrays are not aggressive but they are equipped to protect themselves. Stingray injuries can include lacerations from the barb at the end of its tail, along with the potential for infection, intense pain and respiratory or other reactions in susceptible persons. Avoid stingray encounters by being careful where you place your feet and not provoking any that you encounter swimming in your vicinity; move away immediately and without panic. Drag your feet along the bottom as you enter the water. The grinding of the sand can be felt by stingrays and they will swim away. This is referred to as ""the stingray shuffle."" Seek medical assistance immediately if stung.

, Australian coastline is a haven for many sharks and, in particular, for the great white shark and the grey nurse shark. A number of sharks are listed as endangered species in Australia. To keep out of the way of sharks, use common sense and keep away from areas known to be shark infested. Swim with other people and avoid swimming in dirty or turbid water. If you see a school of fish behaving strangely, this may be an indicator of the presence of sharks and you should leave immediately. Avoid swimming in deep channels, with pets, or near people fishing (the bait will attract the sharks)., Cone shells contain extremely venomous snails. If you do not know what the shell belongs to, it probably is not safe to pick it up. If you are stung by a cone shell, seek medical help immediately.

, These jellyfish can still sting a human or an animal, even if it is already dead. The sting can be mild to extreme pain. The sting depends on the jellyfish's size, and amount of involved tentacles. Blue bottle jellyfish travel in groups of 1000, and it is wise to stay out of water, especially if you see a pack of them. Portuguese man of war tentacles average 33 ft long, and get about 3 ft wide.

Accept your best offer.,
Cope with rejection.",How to Send a Book to a Publisher," You want to know how to sell your book going into a proposal. Before you sit down to write your proposal, you will need to figure out some basic information about the current market for books in your genre.Figure out your genre. Are you writing fiction, nonfiction, poetry? From there, what is your sub genre? Is your nonfiction book a book of essays or a memoir? What could you call your fiction work? Is it literary fiction, or a more specific genre like historical fiction, science fiction, or fantasy.
You want to know what commercial value your book has. Publishers and agents will not waste time on books that will not sell. Research the bigger books currently on the market in your genre. Ask yourself, ""What is my book doing that these books are not? Where does my book fit in?"" If you can find a missing niche in the market that your book fills, this is important information to provide in your book proposal.;
, When you're writing your proposal, you want to be highly self critical. You will have to ask yourself certain questions to help ascertain how to best sell your book to an agent or publisher.The first question you should ask is, ""So what?"" Why is your book important to the current literary world? What makes it important? This is where you must explain why your story needs to be told.
The second question is, ""Who cares?"" Identify a specific audience you believe will buy the book. For example, maybe your market is middle aged working women, or college-aged art majors. Find as specific a market as possible.
The last question is, ""Who are you?"" This is where you have to sell yourself. Explain why you're the best person to tell this story, and any qualifications you have that prove you're a decent writer. For example, you're writing a memoir about mental illness in America. Maybe you worked as a psychiatrist in New York City for 5 years before obtaining an MFA in nonfiction from the University of Iowa. All this could qualify you to tell this specific story.

, Most proposals should contain a title page. This just includes basic information, like your name, address, and email. From here, you will need to write your first sentence. This should be a single sentence summary of your work.Boiling your book down to one sentence can be tricky, and it may take a few days to get that sentence right. Feel free to ask friends for help. You can give someone a variety of sentences and ask something like, ""Which of these sentences makes you most want to read this book?""
This is essentially a tagline, like you would see in a movie poster. Try to hook your reader in by making your book sound exciting. For example, ""In an era where psychiatric drug use is at an all time high, a renown child psychiatrist from Atlanta wonders if an experimental program for childhood ADHD might benefit her clients more.""

, Have you ever read the back of a book at a bookstore? This is the kind of language you're going for with your proposal. Read a variety of book covers to get inspiration, and try to use the same kind of language in your overview.Your overview should be brief. Strive to keep it at a paragraph's length. Use your words wisely. Cut out unnecessary adjectives and adverbs whenever possible.
Remember, you want to keep a publisher or agent interested. Publishing houses and agents receive hundreds of proposals a day, so you will have to work hard to make yourself sound interesting.

, Here is where you work on selling yourself. Give a brief biography that overviews why you are the best person to tell this story. Include any credentials you have that speak to your ability as a writer. This should be about half a page to one page long.Stick to relevant details. An agent does not need to know you grew up in the Midwest and live with your spouse and two dogs. Talk about your qualifications as a writer. If you have any previous publications or books, list them here. If your work has earned any kind of special awards or recognition, this should also be mentioned.
Do you have any degrees in creative writing, or in a field related to your book's topic? For example, returning to the memoir about mental health in America, you could say something like, ""I have a PhD in psychiatry from University of Michigan, and counseled children in upstate New York with ADHD for 10 years. After this, I obtained an MFA in nonfiction from the University of Iowa.""

, This is one of the most vital parts of your proposal. You want a publisher or an agent to feel like this book could potentially make a profit. Mention every reason you can think of that people would buy your book.Talk about what you've already done and not what you plan on doing. Agents and publishers are likely to help an already established author. Have you identified and reached out to a target audience? Have you participated in literary readings? Do you have an online presence, like a blog or even an active Twitter page?
Be as specific as possible when you're explaining why your work is marketable. For example, do not say, ""I know a lot of people in the world of psychiatry and also literature."" Instead, say, ""I have attended several AWP panels talking about my science-based nonfiction work, all of which were heavily attended. My blog has roughly 15,000 visitors per month, and blog pieces have been cross published in popular online publications like Salon and the Huffington Post.""

, Usually, publishers and agents will want a synopsis of your book. They will also want a few sample chapters to asses the quality of your writing.For a synopsis, keep it between 2 to 3 pages. It's a good idea to stay on the shorter side, as agents and publishers are often pressed for time.
Usually, agents and publishers will want the first 40 to 50 pages of your work. However, check specific guidelines. Some agents and publishing houses will want more or less.

, Not everyone needs an agent to get a book published. Having an agent can be a tremendous asset, however, if you're aiming to get published in a larger house. It's a bad idea to send in your book cold to a place like Random House, which receives thousands of submissions each day.Does your work have significant commercial value and are you looking to publish through a big house? If you're writing a work on a hot button issue, or if you already have a big presence in the literary world, an agent may be necessary to get your book to the right sources.
However, you may be looking towards an independent publisher or a university press. Such places usually do not require agents, and some have free reading periods where even a book proposal is not required. If you're writing something in hopes of getting published through a regional press, such as a book of essays on Michigan, you probably do not need an agent.

, If you decide to go the agent route, search for a relevant agent for your proposal. You do not want to send your book proposal out to agents randomly. An agent who works with mostly nonfiction authors will likely not read your proposal on a science fiction novel, for example.Try subscribing to publications like Writer's Market and Writers' and Artists' Yearbook. These publications usually offer you a list of agents and the genres in which they work. Make sure you purchase the most recent version, as outdated versions may give you the names of agents who are no longer working.
You can also look online. Websites like AgentQuery, QueryTracker, and Duotrope prove listings of agents by genre.

, You can also use the above resources to seek out publishers. Small presses and university presses usually do not require you have an agent to submit. In fact, some smaller publishers may not even require a book proposal. Coffee House Press, for example, usually has an open reading period for manuscripts each spring.As with an agent, make sure you know the publishers well. A publisher that primarily publishers literary fiction and nonfiction may not be interested in genre-based works, like sci-fi and fantasy.

, When you've found the right agent or publisher, make sure you read over submissions guidelines carefully when sending in your manuscript. Agents and publishers get many submissions each day, and may simply throw out a proposal that is not formatted properly.


Follow basic formatting, such as requirements for margin sizes, fonts, title pages, and so on.
Many presses and agents require you include a self addressed stamped envelope (SASE) so they can mail you an acceptance or rejection.

, If you have gone the agent route, an agent will want to work with you to refine your proposal. Your agent will want to help make sure you write a marketable draft of your book that's likely to sell to potential publishers.Try to go into the situation with an open mind. Many people get attached to their original idea, and do not want to listen to criticism. However, it's important you follow your agent's advice. If you're interested in selling your book, your agent can help you figure out a way to make it more likely to get accepted by a publishing house.
Keep in mind that, sometimes, restrictions force you to be more creative. Your agent may want you to trim certain things down, or to shift focus slightly. While this may be frustrating, you may end up with a final copy you like more than your original idea.

, Once your proposal is refined, work on your book. If you already have it written, work on refining your drafts with your agent's suggestions in mind. If you're not working with an agent, simply strive to write a high quality draft.It takes a long time to write a final draft, so have patience and stay on a schedule. Carve out some time each day in your schedule to sit and write.
If you have any contacts in the writing world, such as previous professors or colleagues from a creative writing program, talk to them. Ask them to read your draft and provide you with honest feedback.

, As with your proposal, your manuscript should follow all formatting guidelines a publishing house requires. Each publishing house will have slightly different guidelines, so read guidelines over carefully. Make sure you follow all requirements of margins, font, title pages, and so on. You should also include SASE if the publisher requires this.

, Remember, rejection is common in the literary world. You should not send your book to only a few publishers. Send your book out to a wide array of publications. This will increase your chance of having a publisher select your book.Remember to send your book out to relevant publishers who publish books in your genre.
If you're working with an agent, your agent can help you find publishers. If you're working on your own, you will need to use online resources to find publishers.
If you know someone in the literary world, such as someone you met at a conference or attended school with, contact them if they have a recent publication. They may be able to help you get your foot in the door at a publishing house.

, You may only get a few offers on your book. Offers also have a way of fading. A publishing house may make an offer, but later withdraw it or lose interest. From the offers you receive on your book, select the best one.If you have more than one publisher interested in your book, you may get competitive bids. You can select the publisher who is willing to offer you the highest bid.
You should also negotiate things like advances. An advance is an amount of money your publishers gives you to get a start on your book. A higher advance is generally better, as it will give you more resources to focus on your writing.

, You may not get any offers on your book the first time around. Most successful authors faced many rejections before experiencing success. As you send your book out to publishers, find ways to cope with rejections along the way.Have a lot going on besides your book proposals in terms of your writing. Work on curating a literary series, sending your work out to small journals, and self-publishing on a blog. This way, you'll have a lot more going for you if you receive a rejection. It may sting less.
Rejection is usually not personal. Your work may simply not have been a good fit, or it may have been too similar to another book coming out soon. It does not mean you're not a good writer, so learn to take rejection with a grain of salt.

,How to Write Stream Of Consciousness1,
"
Choose a character or topic.,
Forget conventional grammar.,
Revise.,
Illustrate inner thoughts and feelings.,
Read other examples of this writing style.",How to Write Stream Of Consciousness2," In general, stream-of-consciousness writing is tied to a particular character, as it is intended to illustrate the inner thought patterns of that character. For the character’s thoughts, you could choose a multitude of topics, related or unrelated. This could include people, events, dreams, emotions, activities, items, or anything else. It’s sometimes easier to start with a broader topic if it’s the first time you’ve written stream-of-consciousness.Literally any topic will do, as long as you have something to say about it – even if it doesn't seem like much at first.
Using this method, you can connect topics that seem unrelated. For example, you could begin discussing a certain character who loves roses and then immediately switch to a childhood memory of your mother’s rose bushes. This is the way thoughts often work in our heads – so it is also a great way to show how a character thinks and connects ideas in their mind.

, You don’t need to capitalize, punctuate, or even spell correctly. If necessary, make up a word to suit your needs. The point is to get your creative juices flowing, not to focus on line-editing what you write or how you are portraying your character’s thoughts. Remember that the point of this style of writing is to mirror how thoughts naturally flow through our heads, and people don’t typically think in complete sentences with perfect grammar.Ignore sentence structure. You could do an entire page of adjectives, verbs, or nouns related to your topic. Or you could do short phrases, or whatever else comes to mind, as long as it illustrates the character’s thought patterns in a pointed, methodical way.

, Spend a few days away from the writing so that you can look over it with fresh eyes. Think about what you wrote and if it seems to be accomplishing the goal you set out to achieve. Go through several drafts.This type of writing can allow you to provide interesting insights or connections that people normally wouldn’t see. It’s valuable to save this work for future reference to look back over what kinds of connections you made between ideas.
Even if it’s weird or bad, make sure you save your writing. You may want to come back to it at a later time or include it elsewhere in your work.

, Stream of consciousness writing is often used to display the interior monologues of characters in stories. This form of writing is meant to replicate the fast-flowing, free-associating way our brains automatically work when we are thinking inside our own heads. So the inner monologue is a stream of often disconnected thoughts, ideas, or subjects.Many famous authors have implemented this strategy in their writing – including James Joyce, William Faulkner, and Virginia Woolf.

, One of the best ways to master any given style of writing is by reading examples where it is done well. If you find yourself struggling, spend some time reading some texts that focus on the stream-of-consciousness style.You could try reading ""Mrs. Dalloway"" by Virginia Woolf, Ulysses by James Joyce or As I Lay Dying by William Faulkner.

"
"
Familiarize yourself with the form.,
Choose your tools.,
Find a spot to write.,
Write.,
Give your brain freedom.,
Make connections.",How to Write Stream Of Consciousness3," A great way to prepare yourself for writing in the stream-of-consciousness style is to practice a type of brainstorming called freewriting. This usually involves forcing yourself to sit and write for a predetermined amount of time on a certain topic – though content, grammar, and style should be mostly ignored.The main idea is to keep writing for as long as you can and never take the pen off the paper until the timer dings. This allows you to write more than you think you can and to see how your brain works connecting various thoughts and topics.
This makes for great practice for stream-of-consciousness writing because it will give you a model to follow when writing the inner monologues of your characters in the stream-of-consciousness form.

, Freewriting is much better done with pen on paper than on a computer – computers greatly restrict the format of your writing and the flow of your thoughts.Freewriting requires a kind of natural rhythm that is hard to replicate when typing on the computer.
Make sure you have extra paper, a pencil sharpener if you’re using a pencil, or an extra pen.
If you are on a touchscreen, then try to activate software for drawing writing and test a few actions for comfort and tool sets.

, If you’re describing something, you should probably have the item in question visible. You should be comfortable – find a spot with the proper lighting, a comfortable seat, and few distractions.


The most important thing is to find a place where you can sit comfortably and not be disturbed.

, Once you’re ready, just write for a preset amount of time – 5 minutes, 10 minutes, whatever. You don’t have to stick to any particular format. Write backwards, upside down, or in a shape. You could do a spiral starting from the center of the page, or a starburst of phrases, or any other shape that seems to work.Use different colors of pen or pencil. You could change colors every letter, or every word, or in a way that makes the overall work look pleasing. This can be done at any time.
Keep writing until you run out of words. But try to push yourself to keep writing until the time is up.

, It’s not necessary to stay on topic. Freewriting gives you the freedom to write whatever comes to mind, or at least to appear to be doing so. If you start writing about the weather and end up talking about what you had for dinner last night, that’s okay.Freewriting lets you track how your mind roams freely without the constraints of normal writing (thought filtering) processes.

, By letting your brain wander, you allow it to access information you may have forgotten you knew. Or things you didn't realize you connected to this topic. Your brain houses an enormous amount of knowledge. Letting yourself engage in freewriting is a great way to tap into that internalized knowledge.If you are writing methodically in the freewriting practice, this is also a great way to show how surprising connections can be made between obscure or seemingly unrelated topics. Flowing between ideas allows the connections to be made clearer.

Seek advice with your friends and family.,
Develop your vocabulary.,
Practice.,
Find out how you write best.,
Research.,
Follow the rules and write nicely.,
Stick with your goal.,
Plan your text before starting it.,
Review your finished text.",How to Write Something People Will Read," Write down something and ask someone to read it. Ask for their opinion and constructive criticism. They might give you good advice on what they would prefer to read, and what you could improve.


This is a good idea because it gives you an idea of how people really see your writing, apart from your own opinion.;
, This is perhaps the most important aspect of writing something worth reading. The more you know words and their meaning, the more rich will any text you decide to write, be.

, Practice makes perfect. It's a believed saying that is actually true. You should start off writing something every day - not necessarily something anyone should see, just something to improve your skills.


A good idea is to keep a diary, or write some random stories everyday.

, Is it on paper or on a computer? Is it in a special environment? Do you like music while you write or do you like it quiet? It's important to discover that part of yourself that brings out the best creations of writing.

, Whatever text you might be writing, it's important to improve your knowledge in that area. Even if it's something that you don't need to know about, or something you are not going to write down, having the knowledge will make your text more interesting, because the thoughts going through your mind will reflect in the text.

, Don't forget punctuation, grammar, capital letters and so on. This is possibly the most important of any text, even short ones. No one finds it amusing to read texts with too many or a lack of periods, neither does any one want to read a text with absolutely no capital letters, or capital letters all over the place. Make your text seem nice, readable, and professional.

, When you are writing a text, make the moral/point very clear. It's confusing and frustrating to read something, and when you have finished reading it, you still don't have a clue what it meant, or what is was about.

A good rule is, when you read the text, is it easy to analyze, resume and understand? If not, you should probably start over, to make your intentions clear.

, Before even writing the title, you should thoroughly plan what you want to be in the text. A good idea is to brainstorm - write all your ideas down on a paper and decide what should stay and what should go.


Think about how you are going to introduce the text, end it, create the drama, show the point - everything is better when it's planned and thought through.
Even if this doesn't make anything more clear in your head, it will help you along the writing, because it's easy to get lost, at times. It will also make your text more presentable, and of higher quality.

, When you are done writing your text, read it again. Notice any formal rules, as grammar and punctuation, and notice if anything can be made better. If it can, go back and rewrite the section that can be improved. This will make your text seem more put together.

Set up an area where you can display your harvest items.,
Sweep and remove any debris away from the area you intend to use.,
Set up a feeder where you can have all purpose birdseed (including sunflower seeds and cracked corn).,
Not forgetting our squirrel and chipmunk friends, use a low hanging or even ground feeder and set out birdseed there also.,
To make sure your local wildlife has enough to drink, set out a bird bath and fill it with fresh clean water.,

Enjoy all the wildlife that comes to your backyard.",How to Feed Wildlife in the Autumn," It should be in an area accessible to wildlife but also away from your indoor pets. Your backyard or apartment patio are good starting places. Keep in mind most wild animals may come out during the night.;
, Make sure there are no nails, tacks, or other things an animal (or you) could be injured on.

, Use a hanging feeder so that more birds than squirrels benefit from the food.

, Keep it at the opposite end from the bird feeder to avoid interaction or confusion.

, Be sure to change the water as often as needed to keep it fresh and clean. Birds and ground animals will greatly appreciate this addition to the garden.

, Either is fine, although hay is generally a food source whereas straw is used for bedding. Nonetheless, it will make an attractive harvest display and your animal friends will use it for food or nesting material (or perhaps both, depending on the animal)!

, Provided there is still corn attached, animals will use the corn for food and may use some parts of the plant for bedding (or they may also eat parts of the plant). Word of mouth gets out about corn very quickly, so expect lots of squirrels and raccoons to visit!

, Raccoons may help themselves to small squashes and baby pumpkins as a food source. If you decide to carve one of your pumpkins for Halloween, save the seeds and give them to the animals-they will find it a wonderful treat!

, They will thank you for feeding them right before winter!


Keep your camera ready! You never know when wildlife is going to visit, and when they see the plentiful bounty you've left them, they can get pretty excited!

Provide appropriate nutritious food and fluids.,
Check the waterproofing.",How to Clean Oil off Birds," Cleaning oil-contaminated birds carries health and safety training.


Get proper training as a volunteer from the rescue organization that you have joined. Washing and cleaning birds can kill them, so you must know how to wash them in a way that minimizes the chances of stressing them excessively. ;
, Oil contaminated birds will appear blackened, sticky, and they will be trying to remove the oil by preening, if they have energy left.


Oil contaminated birds will preen constantly to the point of forgetting to drink and eat.As a result, oil affected birds will appear dehydrated and emaciated., Oil is as toxic to you as it is to the birds. As well, the birds will be very stressed. Only persons with specific training in handling both hazardous materials and wildlife handling should collect oil-contaminated birds for taking to the care and washing facilities., Oiled birds are very stressed already, without having human handlers coming into the equation.


Distressed birds require calming before washing. This treatment and intensive care should be provided by a qualified veterinarian over a minimum 48 hour period.

, Once the veterinary team has determined that the bird is capable of withstanding the washing process (the bird has been stabilized, has had medical treatments, shows proper weight gain, has excellent blood values, and is behaving normally), the preparation for washing can commence.


Dress appropriately. You will get very wet, you may be inadvertently injured by a panicking bird, and you need to avoid contaminating the bird or yourself. To protect both yourself and the bird, therefore, wear long rubber/latex gloves, a suitable apron or gown, and waterproof boots. Long waterproof sleeve pull-ons are ideal to protect your arms. If you have long hair, pull it back and tie it in place. Wear a waterproof cap to protect head and hair if wished. Expect to get wet!
Work as a pair (at a minimum). Throughout the process, keep monitoring the bird for signs of stress. If the bird appears overly stressed or exhausted, the vet overseeing the wash will probably require the washing to cease.
Use a gentle dishwashing liquid. Add 1%of dishwashing solution to warm water in a suitably sized tub. The warmth should equate to the bird's internal body temperature., One person should be responsible for this, and for gently holding the bird in place.

, This is the job of the second person in the pair.


Use a Waterpik® dental water jetor a spray bottle filled with the dishwashing/water solution to clean the head.
Use a very soft toothbrush and cotton swabs to gently work away dried oil from around the eye and head areas.

, Be aware that you might need to shift the bird as many as 10–15 times, so a third person might be needed to be continuously scrubbing and refilling tubs if you don't have enough available. The washing process needs to be completed in one go, to minimize the stress to the bird.


The bird is considered clean once the water in the tub stays clean.

, Detergent has its own drawbacks on a bird's feathers (removing the waterproofing ability), so all of it needs to be removed. A professional cleaning operation will have spa nozzles on hand to remove all traces of detergent. This part is usually left to specially trained rinsers, so if you wish to do this, you will need additional training with highly trained specialists.

,


Place the bird in a net-bottomed pen.
Use a pet grooming dryer only. Personal hair dryers are too hot for aquatic birds and can burn their skin.
Expect the bird to start preening. This preening will do most of the job of rearranging the feathers into their correct waterproofing alignment.

, Keep monitoring the bird's recovery process.


The vet/medical team or a qualified volunteer will often tube feed the bird after a wash. Again, if you wish to do this, you will need appropriate training, as well as knowledge of the right food, vitamins, and medications that the bird should receive.

, This is done by placing the bird into a warm therapy pool.


Watch for signs of preening.
Watch its ability to swim and float.
Watch for alertness and dexterity.
Check for wet spots under the feathers over the next few days; these indicate the need for further cleaning and drying.

Educate yourself on common alligator behaviors.",How to Avoid an Alligator Attack1," It may seem obvious, but the easiest way to avoid an alligator attack is to avoid these territorial predators. Alligators will often stand their ground when on land. They don’t flee like other animals, so as soon as you see an alligator, move away from them. Alligators are unlikely to attack unless you get too close to their nest or corner them, so leave at least 15 feet between you and the alligator. If it shows aggression, move further away or find a safe place in a house or car. Alligators are very adept climbers, so getting to higher ground may make it easier for you to watch the alligator, but it does not mean they won’t be able to reach you., Warning signs of aggression include hissing, opening the mouth, and moving their heads or bodies towards you. Move away from these alligators immediately. Another less obvious sign of aggression is not retreating into the water as you approach. If an alligator is partially in water, they will typically move back into the water where they feel more comfortable when humans approach. If they don’t do this, they may have a nest near by, see you as a food source, or perceive you as a threat.


Alligators are surprisingly fast. If they don’t move away from you or they otherwise show aggression, be proactive and get to a safe place as quickly as possible., Alligators tend to get hungry and active between dusk and dawn. Alligators are ""opportunistic feeders."" This means they eat anything in sight, including other alligators. Your best safety measure is to always be aware of your surroundings when alligators could be present, but this is most important at nighttime, when alligators are hunting. Do not go into water where alligators are known to habitat during the night, especially if you’re alone.


Most alligator attacks happen when people are in the water and are unable to see clearly or are not alert to their surroundings. Never swim when alligators are hunting, and always swim in pairs. This way, one person can keep watch for alligator activity., This can cause an alligator to lose its fear of people, which means that the next snack you feed the gator might be yourself. Feeding alligators also endangers unsuspecting people who may get attacked by an alligator who associates people with food. Feeding an alligator is against the law, and it could lead to a fine or even jail time. Additionally, it is a death sentence for the animal. Officials will need to ""harvest"" an un-intimidated alligator immediately.


Feeding alligators makes them harder to find because sated gators, those no longer in need of food, are able to dedicate more of their energy to finding adequate habitation and coverage.
You should also avoid throwing scraps into the water. You may not be intentionally feeding alligators, but if they learn that there will be food in a specific spot, they’ll begin to spend more time there., People often get injured attempting to move alligators out of the road. This is never a good idea. Leading the alligator with food, honking, or throwing objects at the alligator is just as likely to trigger an attack as it is to achieve a cleared road. Drive around the alligator whenever possible, or wait the alligator out., You may not realize right away that you’re looking at an alligator nest, but if you see large piles of sticks and grass along the waterline with eggs or small alligators, four feet or shorter, it’s likely the mother is nearby. Approaching, touching, or otherwise tampering with an alligator nest is one of the easiest ways to trigger an attack., These deadly predators were not intended to be domesticated. While they’re beautiful and majestic creatures, they are unlikely to be tamed despite the best training efforts. Even if a so called domesticated alligator never harms its owner, they are much more likely to harm other humans, since they have developed the expectation that humans will bring them food. It is also important to remember that it’s illegal to keep alligators as pets., They are more likely to attack if they feel threatened. Because they are territorial, alligators feel threatened when trapped where they don’t feel they can defend their habitat or their young. If you inadvertently corner a gator, move away quickly., The greater your understanding of typical alligator habits, the more likely you are to notice when something is wrong. Male alligators prefer open waters such as canals and ponds while female alligators dwell in marshy areas to protect their young. If you see alligators outside of these areas, something may be amiss.


The majority of alligator attacks occur during breeding season, which is typically between March and July. During this time, they are out more often, and the males especially are more aggressive. Females who are nesting will also show increased aggression.
Alligators are territorial. They attack other alligators who invade their territory, and they will not hesitate to display aggressive behaviors towards people who enter their territory at any time of the year.Alligators are nocturnal, so if you see one out in the open during the day, they are likely lost, scared, and confused. Get away from them quickly, and contact wildlife agencies like the Department of Natural Resources or Wildlife Department to alert them of the alligator’s presence."
"
Fence your property.,
Map out areas where alligators are often sighted.,
Let others know if there’s an alligator in the area.,
Swim in designated areas only.,
Walk or jog away from the water's edge.",How to Avoid an Alligator Attack2," This might not keep an alligator out, but it will slow them down and keep kids and pets in. If you live in an area that alligators commonly inhabit, especially if there’s a water source on your property, fencing is a great way to keep your home safe from alligators. Additionally, fences tend to deter other alligator food sources like deer and wild hogs that may live in the area, making your property much less appealing to alligators., If you share outdoor space with alligators, it’s important to keep track of where they are most often spotted. You can use a city or county map to mark places where you frequently see them, or ask your local Department of Natural Resources or Wildlife Department for information about the local areas where alligators are nesting or hunting.


You will mostly find alligators in fresh inland waters, but a small percentage can be found in salt water, too.
Alligators prefer murky water, water with growing vegetation, and marshy areas., If you have a neighborhood watch or homeowner’s association, contact whoever runs the organization to alert those who live in the area. If you spotted the alligator in a park, notify whatever community or governmental agency maintains the grounds. If you’re unsure who to contact, call the police or animal services department., If you can't resist swimming in local canals or ponds where alligators are frequently found, do not enter the water or be anywhere near it between dusk and dawn, and never swim in undesignated areas. Also, avoid swimming in obstructed water, dark or brackish water, or water with growing vegetation, as you are less likely to spot alligators in these areas. Additionally, it’s a good idea to swim in pairs, and have one person looking out for alligator activity at all times., If you see signs that say there are alligators in a certain lake, river, or pond be very careful when walking there. While most alligator filled lakes are fenced, not all of them are. Take special care to keep children and dogs at a very safe distance as they are the perfect meal-sized portion for a hungry alligator. Always stay at least ten feet from the water. Preferably, run only on designated paths. Never run at nighttime near bodies of water that may be inhabited by alligators."
"
Run directly away from an alligator.,
Poke them in the eye.,
Thrash around.,
Make a lot of noise.,
Seek treatment immediately.",How to Avoid an Alligator Attack3," If you find yourself in a situation where you need to get away from an aggressive alligator or you’re being chased by an alligator, run away from it at a 45-degree angle. This way, the alligator would have to make a conscious decision to move its thousand-pound body in another direction, which is no easy task, in order to continue chasing you.


It is commonly believed that you should run in a zig-zag motion to escape the alligator’s field of vision. This tactic allows the alligator to keep you in view, if only intermittently, and continue the hunt., If an alligator clamps down on you, a loved one, or a pet, you may be able to make them release their clutch by poking them in the eye. This should only be done if there’s no way to avoid the attack. In most cases, alligators who have clamped down will not release their prey, but this tactic has been shown to be effective., Alligators prefer small, easy to manage food sources, so lots of movement will discourage them from continuing their efforts. Swing your limbs, wriggle your body, and keep moving until they move on. The harder you fight the less interested the alligator will become., Like the thrashing movements, loud sounds also discourage alligators from continuing their attacks. Noises may attract other alligators who will compete for their meal, so alligators will likely seek a less noisy food source. Additionally, this will likely attract the attention of others who can help you or call for assistance from others., If an alligator injures you, always seek treatment from a professional. Even if you don’t think the injury was severe, a serious infection can develop if alligator bites are left untreated. In most cases, you’ll need to complete a course of antibiotics, and you will likely need stitches."

Get the book reviewed.",How to Self‐Publish Children's Books," Perhaps the most popular and accessible option for self-publishing a children’s book is an online printing service. These services, such as Book Baby, Art bookbindery, and Blurb, offer full publishing services, from page layout to cover design to printed proofs, promotional posters for the book, and shipping options for the final product. They often offer basic publishing services for a very low rate and are a good, easy option for self-publishing.You may get a price quote for your book from several of these sites and compare them to find the right one for you.
Options like page layout and cover design are often offered at extra charge through these services.;
, If you do not want hard copies of the book, use an online-only publishing service. Online book sellers like Amazon offer an online only publishing option for self-publishers, where the book is sold as an ebook. You pay Amazon a fee to sell your book online for you. When a book is sold, you receive a set amount of the sale.Online only publishing services are a good option if you do not want to distribute hard copies of the book or have to worry about printing a physical book.

, If you’d rather put the book up for sale online and have it printed by order only, try a print-on-demand service. Amazon offers a print-on-demand option on their site where you can upload your book through a third party publisher and sell it through the site. It will then be printed on demand based on consumer orders.This is a good option if you do not want to have to pay for the publishing fees yourself up front to get a whole bunch of the books printed. Every time a book is sold through a print-on-demand service, you will receive royalties on the sale.

, Before you publish your children’s book, think about how many copies you want to print, or the print run. If you are planning to distribute the book to friends and family only, you may do a low print run to start with. If you want to distribute the book to bookstores in your area, you may do a larger print run.For example, a print run of 50 books for family and friends may be enough to start with. A print run of 100 books may be ideal if you want to distribute the books to bookstores.

, You may decide to do a certain amount of softcover books and a few hardcover books to start with, or only a certain number of hardcover copies. Hardcover books will be more expensive to print than softcover books so keep this in mind when you decide.For example, you may decide to get 10 hardcover copies printed to give to friends and family as gifts. Then, you may get 50 softcover copies printed to give to schools or bookstores in your area.

, Another key publishing detail is whether the book has color or no color illustrations. Color illustrations will be more expensive than black and white illustrations. However, you may opt for color illustrations if you plan to give the book to friends and family as a gift or if you want to promote the book to bookstores.Color illustrations will have more of a visual impact than no color, especially as most children’s books have vibrant, bright illustrations.

, You can choose from a variety of sizes for the book. The most popular sizes for children’s books are square (10” x 10”), landscape (11” x 8.5”), and portrait (8.5” x 11”). The size you select may be based on the format of the book as well as the size of the illustrations and the text.You may get sample books printed through an online printing service in different sizes to find the right one for the book.

, There are several options for the binding of the children’s book, including spiral binding, perfect binding, and casebound binding. Choose the right binding for the book so it appears exactly how you want it.You may go for perfect binding or spiral binding if you are getting softcover books, as this will allow the pages to lay flat. Casebound binding is often used for hardcover books.

, Once you have determined the design and print run for the book, order it through an online printing service. Select your shipping options through the service. When you get the books in the mail, look through them to ensure they are exactly as you ordered.


Only do this if you want to have hard copies of the book on hand. If you are using a print-on-demand service or an online only publishing service, you do not need to order the books.

, To get the book in the hands of more readers, promote it using online tools like social media. Create a website for the book or social media accounts on Instagram and Facebook. Follow leading authors in the children’s book industry and post updates about your book on social media accounts. Connect to your readership by following other popular children’s book titles and characters on social media.If you do create a website for the children’s book, you may set up a blog where you post daily or weekly updates. You may include any book promotions or book related events you are doing in the community to attract more readers.

, To promote the book to young readers, consider setting up readings at schools in your area. Look for reading days at your local library and other events in the community where you can promote the book to young readers.As an author, you will need to be comfortable doing presentations in front of a group of readers to promote the book. Often, these presentations involve reading from the book and answering questions from the audience.

, Another way you can get a self-published book on the radar of young readers is to get it reviewed in publications. Try sending copies of your book to publications like Publisher’s Weekly, School Library Journal, and Audiofile Magazine. They may decide to review your book if they think it is good.You may have a difficult time getting your book reviewed if it is self-published, as publications may prefer books published by a big publisher. Having a strong online following and presence can help persuade a publication to review your self-published book, as they know readers will be interested in the review.

Submit your work to literary magazines.,
Collect your works.,
Submit your work to the Academy of American Poets.",How to Publish a Poem1," By reaching out to magazines and literary journals, you are also reaching out to editors, agents, and other poets. You may be rejected at first—it's almost a rite of passage for creative types—but if you continue to send out good poetry, they will get to know you, and you will start to see your work published.


Finding the right match for you will help you get published. Remember, most editors are swamped with submissions, so if you give them what they're looking for, you'll have the advantage over everyone else.
Refer to Sources and Citations, below, for a link to Rutgers University and a list of poetry publishers.;
, Build a manuscript as you are sending out your poetry, and when you've written a substantial number of poems, and have been published in various periodicals, approach small presses and university publishers.

, Each year, they recognize poets who are publishing their first book.


Look to newspapers, magazines, civic organizations and other national contest organizations, as well. They often list poetry writing contests with various awards for best submissions.
Placing your work with these sources will gain you a valuable recognition.

"
Find a reputable self-publishing company.",How to Publish a Poem2," One way to avoid or get off the submission-and-rejection merry-go-round is to publish your poetry yourself. Print on demand (POD) printing companies such as Lulu and Blurb are good for small quantities of books, and for samples or one-off books. The price is normally somewhat high and is not ideal for large runs. Many are based online. Some offer ISBN numbers for an extra price, and some can also be linked to sites like Amazon. Often times, POD printers create side operations that run as subsidy or vanity publishers.

Go with self-publishing.,
Go with a traditional publisher.",How to Publish eBooks1," If you want to maximize your cut of sales, maintain absolute creative control, or participate in non-traditional copyright structures, self-publishing an eBook might be right for you.


This route is much more difficult than it sounds. It will require you to do all of your own marketing and editing, as well as deal with sellers. Though it will allow you more control, it is significantly more work.
Creative Commons licenses are useful for those planning on self-publishing. This will give you a template for the legalese to protect your work, as well as providing the freedom to decide how tightly you wish to control the work.;
, You may not want to deal with publishing your eBook on your own. You may not have time to devote to marketing, design, editing, or the formatting of an eBook. There is nothing wrong with this. If self-publishing sounds too complicated, you can find a traditional publisher to produce and sell your eBook.


Keep in mind that a traditional publisher will take a larger cut from your book sales and will often exert a certain level of control over the content and copyright.
Publishers will often be reluctant to take new authors. If you want to, get an agent who will help find a publisher for you and advocate for the quality of your work. An agent will also help you negotiate a good contract.

Consider publishing print and audiobooks on Amazon to accompany your ebook.",How to Publish on Kindle," Whether you plan to exclusively publish on Kindle or you are creating an e-book version of a book that you’ve published in a physical form, you’ll need to make sure that your content is pristine. Many writers encourage you to write a “vomit” draft or a rough outline with ideas thrown here and there. Then start writing. After you have a review draft, start to focus on structure and grammar. Have friends and family members look at your text to help perfect it., Think strategically. Think about the Kindle platform and gear your writing to it. What aspects of the Amazon page convince users to click the purchase button? Potential buyers have the ability to peruse its opening pages. This is just like going to a book store and reading the back cover and flipping through quickly. When you are writing your text make sure that the first couple of pages are really engaging. Have something scandalous occur immediately. Make sure that your prose is impressive. Whatever you want the reader to take away from your text needs to be fore-fronted., Figure out what your genre is and then look at the best-sellers in that genre. Figure out what their formula for success is. How long are they? How many chapters normally are included? How do they open their story? Is their book a part of a series? Many mystery novels on Kindle come in series. Consider turning your single, stand-alone mystery into a series. Some people like to invest in long series. There is a sense of accomplishment in it and if you have 20 novels in a series, someone will purchase them all., Your title page should be centered. Write the title of your book and then your name or pen name. Nothing else should go on this page., You want to protect your work and by including a copyright page in your Kindle ebook, you’ll effectively be copywriting your ideas. Here is a boilerplate statement you can use:

“All rights reserved. No part of this book may be reproduced in any form or by any electronic or mechanical means, including information storage and retrieval systems, without written permission from the author, except in the case of a reviewer, who may quote brief passages embodied in critical articles or in a review. Trademarked names appear throughout this book. Rather than use a trademark symbol with every occurrence of a trademarked name, names are used in an editorial fashion, with no intention of infringement of the respective owner’s trademark. The information in this book is distributed on an “as is” basis, without warranty. Although every precaution has been taken in the preparation of this work, neither the author nor the publisher shall have any liability to any person or entity with respect to any loss or damage caused or alleged to be caused directly or indirectly by the information contained in this book.”If your work is fictional, include this statement also: “This is a work of fiction. Names, characters, places, and incidents either are the product of the author’s imagination or are used fictitiously, and any resemblance to actual persons, living or dead, events, or locales is entirely coincidental.”, Page numbers are not important on Kindle publications because your writing will scale differently depending on what its read on and the text size the reader chooses. Make sure that your chapter names are informative. It will give your reader a sense of how your work is structured., Why not include a dedication, a preface, or a prologue? Your dedication is the place to thank that person or people that made this work possible. This is also one of the first things that your reader will see, so carefully craft the statement. A preface introduces your reader to your work in addition to or in place of a formal introduction. It tells the reader what your goals are for the book. A prologue sets up a story line, gives the necessary background. Some Kindle publishers use prologues to recap what happened in the previous novel of a series. It is kind of like the “previously on “insert television show name” line on TV shows., Depending on your content, images may be desirable, but think about how they’ll show up on Kindles. Some Kindle readers will either convert your image to a gray scale (16 shades to be specific) file or won’t show them at all.If you use photographs, make sure that you have the rights to them. If you took the picture, then you should be ok. If you created the image in any way, you should be ok. Do NOT take images off the internet. Even if alter other’s images and present them as your own, you could be sued for intellectual theft or copyright infringement.

If you purchase an image from a stock image repository online, make sure that you purchase the rights to resell the image. Most of the time, websites, like bigstockphoto.com (one of the largest online stores of stock photos), will let you purchase images on an extended license. Since you’ll be selling your ebook, you’ll need to purchase the extended license., You might think that your text will speak for itself, but without a suitable cover, people won’t purchase it. There is no universal guide to cover creation. Again, look at other successful Kindle ebooks in your genre to inspire your cover page. And then try to capture the spirit of your book in the cover. Use images that reflect its content. Have a hunky hero with a damsel in succumbing to his wiles for romance novels. Have a lurking shadowy figure for horror/suspense thrillers. Use ethereal images for a novel about ghosts. If you’re writing a how-to guide, use a picture of someone doing what you are writing about. For example, a book on how to build a treehouse might have someone building a treehouse on its front cover. Think about the person that is going to buy the book. What might catch their eye?

If you don’t want to pay to have a cover made professionally, Amazon has a cover creator program that is free. You simply upload an image, insert text, and then watch it work its magic. You can choose from a variety of layouts, fonts, colors.If you have a small budget for a cover, check out 99 Designs or Crowdspring. These are affordable crowd-sourcing services. Just make sure that the cover you purchase is a JPEG file and at least 25000 pixels on the longest side with a height/width ratio of 1.6., This can include bibliographies, appendices, notes, or glossaries. There is no specific order here to follow, so use your best judgment. Many people also include a note about the author in their back author. Write up a paragraph long blurb about yourself. Where do you live? Are you a full-time writer? Is there an interesting experience that you want your readership to know about you? Some people even include email addresses where fan mail or hate mail can be sent to., Amazon accepts Word, ePub, plain text, Mobipocket, HTML, PDF, and rich text format. Amazon encourages its authors to upload their documents in .doc or .docx files. The formatting software that Kindle uses to transfer and prepare files for e-publication easily works with Word., Stick with Arial or Times New Roman style fonts. If you get too crazy, Kindle will either revert your font style to one of these or won’t be able to read it. If you have bolded, italicized, or underlined text, this WILL transfer to Kindle., Use a justified alignment in your Word file. Many ebooks don’t indent their paragraphs, they just use a space between each paragraph. If you decide to indent, don’t use tab spacing. This will not convert to the Kindle. Instead, use the Word-default paragraph formatting to indent paragraphs. There are two ways to do this:

Click on “Page Layout”, and specify how far you’d like to “indent” your new paragraphs.
Or use the ruler at the top of the page to change the indentation. If you don’t see a ruler, click on the “View” tab and click on the ruler option., Use 'insert picture' in MS Word rather than 'cut and paste'. Use JPEG or GIF images and take steps to properly compress images. Kindle book format supports JPEG and GIF interior image files up to 5MB., At the end of every section, or chapter, insert a page break. To insert a page break in MS word, click “Insert” at the top menu bar and select “Page Break”. This will stop your text from running together., This is not mandatory, but is preferable. Since page numbers don’t work in ebooks, you’ll need to make your ToC “active”. This means that the reader should be able to click on the individual listings in your ToC and be taken to that section.

In Word, go to a separate page and title it “Table of Contents”. You can then use Microsoft Word's hyperlink function to build your ToC manually. The hyperlink function can link to any text formatted with a heading style or any location in your book you've marked using the bookmark function., You’ll need to create a separate username and password for this service even if you have a regular Amazon account.

, Why do you need to do this? All income you make through royalties/sales of your text have to be reported to the government. At the end of each fiscal year, Amazon will give you a W-2 that you’ll have to report. You’ll then need to pay taxes on this income., This should be located on the page after you sign in. Your Bookshelf is where all of your books will be located in the future. It is where you’ll go to make any changes that you need to. If you want to edit the text or change the price, you’ll do it from the Bookshelf., Include the book title, a description/synopsis of your book, and keywords to help people find your book.Pay close attention to your synopsis. This should be one or two paragraphs. It should accurately summarize the contents of your text and engage your reader. Use active language. Look at other successful books in your genre on Kindle to get an idea of what works.Think carefully about your keywords. These will be the search terms that people use when they are perusing the Kindle book store. Don’t just include words that are in your title, because your title is also included in Amazon’s Kindle search engine. Use keywords to describe your setting, character types, plot themes, and story tone. For example, if you’ve written a romance novel set in Paris and your title is ‘’Love Under the Eiffel Tower’’ use phrases like “strong male lead”, “romance”, “romantic rendez-vous”, “travel”, and “Paris”., It only takes 5 minutes to publish your book on Kindle. In 24-48 hours, you’ll work will appear online in Kindle stores world-wide., You want to make sure your work is protected everywhere Kindle ebooks are sold, so make sure to select this option. It doesn’t cost anything., You can select to receive either a 35% or a 70% royalty rate. The only reason to choose 35% is if your file is gigantic. Amazon charges you $0.15 per MB of your file if you choose a 70% royalty rate. The rate varies depending on where you live in the world, but is comparable. Most likely, you’ll make more money by choosing the 70% royalty rate., Most e-books on Kindle are somewhere between $2.99 and $9.99. Look at the price points of books in your genre of similar length. Most e-books that go under $2.99 don’t make very much money in the long run.Some seasoned Kindle authors, who have several books under their belts, will give away their books for free on Kindle in the hopes of attracting new readers. Think about it. If you were reluctant to fork over your $2.99 for a book by an unknown author, you might crack the digital spine of an e-book if it were free., Amazon will email you when your book appears on their website., Have family members and friends read your book. Give it to them for free in exchange for a review online. Reviews are one of the strongest ways to get prospective buyers to click that review button. Have them give their honest reactions on Amazon. They’ll be able to give your work a rating too (1 to 5 stars). Hopefully, they’ll give you good ratings.Visit Storycartel.com. This is a platform authors can use to get free, ethical reviews of their work. Don’t be frightened by the name. This isn’t your Columbian, drug-lord kind of service. You simply create a free account, upload your text, fill out the necessary information, and wait for the reviews to come in. You can also sign up and read other’s works in exchange for reviews.thekindlebookreview.net is a similar service.

You’re an author now too., Only consider advertising on Facebook, if your are really serious about selling your ebook. The average ad on Facebook costs $0.50 per click. This can get expensive quick and you won’t be able to recoup the costs if you are only charging the bare minimum for your book. Now that this disclaimer is out there, Facebook ads can be incredibly effective. You can identify the demographic you are interested in reaching. Facebook will then line the feeds of those people that fall in your demographic., Barnes & Noble has its Nook reader. You can publish on their online site for free too.Publish for free on Apple’s iBooks Store.Try Google Play for free too.To reach independent literary communities, try smashwords.com too. Many of these websites will ask you to link to a personal website of some sort. Rather than set up author pages elsewhere, many will simply link back to Amazon’s Kindle store to share their reviews there., Amazon allows you to publish many types of books on their website. Amazon offers what is called the ""matchbook"" program. It's a service where you can buy the print edition of the book, and get the Kindle version for a lower cost. It's great for completing the customer's library and enhancing their user experience. It's great way to gain more exposure and maximize the profits from your new book."

Edit your book.,
Have someone proof it.,
Hire an editor.,
Use an eBook aggregator.,
Decide your device.,
Decide your distributor.",How to Publish eBooks2," Editing is one of the most important aspects of publishing your book. A poorly edited book will not attract readers, reviewers, or potential publishers. Editing gives your eBook a professional appearance and makes it more pleasant to read.


Fix all grammar and spelling issues. Too many grammar and spelling problems can render a text unreadable. Use a word processor like Microsoft Word or Google Docs to find spelling and basic grammar mistakes. The programs are not, however, a replacement for human eyes. They can only detect spelling errors for words that do not exist. If you have simply typed the wrong their/there/they’re, the computer will probably not catch it. Grammar errors are much the same.
Read it. Read the book yourself, all the way though. This will help you catch grammar and spelling mistakes but it can also give you a better sense of how the book fits together as a whole. Look for scenes which don’t work next to each other, characters who seem to change personality from one chapter to the next, or major changes in writing style. Since authors usually write their books over long periods of time and rarely write them straight through, it can lead to pieces of story that don’t fit next to each other.
Read it aloud. Once you have read the text all the way through, one of the best editing methods is to read the text aloud. This will keep your brain from auto-correcting missing words, incorrect words, grammar and spelling errors. It can also alert you to unnatural-sounding dialogue.

, Have a fellow writer read it through, from beginning to end. They will be able to look at it from a writer’s standpoint, looking for weaknesses in structure, characterization, and word choice. This works best if it is a neutral party, but an objective friend can work just as well.


Have someone read it that normally reads books in the same genre. Only someone who reads similar books will really be able to appreciate your book. They will help you determine if you have written it in such a way that it reaches its intended audience and connects with them.

, If you don’t have the ability or the resources to edit the book yourself, you can hire an editor. There are a large number of freelance editors. Choose one who is reputable and reliable. If you are trying to do this cheaply, you can contact the English department at your local university and advertise for an editor. Students in the subject will be attempting to build a resume and will appreciate the opportunity and the money but their quality of work may not be as high.

, If you don’t want to deal with editing or publishing an eBook, you can use an eBook aggregator service, which will do these things for you. Beware, however. This will not only be expensive but there is also a great deal of opportunity for you and your work to be taken advantage of. Use reputable services and don’t sign on to anything that makes you uncomfortable.

, Before you begin formatting your eBook, you will need to decide which device or devices you want it to be available on. You can make it available on all ereaders to maximize your audience or you can have it only available on one and take advantage of programs offered by companies like Amazon when you make your book exclusive.

, Once you have decided the device or devices, you will need to decide your distributor. Where do you want your eBook sold? You can make it available on websites like Barnes and Noble, Amazon, or Google Play. You can also have it on lesser known eBook distributors or on its own website entirely.If you sell the book on it’s own website, you will gain a larger cut of the profits but miss out on a larger audience and marketing tools.
Again, certain distributors offer incentives to keep your book exclusive to their service. Investigate these programs to help you make your decision.
Kindle Direct Publishing: this is Amazon’s distribution service.
Smashwords: this service publishes to most major booksellers, with the exception of Kindle.
Nook Press: this is Barnes and Noble’s distribution service.
Lulu: this service is notable for distributing eBooks to the Apple store, an otherwise complicated process.

Understand how ereaders work.,
Learn and use HTML.,
Know your tags.,
Size your text.,
Create an HTML page.,
Format for EPUB and MOBI.,
Format from Word.",How to Publish eBooks3," It is important to understand how ereaders work and how text displays on the screen. In understanding what is expected, you will know how your own eBook should look when you are done with formatting.


To get an idea of what eBooks look like, get or borrow an ereader. Look at eBooks and notice how you can interact with them and change them.
It is important to know that there are no “pages” in eBooks like there are in traditional books. eBooks are designed so that the text is fluid, able to resize at any time. You cannot format the book with set pages or page numbers in mind.

, Ereaders work by converting the text of your book to HTML, the same technical language which is used to make web pages. HTML is, essentially, a formatting language. It tells a computer how text and images should appear, regardless of the device or screen size. You will need to learn basic HTML skills in order to format your eBook so that it displays correctly on all devices.Namely, you will need to know how to use tags (specific words placed in angle brackets) which correlate with the normal formatting found in word processors.


Tags almost always come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag. The opening tag will contain a word in a set of brackets and a closing tag will contain the same word but it will be preceded by a forward slash. Contained between the tags will be all of the text that you want to take on the type of formatting indicated by the tag. In other words, all text in a sentence that you want to be in italics will need to be sandwiched between italics tags.
Certain characters to not render well in HTML, especially if they are auto-formatted by programs like Word, and will need to be changed or directly encoded in order to display properly in your eBook. These characters include quotation marks, apostrophes, and ellipses. Use your text editor’s search function to manually replace these or replace them with HTML specific code. For example, to ensure that ellipses are always encoded properly (regardless of device) replace them with “&hellip”.

, There are a number of tags you will need to know in order to correctly format your text. There are, of course, an enormous number of HTML tags but here are some examples of the most relevant and basic for the purpose of creating eBooks:


<strong>text</strong> will create bold text.
<em>text</em> will create italicized text.
<p>text</p> will turn the text into a paragraph.
Another important HTML tag is the image tag, which works a little differently than the tags above. You will need to include the address of the image, the way a web address or file on your computer is listed. You will also need to add a basic description, such as “cover”, so that the publishing program will know what it is for. The image tag is formatted like this: <img src=“image address.jpg” alt=“description” />

, As discussed above, the size of text in an eBook is fluid. Readers can adjust the size, making it bigger or smaller, according to their needs and preference. This means that you cannot use normal “point” font sizes, like what is used in a word processor. Instead, you will use HTML and a relative sized system of measurement for text. The best unit of measurement to use is called “em”.


The size 1em will be the basic size. 2em will then be the next size up and so on. Labeling your text in this way will allow your text to change size relatively, so that when the reader changes the text size it will stay proportional and remain readable.
Indentations will also be sized in the same way. What that size is, however, is completely up to you.
These em’s can also be in half steps (example: 1.5, 2.5, etc.). Use the half steps if you cannot get the look you want using the normal sizes.

, Once you have done all of the text formatting, you will need to create an actual HTML file, with proper coding, to place the text in. This will need to be set up with all of the normal tags associated with a basic HTML page, such as <html>, <body>, etc. You can read about how to set up a basic HTML page here or you can use the included template.


Your HTML page will also need to include a style section. This will help format all of the text in your eBook and keep it looking consistent. You can read about this online or simply use and modify the included template.

, The easiest and cheapest software to use to create an eBook in these formats is Calibre. It is available for free. Be sure that you are downloading it from a reputable source, however.


Begin by opening the program. Click “Add Books” and then the HTML file that you have created.
Highlight your book in the list and press “Edit metadata”. This will allow you to change the author name (Author Sort - last name, first name format), product description/flap copy/synopsis (Comments), as well as add a cover image, ISBN number, publisher info, etc. Be sure to save all of this data by pressing ""OK"".
Now, select convert books. Select the format you would like it to be in from the drop-down menu. EPUB and MOBI will cover the largest number of ereaders.
Next you will want to format the Table of Contents. If you have followed the template included in this tutorial, this will be very simple. There are, of course, other ways to encode the Table of Contents as well. You can use whatever method is best for you. If you have followed the template, you will now go to the field labeled “Level 1 TOC” and input the following code: //h:pAfter the Table of Contents is formatted, go to “Epub Output”. In the left toolbar, look for ""Preserve Cover Aspect Ratio” and be sure that it is checked.
Click ""OK"", let the program work, and when it is done you can save your eBook file. Now you are done!

, There are a number of eBook publishing services that work from raw Word files. The most common is Smashwords. In order to properly format a Word document for epublishing, you will need to go back through the document as manually re-enter all of the automatic formatting (such as indents and capitalization). This will ensure that everything displays correctly once it has been converted to HTML.

Set a good price point.,
Promote your book.",How to Publish eBooks4," If an eBook is too expensive, you are unlikely to sell many copies. If it is too cheap, you will see only minimal profits. A good, middle-of-the-road price will probably be around $2.99. , Promoting your book is crucial to making profit. The internet is a big place and there are many authors taking advantage of the new ease with which books can be published. If you want to get noticed, you’re going to have to do an excellent job of promoting your book.


Make use of social media and blogs. Find popular blogs which cover books in your genre and give them a review copy. Spread word about your book release through websites like Facebook, Twitter, and Tumblr. Most importantly, interact with your customers and fans and encourage them to spread the word.
Advertise your book. You can advertise your book as well, either within the website you have chosen to sell it on or across the web. Use an advertising service or contact individual websites and blogs about advertising. Be sure that any website you advertise on is going to reach the right audience for you.

A book about astral projection & a book about Christian eschatology are going to be very different books, and some philosophy must connect all the concepts to prevent readers from asking what Tarot readings have to do with supporting Israel.;
,


Many talented and otherwise credible authors in the metaphysical field, such as Walsh, David Icke, and Alex Morrey have made grand, sweeping promises of truth & enlightenment that some readers find utopian or exclusivist. It's better to have a down-to-earth attitude about your own writings, while still respecting their spiritual nature.

,


Think about your own spiritual experiences and reflect on their nature and message. Did you have a near-death experience? A prophetic dream? Even a sudden ""lightbulb"" moment while perusing a book such as Descartes's Meditations or the Quran can lead to a sort of revelation. Heck,something you remember from camping in your backyard as a kid can be inspirational.

,


Once you realize what you've learned spiritually over your life and how you reached that point, explain it clearly & simply. Illustration and conversational language help, '""especially""' with solemn topics!

,


You've got past the theory, now it's time for the practice. How can someone help themselves by applying your teachings to their life? It's important to explain how your lessons can help in life, or else your book wouldn't be very pragmatic for readers.

,


No one can read your book if nobody gets it published. If you're the D.I.Y. type, you could publish it independently, but if not, there are many big publishers interested in spiritual literature.
Usually, they specialize in certain types of spiritual writing.
Llewelyn & Weiser are good for Neopagan books, whereas Zondervan & Pilgrim are focused on traditionalist Christian books, Deseret on Mormon literature, and Judaica for Jewish books. Secular publishers also usually accept spiritual books.

, Top resource books include Writers Market and the Jeff Herman Guide to Literary Agents. Plus, almost every literary agency hosts a website. Consult for the most up-to-date information.

,, Dozens of agents specialize in young adult paranormal fiction; don't pitch them if you've written a young adult book about a kid detective.

, A query letter is an agent's first look at you the writer. It needs to be dynamite. It should 1. Tell what you book is about in three compelling sentences; 2. State why you are querying that specific agent; and 3. Explain why you are the person to write this particular book. One page, max.

, Yes, you can query more than one agent at a time. Just be sure to personalize each query and only solicit one agent per literary house. Note: make sure your first chapter is dynamite. Some agents request a first chapter along with your query letter. This is your chance to impress. You need to make the most of it.

, Follow submission instructions closely. At this point it is perfectly acceptable to ask for a reading timeline. A reputable agent should respond to a manuscript within 2-3 months.

, If you do receive an offer of representation, the agent will want to know what else you're working on. Think of it as a long-term relationship.

, If you get it, be prepared with a list of questions. Commission structure? Foreign rights? Editing process? You want to know exactly what you're entering into.

, Remember, an agent needs to sell your book to a publishing house. This may take one week. Or one year. Or it may not happen at all. Be patient and professional in this process and let the agent do his/her job.

, The book The Help was rejected over two dozen times before it was eventually published. Look how that turned out. Literary agents are busy, in-demand folks. But they want to discover the next great novel. Keep after them.

Select a name based on what you know about your character. The name should help to build the identity of your character so that when you’re roleplaying other players might think, Yes. He looks like a “Boris.”;
, Select a name (as well as personality and backstory) specific to your roleplaying environment. Are you roleplaying at a convention? Are you roleplaying with friends? Are you roleplaying online?


Online, you’ll be typing the name so how your handle looks when spelled out is important.
In person, the name will be spoken so sound is important.

, A harsh-sounding name like Thor would be suitable for a tough, bold character. A funny, or bumbling character might be called Jethro. A graceful and elegant character might be called Grace. In each case the name works to show who your roleplaying character is.

, Famous names have associations—character traits you think of when you think of the name. If your character is honest and upright, Abe might be associated with Abe Lincoln. A dynamic (and slightly raunchy) female character might be called Madonna.

, Think about time period/place/status. A high class woman in Victorian London would not be named Haru Takahashi. A Japanese warlord would not be named James Walker.

, Choose a name that’s the direct opposite of your character’s profile. Ebenezer for a character that’s generous and spends lavishly would be an example. Grace for a klutzy character would also work.

, Don’t choose a name that can be turned into a nickname you don’t like. Don’t select a name that will rhyme with an unsavory word. You might end up with a nickname that’s works against your roleplaying intentions., Consider the time/place you are making for your character. A princess in a medieval setting won't be running around in men's clothing (unless, of course, she is a run away and this is important to her character!) Robocop would choose black over pink dress wear. He wouldn’t wear tights. Robin Hood, on the other hand, would.

, Slicked-back hair suggests a slick character. Messy hair, a laid-back and, perhaps, confused character. Hair that’s arranged unusually or dyed pink or blue might suggest a character who has a flair for being original or off-beat.

, Why does your vampire wear a chain around his neck? What’s up with the lightening scar on the forehead of your roleplaying Voldemort character? These accessories ask a question that begs an answer. They make your character interesting.

, The obvious choice, of course, is to select your own gender for the gender of your roleplaying character. But roleplaying is about breaking boundaries. Why not try selecting the opposite gender for your roleplaying character? You might find an avenue into creating an inspiring and original character.

, Leave your character room to grow so that the character will continue to interest you and even surprise you. Characters shouldn’t be predictable. They should be complicated, multi-dimensional, a bit mysterious.


If your mage is the best in his academy, maybe he is incredibly bad at hand to hand fighting.
Is your high school prom queen very pretty? Consider making her incredibly insecure, as well. No one is perfect. Make sure that your character is not.

, The more you know about your character’s backstory, the more solid the character will be. The more solid the character, the more generous the character will be in the personality he/she reveals to you and to others.


Where did your character come from?
What is your character’s age?
Does your character have a middle class background? Upper class?
Did your character’s father come from a poor family and work his way up?, Who are they? Where did they come from? What happened to them to make them who they are?


When you're forced to make a quick decision, this elevator pitch will quickly sum up the personality of your character so that you’ll know what to do.“I am Rollo from the planet Venus, forever mourning the loss of my magic ring.”

, Your roleplaying character shouldn’t only be strong and charismatic. He/she should be believable.


Is your character brave? Then perhaps your character could also be shy, afraid of social gatherings.
Is your character talkative? Then allow your character to be drawn to the works of Mozart to suggest some depth and underlying layers.

, Was your character raised in a tough environment and taught to take care of her/himself? Then perhaps your character believes in survival of the fittest. If so, then your character might be power-hungry, aggressive,the loudest roleplaying character in the crowd., Roleplaying can be a near-art form, creative and inspiring. Cut loose and enjoy yourself! Make dynamic choices for your character so that you'll be interested in the role and will play it convincingly.

, These can have an effect on their behavior.

, What kind of men does she like? What kind of people does she befriend most easily? What music does she like?

Or does she exhibit a mixture of both?

, Decide whether she feels glad or sad and think about how her temperament runs. Maybe she is hot-tempered, or maybe she is steady in her mood. Is she a daydreamer? Anti-social? Hyperactive?

Consider how the character fits into the rest of your story.",How to Write a Main Female Character," To get ideas for your main female character, you may draw on the women in your life. Think about female role models like your mother, your aunts, your siblings, a teacher, employer or your female friends. You may be inspired by the strength of the women in your life and use one of them or a combination of them for your character.For example, if you are trying to find a model for a main female character who is a teenager, you may talk to your mother about her life as a teenager or draw on your sibling’s experience of being a teenager.;
, If you are a woman, you may think about your own personal experiences. Think about how it feels to walk around in the world in your body and how your gender shapes your perspective. If you are not female, you may think about the women you have interacted with in the past or in the present. Consider how you can depict the women you know accurately on the page.If you are not a female, you may find it challenging to draw on the experiences of a gender that is not your own. Focus on how you view the women around you from your perspective and get inspiration for your character that way.

, Once you have an idea in mind for your main female character, you should write out a backstory for your character. Give the female character unique personality traits and quirks. She should have a list of hobbies, interests, and beliefs that make her a well rounded character. Create a backstory for her that is nuanced and engaging.

For example, perhaps your female character is interested in politics, though she is still in high school. She may aspire to be the first female president and focus on social justice issues in her community.
Or, perhaps you have a female character who is struggling with her identity and trying to fit into a friend group in college. You might also give her an interesting hobby like archery that involves mental and physical skill.

, You can also look at published writing that does a good job of representing women on the page. You may read writing by primarily female writers to get some inspiration or read great writing in general. For example, you may read:Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen

The Bluest Eye by Toni Morrison

The Color Purple by Alice Walker

The House on Mango Street by Sandra Cisneros

Mrs. Dalloway by Virginia Woolf

The Outlander Series by Diana Gabaldon

, One of the key ways to give your main female character depth is to give her agency. This means the character should be a key participant in the plot of the novel. She should exist for herself, not as a mirror or a victim to other characters, especially male characters. Give the character a full sense of self and allow her to exist in an active way in the story.For example, you may have a main female character who is in a relationship with a male character. Though she can have strong feelings for another character, her whole character should not be based on pleasing the main character or responding to the needs of any other character, whatever their gender. She may devote more time or equal time to her own interests as she does to her relationship with her partner or her children, if she has any.

, To make your main female character relatable, she should have flaws. Avoid the perfect image of a woman when writing, as this often objectifies the female character and makes them appear flat. Instead, be willing to give your character flaws or issues that she is grappling with in your narrative. This will often deepen the female character and make her feel more genuine.For example, maybe you have a female character who is physically strong. But her flaw is that she experiences panic attacks due to stress and has serious stage fright. This is a flaw that deepens her character and makes her more nuanced.

, When you are writing the female character, you should be aware of the cliches that exist about female characters in writing and work hard to avoid them. Describing a female character with physical traits like “pretty”, “petite”, “bosomy” or “hot”, can be cliche and often flattens your character so they are one dimensional on the page. Rather than resort to cliches, try to come up with nuanced ways of describing your female character.For example, you may describe your main female character by focusing on her actions rather than her physical attributes. You may talk about her in terms of her critical thinking, her ability to speak her mind, and her sense of humor, rather than focus on her body shape or appearance.

, Another way you can deepen your main female character is to have more than one female character in your story so they can interact and talk. Having more than one female character will also show readers that you are not tokenizing one female and are willing to include several female voices in your writing.One test that is used in the writing community to determine if the narrative is representing women properly is called the Bechdel Test. The Bechdel Test states that the narrative is successful if it features two female characters who are named, who talk to each other, and talk about something other than a man.

, Your main female character should be just as detailed and nuanced as the other main characters in your story. Regardless of gender, you should strive to create characters that will linger in the reader's mind and feel unique. Do not limit your main female character just because she is female. She should have all the qualities of a strong character and stand on her own in your story.

Look at your other main characters and consider if they are more developed than your main female character. Do they have more aspirations, goals, and wants than your main female character? Do they feel more unique and nuanced than your main female character? If the answer to these questions are ""yes,"" you may need to go back and rethink your main female character.

, Once you have finished crafting the main female character, you should allow women around you to critique the character. Solicit feedback from female family and friends. Be willing to accept constructive criticism and listen to what others have to say.Another option is to show the character to a writing group that has female members. Getting professional advice from female writers can help you avoid cliches and deepen your character.

, Write down all the feedback you get from others on the character and then apply the feedback to the character. Revise the character with attention to her agency, her personality traits, and how she is described in your writing.

You may try reading the main female character’s dialogue out loud to listen to how your character sounds. Your main female character should sound just as nuanced and detailed as any other character in your story.

, When you have a strong draft of your main female character, you should think about how the character fits into the rest of your story. You may place the main character within the plot outline for your novel and consider if she is an active part of the plot. You may have her interact with other characters in your novel and think about whether she is as nuanced and detailed as the other characters.Think about how your female character embodies some of the themes in your story. For example, if you set out to write a story about empowerment, you may think about whether your main female character feels empowered and strong in your story.

First, you must determine whether or not you are a character writer.,
A good way to get your story started is to start with the characters.,
Now, you may ask, how do you develop a character in such a way?,
Of course, these aren't the only methods.,
This is best if you use this for the most major characters.,
Soon, you may find your character giving input to your stories, especially in writer's block!",How to Write As a Character Writer," One sure sign is if you find yourself having writer's block because the characters simply won't go in the direction you please. Another sign is when you find yourself feeling as if the story is not your own, but your characters'. However, if you feel that you are a character writer, than you are. There are no set guidelines for what defines one or not.;
, Surely a premise can be helpful. But characters will determine what the story is really about. Let's take a fairytale, like Cinderella. The premise is that a girl is forced to work for her evil step family and meets a prince. But that's just the premise! What if Cinderella didn't like balls in the first place? Then, there you have it, you'd have a story about a girl who was GLAD not to be invited. It's all about character.

, Be warned - this is sometimes dangerous. Once a character gets defined to this extent, it may annoy you further! But, for the brave, continue on:


One method is a character ""interview"". Create a list of questions that you would generally ask - who is your family, what do you like to do, etc. And then, answer them from the point of view of your character!
Another method is a character chart. They can be made in many ways, from brainstorming maps to just jotting down notes. Either way, all you want to do is learn who your character is.
A useful method is what I like to call the ""Wanted Poster Method"". You make a list of information you would want for a wanted poster. Information included should be age, appearance, friends, hobbies, etc. This can also be used to help figure out the plot of your story, and the main conflict. After all, if we were to make a chart for Cinderella, the reason she is ""wanted"" could be that she snuck out of her house to go to a ball.

, Adjust them, modify them, make up your own! Just make sure it works for you.

, You don't need to profile every single person that come sin your story - but they should all have a personality and have a background, even if it's not developed.

, My advice is to compromise with them; sometimes characters can get difficult to work with. They become very much alive. If a character truly refuses to go in one direction, you may want to evaluate your plot. After all, would Cinderella really be the kind of person to openly defy her stepmother and yell? No, not in my opinion. So obviously, the story doesn't go that way.

Use a classical anti-hero.,
Use a Disney anti-hero.,
Create a pragmatic anti-hero.,
Make an unscrupulous hero.,
Make a nominal hero.,
Mix anti-hero types.,
Define your anti-hero’s flaw.,
Decide if your anti-hero is the protagonist.,
Create some limits for your anti-hero.,
Think about your audience.,
Explain your anti-hero’s backstory.,
Make sure your anti-hero is good at something useful.,
Give your anti-hero a noble purpose.,
Create a chance at redemption.",How to Make an Anti Hero," This is the most common type of anti-hero, a character who doesn’t share the positive characteristics of a hero. This character can be filled with self-doubt, a poor fighter, cowardly, or dumb, all in contrast to a typical hero who is confident, capable, brave, and intelligent. This anti-hero may spend the story overcoming his or her weaknesses to become more heroic, even if he or she just succumbs to them in the end.Frodo Baggins from “The Hobbit” is a good example, as he shows a lack of self-confidence and fighting ability, only to grow into a more heroic figure by the end of the story. Another example might be the title character from the novel “Don Quixote,” who is likely senile and suffers from delusions of grandeur as he attempts to live out the chivalric tradition.;
, These are anti-heroes with a heart of gold. The anti-hero will have some flaw or internal conflict that he or she must overcome in the story arc to become a regular hero by the end of the narrative, usually leading to a happier ending. The anti-hero probably knows the good or “heroic” way of doing things, but needs to be given a reason to do so.Though not a Disney creation, Shrek the Ogre fits this template as even though he is crude and cynical, he does end up doing the right thing for characters he cares about.

, These are characters who are willing to do what is necessary to accomplish their goals. The pragmatic anti-hero is darker than a Disney anti-hero, and not guaranteed to become a more regular hero. For this character, the end usually justifies the means, usually explained by saying “I did what I had to do,” or “whatever it takes.”Popular examples of this type are police or security officials willing to cross the line when necessary to solve the crime, such as Dirty Harry and Jack Bauer.

, This is similar to the Pragmatic Anti-Hero in that he or she has good intentions, but far fewer restrictions on their actions. The important thing is that whatever bad things you can say about what the anti-hero does, their enemies are always worse. These kinds of characters work best in darker settings, so this is probably better for works targeting a more mature audience.Captain Jack Sparrow from the “Pirates of the Caribbean” series is a good example, as he is willing to lie, cheat, and steal from other characters to ensure his own success, or survival, or both.

, These anti-heroes fight on the good side, but do so for bad reasons or intentions. The important part of the story is that he or she has a reason to dislike the villain, making the anti-hero a useful ally. These reasons are usually personal, and if the anti-hero is a side character, they may depart partway through the story once this desire is fulfilled.Eric Cartman from the show “South Park” can be a good example of this when he works with the other characters. While their intentions may be noble, Cartman is usually attached only for his own personal gain.

, You’ll notice that while there are many different types of anti-heroes, your anti-hero may fit into several categories at once. That is fine as these are meant to be guidelines that help explain both what type of person your anti-hero is, and where they fit into the storyline. Your anti-hero may fall mostly in one category, but also exhibit characteristics of another.

, A good anti-hero has something that makes him or her hard to put up as a great example to others. An anti-hero will not exhibit all the traits that society considers admirable, and will probably reject some of them explicitly. Anti-heroes can lie, cheat, steal, act cowardly, and even kill as part of accomplishing their goals. Your anti-hero doesn’t need to do all of these things, but must have some flaw that prevents him or her from being a true hero, at least when your story begins. Your anti-hero’s flaws will influence the role he or she plays in your story.Shakespeare’s Hamlet is a good example, as while he wants to avenge his father’s death, he is consumed with self-doubt and hesitation, which prevents him from acting throughout much of the play. Dr. Gregory House, though a brilliant physician, abuses drugs and mistreats his friends and co-workers throughout the series.

, A good anti-hero doesn’t necessarily need to be the main character, but instead a sidekick or helper to the main hero. If your anti-hero is the main character, their emotional arc, decision-making, and internal struggle will become a central feature of the story. A good anti-hero sidekick can add some color to your story, and help provide the moral choices your hero needs to accept in order to achieve the ultimate goal.Han Solo is a helpful sidekick to the main character, Luke Skywalker, during “Star Wars: A New Hope,” providing assistance throughout the story while complaining about getting his financial reward.

, One big difference between an anti-hero and a villain can be that the anti-hero has some limit to their bad actions, some things he or she just won’t do. This is important, as without limits, your audience won’t find the anti-hero sympathetic.Not hurting children or pets is a good one, or maybe your anti-hero writes a letter to their mother every week. Explaining this limit can be a good way to help flesh out your anti-hero’s backstory.The Godfather, Vito Corleone, orders others killed or threatened as part of his leadership of the crime family, but draws the line at selling drugs until he is forced to by the other families. He is also willing to use his influence to help friends and family members. Even his son Michael, the main character in the three movies, waits to have his brother Fredo killed until after their mother dies (so she doesn’t have to know about it).

, Consider who you expect to watch/read your story, and why your anti-hero would appeal to them. Look for things they consider to be negatives, flaws that would make your character an anti-hero, but also what limits they might expect an anti-hero not to cross. Remember that different audiences, including genders and age groups, will find different kinds of anti-heroes compelling.Many anti-heroes in modern television series are middle-aged, reflecting a large portion of the audience who watches those shows. While most people are not mobsters like Tony Soprano or womanizing ad men like Don Draper, they can recognize the fear of reaching that part of their lives, balancing work, family, and personal concerns, and struggling as the world changes around them., Make sure your audience knows why the anti-hero acts the way he or she does. By providing an explanation, your audience will be able to justify liking, or at least not hating, the anti-hero character.Maybe your anti-hero has a tragic past, something that makes them act the way they do. Giving your anti-hero a reason for their actions can generate sympathy from your audience, and forces them to think how they would respond in those circumstances. Severus Snape, for example, expressed a dislike of Harry Potter because the character’s father bullied him when they were in school.
If you want to add some drama to the story, you can make the anti-hero’s backstory a mystery, something for other characters to discover or reveal., Even if your anti-hero is a despicable character, he or she needs to have some skill that makes them useful to the story or otherwise gives them a reason to stick around. It will be easier for your audience to accept your anti-hero’s flaws as long as the character serves some purpose.The TV doctor House, for example, is difficult and unpleasant with other characters, and tries to solve medical mysteries not to help people, but satisfy his own ego. He is also excellent at solving those mysteries, meaning other characters put up with his flaws, and even want him around.

, If nothing else, there needs to be a good thing your anti-hero is working toward. As long as the end result is good, your audience will probably forgive a lot of otherwise negative actions.The main character is the series “Dexter” is a serial killer, but one who only targets other serial killers. Though his actions are brutal, he is doing them to rid the world of other dangerous people.

, Your anti-hero doesn’t need to become a full-fledged hero by the end of the story, but he or she should be presented with a chance to reject his or her flaws for something greater. An anti-hero choosing between good and evil is generally more believable. Your audience can better see the internal struggle such a decision will create for a flawed character rather than a more idealized hero.In Dostoevsky’s novel “Crime and Punishment,” the main character Raskolnikov eventually confesses to killing two people. He will gain redemption, but only after serving the psychological punishment of his own guilt, and spending time in prison.
As an anti-hero, your character can always believably reject the heroic choice and become a villain, which won’t seem terribly out of place, especially if they are an Unscrupulous or Nominal Hero."

Remember why they are so important in the first place.,
With your plot in mind and your main character handy, make a list of what types of people he may run into along the way.,
Flesh out your list a little.,
Now that you've fit personalities next to the types of people your main character will come across, write a brief idea of who this person is.,
Let your main character interact with your co-characters.",How to Write Dynamic Co Characters," You see, characters such as Goofy and Donald were created to make Mickey Mouse interesting. By himself, Mickey was okay, but Walt Disney wasn't going to leave him alone. Instead, he created a crazy cast of co-characters to play off of him. Then Micky was interesting; this is why we have co-characters. Now the pressure is off to make the most perfect main character.;
, Not in a geeky group of unlikely hero's sort of way, but every day interactions. Is it the barber? The handyman? Mom? Siblings? All of these ordinary types of people can add or take away from your main character in lots of fun or morbid ways. So go ahead and make a big list of who your main character could run across during the story.

, Writing sage's across the world will all say ""write what you know"" So, lets do just that. With your list handy put a name of someone you know next to a type. Be fair and list the best person for the job. Would your own Mom be a good fit for your main characters Mom? If not then put someone else, but make the fit as perfect as you can.

, Now your characters are not the people you know, but based on them.

, This way, you can find an interesting dynamic that wouldn't have been there before. You don't need these characters to be your main characters best friend, but to be there to make him or her look and feel more interesting to the reader.

Determine your character's ethnicity and appearance.,
Determine your character's interests and characteristics, and decide what sounds will and will not work.,
Think about name meanings.,
Famous names.,
Do you want your character to have a nickname?,
When you have decided on a shortlist of names, go to someone who doesn't know the character you have created.,
Try naming your character after someone.,
Don't choose a name that is impossible to pronounce.,
If your character has a best friend, enemy, partner, sibling, etc who they spend a lot of time with, it is best not to have their names too similar, or the readers may confuse the names.",How to Name Your Fictional Character," For example, if your character is British, your readers will expect a stereotypically English name, so a non-English name like ""Cho-Lin"" would only work with a convincing backstory (see also, for example, the Desi family from Coronation Street). Remember that most readers will hear a name and instantly visualise a character based on that name, especially if that name hails from a particular culture.


By a similar logic, bear in mind that some names are considered old-fashioned or New-Agey by today's readers. Does the name fit the time period your story is set in?;
, If the character is quite strong-willed and stubborn, strong sounds like ""k"" and ""p"" will pick up well here. On the other hand, if your character is pretty and a bit shy, soft sounds like ""f"" and ""s"" work much better.

, Search through baby name websites, looking for names that have a meaning that will go well with your character. You can go with physical appearance (""Bianca"" for a blonde, ""Bella"" for someone pretty"") or personality (""Lewis"" means warrior and ""Leo"" means lion).

, Remember that certain names, such as ""Adolf"" or ""Elvis"", have certain overtones, and a character with a well-known name is unlikely to develop in their own way as you want them to. However, this can be made into a plot device or a running joke, if you want. Just be aware that people may well prejudge your character for this reason, and it is recommended that you use this technique sparingly, if at all.

, If so, you need to determine three things to your audience: (a) who calls the character by the nickname, (b) why they have developed this nickname (some, like Becky/Rebecca, need no explaining, others may need more) and (c) does the character like/accept this nickname? Is it a hated handle?

, Read out each name to them in turn and ask what sort of person might have that name. If they come up with something completely different to your character, it probably won't fit.

, It might be someone you love, someone who has influenced you or supported you, or the person that this character is based on.


Be careful though — if you're naming your character after someone, check with them before it ever gets made public. They may not be happy with being associated with that character, especially if the character is portrayed unfavourably, and you may end up with a difficult court case. If they say they would rather not, accept this and change the name.
This is different from using your own family members — your family, your business (although you should still use common courtesy, especially if these people are still alive). Garfield the cat, for example, was named for Jim Davis' grandfather.

, You may think that Xzighlab is the perfect name for your character, but if the reader has to struggle through this name several times a page they will be put off.

, Examples include Rachel/Robert, Mary/Martin, Sophie/Sam etc. Even if they don't start with the same letter, but sound similar, there can be confusion, e.g. Jacob/George.

"
Make a list of your favorite characters.,
Figure out your main character’s “wants” and “needs.” You probably understand that the desires of your main character are what will drive the plot, but these desires will also shape the substance of your main character.,
Determine your character’s “wounds.” All good characters have “wounds” they have incurred through their lives.,
Try flipping an identity marker.,
Look for “defining characteristics.” When crafting your characters, try to determine each character’s defining characteristics.",How to Write Non Stereotypical Characters1," For each one, write down basic demographic details (age, gender, physical appearance). Then ask yourself, what makes each of these characters unique? How do each of these characters stand out? Use this list to inspire your writing.Walter White in Breaking Bad, for example, is a white, male, middle aged school teacher, but he also becomes a ruthless drug lord.
These qualities shape Walter White and all of the decisions (and emotional reactions) he makes.;
, Consider what your character wants (this is a conscious desire) versus what your character needs (an unconscious desire). Allow the nuances of your character to develop out of these wants and needs.


The character of Clarisse Starling in The Silence of the Lambs wants to succeed and advance within the FBI, but deep down she also needs acceptance (probably from a parental figure).
Both her wants and needs lead her to engage with Hannibal Lecter, but in different ways, thus giving her character nuance.

, These old scars can have a huge influence over how characters act, what they are afraid of, and what they insulate themselves from. If you can determine your character’s wounds, you can better write a round and interesting person into being.For example, Don Draper in Mad Men is actually an army deserter named Dick Whitman.
This is his biggest wound and biggest secret, and it drives much of what he does and how he acts.

, One way to check for stereotypical writing is to imagine you’ve flipped one of your character’s identity markers. Although some elements of your character would understandably change based on these identity markers, you should always have a deeper, more complex reasons for what your character does (and how they act) than a simple identity marker. If everything about your character comes undone with the flip of one identity marker, chances are you are relying on a stereotypical representation. This exercise helps to check for that kind of sloppy writing.Let’s say you’ve written a 26-year-old, black, female detective.
Every once in a while, stop and mentally change some of her characteristics in a given scene.
Imagine that she is a 26-year-old white women, or a black man, or a even much older black woman.
How do her decisions and/or reactions change or stay the same?

, Try to distill the essence of your character down to one or two key features. If you find the essence of your character to be that “she’s a girl” or “he’s a gay man,” you likely have a flat or stereotypical character. Search for something more specific, more unique, and ultimately more interesting.The character Lisbeth Salander in the film The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is a whip-smart, socially withdrawn computer hacker with a traumatic past.
The fact that she is a woman is important, but these other defining characteristics are what drive her.

"
"
Focus on the “inciting incident.” In a traditional plot structure, there is always an “inciting incident,” or something that happens that sets the main character’s story in motion.,
Challenge genre conventions.,
Introduce your character in action.,
Be realistic.,
Have your character do the opposite.",How to Write Non Stereotypical Characters2," If you can think carefully about an interesting inciting incident, it can tell you unique things about your character.Thinking again about Walter White, the inciting incident in Breaking Bad is that Walt finds out he has very advanced cancer.
His reaction to this news is what drives the plot line of the entire series, but more importantly, his reaction reveals who is an a person.

, It is not uncommon to find certain types of stereotypical characters housed within particular types of stories. (Horror movies, for example, are known for having a virginal female character who lives, and a promiscuous one who dies early). You can widen the scope on your character’s personalities by straying from the convention of your given genre. Try to include some plot elements or details that are unique or out of the ordinary for the genre you’re working in, and see how that influences the way you write your characters.The film Gone Girl challenges the mystery-suspense genre, by supplying an unreliable narrator, and the unique character of Amy Dunne is created.

, Rather than writing a lot of exposition that explains who you character is, show who your character is through action. Place your character in a situation, and figure out how they act (or react). The more unique the situation, the more you push yourself to think outside of the box. You may surprise yourself with the unique details you come up with.The family dinner scene that happens near the beginning of Little Miss Sunshine provides each character with an opportunity for introduction and reaction.
This scene is an excellent example of how to introduce an ensemble cast through action.

, Real people are not stereotypes. You can check to see if your character comes off as stereotypical by trying to place them in the real world. Do they seem like a real, natural, three-dimensional person to you? Another approach is to base your character off of someone you know in real life., We are well schooled in clichés and stereotypes. As a result, some of our first instincts for characters fall into these categories. When you make a choice for you character, stop and consider doing the exact opposite. Doing the opposite may be a way to introduce something fresh to your plot, and give more dimension to your characters."
"
Give them a history.,
Provide them with a range of emotions.,
Avoid reducing them to archetypes.,
Pass the “Bechdel Test.” The Bechdel Test, created by illustrator and writer Allison Bechdel, is simple way to scan for gender-bias in film or literature.",How to Write Non Stereotypical Characters3," When it comes to the depiction of women in literature and film, there is a long history of using flat, undeveloped stereotypes that do little more than support the male characters’ story lines. An important way to reduce the stereotypical representations in your work is to focus on how you write women. Start by giving each of your female characters a history. What does her past look like, and what led her to this moment?A great example of this is Katniss Everdeen in The Hunger Games.
By understanding her background, family life, and upbringing, we better understand what makes her tick, and why she does the things she does.

, One of the big mistakes that writers make with their depictions of women is limiting their emotional reactions. Allow your female characters an emotional range—from negative emotions like rage, hopelessness, agitation, and apathy; to positive ones like excitement, curiosity, equanimity, and cheerfulness.Too often female characters are either “the angry one” or “the cheerful one.” Without a range of emotional reactions, female characters are wooden.
A good example of a woman with emotional range is the character Cheryl Strayed in Wild.

, If you look carefully at many modern stories, you will see many women depicted as either virgins or whores; mothers, daughters, or wives; or sometimes the old wise woman. Move beyond these simple depictions, and add depth and dimension to your female characters.Examples of archetypical depictions include the Oracle in the Matrix, Tatum Riley in Scream, and Cinderella in Disney’s Cinderella.
Examples of female characters who move beyond their archetypes include Elsa in Frozen, Vivian in Pretty Woman, and Amy Dunne in Gone Girl.

, To pass the test, a story need only include two female characters who have names, and who speak to each other about something other than a man. (You will be surprised to discover how many films and books do not pass). You can scan your work for three-dimensional female characters, by making sure you pass the Bechdel Test in multiple scenes."

Name the character appropriately for their time period and age.,
Choose a name based on what it or its derivative means.,
Don't go overboard in creating science fiction characters.,
Remember the characters' relationships when deciding how they address one another.,
Be creative.,
Watch out for ""loaded"" names--names that have a popular association.,
Have fun with naming your characters and take time to see what ""fits.""",How to Name a Main Character," Many authors make the mistake of choosing a name that is popular now for an adult character, but rarely been used around the time of that character's birth.


Decide the age of your character and then calculate the year your character was born. If your character was born in the U.S., browse the Social Security Administration Name Popularity List for that year.
You will also want to take into account the character's ethnic background and the ethnic background of his/her parents.;
, Many writers give their characters names that have significance in the story. It could reflect major personality traits, or the character's role in the story.


You may want to search by literal meaning, or think of ways to incorporate other meanings into your character's name. For example, if your character is a botanist, you may not want to name her Flower (too literal), but you may want to consider the names Linnea or Sage.
Even if you choose not to name a character by meaning, you should look up the meaning of all your characters' names so you are aware of it. There may be something that inspires you or, on the other hand, conflicts with your message.

, It's difficult to predict what names will be popular in the year 3000, but you don't have to make your science fiction characters sound like they are from Mars (unless they are). When a person reads (or watches) your story, you don't want them to stumble over a name. The name Zyxnrid, for example, would be difficult to read or listen to every time the character is referenced—and may detract from your overall story. If you do choose to create your sci-fi name, you may want to:


Combine two common names to make a less common, but pronounceable name. Example: Donica (Donna and Veronica).
Use ancient mythological names, or combine two of them. Example: Ceres or Evadne.
Make it easy to pronounce and spell. Example: Bilbo Baggins from Lord of the Rings

, When writing your story, be aware that people who are close rarely use each other's full names.


Couples will use nicknames, terms of endearment (honey, dear, boo).
Parents rarely call their children by their full names--unless they are admonishing them for bad behavior or testifying in court. If you have loving parent characters that are addressing their kids, use a nickname or term of endearment (sweetie, baby, D.J.). An exception to this would be if you want to show the parent character being cold and distant to their child.

, Don't incorporate the same overused names in your stories. For some reason, every writer loves to name his hero Jack. It may be a tough-sounding, honest-working name, but naming your hero Jack is like naming your son Aidan. It's overdone. Be a little more creative, so your reader will remember your particular protagonist as opposed to the umpteen-million other books they've read about Jack.

, These could be names associated with celebrities, historical or infamous people like Adolf, Oprah, or Kobe. They could also be names of famous literary, TV, or movie characters: Hannibal, Scarlett, Romeo, Bart.


If you do choose to use ""loaded"" names, then you really should make it part of the story, part of the character. Your character's mother was obsessed with Gone With the Wind, so she was named Scarlett--how has it affected her throughout her life? How does it affect her in the story? Names are such an important part of one's identity, don't take it lightly with your story!

,


What was your character's childhood nickname? Is that an embarrassment when his parents address him in front of his friends?
Did your character change his name at any point in his/her life? If so, why?
Does your female character want to change her surname when she gets married? Why or why not?

If you're willing to kill your villain, you could always have them sacrifice themselves to save someone/something.",How to Redeem a Seemingly Irredeemable Villain in Fiction," Does it have major or minor importance in relation to the story at large? Also, whether you ponder some specific themes or are more about 'vicariously living through characters and their adventures' -entertainment (like Indiana Jones, Batman, Savage Dragon etc.), along with whether the narrative is more plot-, character- or world-centric, affects your way of execution.;
, What are you aiming to demonstrate?


Sometimes this may be unplanned, coming as a natural course of action.

, The key to possibility of redemption is the right kind of a personality. Look at a villain's personality structure and explore it. It's also recommendable to do some exploration of various different personality types in real life.


If your villain is a remorseless, thrill-loving psychopath with a planet-sized sadistic streak that would frighten Hannibal Lecter, redemption is implausible. Psychopathic personalities overall are a kiss of death for it, because psychopaths are incapable of empathy, guilt, remorse, regret or shame and can't form genuine emotional connections to anyone. Likewise, a petty, deceitful, power-seeking bully, who's had absolutely no problem lying, conniving and backstabbing during the whole story, or a tyrannical sadist, who's delighted in making others suffer, makes for an unbelievable redemption story, just to give a few examples.
It goes better for more ambiguous villains (who might even have a sympathetic reason for doing what they do in the first place), ones who've had serious second thoughts about their path in life or ones with a strong honorable streak despite their evil nature.
What redeeming qualities does your villain have? A soft spot for another villain? Genuine suppressed affection for one of the good guys? A small thing like berry pie? A moral boundary they'd never cross no matter what?
Make sure they fit his character seamlessly, not look tacked on. The less obvious, the better. Even better to have the bits of their hidden blooming goodness gradually come to surface.
Furthermore, if they're supposed to be a supernatural, mythical or religious personification of evil like Satan - forget it! Redemption's just not going to be convincing.

, This may never come to play in an actual story or may just be referred to, but it helps you better understand your villain.

, Even if they understand what they do is wrong, they have a driving reason. Perhaps they honestly believe that what they do is good, just necessary evil to achieve larger good, justifiable or something that can be shrugged off for some reason.

, Dig deeper. What events, things or even developed personality traits would have given him such beliefs? What would be required to get him to replace these beliefs with different ones?

, Pay attention to

, This could be done with a growing sense of unease on the villain's part; with a small, persistent voice at the back of their head; or with an all-out brawl over the villain's soul.

, That being said, it's not the only option. What would his path of atonement be like?

"
Where do they confront each other?,
What weapons or other equipments do they have?

,
Are they both alone or does either (or both) have helpers with them and how many?,
Don't cut the emotional and psychological part out.,
Have both sides hit, miss, defend, evade, get hit, fall, stagger and stumble.,
Don't be afraid to add a twist if the scene and the story itself call for it.,
How dramatic and ""epic"" the confrontation is depends on where the story is.,
If you are constructing the climax it doesn't always have to be a final epic climax in a structurally collapsing building.",How to Write a Dramatic Confrontation Scene Between a Hero and a Villain," A stage can add variety and change choreographies.;
,, Sometimes an all-out massive brawl is better, sometimes you may need just a duel or punch-up.

, Have them taunting each other, trying to get under each other's skin, expressing their emotions, playing a blame-game, throwing witty, caustic remarks, bantering, reflecting on past events and discussing their rivalry(or outright enmity), if it's in character for them. However, if these characters would just go right away for the violent brawl, then have them do it. In that case, mere murderous gazes and other subtleties are enough.

, Keep the outcome in doubt and you'll increase suspense. Show that both opponents are capable of winning the fight.

, Maybe both parties place the blame on each other, but the true blame lies in someone else. Maybe the villain and hero were secretly in love with each other. Maybe a secondary character shows up and kills both. Maybe a villain manages to get rid of (yet not quite kill) a hero for some time with an ace up his sleeve the latter failed to foresee thanks to his (hero's) personality flaw (extremely useful, if the parties confront each other too early in the story). Be creative!

, If it's the hero's first meeting with the villain just make it simple like a chase of sorts. This helps set up their hatred of each other. If you want to the make the confrontation take place in a hazardous environment with the hero and the villain trying to kill each other in melee combat then that's best reserved for the climax. A good example of this is the film True Lies. The protagonist Harry and the antagonist Salim meet up midway through the film and have a chase throughout a hotel and ultimately Salim escapes. At the end of the movie they fight again but on board a large helicopter hovering several thousand feet off the ground. Bond movies are known for doing this so try to take that.

, It can be in a regular setting. A good example is the shootout at the end of Scarface where Tony Montana engages in a large firefight with several assassins inside his house. There is not lightning and no outside danger. Sometimes it's better if it's a simple shootout than an all-out brawl.

Keep your readers compelled with cliffhangers.,
Try using figure of speeches such as hyperboles and connotations to give your story deeper elements.,
Use perfect grammar.,
Make a cover.,
Expect it to take time to get known.",How to Write a Band Fanfiction," Beware of falling into common tropes such as ""the Starbucks barista that accidentally spills coffee on Harry Styles and ends up going on tour with him"". This could leave your readers begging for mercy.;
, Giving the main character some actual human qualities is an important part. Of course, the easiest thing to do would be to create a flawless character but making them perfect is making them boring and leaves no room for conflict and resolution. The messy bun is not the only hairstyle your character can have and she can wear clothes that aren't a baggy sweater with leggings. Try also to avoid spending multiple paragraphs that overdue descriptions as well because... yawn.


A good way to avoid these blunders is to read the ever-so-popular ""Dumb Fanfiction Moments"" online.

, Usually, the most popular story descriptions are quotes—from the book itself or from famous people—so if you decide upon using one, make sure it is compelling enough to hook your future readers into your book.

, Short and sweet is the safest but it can vary depending on your strength as a writer. If you are lost, use the inside covers (or backs) of actual novels as reference.

, Writing is something that you love to do, so showcase your best work when writing something that you're passionate about!

, This will keep them coming back for more, that is, as long as you update frequently., Use synonyms to improve simple words. Instead of black, try onyx or ebony. In place of good, try marvelous or superb. Or, instead of said, try reminded or breathed. The possibilities are endless; just be aware to not come across as ostentatious.

, Grammar is probably one of the most important parts of your story. A lot of people who read books online may refuse to read yours if the grammar is bad. It’s important, so be sure to get this aspect correct. If you're having issues yourself, consider getting an editor to ensure that your work flows properly and reads well.


Instead of writing ""omg i think that justin likes me wat do u think”, replace it with ""I think that Justin likes me! What do you think?"" It's simple differences like that that can change your reader’s perspective as to the quality of the your work. It will also make you seem more mature and serious about your work.
Learn your homophones. There is a difference between ""your"" and ""you're"". Also between ""their"", ""there"" and ""they're"". A pet peeve of many a reader is the use of the wrong words. Additionally, there is also a space in ""a lot"". Using spell check will help you immensely.

, If your book is going to be published on Wattpad, you'll need an interesting cover. Everyone judges books by their covers, that's just human nature; if your story cover is generic, then not many people will want to read your story. Fortunately, you can edit amazing covers on free websites and apps, so there is no need to worry about that!


If you're on a computer, try Picmonkey. There you can create flawless covers that attract attention and most of the useful features are free.
An app that is accessible on your phone is Phonto. You can download your own fonts from online and create pretty covers with little to no effort.

, It honestly takes forever for your story to get famous. However, by using tags, you can help your story reach a larger audience. Also, aim to promote your story on other social media platforms, so as to increase their popularity. Soon, if you're patient enough and you’ve written a good tale, you will be a smash hit.

Decide their birth date.,

Use a personality balancer.,
Give them a great name.,
Identify your character's ending goal.,
Identify your character's beginning.,
Decide how they get there.,
Avoid the clichés.,
Choose a style.,
Draw the character.,
Take design cues from your character's personality and history.,
Study human anatomy.,
Draw from life.,
Practice different, dynamic poses.,
Keep practicing!",How to Make Your Own Anime or Manga Character," Blood type is seen as a common indicator of personality in Japan. You can use this as a way to help decide what you want your character to be like. The blood types and associated personalities are:


O - confident, optimistic and strong-willed but also self-centered and unpredictable
A - creative, reserved and responsible but also stubborn and tense
B - active and passionate but also selfish and irresponsible
AB - adaptable and rational but also forgetful and critical;
, The Western Zodiac or the Eastern Zodiac can both also be used to determine personality. You can use this to choose your character's age or birth year and their birth date.

, If you really want to get an idea for a fully formed personality, you can check out the Myers-Briggs personality test. These personality types, based in the study of psychology, can be helpful in fleshing out your character's personality.

, You'll also want to be sure to balance your character's personality. A balance of positive and negative traits is necessary to create a compelling, believable character. Count up your character's negative traits and positive traits and try to make the negative traits slightly outnumber the positive ones. By the end of your story, your character will have developed to overcome a few of the negative traits. Example negative traits include:


Manipulative
Often lies
Insults others
Uncaring about their impact on others
Focused on only their own goals
Has poor impulse control
Frequently resentful, even of small or accidental slights
Is usually reckless or impulsive

, Many people also believe that someone's name can affect their personality. Studies show that having an uncommon name can lead to bullying and the personality issues that result from being bullied. There are also people who believe a name can determine your whole personality (called Kabalarians). This, whether true or not, can help you decide on a name.


Try to avoid using really unusual names in an otherwise realistic setting. This makes your character seem out of place.

, Where do you want your character to end up? What do you want their lesson to be over the course of your story? What do you want them to have learned or changed? You can use your character's ending state to figure out how to portray them in the beginning.

, Once you know where they end up, decide where you want them to start out. This should follow logically from where they end. For example, if you want a character that learns to appreciate others, you want to show them not appreciating the people that care about them in the beginning. You probably also want to show why they think they don't need people.

, Think about where you want them to start and end. Now, what would lead someone to change like that? This is where you can get some great ideas for your story, because the things that happen to your character to make them change makes for great plot or subplot.

, Their girlfriend gets killed. They were orphaned at a young age. They grew up the perpetual new kid. These are all clichés meant to jump start your character's development. And because they're clichès. They tend to be boring. Try to avoid them. Work to be original in your character development. This will make people more interested in your character and want to follow your story.

, Different types of anime and manga are often drawn in different styles. You can just use your own natural style or you can emulate the look of classic artists for different genres. Shojo and shonen anime and manga are the two most common genres.

, Keep in mind that cute characters usually have wide eyes while cool characters have small, slanted eyes. Check out these resources on how to draw your character:



Here's how to draw an anime character:

An anime boy
An anime face
Anime eyes



Here's how to draw a manga character:

A manga head
A manga girl
A manga girl’s face
Manga hair



, Add clothing and accessories. Let your choices help reflect your character's personality and history. For example, if you have a female character who tends to be very practical, put her in flats rather than heels. If you want to hint at a character's past, think of things that they might wear or keep that are significant to them. For example, in The Legend of Korra, Mako wears his father's scarf at all times. Be creative!

, Making characters that look good starts with a basic knowledge of human anatomy. You don't want to make your character look like they have too many muscles or too few, too many joints or too few, a badly disproportionate body, etc. Get a good anatomy book and learn about where our bones and muscles are, how they bend, and where they line up.

, Drawing a manga character requires a basic knowledge of the human body. The more you can draw humans,the easier would it be to draw a manga. So start with drawing (for practice) your friends and even yourself sitting in front of a mirror.

, To draw poses for your character, you can take images of yourself doing those poses and then try to draw your character in those poses with the help of the images. You can also use helpful websites like posemaniacs.com for reference.


Try to keep anatomy in mind when you do these poses. You don't want your character to end up looking like a Rob Liefeld drawing.

, The more you practice, the better you'll get.

Focus on the look of the Supervillain.,
Figure out what powers your villain will have.,
Think of the evil plot they will have, as every bad guy has one.,
Give them an evil laugh.,
Consider a henchman.,
Give them a weakness or something that will be their downfall afterwards.,
Give your villain some connection to your hero.",How to Make Supervillains," The possibilities are endless. You can make it human, super-human, or it doesn't even have to be a human.


Determine if it is a male or female.






Try to stay away from bright colors. A cape is a good touch, but it's not necessary.






Make it either a creature or have them morph into a shape-shifter for extra effects. Shape-shifters are characters that go from a basic form, such as humans, to different creatures (like Maleficent in Sleeping Beauty).







, He/She could have elements of water, fire, earth, nature. But don't let the basic elements hold you captive. Be creative and make up your own power. If not, try considering things like electricity, superhuman strength, telekinesis, flight, ice, darkness (a good one), or anything you want. Combining more than one power is also possible, but don't make it too strong. Remember, the good guy should always win...for some reason.

, The whole ""Taking Over The World"" thing is outdated. Be more original. For example, Magneto (X-Men) was seen as evil because he was tired of humans treating him and all mutants like trash. Mr Freeze (Batman) had the whole story with his wife - if you watched the movie, you'd know. Nevertheless, let the villain have a good, genuine reason for being so mean (e.g. jealousy, alienation, revenge, protection).

, A laugh is a confirmation of their power, so it has to suit them. Pick it out carefully. You could choose the deep Dracula kind of chuckle for the guys, the high toned witch cackle could suit some females, but not all. Others would rather prefer the lower mysterious laugh, that is sometimes even confused with a giggle. There are countless choices.

, In complex plots, henchmen have their very own personalities and would not be considered as part of the super villain. But if the story is short and simple, a henchman can be limited. Give them a basic good quality - e.g. brains, strength, speed, obedience, bravery - and a basic bad quality - e.g. stupidity, clumsiness, cowardice. They don't have to look like the villain, but it would be good if they shared some characteristics or ideas. They could have, for example, the same goal and reason to be doing such dastardly crime.

, It could be a physical thing, like Achilles' heel, or a mental or inner flaw like greed or jealousy. He could have also been betrayed. But don't let it be an accident, his or her defeat. The point is to teach people that crime does not pay, so let his loss be by flaw. Throughout the story, show signs of his flaw, as Caesar showed signs of his arrogance throughout the Shakespearean play, and it was this flaw which caused him to die. He wasn't a Supervillain, but yours should, as Caesar, perish in the end.

, A betrayed friend or a spurned lover, if the rivalry is personal it makes for more intense battles.

Consider what it means to be good.,
Look at evil acts that people have actually done.,
Is your villain human or non-human?,
Make them evil because of their choices or actions, not their identity.,
Skip lazy shortcuts.,
Consider how your villain justifies their actions.,
Give the villain understandable and/or compelling motivations and goals.,
Examine the villain's interactions with allies or minions.,
Consider the parts of the villain that aren't evil.,
Give minions, followers and even the lieutenants reasons to follow the villain.,
Examine the villain's feelings and interactions with the heroes.,
Consider how you are going to introduce him into the story.",How to Make a Purely Evil Villain Interesting," Anything else is wasting your time, because this is the only thing you actually need to know, you can not create a bad person without knowing what is good then bad is the opposite.

, Turn to the news and history books to see examples of how real people can do terrible things., If your villain is a non-human creature, things can a bit different. Maybe your non-human creature actually has no concept of good and evil and though may be evil in some way, is more amoral than actually malevolent.

, Evil isn't simply something that someone is, it's something that a person chooses. Give your reader a sense of why this character is evil and not good.


Have the villain personally do evil acts (not just order them to happen). To make it more effective, have the evil acts happen to a person that the reader cares about., To write an interesting character, you'll want to avoid the overused tropes and shortcuts. This includes writing villains who have very little motive.Sadism isn't a real motivation. Your character needs a good reason to do evil acts instead of eating dessert in front of their TV.It's boring, and not very believable, to have a villain who does evil acts ""because it's fun.""
Don't superficially rip off Nazis. Use literal Nazis as villains, or if you use Nazis as an inspiration, do some detailed research about their rationales and how they worked.A person or group shouldn't just seem ""bad"" because they look like Nazis, but because they are nuanced in their evil beliefs and actions.
Mental illness and disabilities don't make people evil. ""They're evil because they have a mental condition"" is lazy writing that is deeply insulting to the many good people with real emotional and developmental disabilities. (Disabled people aren't more violent than anyone else, but they are much more likely to be victims of violence.Don't support discrimination by caricaturing them as evil.)
Avoid cheesy, academic language. This is pretty overdone., Avoid the lazy writing of simply having a villain cackle at actions they think are depraved. Even if your villain knows what he is doing is morally indefensible, there still should exist some form of justification in their mind. It may make sense for them alone based on his experiences and beliefs he has formed from them. Here are some justifications a villain might have:""I will do anything to earn the acceptance of _____/become a true _____.""
""The world is full of moral failings, and I am one of the few that is truly virtuous. I must correct others' immorality. If bad things happen to people, it is because they deserve it.""
""People of group X are monsters/in need of controlling/a waste of space.""
""Only the strong survive. Losing is a sign of weakness. The weak deserve to lose.""
""People who X deserve to be put back in their place.""
""I will stop at nothing to achieve my goal, because it is the greatest good. If other people get in my way, I will stop them. If I happen to hurt others, it doesn't matter, because it is for the greater good.""
""Members of Minority X are scary and bad. I will do anything to protect my home/town/country from them.""

, Evil for the pleasure of evil itself is harder to write well. It's chilling to make their evil look like something a human being would do given the right circumstances and mindset (and/or in case of the most of us, enough push).

, How does he behave towards them? How differently? Is he patient towards his second-in-command, but can impulsively, without a second thought, kill an underling, who has failed a mission? Does he treat his trusted lieutenant as almost his equal, but sneer at his generals when the latter try to question him? Does he perceive his elite warriors as the ideal kind of soldiers superior to everything but himself, but view his lesser footmen as mere cannon fodder? Why? What do his interactions tell about his character?

, No well written character is either all evil or all good, so your villain should have some neutral or good traits as well.Who does your villain care about? Which people or animals are special to them?
Consider what the villain won't do. For example, maybe he is willing to kill people, but considers torture and rape to be unnecessarily cruel. Or she will steal, threaten, and cheat, but she won't kill unless absolutely necessary.
Give your villain hobbies. What non-evil things do they do in their spare time? Do they play chess, practice shooting, knit sweaters for Fluffy, write their autobiography?

, Is it fear? Do they have same goals? Do they need the villain’s help to advance their own goals? Are they after the same thing as the villain, but plan on turning against him at the crucial moment? Do they secretly plan vengeance against the villain while maintaining a false identity and pretending to be their ally? Do they follow the villain out of respect, admiration and/or worship and why? Do they secretly want something that the villain possesses or has access to? This helps to give both the villain and lesser bad guys more depth than just flat cardboard cut-outs.

, Do they find the main hero irritating, because the latter never gives up? Or amusing, because she’s much more persistent and less easy to kill than anyone who’s resisted them in the past?

,


One good way of creating suspense is having other characters talk about your villain, show some of his deeds and give the audience sense of him. Later he may come out of the dark with a frightening entrance.

Gain musical inspiration.,
If you are in a position to inspire a child or someone younger than you, listen and interpret the meaning of the songs and whether or not they have discriminatory content in them.,
Help out someone in need.,
Be a positive remodel.,
Read inspiring books.,
Get education.,
Find out what your life purpose really is.",How to Inspire and Make Changes," If you look at music and the different categories of music such alternative rock, blues, Christian, classical, country, gospel, heavy rock, hip, jazz, hop, heavy metal, pop, reggae, rap, rock, and on list just keeps on going, you will find out that music expresses the human imagination.


However, what you imagine yourself to be or what you image what you want to become is important. The issue to consider about inspiration is does the music you listen to inspire you to do great things in life or does it do the opposite and make you reflect on greed, pride, envy, lust, or gluttony? If it makes you reflect on the negative qualities of life, the question you should be asking yourself, is why are you listening to it?
The more you listen to music that has the negative qualities, the more likely you will not be inspired about life. The result is that you are unhappy and take the things you have for granted. If you listen to positive music that inspires you, it makes you reflect on the good qualities that you have within yourself and it helps you to not only strive better in life but to be happy and satisfied with what you have in life.;
, If you do in fact find such content quickly remove it and prevent the child from listening to it.


You have to remember that children brains are not fully developed yet, and they are not aware of the influences that music plays on their character development. Character development includes being able to learn and grow as an emotional, spiritual, and intellectual being. Music is so powerful because it influences our character development and the main purpose of music is to inspire us to do great things in life.

However, it can also have the opposite affect on us and influence us to take things for granted and want more materialistic things out of life; none of which will never completely satisfy us because we are not simply happy with the things that we do have.



, A simple act of kindness can bring out the best in people. All of us at heart want to be loved and respected and by helping out someone it shows these qualities. When we help out another person without asking for nothing in return, we are instilling and enforcing the good qualities within ourselves and we become more grateful for the things that we already have.

, Today it is tougher for the younger generation and the generation that are yet to come. The reason that it is so hard to grow up for them is because more negative things are happening around the world: the terrorist attacks, the sniper shootings, the ongoing wars around the world, etc. It is during these times that people need to become remodels not just for children but for others and to inspire others to do what is right rather than what is wrong.


It can be a simple act of volunteering at a local community event and encouraging others to go. This can prevent children from becoming involved with future criminal activity and inspire them to want to help others in the community. Whether you realize or not your actions do speak louder than words because people actually do observe your actions and take after your habits into their personality subconsciously.

, Thomas Jefferson before he would go to bed would read a book that would inspire him. The books that inspired him the most were books that had some moral story or a moral dilemma in them.


How often do you to read a book that has a moral issue or discuss the merits of having good morals and how they impact your character as a person? If you need inspiration try to read a book on moral values and question what is right and wrong.

, Education is fundamental for growth. The question is who decides if it is the right education or not? You as a citizen have the right to decide what you choose to embrace. This includes what you want to learn about. But knowledge can lead us to do the right thing or the wrong thing.


However, sometimes we do make the wrong choices in life but it is up to us to take responsibility for our actions and to live up to them. For where there is evil in the world, there is also good which is very much alive.
To all the women in the world this wisdom is for you; you do not need to show us how beautiful you are. You already are beautiful just as you are and you can show us your beauty by letting us feel your beautiful presence. To all the the men in the world, I say let the man make the money and do not let the impulses of greed dilute your prospective of life for money does not make a man.""


, What exactly holds everything in the universe together? If your answer to this question is that it is atoms, you are absolutely right. But then, what holds the sub particles of the atoms together? Are you stomped that’s alright?


The reason that these tough questions were asked is because it makes you think about what holds everything in the universe together and this is a good thing. There has to be something in the universe that holds everything together including the atoms, the sub particles and everything else, but what is it exactly? You can ponder about that question because it is not my place to say but to make you think.
If you do think that there is a greater power beyond the universe, would this higher power be showed to us in everyday life like though the simple acts of breathing, consuming food, gazing at the stars at night and the list just goes on. The point is with all of our knowledge in the universe we only know and understand about ten percent of it; everything in the universe is different and unique in some way or another and yet these things still manage to work together.

Everything in the universe has a unique and special place and is given a position that will help to support the other things together in the universe to serve for a greater purpose; this purpose is one that we not yet understand exactly but it is a purpose that is filled with being able to rebuild, and renew all life out of love, empathy and compassion which is what truly binds everything together. To find your life purpose you need to examine your values and do what you believe is right but you as an individual must reflect and bring out the good human qualities within yourself.

Reread your whole story, top to bottom, fixing grammatical and spelling errors before you start redefining your characters.,
When you come to a point in your book where you're introducing your character, be descriptive!,
Remember: The better the reader knows the character, the better they can understand later actions in the story.,
Give the character his own action phrase, or word.,
Name their likes and dislikes throughout the story.,
Note if the character is sarcastic, funny, rude, etc., and apply that to most of the character's dialogue.,
Your alter ego is very important.,
""Read between the lines"" is a good tool.,
Make character's bad habits apparent (biting nails, lying, disorganization).,
People subconsciously do things, apply the actions to the character.,
Apply all the rules above to all the other characters, starting from most important to least.",How to Make Your Book Characters More Realistic," This makes it easier.;
, Talk about his clothes, the way he walked towards someone, his facial expression, the way the other characters immediately acted around him, and anything that reflects the character's personality.

, Of course, this also means that his/her later actions need to connect with their personality or have some sort of consequence for the character, like emotional uncertainty or the sudden distrust of another character. If you use the ""I don't know who I am any more"" trick, don't overdo it, that can end up sounding clichéd.

, A phrase or word that reflects how they feel about a situation. If a character says the word ""Fantastic"" when they're annoyed or aggravated, for example. Don't overuse it, but you should have it present if you do use it.

, If someone's eating an apple and the character is sitting by them, they could say, ""I like pears better, apples are sour."" Make sure this integrates smoothly into your text.

, Again, don't overdo it, or your character will lose his/her humanity. (Even if he/she isn't human.), Use it, it's so much easier to write about characters loosely based off yourself or your alter ego. Imagine that someone was saying every line to that character to you. Beware of Mary-Sues, though. Google this if you don't know what it means, as it's important.

, Maybe the character wants to go out to a Chinese restaurant, therefore, he/she likes Chinese., Do the same for good habits.

, If the character is angry, have him run his fingers through his hair. Or if the character is shy, have that character use one of it's arms to rub the other.

, Make sure you continue your characters' new traits as you're writing your book, if you're still writing.

Make sure to give your OC at least five flaws.,
Relax and think it over.,
Think of the seven deadly sins if you get stuck.",How to Give a Mary Sue Flaws," Name the character, define the character's background and locate the character in the story.;
, Don't give them present day clothes like skinny jeans and halter tops. That just doesn't fit into a plot. Also, the OC shouldn't have the perfect body, so don't give your OC too many muscles or curves, or it just won't look right. The OC shouldn't have unnatural hair colors, like neon green or pink. Unless the character has a lighter tone like Sakura from Naruto, keep things natural.

, A thing that a lot of people do is have some tragic past or an abuse story. If you're going to do this, don't overdo it. A good thing to have is an actual living family or family member, this will give your character a relatable situation.

, Have your OC build and form a bond with the character, and don't make their relationship perfect. Remember all character couples fight, so make their relationship healthy.

, If you don't have flaws, they'll seem perfect and that is, for anyone but the most narcissistic among your readers, absolutely impossible to relate to.


A flaw can be physical or mental.
The character could have a scar of some sort or they could be emotionally unstable.

, Don't make the OC into someone everyone wants to be and be with. Real people and OCs alike have flaws and that is what makes the OC appear natural.

, The seven deadly sins are greed, envy, wrath, sloth, lust, pride and gluttony. Any of these can be applied to a character to create one or more flaws which would set them back.

For example, a greedy character could be endlessly grabbing money for himself, and refusing to do tasks that he wouldn't get paid for.
An envious character could be jealous of others and be constantly trying to hurt them.


These traits could be written as ending badly for the character, and they would have to work hard to get themselves out of trouble. This kind of writing is character forming and makes people warm to your character a lot more if they have to work to overcome flaws and therefore earn their happy ending.

, Show them when you introduce your main character.

, Then, after a few subtle foreshadowing clues, have the character show his or her true colors. This works especially well with villains. Likewise, another good way is having other characters tell second or even third hand information about your character before you even show him. Then reveal him to be different from how others see him.

, Is she a silent, calm, serene girl, who likes to listen to dramatic music? Is he a gentle, friendly guy, who likes to play a villain? Adding in these genuine human elements will help bring them to life and will encourage readers to identify with them more.

Give your characters different last names.",How to Make a Good Last Name for Characters in a Book," Pick up a book in the same genre as the one you're writing. Glance through character or place names in the book to get some ideas. It can also help to compare last names from your characters to the story you're skimming. Ask yourself whether or not your character's last name would fit or stand out in a book with similar themes.


Avoid simply copying last names. Use other books for inspiration. For example, if you're writing a classic children's story, thumb through another classic tale. You might see a name like Jenny Parker. You can then compare names you're considering. You might realize that Ignez Brumwell is too hard for children to read or pronounce.

, For truly random last names, pick up a phone book or book of baby names. The phone book will not only give you thousands of last names, but you can also read first names and get a feel for what names work well with each last name. While a baby book won't have last names, some first names could be used as last names. For example, these first names could be used as last names:Brady
Coleman
Davis
Devlin
Duncan
Murphy
Quinn

, If you're really stuck, search for online name generators. Some name generators are actually extensive lists of last names organized alphabetically. Others will have you put in a first name and will randomly select a last name. You can continue hitting the generate button to get different last names.You can also use online name converters. These will convert a name into a foreign name or a name based on a different ethnicity. Some converters will let you select the decade your character was born and the characters sex to determine a name.

, Once you've found a few ideas for last names, research what the names mean. If you pick something really random, you may want to make sure that it's not offensive in another language. If you're having trouble coming up with last names, you could even start your search by looking for names that mean a certain thing.


For example, if you were looking for a last name meaning ""strong"" and ""bold"" you'd find that the name Trumbull fits that meaning., If you're feeling creative, you can make your own last names using random letters or by mixing around letters in a certain word. For example, to make a last name from an anagram, rearrange some or all of the letters until you find a name you like. For example, Pullman might become Lupan, Malpun, or Ullnam.You can also find creative last names by using street or place names. Be sure to ask your friends or writer peers for feedback about the last names you've created.

, Most of the time, you'll want the last names of your characters to blend in and seem natural. To do this, you should avoid using names that are instantly recognized for whatever reason. For example, you probably don't want to use the last name:Shakespeare
Heathcliff
Gandhi
Einstein

, If you already know the first names of your characters, write down their names and list their personality traits next to the names. Ask yourself what kind of life the character has and how the character interacts with others. This will help you match a last name to the personality.For example, if you have slightly obnoxious and well-off character, you might give her a fancy name. Instead of a last name of Smith or Jones, you could give her Fitzherbert or Errington.

, Think about the social context surrounding your character. If your character lives in a futuristic society, you can be more creative and daring wit your name choice. But if your character lived in the past, think about using a last name that explains what the character does.For example, you could use Brewer, Cooper, Mason, or Cartwright to designate jobs. You could also name your character based on locations near where your book is set.

, Regardless of if your book is set in the past, present, or future, the last names should reflect those of the time period. You should also make sure that the last name fits the geography of your book. To do this, look up name popularity lists based on the decades surrounding when your book is set. You should use name lists from the place where your book is set.


Try looking up the popularity of baby names as tracked by the Social Security Administration.For example, a male farmer from the 19th century in North America probably wouldn't be named Ethan Forbes-Smyth. Instead, research would tell you that a common last name would be simply Smith or something like Brown or Williams.

, Once you've found a few last names you like, use online search engines to see if anyone actually has your character's name. In some cases, you may want to change the name slightly. Or you could get ideas for a last name by searching the internet for a description of your character.For example, you could search for a modern Japanese journalist to see what last names come up. You'd find names like Goto, Torigoe, and Yamamoto.

, If your readers will be reading a characters full name several times, make sure it flows well. You don't want to jar your readers while they're in the middle of reading. Avoid names with glottal stops (like Alec Gibson). Choose something that uses similar sounds (like Shao Shing).It's not as important that the name flows if the character is mainly addressed only by its first or last name.
Keep in mind that a name that flows will help listeners who may be following your story as a book on tape.

, Have friends or peers read the names aloud to see if they have trouble pronouncing the last names. This is especially important for long, foreign, or futuristic last names. If your readers struggle with names, they may lose interest in your story. To prevent this, you can either choose simpler names or offer a pronunciation guide at the beginning of the book.


To make it easier for your readers, consider only changing a few letters of a last name when creating a new name. This way your readers can probably guess that it sounds similar to how the name is currently pronounced.

, You may find yourself naming all of your characters with last names that start with the same letter of the alphabet. Or you may be giving very similar names to all of them. This can make it hard for your readers to distinguish between characters and may cause confusion. To prevent this, read your list of names and make sure they're unique from each other.For example, you don't want the last names Buchanan, Beveridge, and Bridgewater. Not only do they all start with ""B,"" but they also all have three syllables. Your readers would need to pay extra attention to keep the characters straight.

,How to Find Unique Names for Your Characters1,
"
Use a first name as a last name.,
Look for names in unexpected places.,
Find an unusual name in a book.,
Create a name from other words.,
Invent a name at random.,
Name characters after your favorite character.,
Adjust or misspell existing words.,
Change the gender of the name.,
Look up names.",How to Find Unique Names for Your Characters2," Since first and last names usually sound very different, breaking this tradition would make your character stand ever so slightly apart.


For example: Anna Joey, Robert Gideon, Paul Michael.
This is a very subtle approach and would make the most sense for a story that unfolds in a time and place that’s similar to your own.

, Watch the credits of a TV show or movie; a lot of uncommon names and name combinations can be found here. When you walk, bike, or drive around, take note of the street names. You might even borrow the name of a foreign city, a distant nebula, or a rare plant.


Because this is a broad approach, it could be applicable to a wide variety of genres as well as male or female characters.

, Flip through the phone book or a baby name book. In particular, baby name books have lots of uncommon names and interesting spelling variations.


For example: Razilee, Kadiah, Joval, Jantanie, Keryl, or Kaline.
If you want to be inspired by both a name and a character, check out a mythology book from the library; however, unless you want something obvious (ex. Athena), don’t go with Norse, Greek, or Latin mythology.

, J.K. Rowling, for example, is said to have created some of the names in Harry Potter by first describing a character and then creating an anagram from the descriptions. There are a number of strategies that you could use to engineer such a name. For example:


Blend common names together. So, Sarah and Josephine could become Josah and Saraphine; Garrett and Adrian could become Adriett and Garran; etc.
Try different spelling variations. Substitute Mykael for Michael, Gaebriel for Gabriel, etc.
Rearrange your own (or a friend’s) name. If your name is Bob Smith, scramble the letters to get something like Omi Thibbs. Your friend Eileen could be Neelie, Annabel could be Belanna, and so forth.
Create anagrams from common words. For example, laugh can be Gal Uh and jump can be M Puj. You can also use this technique to make a name that fits a character’s personality. So, the anagram of laugh, Gal Uh, could be a good name for a comedian and the anagram of jump, M Puj, could be a good name for a high jumper.

, If you want something truly unique, give up basing your name in anything you’re already familiar with and try to invent something completely new. This might be especially appropriate for a sci-fi or fantasy story that doesn’t fit your current cultural context.


Type a random string of letters in a Word document, then select a set that seems promising, and rework them to create something you like.
Or, you might cut individual letters out of a magazine, throw them into the air, and choose a combination based on how they fall to the floor.

, But try not to make it too obvious, as you don’t want to directly rip off an existing character’s name.


For example, if you want to name your character after Katniss Everdeen, don’t just name your character Katniss Everdeen, as this is not only unoriginal, it is also against copyright laws. Instead, try to create names similar to the existing name, such as ""Katherine"" instead of ""Katniss"", or ""Dean"" instead of ""Everdeen.”
You can also use celebrity names to create new names by mixing up or combining the names. For example: Justin Bieber and Kate Alexa could become Jexa Kelbeir.

, Take a word or phrase and misspell it to create a new name.


For example, misspell “like this” so it appears as: lykkethez. Then, choose an interesting letter combo from the results. For example, Kethez, Ethe, or Ykke.
Type a few lyrics from a song without spaces to find interesting combinations. For example, all we are is is the wind could become Llwea, Arei, Isdus, Hewin, etc.

, Change a male name to fit a female or female name to fit a male.


Keep in mind not all names have opposite-gender equivalents.

, If you research names on a name generator (meant for baby names, but still useful), you will likely come across one name or several names that could work for your character.

"
List letters that you’d like to have in the name.,
Pick a name ending.,
Make the name something you like, or the first thing you see when you look up from your screen or out your window.,
Add more letters to the letters you like.",How to Find Unique Names for Your Characters3," If you're unsure, pick one of your favorite letters. For example, you may want a character with the letters L and S in their name, because you like how those letters sound or feel they would fit the character’s personality.

, Common name endings for girls are: a, bell, na, ly, ie, y, line, etc. Common name endings for boys: ob, ab, an, ly, etc. Pick one you like, or make one up!

, If the thing you pick/see isn't a good jumping off point for a name, think of synonyms for the thing.


For example, if you are staring at the moon, think of a synonym, such as “celestial body”, which could become the name “Celeste”.

, You may like the letters “o” and “a”, and could add a “n” and “h” to make “Noah”.


If the name you come up with sounds clunky, add more letters, but don't overdo it.

"
"
Use a name that fits the setting of your story.,
Choose a name that is easy to pronounce.,
Think about how the meaning(s) behind a name could work with the characters in your story.",How to Find Unique Names for Your Characters4," Pick character names that correspond with the world, time frame, and/or country where your story is set.


It will add to the believability of your story if the character names sound appropriate for the setting. For example, a story set in China will likely have different character names than a story set in Africa.
Another technique, used by John Braine, is to use place names from the region or area the story takes place in.

, Most readers don’t have the patience to try to decipher a character name every time it’s mentioned. A hard to pronounce name may also break the flow of the story and take the reader out of the story, rather than immerse them further in it.


Look for names that are easy to say out loud and roll off your tongue.
Avoid using a lot of strangely spelled names for your characters as this could confuse and alienate your reader.

, The meaning of a name could help you connect the name with one of your characters, based on their personality. Think about how the meaning of the name reinforces the character’s personality traits.


You could also use a contrasting name to create some friction between the sound or meaning of the name and the personality of the character. For example, a tough girl could be named Lacey, or a nerdy kid could be named Brock.

"
Create a biography page for each of your characters.,
Add general details about each character to their specific biography pages.,
Describe the physical appearance of your characters.,
Consider your characters quirks and flaws.,
Start thinking more in-depth about each character’s personality.,
Tie the characters deeper motivations and thoughts into their shallower characteristics.",How to Get to Know Your Story Characters1," On each page, create a category for “name,” “date of birth,” “height,” “physical characteristics,” “favorite food,” “favorite time of day,” and so on.;
, Write the name of a character at the top of each page. Fill in the blanks for each character. Note whether each one is a minor or major character, and how they relate to one another in the story.


Draw a family tree if you need help keeping all of the characters straight.

, Don’t forget to include diversity in your characters. Your characters should reflect real life in age, race, sexuality, gender, size, etc.

, Maybe they never shut the kitchen cabinets. Maybe they always hang up before saying “I love you.” Maybe they sing in the car, but never in front of people. Maybe they eat a bit too much cheese, and spend an entire paycheck in the cheese section of Whole Foods.

, What does your character fear? Maybe he doesn’t like spiders, or he’s afraid of the water. What motivates her? What keeps her awake at night? Maybe she can’t sleep because she always dreams of black cats. What makes him cry? What makes his heart stop beating for a moment? What’s his favorite china pattern? What does he want most in life? Where is her favorite place in the world? What medications does she take?

, For instance, what do her scars or tattoos say about her past? Maybe she got a tattoo that reminds her of a favorite pet that died. Why are his eyes brown? Maybe they’re his grandmother’s eyes, and he shares a passion for painting with her. When or why did she decide she liked strawberry-rhubarb pie? Maybe it was her mom’s favorite, who died when she was a kid. Why does she like mornings? Maybe that was the only time she really got to spend with her mom.


Continue to dig. Ask “why” to every characteristic. Why is he afraid of spiders? Why does she dream about black cats? Write down the potential answers on your character’s biography page.

"
"
Write short scenes that involve each of your characters.,
Create an ‘interview’ with your character.,
Create an interesting situation for your character.",How to Get to Know Your Story Characters2," These scenes don’t necessarily need to end up in your story; they are just meant to help you get to know your characters better. These scenes could involve another character asking the character you are trying to get to know about themselves.


You could also create scenes where a character is presented with an interesting situation. Your goal is to determine what the character would do next, given his or her personality.

, One scene you could create is one where you (or a different character) begin to interview the character you are trying to get to know. For instance, you could create a journalist character to interview the character you are learning more about.


Pose questions to your character on paper (either directly or through another character’s voice). Answer these questions in the voice and style of the character you are trying to understand.
Take notes and add details to your character’s biography page as you expand the character more.

, Imagine how your character would react in different situations. What does that reaction tell you about him or her? Include those characteristics on his or her character page. You can use a scene from your everyday life, find one online, or just make something up, such as:


“Your character walks into a bar to find a woman totally naked sitting at the bar. No one is paying her any attention. What does your character do next?”.
Another idea is: “Your character is sitting alone at bench. A car drives slowly by, and something is thrown out of the car. What does your character do next?”
Or: “Your character is alone at night and hears a noise outside. He finds a small kitten sitting on the porch, obviously malnourished. What does your character do with the kitten?”

"
"
Create a list of the characters you'll need.,
Now before you even start to work with those characters think about other people's characters.,
Look back over your first list.,
Make them as real as possible.,
Now put them into the story.",How to Develop Characters," Hopefully you have a basic story idea but if not you know you'll need a lead. What else? A villain? A love interest? A friend? A teacher? The possibilities are endless. As you write you will notice more and more characters that are needed but try to start with at least five.;
, Which ones did you really love? What villains did you despise? Write down (or don't) the good ones. Now write down the lame ones. Look at your lists. Do you see any patterns? What made them all so good or bad? Here are some things to look for:


Are most of them male or female?
Do they share any personality traits?
Do they have similar roles in the book?
Do they remind you of yourself or are they entirely different?
Do you see yourself being drawn to a specific type of character? (e.g. the badass, or maybe the caring friend) OR is it just well portrayed characters you are drawn to?
In order to do what you like you first have to know what you like, so maybe read over old books and make notes of your favorite characters. Pay close attention to their actions, flaws and strengths, how they talk, and how they react when some one cuts them off in traffic. It's all important.

, Now make the characters. Who are they? The lead has to be complex and interesting, likable but flawed, someone you can sympathize with. Sound like a tall order? Don't worry.


Start with the physical looks. It's hard to make a good character if you can't visualize them. Are they tall or short? What does their hair look like? Do they have freckles? Got the picture? If you are a good artist, or even a bad one try to draw them. Look at pictures in old yearbooks. Get a good solid image.
Now work on the personality. Pick three main traits. They can be anything. Keep them in mind as you continue to work with your character.
Think about how they interact with others. Imagine them in an everyday situation, or a chapter of your favorite book. What do they do?

, Think about them all the time. They won't just create themselves.


Give them flaws.
Give them strengths.
Give them annoying little habits. Are they always mussing their hair? Humming? Cracking their knuckles? What usually triggers this, fear or agitation or maybe boredom?
Give them a pet peeve.
Give them a soft spot.
Give them a history. Where did they come from?
Give them a style. What kind of clothes do they wear?
Describe how they smile to yourself. That can tell a lot about a character.
Think about the way they talk.
Give them an opinion about at least five things. Write them down. Maybe they love Honey Nut Cheerios.
Give them hobbies.
Make a list of other characters like them and read up on those characters. What do they like? Does your character share those opinions?

, See how your characters will react to what's going on. Based on the details you've picked out, decide what your character will most likely do.

"
"
Begin by creating the character's personality.,
Create the appearance of your characters.,
Think of creative names.,
Flesh out your character.,
Be prepared to let your characters and their responses surprise you; that's when you know you're really getting somewhere.",How to Develop a Character for a Story," Once that's done, it's much easier to imagine the character and what they look like physically. Take a blank sheet of paper and fold it in half. On one side, write all of the qualities you find good in people. On the other side, write all of the qualities you find bad in people. Use this as a reference for creating both antagonists and protagonists. A protagonist is the hero of your story, and an antagonist is the person who opposes, or is against the main character.


Keep a notebook close, and write down little details about real people. Does your friend have a strange way of twisting her hair when she's excited? Do you notice how your brother has a comeback for everything? These little details make up the character.
Do not make your protagonist perfect. That makes it harder for the reader to relate to them, along with making your story less believable and harder to engage the reader in. Instead, use a mix of qualities from both columns to make a more rounded character. However, make the character 60% good, and 40% bad.
Just as you don't want to make your protagonist the perfect being, you should avoid making your ""villain"" of the story all bad. Use the same method of rounding the character as described before, but instead make your antagonist 60% bad and 40% good.
Create character personalities that are ranging from 90% good and 10% bad to 50/50. The closer the character is to the protagonist, the more rounded they should be. Instead of making the protagonists friends 90/10, try making them 60/40 or 50/50. Once again, they are easier to relate to this way. Repeat to create the antagonists' peers and associates, except making them 90% evil and 10% good, and so on.

, What are the physical features of some people you admire? How about those of whom you don't like too much? Get out another sheet of paper and make another list. Again, use a mix of qualities from both columns to create your protagonist. The protagonist does Not have to be perfect. You could take a fashion magazine and flip through it, noting down facial and bodily features that catch your eye.

, In your notebook, keep a record of names you might like to use one day. These include your friends' names, your relatives' names, and names you spot one day while you're reading or surfing the net. Names like Katie and Joel are common and easy to remember, but you should record names like Arista and Montague, which you don't see very often.


Names should be relevant to the setting of the story. A post-modern Japanese woman would be named Sakura and a teenage boy in Harlem would have a common name, like Tom. Fancy and syllable-heavy names should be saved for Fantasy and Science Fiction Stories, and should be used sparingly.

, If you are developing one very important character, have fun with it! Give your character an entire profile! What is his/her name? Where were they born, and when? Do they wear striped socks or solid ones? Is their hair blue or flame-red? Write down a bunch of these details, even if they may not be necessary for the story. If you are writing a character's personality off of someone you know,keep in mind that the reader doesn't know who you're writing about. Make it so that the reader has a clear picture, and don't leave any important information out! You can't assume that the reader knows the character as well as you do.

, Even imaginary people are resistant to living in a completely determined world.

Create a favicon that represents your website.,
Decide if you want a transparent background.,
Create a favicon that's easy to read.,
Create an aesthetically pleasing favicon.,
Use colors that are cohesive to your brand.,
Consider your audience when designing a favicon.,
Get the opinion of friends and colleagues.",How to Create Your Own Favicon Icon1," The type of website you have should determine the look of your favicon. Try to design something that will adhere to your brand image and that will be recognizable and memorable to people. Your favicon will be the first thing that people see when they look at the tabs in their browser and will also appear in people's bookmarks.

For instance, if you have a food website, choosing a favicon that has a fruit or vegetable as the design may make it more memorable.
If your website is for a law firm or investment company, a traditional and sleek favicon is best.
If your website is aimed towards younger people, try creating a playful and colorful favicon.;
, If you don't designate a background, then it will fill in white, which may not adhere to your brand.A transparent background will take on the color of the person's browser and look more streamlined in some cases. In other cases, having a color for the background will make the foreground letters or graphics pop. Decide what would be the best for your design and keep it in mind as you make it.

The most basic favicon is a 16x16 square and has a background color.

, Because the favicon image you'll be using is small, it's important that you can get your brand across without confusing your visitors. A favicon that's hard to read leaves a negative impression and can create questions in the visitor's mind about the quality of work that you can provide.Overly complex images and logos do not look good when shrunk down to 16x16 or 32x32 pixels.

If your existing logo is too complicated, then you can use tactics to simplify it, so it can be recognizable at favicon size. Use initials instead of showing the entire company name, or design a simple icon rather than using a picture.If you already have a simple logo, you can shrink down the image and set it as your favicon. You may need to alter it before converting it to an icon file.
You can also use a picture of an object that describes your site's overall theme.

, The structure of your favicon is called its form. Favicons typically take on shapes, like a circle or a square. When you design your favicon, it's generally better if it's able to fit within one of these basic forms because free-form shapes can often get muddled or confused at 16x16 pixels. Another important aspect of your design is called aesthetic unity. Aesthetic unity includes the details and sizes of different components in your favicon and how your favicon is balanced. The more uniform the details, the more cohesive your favicon will look. For instance, using different font types or sizes within your favicon isn't pleasing to the eye and can make your favicon look confused or messy.Another example of aesthetic unity is maintaining rounded corners throughout the shapes in your favicon.
A good example of an icon that has changed form is Google's favicon. It has changed from a square to a circle.

, When you create your favicon, you should create it in 8 bit (256 colors) or 24 bit (16.7 million colors) color depth, as this will work on modern browsers.Make sure that the colors you choose can be found elsewhere on your website or are associated in some way with your brand. A favicon with colors that aren't on your website, logo, or applications won't be memorable, and people will not be able to associate the icon with your brand.

Some creative uses of favicon color include GitHub which changes colors depending on your system status and Trello, which changes depending on your background color.
The most common colors used in favicons are red and blue., Other than identifying your brand, your favicon needs to look appealing to your visitors. People with different tastes, interests, and societal norms will look at different iconology from different perspectives. Cultural differences exist within our society and could confuse or repel the audience you are trying to attract.

For example, Mac Os X uses a stamp which is a universal symbol for mail. Using a mailbox would not be as effective because mailboxes vary in different parts of the world., While it isn't incredibly graphically intensive, a favicon is an important part of your brand. For example, think of your favorite websites like Twitter, Gmail, Facebook, or wikiHow, and how much you associate the favicon with the brand. If you don't have a good eye for design, or you're stumped on what kind of design you should have for your site, consult friends who have an eye for design or who work in graphic design.

Ask around in your network of friends to see if anyone can provide design advice for free.
Larger companies have in-house graphic designers that can create the favicon image.

Use photo editing software to create your favicon.,
Resize and save your favicon.,
Combine your files using a converter.",How to Create Your Own Favicon Icon2," You can use photo editing software like Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator to create the image for your favicon. These software applications also allow you to resize and export the image in the right format. Some software allows you to create your favicon by hand.

There are also favicon specific editing programs that you can find online.
Use a search engine and type in ""favicon editors.""
Make your canvas size 512x512 pixels because this number breaks down to most applicable favicon sizes and is still big enough for you to edit effectively.Other popular photo editing software includes GIMP, PhotoScape, and Paint.NET.When using this software, you won't be able to edit the .ico files directly, but you can use .png, .jpg, or .gif files and then convert them later.

, 32x32 px is the size of Windows desktop items while 16x16 px is the size of favicons in your browser's tab.After you create your favicon in a larger format, it's important to reduce its size so you can see how it will look in people's browsers. If it is unreadable or not aesthetically pleasing, start over on your original design. Think about the platforms that your website or application is most likely going to be used on and then create a favicon to cover all your bases.

It's important to note that different hardware and software utilizes different favicon sizes.
Some other favicon sizes include 57x57px for the standard iOS home screen, 72x72px for the iPad, 96x96px for Google TV, 128x128px for the Chrome Web Store and 195x195px for the Opera Speed Dial.If you want to cover all your bases you can create versions of your favicon in each of these sizes.
Save separate versions of your favicon, so you don't lose the work you've done.

, The great thing about .ico files is that you can combine more than one file to create it. This is useful because different browsers and software will want a different sized favicon. To make sure your favicon looks good across all different platforms, convert your files using an online converter. Type ""icon converter"" into your favorite search engine to find free online applications to do this. Save the merged file as ""favicon.ico.""

You can also use a program like GIMP that has a built in feature, or download a plugin called ICO FORMAT to Adobe Photoshop.Create a new folder so you can store new favicons or works in progress.
Type "".ico converter"" or ""favicon generator"" in a search engine to find different tools you can use.

"
Upload your favicon if you're using a website editor.,
Upload the file to your site’s root directory.,
Add the file to your header.,
Refresh your browser.",How to Create Your Own Favicon Icon3," Many website editors come with a built-in form that allows you to upload your favicon to your website automatically. If you are using a website editor that has this built in, look for options that say ""Upload Favicon"" or ""Add Favicon"" in your website's settings menu. Select your favicon.ico file and upload it to your site.If you can't find a place to upload your favicon on your website editor, you'll have to do it manually.

, If your website supports File Transfer Protocol or FTP, then you can use your FTP client to upload your new favicon.icon file to your root(index) directory.If not, then you'll have to go to your web hosts page and upload the image manually. Remember to replace the existing favicon.ico file with your new file., Find the place where you can access the PHP and CSS files for your site. Go to your site's header.php file and edit it. Under the <header> tag type, ""<link rel=""shortcut icon"" href=""<?PHP echo get_stylesheet_directory_uri(); ?>/favicon.ico"" />"". This should connect your site to your favicon.Because you're using PHP, it means that any sites that use your header file will now have the same favicon.

, Once you're done uploading the favicon you can refresh your browser to see your new image next to the address bar. To go directly to an image of your updated favicon, type, ""http://www.yourdomain.com/favicon.ico.""If your favicon does not initially appear, you may have to reset your browser's cache.
To clear your cache, go to your browser's settings and delete your Temporary Internet Files, Cookies, and History."

Make a list of certain traits that make up the character: hair color, eye color, face shape, body shape, etc.,
Decide on your options.,
Study these examples for Emma:


I saw Emma in the hallway.,
Write the description as the character is moving/doing something/as the story still goes on.,
There is also a third option, which is writing it as you go.,
I walked up to Emma, recognizing her from her curvy figure...She looked at me, tears welling up in her chocolate brown eyes as she talked about her mom's death...as we ran down the path, Emma pulled a hairband into her curly hair, and wiped sweat off her heart-face...etc.,
Choose whichever way that works best for you.",How to Describe Characters When Writing,";
, Then, try to think of more descriptive words to describe your list of traits.

, First, you may choose to describe the person plain and simple. For example, if you come up with a list for a character name, oh, Emma, let's say, that list could contain: slender, brown eyes, brown hair, heart face, curly, and long hair.

, She was tall, with long, curly brown hair, and had a heart-shaped face with brown eyes.

, Study this example:


As I was walking in the hallway, I noticed a tall, curvy figure talking to some friends. As a boy would walk by, she would flick her long, curly hair, and would bat her ink black eyelashes, showing off her chocolate-brown eyes.

Start with your character’s face shape.,
Describe your character’s bone structure.,
Describe your character’s eyes.,
Describe your character’s eyebrows.,
Describe your character’s nose.,
Describe your character’s mouth.,
Describe your character’s hairline.,
Describe your character’s body type.,
Describe your character’s posture, body language, and clothing style.,
Fill in the remaining details.",How to Describe a Character's Looks Well," This is important because a person’s face gives a strong and immediate impression of their personality. Is it heart-shaped with a wide forehead and a pointed chin? Is it square with a jaw-line that could chisel granite? Which of these faces might you describe as playful and which might you describe as rugged? As you continue to describe your character, keep in mind that people definitely associate certain personality traits with certain features.

, In particular, we draw many conclusions from a person’s bone structure. High, wide cheekbones can give the impression of apple cheeks and, thus, a lingering smile. Whereas a “weak” chin is associated with passivity, a prominent chin is described as “determined” and might suggest that someone is inclined to keep their chin up. Wide-set eyes are found on most baby animals and have become associated with innocence, whereas deep-set eyes are often shadowed and can be associated with un-trustworthiness or a brooding personality.

, The eyes are the “windows to the soul” and should receive extra consideration. Most baby animals have large eyes and long lashes, making large-eyed or long-lashed people seem more trusting and open. Brown eyes are among the most common and are often associated with a plain, salt-of-the-earth honesty or a chocolate-brown depth and richness. Blue eyes may be thought of as innocent (baby-blue), piercing (icy-blue), or wise (gray-blue). Light-green eyes may seem trusting whereas emerald-green eyes are often thought of as exotic or catlike.

, Since the eyebrows are so intimately involved in facial expression, they also have a huge impact in their resting state. Kristin Stewart’s straight eyebrows give her a perpetual expression of nonchalance, whereas Marilyn Monroe’s high-arching brows add to her look of slight surprise and continuous interest. If the inner half of each eyebrow slants sharply downward, it can create a mischievous look á la Christian Slater or a slight scowl á la Megan Fox. Especially low brows like those of Michael C. Hall (a.k.a. Dexter Morgan) can create a sinister appearance.

, The nose is extremely prominent on the face and can suggest a lot about your character’s attitude. An up-turned nose might be cute and playful like a child’s but can also veer into snobbish territory (i.e. someone who turns their nose up at you). Since noses continue to grow on a person’s face with age, a long nose can suggest an air of wisdom. A pinched nose like Nicole Kidman’s might be cute as a button but can also appear crinkled as if with distaste.

, Like eyebrows, the mouth is crucial in forming facial expressions and is subject to much interpretation. Since people’s lips grow thinner with age, full lips are associated with sensuality. Slightly open lips may seem relaxed or even suggestive (which is why most models pose this way), but a mouth that cannot close (á la Napoleon Dynamite) can give the impression of perpetual stupefaction. A wide mouth is often called “generous” and can convey a sense of openness, whereas a small, narrow mouth (think Hugh Laurie from “House”) may seem reserved or unfriendly.

, The hairline also plays a big part in how we see a face to be shaped. A widow’s peak, which interrupts the forehead by pointing down at the nose, adds an element of intrigue and is the go-to look for vampires. A receding hairline may suggest a loss of virility and earn a derisive title like “Mickey Mouse ears.”

, Are they tall? If so, are they long and gangly or lean and athletic? If not, are they short and squat or petite and elven? Is your character overweight, underweight, or perhaps just sturdily built? What other features stand out? For example, an elongated neck might be graceful and elegant whereas a thick neck or hardly any neck at all might suggest brute strength. Knock-knees may suggest uncertainty or clumsiness, duck-feet might seem to slap around rambling, and slender fingers might convey an artistic inclination.

, All of these things reflect the way a person interacts with the space around them, which speaks volumes about how they interact with the world at large. Does your character slouch with indiscipline or stand tall with certitude? Is their body language lackluster, hesitant, contracted, or expansive? Does your subject wear eye-catching clothing or blend into the background? In other words, does your character fill a room?

, Note the hair and skin color. Instead of using words like brown, blonde, black, red and so on, use words like chocolate, honey-wheat, raven-black, fiery orange. Be sure to identify any unique markings; piercings, tattoos, and scars are very distinctive and tell unique stories about what your character has been through.

Choose an era.,
Choose a race.,
Choose a profession.,
Choose a name.,
Create your appearance.,
Create a background.,
Be creative and not clichéd.",How to Create Your Own Star Wars Character," There are four eras to choose from, each with different periods. These include the Old Republic, the Clone Wars, the Galactic Civil War, and the New Republic.;
, There are many sentient races in Star Wars from Abyssin to Zygerrian. Choosing a race can be hard at first but you can make as many character's as you want so no pressure.

, Your character's profession defines who they are in the galaxy. You could be a soldier or bounty hunter. Maybe you prefer being a criminal, or a power hungry sith?

, Choose a name that's iconic and memorable.

, You can either draw this, imagine it or find an image on the Internet. Make sure you know what your race looks like so you can be as accurate as possible. You can also use a photo editing program (like Photoshop) to adjust pictures to your liking.

, What happened in your characters past that lead to their future? Were they outcast from the Jedi order or maybe a soldier on the run. The stars the limits.

, When creating a character try to stay away from the cliché, especially with their background information. Here's an example of an original take on a new character:

Name: Andros Rehal
Race: Mandalorian
Era: The Old Republic
Profession: Bounty Hunter
Background: Andros Rehal was once a Jedi nearing council status when him and his apprentice, Thrax Megnalx were assigned a mission on Ruusan. A sith lord was trying to corrupt a temple. They traveled to the planet and ventured to the temple where they found the young sith. During the fight the Sith threw a piece of a broken column at Thrax, hitting him and knocking him out. Andros thought he had been killed. He flew into a fit of rage and viciously killed the young Sith, who had begged for his life. Andros left and two days later two jedi were dispatched to investigate their disappearances. They found Thrx near death. They took him back to Dantooine and healed him in a bacta tank. Five months later Andros had been found killing both Jedi and Sith. They mounted an attack party against him. A jedi master, his apprentice and Thrax. They went to Taris where he had been sighted. When the Jedi Master caught up with him Andros sent him into a trash pit. Andros killed the Jedi masters apprentice as well. Andros didn't recognize his own apprentice. He was blinded by rage. He killed his apprentice and only until he got a good look on his still, lifeless body did he realize what he had done. He left Taris and headed back to the temple on Ruusan. He relinquished his powers to the temple's force nexus and went into self exile. He became a bounty hunter and is still connected to the force. That location later became known as ""The Valley of the Jedi"".

Do not describe your characters without letting the story flow!,
Try to be specific on the features.,
Comparing features to food may be good in moderation.,
If you are planning a book with many chapters, make 'day in the life of' chapters for every character and their relatives that appear in the book.,
Check out other people's examples of explaining a character.",How to Describe a Book Character in an Interesting Way," Most people hate long slabs of description. Look at the examples below and see which one you like best. 1- Timmy had dark brown hair, blue eyes and was 4 feet (1.2 m) 2 inches (5.1 cm). Today, he was thinking of running away because he had a math test. 2- Suddenly, it came. Timmy woke up and remembered that he had a math test. Well, there was no doubt about it, but he had to run away. He knotted his sheets together and jumped out the window. As he ran down the street, wind ruffled his dark brown hair and dried out his blue eyes.;
, Instead of saying that Timmy had blue eyes, say that he had sapphire blue eyes, his eyes were like sapphires or that Timmy's eyes were sapphires on his face. The same goes for hair, skin tone etc.

, However, nobody likes hearing about how Timmy's eyes look like kool-aid, his hair looks like dark chocolate etc.

, It is a good way to describe your characters and to add to the story a bit.

, Pick up any book and you'll find either good or bad character descriptions. Try to work out what makes them good, interesting, dull or just plain bad. Once you have got the hang of this in your own mind, it'll not only be easier to spot in other writing but also easier to work out for your own writing. Here's a few examples:


As I walked down the unfamiliar road, I saw a pair of dazzling, vivid green eyes piercing my insides. I stared back at the unknown girl's beautiful features. She had wavy, blonde hair and had a healthy-looking tan.
Joe woke up suddenly, his milk-white face covered with sweat. He had been dreaming a bad dream, and suddenly his bright blue eyes flew open. He spiked his pitch-black hair, wondering what had just happened.
Millie shyly blinked her lovely gray eyes at her strict-looking headteacher. Being new to the boarding school wouldn't be nice with that teacher, she thought, tucking a stray strand of her ruby-red, long hair. She raised a pale-skinned hand at her mother for a last goodbye.
Rosetta woke with a smile in her eyes, which slowly reached her mouth. Her pretty, oval face was a sight for sore eyes; her eyes a pure brown, like the mahogany behind her. She had recalled yet another memory! She slowly slid her smooth legs out from under the duvet, and placed her feet on the warm carpet of her room. She stood up slowly, unfolding her petite frame as she stretched out first her arms, then her neck, her lean abdomen, pushing her slim waist forward as she stood on tip-toes and yawned, highlighting her high cheekbones.

Brainstorm the basics.,
Define the role the aliens will play in your story.,
Consider their physiology.,
Do some sketches.,
Build the society.,
Decide on communication.,
Develop transportation.,
Create individual characters.,
Find problems.,
Create consequence.,
Do not divulge everything.",How to Create Your Own Alien Species," Your alien species will develop and change as you give it more of a backstory, but you have to set some basic parameters to get started. Use a written outline or a quick sketch to get ideas down.Are the aliens going to be human-like or physically different?
Will they have their own language?
Do you want your aliens to be scientifically plausible?
Do they come from a known planet, or are you inventing the planet as well?;
, The aliens you create will have a specific function in your story, and that function may define parts of how the look and act. Think about what role the aliens will play in your story.


Are your aliens going to be your main characters or supporting characters?
Will they be good or evil? Will they be something in between?
Will they be intelligent beings from an advanced society, or will they be primitive?

, Whether you build your story around your aliens’ features or you build your aliens around your story, their physical composition and storyline should work together.Think about what your aliens need. What biological features do they need to survive in your story? If they come from a planet close to its star, for example, do they need thick or plated skin for protection?
Will their physiology create meaningful challenges? For example, will a species with a tail be easier for alien head hunters to catch? Will the species have to find ways to adapt?
Will their physiology create any unnecessary challenges? Look for features in your aliens’ physiology that might make for improbable scenarios, such as a species with gills invading a species on land. Find ways to rework those improbabilities.
Remember, form follows function. A flying alien will probably be very slim and lightly built while a swimming one might be streamlined like a dolphin or shark.
You can also ""reverse engineer"" an alien's habitat and lifestyle based on its looks. So a lanky alien with long arms might live in the trees like a monkey, or one with lots of fin-like crests might live somewhere wet like a lake or marsh.

, Making a drawing can give your imagination a jump start if you're having trouble describing your alien. Even if you are not using images in your story, drawing may help you focus on your aliens’ details.


Try a basic sketch depicting the physical features of your aliens.
Once you have their standard look established, depict your aliens in a few scenes from your story. Seeing how the aliens fit into the events and physical surroundings of the story may help you refine what they look like or how they act.

, The actions of your alien are going to be informed by its social surroundings. You may opt not to create an entire history for the new species, but consider shared values and customs and how they relate to your alien characters.Consider political structure. Is it governed by or separate from religion? Are they autocratic, democratic, or governed by different means?
Are your inherently peaceful or inherently militant? They may be neither, but if they are meant to be truly peaceful or truly warmongering, it will impact how they act.
Think about social stratification. Are there any sub-races within your race? Do certain individuals have greater status based on their families, jobs, wealth, or other factors?
Do your aliens form strong social connections, such as friendship and love?

, There are limitless ways in which your aliens can communicate. They might speak, use telepathy, communicate via scent or body language, or something else entirely.


Establish how your aliens communicate with one another. Do they have their own language? Will they use the same language as the non-alien characters in your story?
If they communicate by telepathy, consider how you will depict the experience. Will others hear a voice in their head, or will they emerge from interactions with an understanding that uses no words?
Decide how your aliens will communicate with other species, if necessary. Will they use translators? Are they multilingual? Will they learn during the story?

, If your aliens are going to an area that is not their home planet, you need to decide how they get there. If others are coming to their world, you need to decide how.


What means do your aliens use to get to one another? If they use locomotion, what type? Do they teleport?
Develop a means of long-distance transportation. How do your aliens get around their planet? How do they get to other planets? Are there specialized vehicles for different purposes?
If your aliens will be visited by beings from other planets, decide how they will react to alien ships. Will they understand what they are, or will they be confused or frightened?
If your aliens are on earth, develop how they got there. If it was by ship, is that ship still present and functional?

, Once you have your alien species developed, you are ready to create the characters that will drive your story.Your alien characters will be informed by the information you worked out, but they need to be individuals. Each alien character should have a distinct purpose that drives the story forward, as well as their own character arch.
Diversify your alien characters. Like people, they should operate in the parameters you set for your world, but they should each have their own personality. What is your character’s social status? What is their emotional range? Do they have any personal relationships?

, Individual characters should have personal focus, as well as a focus on the overall story arc. Create problems for your characters that impact them on an individual level.


Give your character personal quirks and challenges. All of your alien characters may be focused on saving their planet, but is one in particular also having trouble learning to read? Create dynamic characters that are different from one another.
If there is a problem pertaining to the whole species, give your character a personal interest in that issue. For example, if the species is about to fight for their own defense, create conflict by having a character that opposes violent conflict but fears losing family or a loved one.
Make your characters more relatable by giving them small problems outside of the overall story arc. Characters focused on one matter will come off as one-dimensional.

, Give your story depth by creating consequences for your alien characters. They may be positive or negative, but the actions of the alien characters should move the story forward.


Consequences will naturally build your alien character’s story arch. If they invade another planet, for example, will they be welcomed home as a hero or exiled for their destruction? How will the consequences of their actions inform their future decisions?
Create consequences that your audience might not see. Decide if there are major events in the history of your alien species that inform their actions and behavior. Try to use these events to create conflict and depth in your character.

, You want to create a complete world so that you can make compelling alien characters, but your story should be clear and engaging for your audience.


Provide detail that informs specific parts of your story. If, for example, an alien character is stranded on earth, establish how they got there and why.
Avoid putting in too much detail that does not relate directly to the story. Use the details you created to inform your writing, but avoid including lengthy explanations of things that do not make sense of the story or move it along.
You may decide, for example, that your aliens all glow blue in a mostly helium atmosphere. However, if they are never in a helium atmosphere during the story, there is likely no need to include that detail for your audience.

Describe your character’s physical appearance.,
Give your characters physical tags.,
Incorporate fantastical physical traits.,
Choose an interesting name.",How to Create Realistic Fantasy Characters1," You want your reader to create an image of what your character looks like in their mind. Use a lot of detail when determining your character’s appearance, and use physical descriptors that also indicate something about your character’s personality.For example, instead of saying, “He had red hair,” say “He had unkempt red hair that looked as if he’d cut it himself.” In the latter, we know that his hair is messy and uneven from a bad haircut.
In writing fantasy, it’s doubly important to give the reader a good understand of what magical character looks like. Is your character human, or part animal? Are human beings normal in your world, or do they all have pink hair and green skin? Be creative with your characters but always be sure to give concrete descriptions to keep readers from getting confused.;
, When writing any kind of fiction, it’s important to create characters that are distinctive and memorable. Tags are those small physical details – birthmarks, facial features - that set characters apart from each other. Give each of your characters one to three unique tags.Think of the tags of your favorite fantasy characters. Harry Potter is famous for his lightning bolt scar, Gandalf for his long white hair and staff. Try giving your characters a scar or accessory that has an interesting story behind it.
Make lists of various features such hair color, height, skin color, and eye color that you can then allot to different characters to make them unique.

, Depending on what kind of fantasy you’re writing, you may have some characters that do not have strictly human traits. Be sure to provide your reader with a simple and clear description of what your character looks like. If your character is part animal, like a centaur, it is crucial that your reader understands that a centaur is half human and half horse.


Be careful not to make descriptions of fantastical characters too generic. Many readers will know what a wizard or witch looks like. They want to know what makes your version of a wizard or witch unique. Don’t just tell us that your wizard has a wand or a pointy hat. What kind of wand does he use, and what color is his hat?, You want to give your characters names that are memorable, but not too complex. Ideally, the name will roll off the tongue and be unique but relatively simple. Bilbo Baggins is just strange enough to catch a reader’s eye, but also simple enough that it’s easy to remember.


For ideas, try flipping through a phonebook or reading a list of baby names. If possible, use different letters of the alphabet to start your characters’ names so that they won’t end up all sounding too similar.Since you’re writing fantasy, don’t feel like you need to use real names! As long as your reader can pronounce them, make up your own fantastical names.

"
"
Make your characters flawed and complex.,
Give your character memorable vocal traits.,
Subvert your reader’s expectations.,
Figure out what motivates your characters.",How to Create Realistic Fantasy Characters2," When reading fiction, readers want to follow characters who have some sort of need, goal, or conflict. Don’t make your characters perfect. Instead, have them struggle to reach success because of an inner character flaw. Give them some emotional issues that they have to overcome over the course of the story. In choosing a specific flaw for a character, try giving them a few emotional imperfections or some sort of troubling secret. Perhaps your character has a long lost childhood love or a dark past involving crime.
One way to show your character’s flaws is to have them make bad decisions. Getting your character into trouble generates conflict and helps hold a reader’s interest.

, Dialogue is one of the best ways to show a character’s personality. Use distinctive vocal characteristics such as accents, use of slang, or vocal tremors to make a character unique.


Give your character an accent to show where they’re from. For example, a character from Germany will have a different way of speaking from a character from the deep South.
Consider age when writing dialogue. An older character will have a much different speech pattern from a teenager.
Use or invent slang. Make up slang that fits in with the world you’re building. In Harry Potter “mudbloods” is a term that refers to wizards whose parents are non-magical. You can make up universal slang or dialect, and you also can have specific characters use slang terms., Don’t fall into the trap of making your characters clichéd. Try instead to continuously subvert your reader’s expectations by giving your characters unexpected personality traits or having them make surprising decisions.


For example, make your villain have a soft spot for baby animals or an unquenchable sweet tooth.
Since you are writing fantasy, you can subvert expectations by making popular fantastical figures such as elves, wizards, witches, or vampires have unusual tendencies. For example, you can have an elf who hates Christmas, or a wizard who desperately wants to become an investment banker.

, Determine what factors influence your character’s thoughts and actions. Often motivations are grounded in the emotional. Establishing a clear motive will help you to generate conflict and plot arc.For example, perhaps your main character’s child was kidnapped, and now he/she must get the child back.
The motivation doesn’t have to be too dramatic. Maybe your character simply wants to tie their shoe and in the process falls into a pothole that sucks them into a magical world.

"
"
Consider the environment of your story.,
Create secondary characters.,
Establish a society.",How to Create Realistic Fantasy Characters3," For your characters to be believable, they need to live within a well-crafted universe. To start building your world, figure out what you want the physical environment to look like. Do you want your story to take place in a medieval time period with castles, or do you want to create a whole other planet with a yellow sky and red water? Take notes on physical descriptors that will make your world stand out.


Think about flora and fauna, what creatures live in the world, if there are seas or forests, color of sky, the type of air, natural landscape, and cityscape when creating the details of your world., Not every character in your story can have a star role. To make your world believable, you need a cast of filler characters who can take up the jobs and residential roles that make a society function. You can’t have a world full of only dragon slayers and knights in shining armor. You also need cobblers, tailors, merchants, cooks, and children.Part of what makes a series like the Lord of the Rings so interesting is the enormous cast of characters. There are elves, dwarves, hobbits, wizards, and more. Try adding many different kinds of characters into your world to keep your reader engaged.

, Consider how the society in your story functions. Is there are a specific system of government? Is money the standard currency, or are transactions made with chocolate or pine cones? What kind of law enforcement exists, if any? Your society can have any rules that you’d like, as long as they have consistency. This way, your characters will have a functional home that will strengthen their personality traits. "

Start with a simple profile including these categories: Name, Age, Gender, and Occupation.,
Choose a good name.,
Create a longer profile.,
Make a more developed personality.,
Add Tweezer into a plot.,
Continue developing characters until your story is finished.",How to Create Good Personalities for Your Characters," All of these categories will affect your character's choices. Fill it out, starting with the protagonist of your story. As an example, we'll use: Jack, 15 years, male, gang member. Jack's age, gender, and occupation all affect his personality. Notice how you quickly assume that he's a troublemaker who drinks and deals drugs and such.

, Names can affect a character's personality, and Jack will probably have a nickname. Let's try Tweezer. How do you think Tweezer the gang-member compares with Jack the gang-member? For example, a fantasy story will sometimes have characters with names from Greek mythology, 'Demetrius' for example. Sci-Fi stories will have characters with techno names, such as the word 'Techno' itself. However, be creative and don't merely mimic the custom for the genre in which you're writing.

, Create a background for Tweezer, how long has he been in a gang? Why did he join the gang? What are his desires? What are his fears? What are his goals? Environment and events shape our personalities, using these tools will help shape a personality.

, How has his background affected his personality? Has he lost a loved one, resulting in him joining the gang? Possibly he joined so that he could get tougher, and protect those he loves. Think up some major flaws that possibly came out because of his backstory. Use those flaws as you write. Memorable, unique, and relatable. Those are the key characteristics of a good character. This can be developed alongside the history/backstory.

, Think of a beginning, and an end. Think of an antagonist to go with Tweezer, and make him as similar as possible, with key differences. They could even be so similar as to have been friends, were they in the same gang. Develop more characters as you go. Make them as human as possible. The name of the game here is relatability.

, Keep going through this process until you've created, for example, Tweezers leader, best friend, a possible love interest, and other important members of the gang. Do so for any rival gangs, and other big characters such as Tweezer's parents. (Be less specific, the less important a character is).


Remember that character balance is important. Creating specific types of characters will show how Tweezer would interact with them and thus, change the overall tone of the story itself. Character balance also means not having specific characters in specific places or situations. And it also means taking one type of character and putting him in multiple scenarios. For example, a happy perky girl coming from a rich family, as opposed to a girl with the same personality coming from a poor family. Things like that help to contribute to the characters and thus, the story. Feel free to experiment with character balance and see what you can come up with.

Determine how your character looks.,
Give your character a distinguishing physical mark or trait.,
Decide what type of clothing your character wears.,
Come up with unique names for your characters.,
Base the appearance of your characters on real life people.",How to Create Characters for a Story1," One of the most direct ways you can build up your characters is to develop their physical tags or markers, such as how they look. Creating specific and distinct images of your characters can help the reader get a better sense of how they appear to themselves and to others.For example, in the Harry Potter book series, the character Hermione Granger is described as having buck teeth and bushy hair. This indicates to the reader that perhaps she is not a well put together person or could come across as a nerd. This is in contrast to another character in the series, Minerva McGonagall, who is described as having square shaped spectacles and always wears her hair in a tight bun. Minerva then comes across as more put together and severe than Hermione.;
, Another way to distinguish your characters is to give one character, perhaps the main character, an unique physical marker or trait. This can help the reader to remember the character better and also tell the reader more about the character and the story. The more specific the physical mark or trait is, the more memorable it will be to the reader.You could give your character a physical mark like a scar, a tattoo, an item of clothing that they never take off, or even uniquely colored eyes. You could also give your character a physical trait like a limp, a missing limb, a missing sense (such as blindness or deafness), or a positive physical trait, like beautiful hair or clear skin.
For example, in the Harry Potter book series, the main character, Harry Potter is given a very distinct marking, a lightning shaped scar, that later has significance in the plot of the story. As the novel’s main character, Harry Potter remains unique in the reader’s mind as the boy with the lightning scar.

, Imagine your character opening her closet or getting dressed to go to school or work in the morning. Does she wear jeans or slacks? Sneakers or heels? More feminine clothing or more masculine clothing? Maybe your character has an item of clothing she always wears everyday or neglects to wear an item of clothing she is supposed to wear, such as a school uniform or a work uniform. Focus on concrete details of her clothing, from her pants to her bag, to help create an interesting character for readers.Clothing can also signify certain traits or qualities in a character in the world of your story. For example, if your novel is set in the world of wizards, you may create a system where wizards of a higher stature wear a certain robe, hat, or carry a different colored wand than wizards of a lower stature.

, One of the most distinguishing characteristics of your characters are their names. Coming up with an interesting name for your character is not too difficult in the current age due to name generators you can use online. However, you should also choose names that seem to fit your character’s personality and your character’s background.Try to use character names that are different from each other and start with different letters. For example, rather than name one character Robert and another character Rita, maybe name one character Robert and another character Mona. If you are writing about a family and part of the story is their love of names that start with “M”, you may name all the characters different names that start with “M” to illustrate this.
You should also try to match the character’s name to the ethnic background of the character. If your character is Irish, for example, you may choose an Irish name. Or if your character is a second generation Mexican, for example, you may choose an American name, as the character’s parents may have chosen an American name to assimilate into American culture.

, One tactic to help you build characters for your story is to think of people you know in real life and then use their physical traits to help you create a character. For example, if you are writing a story about a grandmother, you may use your real life grandmother or a friend’s grandmother as the inspiration for the character.You can also use physical traits from certain people you know or strangers you observe on the street and compile them together to create one character. Think of a physical trait that you have always been interested in or fascinated by and try to explore it through your characters.

"
"
Give your character an accent.,
Create a vocal tic for your character.,
Note if your character speaks differently based on the setting or situation.",How to Create Characters for a Story2," Distinguish your characters by giving them accents that indicate to the reader where they come from or where they grew up. A character who is from South Boston, for example, will have a different manner of speaking than a character who is from Paris. Think about how your character might speak on a day to day basis and how you can represent their dialogue on the page.This may mean your character clips certain words, such as “sayin’” instead of “saying” or pronounces words differently than others, for example, “dawg” instead of “dog”.
As well, age can be a factor, as older characters may use different terms or phrases than younger characters. An older character may not be as aware with Internet speak as a younger character who is on her phone texting and surfing the web all the time.

, A vocal tic is different from an accent in that it is a quality of speaking that the character has created for herself or that has developed due to a physical or mental trauma.Your character may have an issue with certain terms or phrases due to a mental trauma and avoid saying them or replace them with different words. Or your character may be unable to use certain words due to a speech impediment or another physical impediment. For example, maybe your character is blind and has difficulty describing colors. So she will describe colors differently or use other terms for colors in her dialogue and description.
Your character may also choose to replace certain words or terms. Many teenage characters do this, where they replace more adult terms with their own terms. This is often specific to the world of the story and the mindset of the character. For example, in the Harry Potter books, humans are known as “muggles” and are referred to as “muggles” by different characters.

, Another way to build character is to consider if your character might speak differently around certain characters or in certain situations. This switch is known as code switching, where a person adopts different manners of speaking to best express themselves based on their audience. Your character may do this as well and you can use their code switching as a character trait.For example, if your character is a young Black man who is trying to get into Harvard, he may code switch and use formal English when he speaks to the Harvard application committee. He may then speak in slang or street language when he is hanging out with friends at school or at home with his family.

Determine what motivates your character’s thoughts and actions in the story.,
Identify the character’s emotional triggers.,
Write characters who challenge the reader’s expectations.,
Allow your characters to make bad decisions.,
Interview your characters.",How to Create Characters for a Story3," Character motivation is a big part of building an engaging character your readers will want to follow and get to know. Strong character motivation can also help you set high stakes for the story and allow you to get a better sense of your character’s arc. Your character’s arc is the journey your character will take as she tries to achieve her motivation.Your character’s motivation could be as simple as passing a math test or as complex as saving the world from mass destruction. Once you identify your character’s motivation, you can then build the rest of the story from there. Your main character’s motivation may be challenged by the story line or by other characters in the story, leading to drama and action in the story.

, An emotional trigger is a life event that has significant meaning to the character and changes the character. Think about what your character’s emotional trigger or triggers may be in the story. This trigger can act as a motivator for your character or act as a major event that then triggers change in your character.Some emotional triggers for characters include the moment of greatest fear, the moment of greatest courage, the moment of greatest sadness, the moment of greatest joy, the moment of deepest shame, or the moment of deepest guilt.
Though these emotional triggers may seem extreme, placing your characters in situations where they must confront their emotional triggers will make your story feel engaging and dramatic. It will also help you create characters who have strong opinions and strong emotions, which are often what help readers connect to characters in a story.

, Avoid falling into cliche character development and seek to instead surprise your reader completely. Play against type and give your characters surprising traits that will throw the reader off balance, in a good way.For example, maybe you are writing about a villainous mob boss. Give him a surprising trait, like an undying love for kittens. Or, maybe you are writing about a single mother, who takes care of her children and is also a bare-knuckle boxer. Work against stereotypes so your characters feel interesting and three dimensional, rather than one note or cliche.

, Often, characters who make poor decisions or take the wrong actions are more engaging than characters who always do the right thing. Don’t be afraid to let your characters do the wrong thing or choose the ill advised action. Lowering your character’s inhibitions can help to create stronger characters, leading to conflict and tension in the story.For example, maybe one character who has always been faithful to her partner has an affair, or maybe one character speaks without thinking in a meeting and offends her boss. Think of the moments where your characters make mistakes or act on a false assumption and lean into that to create stronger characters and a stronger story.

, Once you feel you have a strong sense of the characters in your story, you can check your knowledge by doing pretend interviews with each character. Create a set of basic questions, such as “What is your name?” “Where are you from” “What motivates you?” and fill them out as each one of your characters. If you have created well rounded and engaging characters, the characters’ answers to the interview questions should reflect your hard work as a writer."

Decide what type of story you're writing.,
Decide on the basics of your character.,
Determine your character's basic personality.,
Get deeper into your character's personality.,
Sprinkle in some negatives.,
Think of how you would talk to your character if you were around them.,
Write a scene with your character.",How to Create and Develop an Original Character," Is it fantasy? Historical fiction? This can influence your character a lot; even if your character has traveled back or forward in time to access the story's universe, they'd still probably be very mired in their old ways and get confused with the differences in the culture and the time period.;
, What's their name? What do they look like? How old are they? What was or is their education like? Who is their family, and what is their family like? How much do they weigh? What distinguishing features does your character have? Get to where you can picture what they look like in your head.


Among the basics would be things such as if your character is disabled or LGBT. However, when approaching these topics, be very careful if you have no experience with it. When creating disabled or LGBT characters, do plenty of research before writing something that may make you seem ignorant or offensive.
Make sure that the character's appearance makes sense for their universe and hobbies. For example, a professional fighter wouldn't have long hair that they never pin back, due to the fact that it can be easily grabbed and put them at a disadvantage. In a real-world setting, nobody can have bright pink eyes, or have red or purple eyes without certain genetic mutations (such as albinism) or contact lenses; genetics don't work that way. And if your story is taking place in a realistic world, Alexandria's Genesis isn't real, so no using that to justify your character's purple eyes!

, Are they cheerful and perky, or are they gloomy and sullen? Are they withdrawn? Enthusiastic? Studious? Callous? Come up with the basics of your character's personality to get a rough start on how they'll look in your story.


With this, you may also want to determine your character's interests and hobbies. Are they a computer programmer? A violinist? A dancer? A writer? A chemist? A mathematician?

, Ask yourself some deep questions about situations that can help you determine your character, such as, ""What would my character do if his mother died? What would he do if he met a long lost family member? What would he do if confronted by a bank robber? If someone held a gun to his head?"" These are the kind of questions you should ask, and write the answers down. By now, you should have a good idea of your character's personality.

, If you make your character too perfect, people will think that your story is too boring. You can't have a tall, thin, handsome, strong, honest, thoughtful and intelligent character if you want the character to sound real. Reveal a flaw, such as a drug addiction or the fact that he's too proud. Put in some complications!


Be careful not to make the flaw something that causes no actual trouble in the story. For example, if your character is shy and clumsy, these are not considered true flaws if all they do is get the character to land in the arms of their love interest. A true flaw would form as something such as, ""Clara is so shy that she can't bring herself to say what she truly thinks, and this lands her in trouble when her friends do bad things and she can't speak up"", or ""Fernando is clumsy, and this ends up causing problems when he trips and drops a candle onto the curtain of the hotel he works at, causing a fire and serious injury to those around him"".
Don't introduce too many flaws to your character. If your character's description is, ""His parents died when he was little and it left him traumatized, and his foster parents lock him in the closet when he does anything wrong even just by a little bit, and he's ugly and socially awkward and nobody likes him, and he's terrible at everything he tries to do"", nobody will be able to relate to your character, and may just find him annoying and whiny.
Be wary if you decide to introduce flaws to the character such as drug or alcohol addiction, mental illness, or disability. More often then not, this is not handled well, and makes it seem like addictions can be ignored with the wave of a hand, like mentally ill people are violent and uncontrollable, or like disabled people can't do anything on their own and must rely on everyone for every need they have when it's not justified (e.g. someone in a wheelchair who has no communication problems relying on others to communicate). These things must be researched carefully, or else you may end up offending readers.

Try checking out How to Write a Disabled Character for more information on writing disability such as mental illness, autism, or so forth.



, Think about his hopes and dreams, their fears, their memories. You can also consider trying to answer questions as your character, which can help to ""put you in their shoes"" and get a better way of seeing the world through your eyes.

, If you're struggling for an idea to write about, search for an idea generator and pick one that sounds good. Make sure to show how your character reacts to given situations, not just tell. This can help you get a feel for how well-developed your character is, and if you need to go back and touch up some parts of their personality. If they are reacting to whatever's going on in the story, you're off to a good start.

The difference between showing versus telling is that when telling the reader about a character, there's no evidence to back it up (e.g. ""Jenna cares about people.""). When showing the reader, there's plenty of evidence to back it up (e.g. ""Jenna reached over to wrap her arms around the shaking, crying child and held him in her arms, gently murmuring to him, ""It's okay. Nobody's hurt. Everything is okay now.""""). Generally, you want to show, not tell, for better writing.

"
When you are first creating your character, do the personality first.,
First, make a sort of generic outline of your character.,
Next, make sure your character has some flaws, a perfect character is not interesting, they are just plain boring.

,
Then, elaborate the outline.,
When picking traits, make sure they never contradict what another is.",How to Create an Interesting Character1," That way you can see what the rest of your character will become. Plus, it is easier to pick a name with everything else out of the way.;
, EX: Funny, Smart, Clumsy, Loud, Outgoing.

,, EX:


Funny when around the people who they are more comfortable with, Smart in writing, but horrible in science and math, Has two left feet, Can never be outspoken, Always has to have the last say, Bold with friends, but shy around others. Lets people walk over them; doesn't stand up for themselves. Has a very low self-esteem.

, Don't make one trait Happy and then another Depressed all the time. Unless you do a person who puts on a happy face but when in reality is very depressed on the inside. Then, that would be okay.

Don't be deceived, your characters will control you if you don't know how to control them.,
You have to know someone very well before you can tell exactly what they would do when faced with a situation, Right?,
I take a character, sit them down and ask them questions: “What would be your reaction if some called you ugly?,
Say we have a character named Harold.,
If you're stuck trying to create a certain character, keep your eyes open wherever you go.,
When writing with a character, don't forget that they have needs and desires just like you.,
Characters respond to physical trials as well as emotional.,
For an example: sometimes 'Harold' will get angry.,
The key to a good character driven story is in creating characters whose actions are consistent with their personalities, and therefore easy for your reader to identify with.",How to Create Lifelike Characters," Characters take on their own personality the more you work with them and put them in real situations. They will occasionally stick out their tongue, jeer at you, and mock you for the reactions you force them to make. “Come on, I'd never do something like that! You're writing it out all wrong!” So how do you work with a character and control them? There really is no magic answer to that, so let me just share with you a bit of what works for me.;
, You can't honestly determine someone's actions by glancing at them, and you would have no clue whether or not they would delight in conversation, or ignore you. To know a character, I start out with writing his biography. Begin with the basics: name, age, gender, purpose, personality, background and looks. You will think of more to add later on as you develop your character. You'll want to have this for reference when you're writing something about a character. So that you wouldn't tell the reader sometime later that one of your characters has brown eyes and red hair, while at other times the story says he has blue eyes and blond hair.

, Would you get angry or just ignore them? What would you do when faced with the death of someone close to you? Etc.” Sometimes I write down the whole history of a person, just so I can know how they will respond to emotional and physical tests. I do this judging how I want my character to act, whether I want him to be rude, friendly, odd, etc. I keep in my mind what I want my character to be like, then I go back and build a past for him that helps me understand the reasons for his behavior. Every person has dreams, goals, troubles, weaknesses and strengths. The way they react to their circumstances, the way they accept faults, they way they keep on going forms their personality.

, He has suffered an abusive childhood and over the years he has grown bitter, resentful and doesn't communicate well with people. He would rather keep to himself than meet new friends. When you get to know why he is the way he is, you will realize where the attitude is coming from and have a better understanding, or rather relationship with him. (Yes, you do develop a relationship with your character—it happens.)

, It's always good to observe real people and transform them into characters. I have used countless people I have seen or met at the grocery store. I was eating at a restaurant not long ago, and I noticed an Indian man sitting at one of the tables with his friends. He was rough looking, had long, black, greasy hair, and really dark skin. I stared at him occasionally, and even though I think I made him angry, I got a good idea of what I wanted one of my characters to be like. Though he may not have been rude or mischievous like I thought he looked, he still conjured up a great personality to work with.

, Whether or not you decide to fulfill their needs and desires is completely up to you, but don't forget to mention the suffering your characters go through -- how hungry they are, how thirsty they've become, how much pain and suffering of a long journey, etc.

, They can get grumpy, rant, cry, run off, or stoically endure the problems that they encounter through the story. Just don't forget that the characters suffer for the things you do. Not that that's a bad thing. It's actually good to bring out their attitudes, as it makes them more real, and allows your readers to empathize with them.

, It may build up inside of him, and fester for weeks. The reader can tell by Harold's actions that he's mad, though he may never say anything and doesn't blow up. Finally, he can't take it anymore. A simple question or a suggestion by someone sends him on a rage, and he explodes. Emotions can be a lot stronger than physical actions, but it depends on how you use them.

, You can build much more lifelike characters by observing real people, giving them a past, and placing them in situations that bring out what's inside of them. Construct a foundation for your character and you'll be amazed by what they will build for you.

Decide which genre your character will be in.,
Answer the following questions: What is this character's purpose in the story?,
Decide what purpose your character serves.,
Make sure not to make your character do something they would not want to.,
Give your character some basic attributes.,
Delve into your character's past.,
Allow the character to grow and develop as the story progresses.,
Show, don't tell.",How to Create Characters," Is it fantasy, action, comedy, etc.?;
, Why is this character needed in the story?

, Are you creating a main character or a supporter? The object of affection or a despised enemy to a main character? By deciding what role your character plays in the story beforehand, it is easier to create a personality to fit that role.

, It would make your story seem off. For example, if your character was very trusting, would he/she investigate the strange man who came to town from the forest? You may be thinking 'My story won't work if he/she doesn't investigate the man!' Maybe you can find a way to make it work, or maybe you will even spin the story into another, more exciting direction.

, This will be the skeleton for your character's personality. What does this person look like? How old are they? Where did they come from, and how were they raised? What are some of their likes and dislikes? Think of your character as someone you've just met and are trying to get to know better. Try to make their attributes relate to their role in the story; for example, a villain likely would not have a nice attitude about other people. Use a character's attributes to tell the reader something about who they are. This doesn't have to be very personal or in-depth. After all, the character isn't a day old! Also, even if you are not making a comic, if you have some skill in drawing, it helps to draw your character to further visualize him or her. If you are not confident in your drawing skills, ask an artsy friend for help.

, What made them what they are today? Is there some deep dark secret that the character feels like he has to hide? Was the character born into extraordinary circumstances or did she/he have a normal childhood? Create a biography for your character and get as in-depth as you like with this. You can even write short memory scenes for your character. Don't hesitate to add to this character's experiences even as you're writing the story. You may find that, for your character to react the way you want him/her to in a situation, something must have happened in their past to garner that reaction. It's OK to change your character's personality to suit the story. Just make sure to go back and change anything that would be extremely out of character given his/her altered personality.

, The events in your story all add to your character's experiences and memories and will have an effect on their thoughts, actions, and attitude. For example, if you have a very lonely downtrodden character who is shown a shining instant of human kindness, the character's attitude will change, at least temporarily.

, Use the character's actions and dialogue in your story to reveal them to the reader instead of just bluntly stating what they are like. Dedicating an entire paragraph of a story to describing the character's personality and appearance causes your story to sound stilted and disrupts the plot; instead, make character development an organic part of the story.

So, you want to make the character's looks somewhat coincide with the personality.,
You can choose a hair color, but keep it reasonable with your character.,
When you are looking for the right eye color, think about what the color says to you.,
For the way their body is built, base it around the personality.",How to Create an Interesting Character2," Like, one trait said smart in writing, but not in science or math. You could make your character look somewhat like a bookworm.

, Along with the height and weight. But, remember that you must make the height and weight believable for the gender and the age.

"
When picking the gender, it is simple.,
Picking the age might not be hard, but then again it might just be.,
Next, think of where you want your story to take place.,
Now, thinking of the right setting in which you character is going to be placed should pop into your mind the right age.",How to Create an Interesting Character3," With what gender you think is the best as your main character, choose it.

, For some personalities, they can be from 13-18, others are 22-30. Try to narrow it down by choosing if they are in high school, college, or have already graduated.

, If it is in an office building, you don't want your character to be 10. Just like you don't want your 22 year old character playing with children's toys.

, If later down the road as you are writing your story you decide that you want to change the age, that is okay. Just make sure you are not going from 18 to 28 because you might have to redo the story. It is best if it were in a 1-2 year difference range.

"
"
When you are finishing a character, you must name them, obviously.,If you are looking for a specific meaning, go to Baby Name Addicts

,
A lot of people go for the generic last name like: Jones or Gates or something along those lines.",How to Create an Interesting Character4," A first name says it all.

, The last resort is to use a last name generator. But, don't use it too often because they reuse a lot of the names over and over again and you don't want to seem like a copier.

Have a notebook for keeping track of your ideas.,
Watch people everywhere.,
Keep track of names you find appealing.,

, At the playground, the office, the grocery store, etc. Listen to how they speak, how they act, watch their body language and how they look. If you find any interesting ideas, write them down before you forget.

, Sometimes just a name can spark an idea for a character. At the same time, try to find memorable names, ones that are easy to remember. If you have a really long name, at least try to create a nickname. This makes it easier on your readers/viewers, and for you. You can look at the credits of a movie for good ideas.

, Keep track of their name, age, personality, likes and dislikes, and everything in between.

, How they talk, walk, their actions and how they might react to different characters.

Consider the genre.,
Understand your audience.,
Read other stories featuring animal characters.,
Determine the role of your character.,
Choose a look.,
Consider the character’s personality.,
Determine unique qualities.,
Name your character.,
Define the character’s goals and dreams.,
Give them a history.",How to Create an Animal Character for Your Story," Knowing what genre your book fits into, be it science fiction, mystery, drama, etc., is an important consideration when creating an animal character for your story. Although characters don’t have to fit the exact mold of that genre, it may seem misplaced or odd if, for example, your animal is a fish who lives in outer space.


Brainstorm what special characteristics your character may have, based on the genre. For example, if the story is science fiction with a lot of fight scenes, your animal should have paws in order to hold their weapon. A snake would, therefore, not be a sensible choice, but a dog or a cat could work well.
For historical fiction you may even want to research the types of animals, which were popular or present during that time. If you are writing about the Jurassic Period, a dinosaur may make sense, but if your story is set in the Stone Age, suddenly, T-Rex seems out of place, unless of course he’s a time traveling dinosaur!;
, As important as it is to consider the genre of your story, it’s equally important to understand the audience. What may work for one audience, say adults, may not be appropriate for others, such as children.


Your audience should play a role in determining potential designs and details. Keep it fairly simple for children. You don’t need to feature a character who super nuanced unless you’re appealing to an adult audience as well., While you never want to copy or plagiarize the work of others, it can be helpful to read the work of others and try to think about whether or not that character works.This will ultimately help you when creating your own character.


Try stories like The Jungle Book, Watership Down, Charlotte's Web, The Tale of Despereaux, The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, Bunnicula, or your favorite story featuring animals.
When reading the story, ask yourself: Does this character work? Does he seem real to me? Why or why not?

, Whether your animal character will be the hero or the sidekick, it’s important to determine his/her role in your story. In doing so, you’ll be able to better define and shape the animal moving forward.


Think of the characteristics which define an animal in this particular role. For example, if they are the sidekick, but are always saving the day for the hero, think of how this will shape their persona.
Consider whether your animal character will be living amongst other animals (Mickey Mouse, for example) or if they will be working alongside humans (think, Scooby Doo). If, for example, your character is living independent of humans, they may be able to walk and talk and take on other human-like characteristics. However, if they exist in a human's world, their role would differ dramatically, as they may still have animal characteristics and wouldn't be able to talk or wear clothes.

, Based on everything you determined in the previous steps, it’s now time to have some fun and choose how your character should look. How will you describe your character? Consider everything from the color of the character, to their clothes and accessories.Accessories should be an important consideration.Is your character well-read? Maybe he has reading glasses or a monocle.
Gender and height are just another dynamic in creating a look. Try taking a normally small creature and make them big.

, Thinking back to the role of the character, consider how that would affect their personality. Is your character’s personality larger than life because they are the hero? Are they the shy, but inwardly brave sidekick?


Write down words that describe your character’s personality. This will come in handy when introducing them to your audience, but could also be incorporated into their name.

, What makes your animal character special? Do they have certain qualities, which help to shape who they are? For example, your character may be able to read minds or fly. Perhaps they are a math whiz or a scientific genius.


Be creative, but consider how their unique qualities tie in with everything else you’ve already determined.
Don't fall into stereotypes, as that only produces boring characters.It's up to you to break the mold and to give your character qualities that will set him/her apart.

, Now that it’s time to bring your character to life, start by giving them a name. They are, after all, a unique being with their own personality, look and qualities. Shouldn’t they have an equally awesome name?


Consider using their unique qualities when choosing a name (think, Mighty Mouse).
Speaking of Mighty Mouse, alliteration can be a strong tool when naming your character. Many iconic characters, Mickey Mouse, Daffy Duck, etc., have made good use of alliteration.

, Part of bringing your character to life, entails giving them a future or something to work towards. Think of Wile E. Coyote. His goal in life was to catch that pesky roadrunner. Regardless of how it turned out, the audience had an expectation for Wile, because they knew what he was after. Your character's goals can shape his personality,so don’t miss this important step.

, Similar to their goals and dreams, a character should also have a past. This not only helps to define who they are today, but gives the audience something to sympathize/empathize with.


You don’t have to dwell on the character’s past. Bambi is a good example of this. Ultimately, his sad past helped to shape him into the confident and courageous leader that he became. However, his past wasn’t necessarily the theme throughout.
More than anything, the fictional characters that you create need to feel like real, living creatures to the readers."

Come up with the motto of the superhero alliance.,
Name your alliance.,
List the members.,
Think about their base, headquarters, and safehouses.,
All the members' personal lives should be discussed.,
Determine the relationships.,
Name a country or a city in which the alliance is mainly based.,
Define the relationship of the alliance with the government, army, navy, air force, and other major national institutions.,
Make the villains.,
Add some more spice.",How to Create a Superhero Alliance," It is one of the most important elements. The aim of a team is the character of that team. Any character or characters' issue-dependent opinion may differ with that of the decision-making authority or government, but the motto stands universal, to give justice or to kill crime or to save the globe or something similar.;
, The name must fit with the motto of the alliance. You may give it a big name and use it's abbreviation, as this will add more attraction. The abbreviation should sound crunchy.

, Decide which characters will be the founders of the alliance. Choose a leader as well; he or she should show leader-like activities.


If you have not designed your superhero characters, then design them first, as they should be compatible to uphold the motto of the alliance.
If you have already designed some characters, then at first make an incident where they'd meet and think of forming an alliance. Then, you may add suitable characters as you create.
If you have such characters that are to work individually, you may reveal those characters occasionally in your team, as they are co-operating just for a mission.

, You may have one of the bases at space, one underground, etc. You have to keep in mind that the safehouse should have facilities, but not as refined as the base.

, Try to relate them with your real life. You don't have to tell all the histories at your publication. Instead, you may describe them as the story progresses. You have to figure out which of the members are full-timers and which ones act when a threat comes.

, The relationships between all the members are one of the determining points of your story. Individual opinions of characters may make mental distances and crack the unity of alliance. You should figure out who loves whom, who is competing with that person, who has an ego clash with whom, which characters are friends, and so on.

, It may be a real country, real city, or fictional country or city. You may also make them based in a high facility space station, or at any other real or fictional planet.

, Maybe the government is friendly with them, maybe the navy head has an ego problem with them, etc. The team may be under cover or they may work secretly. If the allegiance are threats to the law, you may make police looking for them.

, This is one of the most important parts. You may make a villain's alliance if you wish. However, you have to figure out the type of the threat the villains pose and why they're doing it. Make their weak points. Think about how your story will end, for instance, how the superheroes will fix the threat.

, Bring something special. It may be a weapon of mass destruction or a special gem, a brand new facility headquarters or a new alien. It will complete your story.

Give your superhero a trademark.,
Name your superhero.,
Decide if you want to give your hero a sidekick.",How to Create a Super Hero," Since super heroes are generally identified by their powers, it makes sense to think of the powers first and then shape the character to fit them. A huge number of superpowers have already been claimed by other characters, so try to come up with something unique.You can also consider giving the hero multiple powers, like flight and super strength. Coming up with a mix of powers might help differentiate your new hero from other ones that already exist.
Some superheroes don’t have supernatural powers and instead rely on gadgets and training (ex. Batman and Black Widow). Others specialize in a single weapon or fighting style; these heroes’ dedication commands respect, but also makes them more susceptible to other attack styles, which in turn makes them more vulnerable—and possibly more interesting.;
, A tragic or “fatal” flaw is essentially a character trait or quality that your hero grapples with on a regular basis. An invulnerable hero can get old fast. By giving him or her a fatal weakness, you make battles more interesting and make fans more invested in the character.For example, Superman's weakness was kryptonite, while Batman’s tragic flaw was his obsession with seeking justice after seeing his parents murdered. Flaws or weaknesses can be emotional or psychological, or they can be physical., Your super hero might have two separate identities: his everyday identity, and his hero identity. These two lives might entail separate personalities and traits. Work out what traits your hero possess in each form.Clark Kent, Superman’s daytime identity, is a quiet, careful, nerdy guy with glasses. But, as we know, he can morph into Superman and has super powers capable of fighting terrifying villains. Superman’s personality differs from the personality of Clark Kent. If you plan for your hero to have a secret identity, or to be an “average Joe” to the general public, negotiating between these two sides of the character can add dimension and make him more interesting for readers., It’s doubtful you’ll be able to find traits or powers that haven’t already been taken by someone somewhere, so just be sure to tweak it enough that you don’t directly rip off another character.


For example, if you want to give your hero Superman’s powers, give him a different name and a different backstory. That way, your hero is different and original.

, If you’re creating your own superhero, you are probably pretty familiar with the standard traits and qualities of popular superheroes. Rather than making yours just like the ones that already exist, break the mold and try to be original. Give your hero a unique combination of powers or traits.


You can be original in all aspects of creating your superhero. Maybe your hero’s power puts him at a disadvantage, rather than an advantage. Maybe your hero discovers he has these powers, but then ends up too scared or nervous to use them for good.
Use popular superhero characters as reference points. When you think of a traditional hero, what comes to mind? How can you make your hero different from these tropes?

, In the superhero world, backstories are often called origin stories. They offer insight into the life your hero had before he really became a hero, and even how he became one. This story will give us a look into the more “human” side of your hero, and make him a more sympathetic and relatable character.Many superheroes have tragedy in their pasts that led to an urge to enforce and serve justice. Bruce Wayne saw his parents murdered, and Peter Parker lost his uncle. These tragedies served as motivation for pursuing their powers (both supernatural and not).
Conflict and inner-turmoil can help shape the character and their story. When coming up with their backstory, think about conflicts or problems they may have faced that shaped them into the hero they are now.

, Once you’ve determined your hero’s backstory, you know whether or not he was born with the powers he has, or if he came into them later in life. Deciding how he discovered or came into his powers is an important part of his story and who he is.


Consider some questions: what was the character’s initial reaction to his/her abilities? How long did it take before the character had second thoughts? Have the powers become necessary for survival? Does your superhero try to use those powers as little as possible? Is (s)he proud or ashamed of these abilities?
Make the superpowers a journey in and of themselves. A character who has a static relationship to his or her own abilities won’t generate a lot of interest. Some trial and error, or even some internal conflict with how to use the powers are both good options.

, Some superheroes are disliked or feared by the communities they exist within. Batman and Spider Man, for example, were both seen as menaces initially, before the community came to see them as helpful. Decide what kind of relationship you want your hero to have with his community.


Anti-heroes like Deadpool and the Suicide Squad are loved by many comic book readers and movie-goers alike, even if they are disliked or feared by their communities. Taking this approach with your superhero could be a fun experiment in storytelling and character evolution.

, Any good superhero needs a villain or two to fight against. Flesh out the enemies the same way you did the superhero. However, don’t answer too many questions about the villains right off the bat. Taking time to reveal their backstories, true natures, and motivations will make them more engaging and mysterious.


The central villain’s backstory could possibly weave in with the superhero’s, even if the hero doesn’t know it. Your hero can ultimately find out about their connection as his story unfolds. This adds new layers to the story and the characters. For example, Luke Skywalker eventually found out the bad guy was his father—that complicated things a bit.
People love a good villain. Whether it’s to place blame on the evil-doer, or to better understand their own innate fascination with the motivations behind people who do bad things, people are usually very interested in the villains of superhero stories. So, creating one can be a great step to take when coming up with your hero.When creating your villain, consider making him a foil, or the opposite of, your hero. For example, maybe his particular superpower directly conflicts with your hero's power(s). This will immediately give the two a reason to be at odds.

, Superheroes come in all shapes, sizes, and genders. Some are not even human at all. Decide on the physical traits of your superhero. The superpowers you have chosen might even help you determine the character’s physicality.


Consider some questions: is your character a tank? Would a lithe and lanky build be more appropriate? Is the power gender-specific?

, Make sure the colors, style, and accessories are all appropriate to both the character’s powers and personality. Consider the central weapons your hero might rely on, and if your hero might have a signature weapon they created and use.


Consider color when designing a costume for your hero. Think about what certain colors often imply. For example, white can sometimes imply an innocence, or godliness, while black might be more associated with darkness or bad guys., A symbol or logo, for example, makes superheroes more memorable and helps make their costumes complete. Think of the big “S” on Superman’s chest, and the skull painted on the Punisher’s shirt. A catchphrase might also be useful, but remember to make it catchy, not long or cheesy.


If it’s appropriate for the character’s power, you might also want to give him or her a trademark pose. Of course, the most important trademarks of all are weapons, vehicles, and other useful tools. Be sure to name these items and give them a special place in the story arc.

, The name of your superhero will essentially be the “hook” for getting people interested. Of course, it’s the stories and character traits that make people love the superheroes, but it’s their names that are memorable and make the reader interested in the first place.


Consider trying a few different naming techniques. There’s the noun + noun technique, in which you use two nouns and make a compound word for a name, like Spider Man. Or, you can try the adjective + noun technique, like in Superman and Black Widow.A name can have something to do with the hero’s powers, or even something to do with their personality and who they are. Since you’ve already thought out their origin story and what powers they have, these things should help you come up with a good name.

, Also, you might consider making your hero part of a team. Think of well-known teams and pairings like the X-Men, Justice League, and Avengers. They often come together as a team, but also have separate stories of their own.


Develop the sidekick/team the same way that you’ve developed the superhero thus far, then create a backstory as to how they met or came together. Consider these questions: is the sidekick/team useful or do they make lots of mistakes? Were they once enemies? Were they scarred by the same event? Is (s)he a sibling or friend? Did the superhero meet the sidekick/team by resurrecting them (or vice versa)?

Build up to a showdown between the hero and the villain.",How to Create a Perfect Villain," In a traditional story, the hero is the good person, the one a reader or viewer will root for. The villain is often portrayed as the bad person, representing evil and darkness in the story. The struggle between the hero and the villain sets up the major conflict in traditional stories, with the hope that the hero wins and the villain fails.Keep in mind villains are often more terrifying and memorable to readers if they are multi-dimensional. Often, a villain who is as developed and detailed as the hero in a story will keep the reader engaged in the conflict and build tension. Taking the time to craft a well developed villain will only help your story become stronger and more memorable.
Avoid using an abstract concept, such as a disease, a war, or a corporation, as a villain. Abstract villains are often too vague and general to elicit much emotion from your audience. If you do want to use an abstract concept, relate it to a particular person or being who will act as the villain in your story., To get a better sense of how you can create a perfect villain, you should read examples of villains who are popular among readers. For example:Dr. Moriarty from Sherlock Holmes by Sir Arthur Doyle.
Satan from Paradise Lost by John Milton.
Count Dracula from Dracula by Bram Stoker.
Sauron from The Lord of the Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien.
Voldemort from the Harry Potter series by J.K. Rowling.

, Once you have read several examples of villains in literature, you should consider how the author crafts their villain. You should also think about how certain villains are similar to one another and how they differ.


You may ask yourself, How does the author characterize the villain? Does the author use physical and emotional characteristics to describe the villain? How does the villain interact with the hero of the story? What is the role of the villain in the story?
For example, you may think about how Tolkien’s Sauron is considered representative of all encompassing evil in The Lord of the Rings. Sauron is characterized by his power over the all seeing eye, which sees everything in Middle Earth like the ultimate Big Brother.
In contrast, Doyle’s Dr. Moriarty is a criminal mastermind who tries to outsmart using intelligence. Tolkien’s villain uses magic and Doyle’s villain uses intelligence, but both villains push their respective stories forward into conflict.

, To help you get inspiration for your villain, you may a person who already exists that you find terrifying or scary. This could be your older sibling, a family friend, or a celebrity. Using an existing person as a model can help make it easier to then add or subtract elements to create your own fictional version of the person.For example, maybe you create a villain based on a famous dictator, like Mao, or a villain based on your scary Aunt Edna. You may exaggerate some of the real life details of the person to make them appear more threatening or intimidating. Maybe you give Aunt Edna a physical trait that is scary, such as a glass eye or a facial scar. Or, maybe you exaggerate her personality, making her meaner and more aggressive.
You may also look into historical figures who have been known as villains, such as a serial killer or a political figure. You could then add details to the historical figure to make them appear more villainous.

, You can get a better sense of the villain by defining her by her key character traits. These could be simple one word descriptors that help you paint a better picture of the villain and her goals once you sit down to write the story.Try to think of character traits that are more than just “evil” or “crazy”. Look for character traits that will define your particular villain and make her more than just a one note character. For example, you may write down, “attractive”, “powerful”, “jealous”, “intelligent”, “manipulative”, and “quiet”.

, Many of the more popular and successful villains in literature have engaging backstories, where they have a history of bad deeds due to a pivotal event in their lives. Determining what event or moment made the villain turn dark can help to create a more fleshed out character. It also allows you to avoid creating a one dimensional villain who only appears evil for evil’s sake.For example, you may have a villain who witnessed trauma at a young age, such as violence, abuse, or abandonment. Or, you may have a villain who stumbled into a bad situation and made a poor moral judgement. This may then have lead the villain down a dark path.

, Add to the villain’s backstory by outlining her bad deeds. This may be a progression of smaller bad deeds to bigger bad deeds, or one or two awful things done within a certain period of time. Try to be detailed about these deeds, as this will help you build the villain into a living, breathing character who nevertheless makes choices and decisions just like everyone else.For example, you may list bad deeds done by the villain, such as hurting specific characters or killing someone. You may also note how these deeds were done. Maybe the villain got his henchmen to kill someone or personally hurt specific characters in vindictive and sadistic ways. These dark things could then trigger the hero to go after the villain.

, Good villains will cause readers to question their own moral judgements as they may end up sympathizing with the villain, despite the bad things he has done. A villain who is sympathetic and evil is way more interesting than a villain who is just pure evil, as readers will be quick to dismiss him and unable to relate to him. Giving your villain humanizing traits will prevent him from becoming a one-dimensional character.For example, you may have a villain who cares for his children and is a good father, despite his secret life as a serial killer. Or maybe have a villain who spares an innocent bystander, despite his evil master plan to take over the world.
The villain Satan from Milton's Paradise Lost is portrayed as a fallen angel from heaven who is an outsider and an outcast. These qualities are humanizing because most of us can relate to the feeling of being isolated or rejected in our own lives. This makes Milton's portrayal of Satan more sympathetic and nuanced.
Adding in details that make the villain human will also allow your story to feel more developed and well-rounded. A good rule of thumb is to make sure your villain is as detailed and defined as your hero. This way, the showdown between the two of them at the climax of the story will feel that much more exciting and engaging.

, This may depend on if you are creating a villain for a genre story, such as a fantasy story, or if your story is based more in reality or the thriller genre. Your villain may have special powers or abilities that allow her to get a leg up on the hero and do incredible feats of evil. Giving your villain a specific power or ability will deepen her character and raise the stakes of the story.For example, maybe your villain is a genius mad scientist who uses this scientific abilities to create an evil monster. Or, maybe your villain has the ability to access dark magic, which then allows him to wreak havoc on a peaceful land.
You may want to consider giving your villain powers or abilities that run counter to your hero’s powers or abilities. For example, maybe your hero is brilliant at a specific form of good magic, which runs counter to the villain’s skills in dark magic.

, Once you have given your villain a convincing backstory, you should think about the nature of the conflict between your villain and your hero. This will allow you to add to the villain’s character and get a good sense of the villain’s motivation as a character. Outlining their conflict will also help you structure the rest of the story, starting from the beginning of the conflict and building up to the showdown between the villain and the hero.For example, the villain may desire powers that only the hero can access. This may then lead to the villain seeking out the hero and plotting to control the hero for her own uses. Or, maybe your villain can only achieve her goal by taking something from the hero. She may then pursue the hero and hurt the hero, leading the hero to retaliate and fight back.

, One way to characterize the villain in a scene so she stands out is to give her a distinct voice. Think about how the villain might speak to others in a scene or to the hero. Maybe the villain has a unique perspective on a situation that comes through in the way she speaks.Ask yourself, Does the villain have an accent when she speaks? Does she use different wording or phrasing that indicates her evil nature? Many villains will speak with menace and use words to manipulate weaker characters. Maybe your villain is skilled at wordplay and uses words to confuse or trick other characters.

, To give your villain purpose and meaning in your story, you should map out his master plan. Doing this will also allow you to structure your story around the villain’s master plan or factor in the master plan when you are thinking about how the hero will move through your story. Most villain’s have elaborate plans with an ultimate goal or endgame. Defining this will also ensure your villain appears determined and motivated in every scene of your story, as he has a clear purpose or goal.For example, your villain may have a master plan to use science to create a monster that will wreak havoc on the city and allow him to take vengeance on those who have wronged him in the past. This master plan may then have several parts that you will need to show your reader so they get a sense of the villain’s plan.
Your villain may also work more in the shadows or pull strings behind the scenes, moving one step ahead of your hero. You may integrate his master plan into the larger story by having the hero discover clues of the plan, leading to the ultimate showdown between the hero and the villain.

, A perfect villain requires the ultimate showdown between good and evil. Your story should have a plot outline that builds up to a face off where the villain and the hero battle in some way. This should be the high point of conflict and tension in the story, where the villain finally unveils his true intentions to the hero.Your villain and your hero may battle through a game of wits or a battle of magic. Or, your villain may set a trap that your hero must survive or a test that your hero must solve. Make sure the showdown is full of obstacles and difficulties created by the villain so the stakes are high for both the villain and the hero in your story.

Open a blank document on your computer or whip out a piece of paper for notes.,
Think of their age.,
Think of their background.,
Think about how the events In their lives have changed them.,
Think about their family & parents.,
Also think about they treat their peers; Are they nice?,
If you're stuck, maybe put your character in a certain situation like a robbery or an earthquake and see how they react.,
What possessions do you characters love most?,
Next, think of their values.,
Start writing.",How to Create a Highly Detailed Character Profile," Start with a name, make sure it suits their culture or nationality (e.g. a Gothic character could be called something like Arachna Vladimir if female, or Hellebore Natrix if male). If you cannot think of your own names, search the Internet for some suggestions.;
, Think of their birth date, It might also help to think of a death date.

, What country did they come from, & where do they currently live? Any past trauma's such as-death of a parent, raped, viciously attacked, abused, unloved, abandoned by parents & left to care for themselves, or maybe even something worse?

, Maybe it turned them Into a quiet, emotionally distant goth/emo? Or maybe an alcoholic? Its up to you!

, How did their parents treat them? Were they an outcast from the rest of the family, or were they just like everyone else? Did they have brothers or sisters? If so, how did they get on? Did they have vicious fights, or were they all sweet & nice?

, Aloof? Mean? Mysterious? Does their rough childhood (if they had one)cause them to be cruel to animals, for example? How your character reacts to others can speak volumes to your audience(i.e, saying 'Lauren avoided the park because the thought of the children on the playground repulsed her,' is much more interesting than 'Lauren disliked children').

, Do they snivel and cower in fear? Do they wrestle the robber to the ground, or are they the robber? Do they help rescue people from the wreckage of the earthquake? Do they start looting the abandoned stores and shooting the bystanders? Remember, actions speak louder than words.

, Maybe it's that hunting knife they got, or that ugly shirt their boyfriend bought them for no reason. Or maybe it's their pet goldfish Sparky. And what do they have with them in their pockets; lip balm, a Swiss Army knife, a shiny rock?

, A value is something that they believe in strongly, like 'Money is the best thing in the world'. And, if you want deep characters, give them conflicting values. Say our friend Bob believes that nothing is more important than his disabled dog, Nemo. That's great, but not much of a story. But let's give him another value, like nothing is more important than money. Now we have a story; Bob loves Nemo, but his vet bills are just too much for Bob. What does he do? He can't get rid of Nemo and he can't continue paying this much. Maybe he takes a second job. Or starts robbing people. Or pretends to be blind and begs on a street corner in his spare time.

, Add as much description as possible, don't use the basic words like 'nice', find an alternative such as 'wonderful.'

Decide on the basics, such as name, age, hair colour, eye colour, skin colour etc.,
Give them a bit of personality.,
Develop plot line techniques; i.e what happens to them in your story.,
Give your character some background.",How to Create a Likable Character," This step is important as how readers imagine the characters to look can sometimes increase the character's popularity. We root for a pink-haired small girl who people bully because she's different. Are they attractive, cute, or child-like? Perhaps comical-looking? Decide on a specific look for your chosen character.;
, To make a character likable there are many personality traits you could choose from: sweet, funny, sarcastic, trouble-making, brave. All of those can be twisted to make a likable character. The likable personality traits are obvious: sweet, caring, kind. But sarcastic and trouble-making can make for a very likable character, especially if your other characters adhere to the rules or are part of a world where such behavior is unsightly. Remember, your character won't appeal to every reader, but so long as there are elements which the reader can empathize or sympathize with they will stick by them until the end of the story.

, Try creating a funny character who has something tragic happen to them. This generates a lot more sympathy for the character so it comes as a bigger shock if they die etc. Another technique is a dumb villain; i.e. villain thinks he's an evil genius when in reality he messes up constantly, giving the character a vulnerable element. Another approach is making your character either cute or child-like throughout the story, i.e constant damsel in distress, but suddenly they could become brave and show some backbone. There are several avenues you can take; it all begins with your initial character. It's more difficult to make a villain likable than the hero, but with a background we may sympathize with, we can learn to at least understand the villain. This leads on to the next step.

, So, you've got your good-looking character called Ziggy who is idiotic and claims to be an evil genius, but in the story messes up all of his evil plans. This makes a likable character. Of course this is a more clichéd approach to it - if you want a realistic character you should take a more three-dimensional approach. Instead of Ziggy being arrogant and thinking he's brilliant and super evil, there could be a reason behind his evil ways. Abandoned as a child? Never knew how to love? Adding background like this can add yet more likability to your character.

Do your research on mermaids.,

What do you want the mermaid to look like?,
What's the mermaid's personality?,
How does the mermaid react under pressure?",How to Create a Mermaid Character for a Fantasy Book," Don't stick with modern-day images of mermaids in Disney movies; those mermaids are tame in comparison with the possibilities. Wikipedia's mermaid piece is a good place to start. Here you will discover that mermaid lore can be found all around the world, in the Ancient Near East, in the British Isles, etc., and in many famous pieces of literature.

, This is not for the sake of copying; rather, it is about getting as full a comprehension as possible of how mermaids have been represented in literature through the ages. In itself, there might be ideas from your readings that you'd like to explore further; for example, perhaps you'd like to write about the new adventures of a mermaid character originally from an old legend, to see what she might be doing in modern times (given that many writers assume mermaids to be immortal). Weaving the legends surrounding mermaids into your writing can be a great storytelling device too. The more that you know and understand mermaids, the better.

, Will she be:


Loving, caring, peaceful?
Heartless, cold, remote?
Vengeful, with some plot to seek revenge on a lost love?
Naive but charming, clumsy but cute?
Thoughtless, as in the mermaids said to forget that humans cannot breathe under water?
As ancient as time itself or very modern?
Subject to another's will or subject to her own?
A mixture of differing moods?

, There is no need for your character to conform to modern depictions of mermaids. You are free to make her in form that you like. You might even consider crossing legend types, such as a mermaid vampire, or a mermaid wereshark.

, Is she a Starbucks style mermaid, all sleek and modern, or is she a Botticelli mermaid from times long passed? The possibilities are endless, and your mermaid doesn't need to even keep with one style but can evolve throughout your story.

, When you have a good idea of how your character looks, what her personality traits are, how old she is, etc. find a good ocean-associated name for her, or just find a name as suitable as needed. Some good ocean-associated names might include:


Shell, Mishell, Coral
Seah, Siah
Selkie
Oceania, Oceanie
See Sea Names for more ideas

, When writing, the plot can often influence some elements of your characters. Your story will certainly have some impact on the strengths and weaknesses of your mermaid character, so take this into consideration as well. The rest is up to you, to take your mermaid where she hasn't gone before!

, Traditionally, mermaids are depicted with long, flowing hair, bit you could really go all out and give her a bob or a pixie cut. You could make her a bit of a rebel.;
, Is she carefree, laid-back and easygoing? Or is she a mermaid-to-human shapeshifters, paranoid and terrified that someone will discover her secret? Alternatively, you could make her struggle to appear as human as possible.

, To really flesh out your character, run her through tests: all sorts of sticky situations. Let's say she's a shapeshifter and she grows a tail every time she touches water. She's just fallen overboard- she's fine, but the other people on her boat are getting worried. What happens next?

(If your Gemsona is a Crystal Gem, then you'll have more creative freedom.) Gems already shown, mentioned, or depicted in-series are:

,, Gems tend to have interesting, even cool, clothes, but they're not terribly elaborate. Have a fair level of practicality in mind, especially if your Gem is a soldier or warrior. An aristocratic Gem might wear something more elegant.


Gems typically have their physical gems located in a place that subtly signifies something about them. Pearl's gem is on her forehead, reflecting on her logic and intelligence. Garnet's gems are on her hands, showing her inclination toward action and that she can be rash. Lapis Lazuli's gem is located on her back, showing that she is looking ""back"" at her Homeworld and wants to go ""back"" there.
A Gem's clothing also reflects upon their personality. Garnet wears a plain full-body jumpsuit, showing that she's straightforward and to-the-point. Amethyst wears casual looking clothes, showing that she's not so serious about things. Rose Quartz's long white dress resembles a wedding dress, pointing to her maternal qualities as well as her beauty.
Is your Gemsona a fusion? If so, how stable is she? What Gems have fused to make her, and what are they like?
How tall is your Gemsona? Is she child-sized, average human height, or nine feet tall? (If she's a fusion, she'll be even taller.)
If your Gemsona is a Crystal Gem, incorporate a star somewhere in her outfit. Every Crystal Gem has at least one star on her clothes.

, You can use any weapon, really, since the series shows everything from gauntlets to battle axes. Note, however, that no Gem shown yet has had a modern weapon, so avoid things like guns and grenades.


Some Gems have secondary abilities that can be used in combat (or not). Garnet has future vision, Pearl can project holograms from her gem, and Rose Quartz has healing tears. The series has also shown Gems with powers related to cold/ice and heat/fire, as well as electricity, water, and plant life.

, Gems, like humans, can be benevolent or callous, wise or reckless, friendly or cold. Some important things to consider include her attitude toward humans and the Earth, as well as whether or not she partakes in human activities, like sleeping and eating. Note that each Crystal Gem has been shown or implied to have some element of pain in her past. If your Gemsona is one of the Crystal Gems, remember that she went through a war at one point and has faced any number of traumas in her thousands of years.

, Compare your Gemsona to the Gems shown in-series. Is there anything about her that contradicts what the show has revealed about Gems? For instance, it's unlikely that she'd be as friendly with humans as Rose Quartz; Rose Quartz's love of humans has not been seen in any other Gem. If she's a Pearl, she must have been a servant or intended servant at some point. Try to make your Gemsona mesh well into the world of Steven Universe.

Keep details to a minimum for supporting characters.",How to Create a Good Character," Major characters need to be defined to some degree as soon as they are introduced in the story. If your reader can't picture the character, they will lose interest. Before you start writing, make a list of the basic physical traits and circumstances relevant to your character.


Define the physical traits of your character that you would like to know as a reader. What is your character's gender, age, ancestry or race, and general body type?
Determine what your character's life circumstances are. Is he poor? Does he have children? Where does he live? What is his occupation? Even if you don't explicitly state some of these traits in your story, it will help you develop your character to know at least his basic characteristics.;
, This is one of the best ways to make a character seem real to the reader and make him stand out in your story. If you think about it, everyone you know well probably has a few idiosyncrasies or odd habits; in order to seem real, your characters should be no different.Your character's quirks do not have to be central to the story you tell, but they should not be too strongly contradictory to his personality, nor should they distract from the primary plot.
You can use your imagination to create idiosyncrasies of your character, or (even better) you can draw inspiration from those around you.

, In order to be interesting to the reader, your character should be one-of-a-kind. For one thing, the reader needs to be able to easily distinguish your main character/hero from others in the story. More importantly, the reader will not be interested if your character is bland and has no remarkable traits.Brand your character as an individual by contrasting his major personality traits with his surroundings or with other people in the story. If your story's hero is kind and compassionate but lives in a society where most people are selfish and cruel, he will stand out to the reader.
Conflicting traits can help to establish your character as both unique and one that avoids overused clichés. For instance, you make your character both soft-spoken and short-tempered. As long as the traits are believable, your reader will be intrigued by this unexpected element.
Your character's uniqueness should serve the story's purpose. Don't make your character so strange and unpredictable that he can't believably handle the events in the narrative.

, Characters who seem real are often the most captivating, and real people are not perfect. In order to be relatable, give your character some imperfections that the reader can believe or identify with. For instance, you can create a character that is outgoing but also insecure about his appearance.Character flaws can be minor or significant, but if you choose to make your character significantly flawed, this should become part of his journey. For example, if your main character is schizophrenic, you shouldn't ignore this trait in your story; it should be addressed somehow.
Minor flaws that serve the purpose of making your character relatable should be realistic. Don't give your character both a Ph.D. and an IQ of 70.

, A good character has to need or want something in order to be a believable protagonist. Desire creates conflict, because any deep-seated, burning drive to accomplish something will realistically be met with some resistance or difficulty. This is the life-blood of most stories: the character's struggle.Rather than explicitly stating your character's ambition(s), have this come out organically in the story. It will be much more compelling to the reader if they discover that the character wants nothing more than to be reunited with his estranged brother rather than if you simply stated this fact.
Keep in mind that your character need not necessarily be fully aware of his own desires or needs. If part of your character's struggle involves learning things about himself as the story progresses, then you have created an interesting character and story.

, This also serves the purpose of creating a character to whom the reader can relate. Many of the best heroes in literature and film are those who must overcome hardship or trauma in order to succeed in their quest. Vulnerability in your character makes his perseverance all the more impressive and exciting to the reader.As an example, perhaps your character has a fear of swimming after nearly drowning as a child and later must save his own child from being swept away in a flash flood. In such a scenario, your character's own phobia increases the tension (and potential triumph) of the moment.
Some story arcs can revolve entirely around a character's vulnerability. Whether this is a secondary or central feature of your character's personality is up to you and should depend upon how you want your story to unfold.

, Stories told in writing have the significant challenge of creating characters that are memorable even without being accompanied by a visual. If you are writing a novel (and especially if you intend to create a series), your character must be memorable to the reader in order for him to stand the test of time.Use ""tags"" to identify your main characters. Tags can be any remarkable physical feature (such as Harry Potter's lightning-shaped scar and round-framed glasses) or the way a character speaks (such as the high-pitched, hiss-like voice of Voldemort). These help your reader identify and remember your characters.
If your story involves an ensemble of characters, the need to establish them as memorable and distinct becomes even more important; otherwise, you risk confusing your reader.

, A character who can be summed up within the first few pages of a story is boring. Captivate your reader by creating a character that is much more than meets the eye. You can accomplish this by addressing the following for each main character in your story:Establish your character's purpose in life. What are his reasons for doing the things he does?
Define your character's methods. How does he react to dangerous, frightening, or stressful scenarios?
Form your character's judgment. How does your he evaluate situations, perceive people, and judge his own situations?

, In most cases, characters should not be space-fillers; they should always fulfill the dramatic needs of the narrative. This is especially true of your main character(s), around whom the story revolves. When creating a good character, make sure his traits facilitate the storyline you hope to achieve.For example, if you want to tell the story of a warrior who saves a city from its tyrannical leader, your character should not be elderly, crippled, and meek -- unless the purpose of your narrative is to tell how such a character could accomplish such an unlikely feat.
It is useful to outline your story's plotline before establishing its characters; this way, you can avoid creating contradictory details in the two. An exception to this would be if you have a powerful inspiration for a character before you know what story you wish to tell about him.

, It is not believable to have a character who is impervious to the things that happen to him. For instance, a regular kid who gets sucked into a world of gang violence should be intensely affected by what he sees. Make your character real and believable by molding his personality to the events that take place around him.

The depth of the experiences you create to shape your character is up to you. Keep in mind that the more significant the events, the more complex should be their impact on the character.

, Good storytelling involves some degree of subtlety. It is often more powerful to divulge information about a character's personality by putting him in a revealing situation than to simply describe those traits. The reader will be more intrigued by a character if she figures out things about him without being explicitly told.The key to successfully doing this is to be very intentional in describing how your character deals with a given situation. How a person responds to a house fire says a lot about who they are.
You don't have to use Die Hard-level action sequences in your writing to do this. If your character is the protagonist of an emotional drama, you can still use action-packed scenes to convey things about your character (such as a hospital room where your hero's mother is dying).

, Character development is as important as anything to creating a compelling work of fiction. The best way to ensure that your reader can follow (and believes) the journey of your character (whether metaphorical or otherwise), pay careful attention to the sequence of events in your story. Don't have your character do things that don't fit his personality or abilities without logical steps to precede them.It is okay for a character to develop in unexpected ways, so long as this development is not illogical. Readers like to be surprised, but not cheated!
It is important that your character learn from his mistakes and figure out how not to get burned by the same situation twice. If your character keeps doing the same thing over and over, the story will become stale fast.

, Nothing kills the flow of a story more quickly than the discovery of an inconsistency in the plot or a character's background. In order to avoid making this mistake as an author, keep a file (written or digital) containing all the important information about your characters as it comes up. This will help keep you from making a claim about your character in Chapter 11 that is directly contradictory to something you wrote about him in Chapter One.To maintain consistency, refer back to your database of character facts any time you bring up something significant about your character's past or his beliefs.
This tip is especially helpful when authoring a series of related stories with the same protagonist or for novels that are very long and/or have a lot of characters.

, The main character(s) of your story should be portrayed in ways that make them likeable to the reader (for example, possessing nobility or strength of character).In most cases, you'll also want to provide the most detail (including physical description, background, and divulgence of personality traits) for these character roles.


Protagonists don't need to be perfect, and can even be obviously flawed or weak (these are known as ""antiheroes""). The point here is that you don't want to make your main character contemptible, or you risk losing the reader (who likely won't enjoy following the exploits of a character she detests).
There might be situations in which you want to leave certain details about your protagonist out until later. Indeed, the most interesting characters typically can't be summed up in a single paragraph. Just make sure you don't provide more description for a side character than your protagonist.

, Not every story will include a love interest for the main character, but if yours does then you need to give a decent impression of this character's appeal. This can take many forms, but the reader needs to be able to understand what it is that the protagonist likes about him or her (or how the person makes your main character feel).As with your protagonist, the 'love interest' character should be likeable and usually deserves a fair amount of description and attention.
The amount of detail you provide for a main character's love interest should depend to some degree upon his or her relationship to the protagonist. For example, if he or she is the main character's spouse, it makes sense to divulge more to the reader than if he or she is just a stranger on the train.

, For a villain to be truly frightening or loathsome, there must be a bit of mystery surrounding his origins, motivations, or true nature. Much of what makes a good villain comes from his unpredictability and lack of redeeming qualities; both of these things rely in part upon the reader's inability to see too deeply into your villain's mind.Many good stories involve plot twists toward their ends that reveal something profound about the villain's past or personality (think Darth Vader in Star Wars or Professor Snape in Harry Potter). This is a good reason to keep certain details about your villain a secret until the proper moment.
Use imagery to portray your villain how you wish him to be perceived by the reader. This can be done through his physical features, mannerisms, speech, the settings in which he often appears, and various other forms of imagery. Be creative in how you convey to the reader what's in your mind!

, Supporting characters can be important to your story, but the amount of description you devote to them should be proportionate to their role. For instance, don't spend two pages discussing the back story of a character who never again appears in the story. On the other hand, a ""sidekick"" could end up being your second most important character.As with most rules of thumb for writing fiction, there are exceptions to this. For example, perhaps a character your protagonist doesn't know will end up being important to the story's climax; this is fine, so long as it is believable and fits your storyline.
It is important to make sure all your supporting characters actually serve a purpose in the story; otherwise, they are just space fillers. Your reader doesn't want to try to distinguish between 40 characters who may or may not be relevant to the narrative.

It may be an apartment in Paris, or a parking lot in Poughkeepsie, New York. This not only sets the stage for your character, but will help define him, her, them etc. as well.

,
If you're at the point of creating a character, chances are you have at least the idea of a plot/story in mind.


If you're creating a grand, sweeping narrative such as The Lord of the Rings, you will need an entire world of characters—some good, some evil, some male, some female, or whatever other gender comes to mind and even some that are neither good nor evil, neither male nor female.
If you're creating an introspective story, you may not need more than a single character.

, Unlike what first comes to mind when you think ""character,"" not every character in a story is human. For example, in Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, the mountain Caradhras functions as a character, filled with a cold malice, whereas in Hemingway's ""The Old Man and the Sea,"" a marlin is one of the main characters.

, Who you need depends on your story, of course, but by starting with broad criteria, you can start to make decisions that will gradually define your character by reduction, much like the sculptor removes all the excess marble, revealing the statue buried within it. A pattern includes a culture and the individual traits (common/everyman or heroic, tyrannical, superman or ogre).


You'll likely want a protagonist (hero) and antagonist (villain), as conflict is the basis of plot. Maybe you need a secondary character such as a henchman, a best friend, a romantic interest, a sidekick, or a significant other. Note that sometimes, what you think of as the protagonist—the good guy—is painted as the antagonist. For example, Kong in King Kong.
You might need anti-heroes, like Clint Eastwood in Pale Rider; sympathetic ""villains"" such as Lennie Small in Of Mice and Men; wild cards like Jack Sparrow in Pirates of the Caribbean; a femme fatale (an irresistible woman who leads her man into greatness, difficulty, danger or disaster) like Jessica Rabbit in Who Framed Roger Rabbit; treacherous friends like Iago in Othello or Petyr Baelish in Game of Thrones; or perhaps a trickster guide like Smeagol in Lord of the Rings. Each of these characters began as archetypes, and then became more defined as the stories were fleshed out.

, Once you have your character's archetype defined, you can add traits and features, remove things the character is not, and generally start to reveal the sculpture buried in the marble. Ask yourself what you want your audience to feel about your character: love, pity, revulsion, compassion—or nothing at all. Begin to draw your character based on your desired outcome.


Determine whether the character is male, female, or otherwise. This will inform the character's general point of view, suggest traits depending on archetype, and may even be a point of conflict for your character and your story when seen through the eyes of society's preconceptions, whether fair or not. For example, an arrogant male is perceived differently than an arrogant female. (Both of which further define your character!)
Age is a factor. Older is generally seen as wiser, but it comes into play in other ways as well. A young villain is generally portrayed and seen as a bad seed or simply insane. An old villain can be all that, but might also be twisted that way by life's circumstances—giving him a lot more depth. The young, idealistic hero elicits a different feeling than the world-weary vet who is just doing the right thing. And when either of those meets their end in the story, the reactions are different as well.
Sometimes these can be contradictory. Don Quixote was a crotchety old man who'd spent his life in a room reading chivalry novels, and was woefully naive. Yet it was this naivety that drove him to seek adventures and love, and to create fantastic imaginings from the world around him when reality didn't meet his expectations.

, In a horror tale, the protagonist may want to survive at all costs—for example, Ripley in Alien; in a romantic tale, the antagonist may want to stop the hero from getting his ""true love,"" as did Prince Humperdinck in The Princess Bride.


How your characters deal with the inevitable obstacles that stand between them and their aims will most clearly define them. In complex stories these might cross repeatedly, with the motivations and accomplishments of some characters getting in the way of others, generating further action and twists, and cumulatively raising the stakes.

, To really flesh out a character, give them a personality that goes beyond the story itself. Some parts of their personality may never make it into your story, directly, but will help inform the decisions your characters may have to make.


Make a list of likes and dislikes, and make sure the list is balanced. In other words, don't have 10 dislikes to every one like or vice versa. Even the crankiest characters like something, even if it's just their mirror.
A character's attitude is likely made up of complementary traits, which can lead to actions that are unexpected and could change the audience's perception of your character. For example, the character that loves freedom is likely to dislike authority; if they like rich cakes or flashy cars, they're unlikely to respect frugality or restraint. If your character is merciless, but unexpectedly rescues a helpless child from a burning building, the audience is forced to rethink his character completely.

, Good habits, bad habits, or just things the character can't stop doing without some serious discipline or counseling. This can be minor, such as biting fingernails (which would indicate a worrier), or obsessive hair-combing (vanity or insecurity); or as serious as a drug addiction (somebody who evades responsibility and craves escape), or a death wish (hopeless and forlorn).


The more of these little tics and traits you give your character, the more they will ""come alive"" in the audience's mind.

, Work on external features such as where he lives, what she looks like and whether or not he has any pets, etc.


Does your character live in a well-manicured Upper East Side apartment (old money), or a peeling-paint hovel in the district (a life lived hard)? Most details you choose should suggest something about the character, or the characters' history.

, It creates a much more realistic character and helps to develop the character's archetype. A popular hero strength/weakness has to do with loyalty/disloyalty.

, Look at people at the mall, or on the subway. Suggestions for characters are everywhere.


Note physical features—the shape of noses, jaws, ears, body shapes, how their clothes fit, or how they carry themselves.
If you like their look, describe to yourself the details you find attractive, and translate that to your characters. If you see somebody that looks scary, honestly tell yourself why that person scares you, even if the reason is totally irrational or politically incorrect. Use this information to inform your characters.
Create characters that combine these traits—don't base an entire character on one or two people, because if they find out, you might get in trouble.

, Matching your character's traits to our perception of objects can help define your character, and be useful for foreshadowing moods and actions. For example:


A rose blooms briefly, but people adore them.
A snake is volatile and can strike without warning.
Stone buildings are solid and resistant to change.
Thunderstorms are violent, but presage a surge of growth to come.
A sharp sword is even a danger to the hand that wields it.

, First of all make a mind map of all the things you've talked about, and all the things you want to decide about your character. Get a voice recorder - most phones or laptops have them - and interview yourself, or even better get your friend to interview you as the character. Then write it down, and fill your mind map, to uncover things you didn't know about your character and develop the personality. If you make a mistake in the recording just remember that you can always branch out into multiple possibilities from a given idea.


Feel your character, and put yourself in his/her/its shoes. Sometimes the best characters are created from your own ideals, character, flaws or strengths, and those of family members and friends/foes.

, How does your character treat others? And how do they treat them? Has a lifetime of neglect forced them to turn to animals for comfort? Maybe being praised too much as a child has caused them to become stuck up and mean.

, For example, if your character's hair is simply described as brown, elaborate. Is it mousy brown? If it's blond, maybe it could be beach blond.

Keeping your character notes, drawings and doodles in one place is recommended, as this makes it easier for you to refer back to as needed.

, Try not to use your name, or someone else's name that you know, as this may be considered personal information.


Your character doesn't have to have their name mentioned in your novel. You may be writing a mystery have your main character may just be referred to as, for example, the Man, all the way through the novel. Even if this is the case, to add depth to your character, you should know them inside-out.
Some characters may not get their name until you've fleshed them out. That's okay too––go with whatever feels right as you develop the character.
Give your character a unique, memorable name. Baby name books are a good resource. You can also check sites that help new parents to name a baby.





;
, Does he/she have red or blonde hair? Are his/her eyes green, blue, or two different colors? What color is his/her skin? Is he or she human, animal, robot or mythical creature. Make your character unique.


Describe your character in an interesting way, even your character is meant to be bland or average. Pink hair with pale skin and green eyes? Or short brown hair, brown eyes, and a good tan? Maybe brown hair with purple streaks, brown eyes, and ghostly pale skin. The possibilities are vast, just make the descriptive language good, so that it conjures up the character for the reader.







, This includes:


Nationality, social status and job/occupation.
Beliefs, values, preoccupations, superstitions, preferences, fears or phobias (Is he/she afraid of the dark? Or maybe spiders?) and why they fear that specific thing.
Friends/allies, enemies, any family he/she has, any lover or crush, etc.
Particular talents (maybe he/she is good at juggling), any movements/protests he/she is involved in (describe the movement/protest and its purpose), and past/childhood (maybe he/she used to be a warrior, or a bank-robber), etc.
Hobbies/things he/she likes to do for fun.
Describe his/her current home (in full detail) and past/childhood home.

, Is he/she loud and flamboyant, or more the quiet introvert? Does he/she stand for his/her beliefs? Is he/she shy, or in-your-face? You want your readers to know exactly what kind of person your character is, if required.


Of personality traits, which are the best? They are all great for working with as a writer, but you must choose a reasonable selection that best fits your character––don't try to overwhelm the character with an unlikely combination of many traits.
Don't give the character merely neutral or good traits. Also spice it up with the vices and weaknesses. Your character is best if presented as imperfect (in actions, appearance or personality). Your character can make mistakes, have bad habits, and possess little interesting quirks. This is what makes the character interesting. For example: Is he so nice that he gets taken advantage of? Or is she so pretty that is goes to her head? Maybe she is such a tomboy that the guys don't mind including her in guy's night out?







, Your character's background is the most important thing about them. That is when they learned what they know today. Was her father a drunk and beat her so badly that she is scared of guys? Or maybe her father was never even in the picture and her mother wasn't the best mother? Maybe she is the oldest child and takes care of her two little brother since her parents left her at a young age to fend for herself? What are you going to make happen?

, What is a good story without a good plot? Maybe your character fell in love with the wrong person and now has to find a way out before it is too late? Maybe your character has become mixed up with some bad people or a strange mystery. Maybe your character has only months to live and wants to do something great. Keep imagining away!

Does that boy who lives across the street have a habit of knocking things over? Does your best friend talk with her hands when she's excited? These could be quirks of a character you create yourself.;
, If this is your first time writing a story, or you're not sure how to make your character believable, base your character on somebody. It could be a friend, a family member, a celebrity, or even you! If you base it on someone you know, you will know how they react to situations, which makes it easier for you.

, Keep everything you'll need to know about your character in this folder. Doing this will keep you organized. Alternatively, you could make a folder on your computer and type everything up on Microsoft Word.

, How tall is the person? Are they of athletic build, slim build or chubby? What colour is their hair and their eyes? How long is their hair? Is it curly, wavy, straight, etc.? Look online for 'face makers' or, if you have a Sims game, make a Sim look like your character and take several screen shots. You could also look through pictures on-line and in magazines and find a person that looks like your character. This will help you get a strong visual of what your character looks like. Put pictures of your character in their file.

, This means recording things like the full name, birthday, ethnic background, and every detail of your character's personality. Search Google for character sketch outlines. Many are quite helpful. Work out and write down the basics, such as:


When is their birthday? How old are they?
Who are their friends?
What are their dreams/goals? What do they want to accomplish?
What is their past like?
Who's in their family? Do they have any family? Any pets?
What are their favourite things?

, Names are important and must fit the personality of your character (although, as the writer, the name you choose will usually fit eventually, as readers get used to the combination). The name should reflect the time period and location in which your story is taking place, in order to seem fitting and convincing to readers. For example, a boy living in a small town in South Georgia in 1980s isn't going to be named Throckmorton.


Sometimes, a long, complicated name is appropriate, but keep in mind how many times you will have to write it and your readers will have to read it. There's nothing worse than not being able to pronounce the main character's name!

, These can form excellent subplots and are a great help when you're stuck. What if Oliver is afraid of heights? What if the only way to save his little sister is to climb across the rickety bridge a mile above the ground? Knowing your characters' secrets can also create a compelling story. Having the secret slowly revealed can help to bring the plot and characters to life even more.

, If it helps you, draw your characters. While the personality of characters is far more important than appearance when it comes to being convincing, appearance can help to develop the character as well.

, Know their greatest desire, because this will keep the plot alive. Know their past, their biggest fear, their most embarrassing moment, their darkest secrets. Even if some of this doesn't show up in your story, that's okay. Knowing your characters will convince them that they are alive, and will do the same for their reader.

, Once you have the essentials down, start interviewing your character. How does she/he look at the world? Pretend that you're someone on a talk show interviewing a celebrity. Watch some talk shows for ideas on questions to ask your character. Ask as many questions as you'd like until you get a real feel for your character.

, Put the folder in an easily accessible place so that you can continuously go back and take another look at the details of your character while writing. This will ensure that your character is strong from start to finish of your story, instead of starting strong and dwindling away as the story progresses. Now start your story with a strong, convincing character!

The steps shown below are a starting point, but eventually you'll find a method that works for you, and it's perfectly all right (and even encouraged) to follow that method.
, This can be anything from a picture online, one of your own personality traits, to a song on the radio. Use anything that gives you an idea. Once you have the first aspect of your character, a name, appearance, or personality trait, you're ready to expand on it. In some cases, you'll have such a clear insight into your character that you might find you don't need the rest of these steps at all.

, This is easy enough if you think about it. Consider your setting and which gender will be more appropriate for your story. For example: William Golding, the author of the classic ""Lord of the Flies,"" explained that he wrote a book about boys because he thought if he included girls and boys, there would be a sexual aspect that he didn't want to include, and he thought boys alone would be a better model of society.

, Personalities can get really fun and creative. There are so many. You could just use a three word personality like loud and fiery or quiet and shy or tough and confident. Just looking at stuff will give you ideas. For example, you look out the window and see a pink flower. Then you may get an idea for your character to be pink and girly. Consider adding one or two of your own personality traits so you can better understand your character. Once you have a personality, expand on it and really develop it. Characters with deep, realistic personalities, with endearing characteristics and annoying flaws, are the most beloved characters of all.


When you are creating your characters personality, you need to ask yourself a variety of questions: ""Is my character kind?"" ""Is my character wise?"" ""Is my character smart?"" etc. If you are having trouble with creating a whole new personality, why not just base the character's personality off of your own? That shouldn't be too hard.







, This is important. Eye color, hair color and skin tone are important, along with maybe height or weight or even shoe size, if you wish.


Does your character look like a supermodel? Is your character butt ugly? Is your character muscular? Is your character skinny and weak? You should have fun with this, but you need to make it believable, so that people can relate to your character.






How your character dresses should reflect on the personality.

, Some writers use really strange names, or unique. It's always a good idea to have a first and last name, and maybe a middle name. Don't be afraid to be unique. Jacqueline Wilson's well known Tracy Beaker may have a strange last name but we don't really think about that much. Is their first name going to be a normal name, common, unusual or possibly ethnic? Rhiannon, Tanya, Monica, Mindy or Andi for a girl are some of those uncommon names, but some writers use classic names like Mary, Jane, Nora or Emily. For boys, some unusual ones would be Kenny, Zeke or maybe even Terry. Some common ones would be James, Tom, John, Michael, Patrick, or plenty of others. Keep in mind that just because a name is common, it's not necessarily boring. Some names are popular for a reason, and sometimes a common name works better anyways- there's a reason why very few characters in modern literature have names like Aloysius or Apollonia. But the most important thing to remember is the character's personality and setting.

, Think about his or her hobbies, likes and dislikes, and favorite things. Your character could like sports, cooking, music, fashion, reading, animals- the possibilities are literally endless.


Your character may be transgender, no gender or a gender bender. Don't get hung up on pronouns.

, If your character just drifts through the story without showing any emotions whatsoever, it will be a dull tale. The emotions are catalyst's for your character's reactions. Your character needs to show more than one emotion, or the story will be humdrum.

, Whatever happens in your story has to have at least a little bit. For example: If your character's best friend moved away, how would they react? Giving your character good reactions will make the character seem more natural.

, Use this to guide you as you write. You can add to it or subtract from it as you write the story.

Your readers may find it hard to believe that the canon character has a sister he never mentioned or a son she doesn't remember.

, Your original character should not constantly be the center of the universe. Let the other characters have moments away from your new character where they don't talk or think about the new character.

, Remember why they're there. Your readers want to read about the canon characters, that's why you're writing a fan-fiction.

, Make sure that your chosen name fits in with the fandom. For example, don't have a Harry Potter character called Trixiebella Arwen, or a LOTR elf called Jane. There are plenty of sites online where you can research names to make sure that they fit with your chosen fandom.


Baby name sites are a good start, but don't go mad. Names like ""Angelica Rowanna Marybelle Devenish"" are ridiculous and not realistic. Don't use traits like hair color or facial features either, as most children are named at birth.
Don't use your own name, or a variation of it. This just screams ""Mary Sue"" to readers.

, Ones like impatience, obsession with looks and trouble making friends are examples of flaws within the character. They should be flaws that have real consequences for the character in his or her life and advance the story forward.

, One of the most annoying things about Mary Sues is how easily everything comes to them: fighting skills, special talents, strong relationships, special powers that appear just in time to save the day, etc. If your character has to struggle and deal with real problems your readers will start to feel for her. If she does everything perfectly with no real adversity, they'll start to hate her.

, If you do so, you might as well start a diary as everyone has a different personality and should have to freedom to choose what they want to do, so do not base their decisions on your personal opinions, beliefs etc. This makes the story far more interesting and also makes the writing more of an interesting journey for you, stretching your writing abilities.

, Look at the original work you're drawing from. Do all of the protagonists always agree or act the same way? Of course not. Take the canon characters' personalities into account and craft believable reactions to and relationships with your newcomer.

, Give the glory to an established character or make it a real team effort.

, Mary Sues are constantly winning the love of a character the author really likes or fixing up two previously unattached characters the author thinks should be together. Romance is possible in fan-fiction, but give it time to make it more realistic.

, One of the biggest flaws of Mary Sue stories is that things happen far too quickly. It will probably take a while for your new character to become really close to the canon characters, or be in a position to accomplish lots of amazing things. Go slowly. You can always write a sequel.

First, think of the kind of story you have.,
Once you know your kind of story, you should have an idea of the plot.,
Using this information, you can start making characters that fit with it.,
Imagine you in their shoes.,
Provide the details.,
Provide Interaction between characters.,
Develop Extra characters.,
Have changing personalities.",How to Brainstorm Characters for a Story," Is it science fiction? Historical fiction? Historical non-fiction... The list goes on. If this is a super-hero type of story, I advise not to have the good character very strong, and the villain weak. In fact, it draws the reader in more if the villain is much stronger than the character himself!;
, Some writers write a whole outline and start filling in words, others just make up things as they write. If you have a good imagination, then try making up things as you go. When you're not at your computer typing it up, if a thought of what to write comes to your mind, you should either go and continue on the story or write it down on an ""ideas"" paper.

, For example, if this is medieval-type, then don't put a bratty I-want-everything-my-way and roll-my-eyes girl unless she came from the future or something. It just doesn't cut it to mix up the kind of people there are. For medieval, it's better to put a brave knight or princess, and maybe even a dragon!

, Be the knight for a little bit, and think how he would feel, but with his type of personality. It might be hard at first, but soon you'll get used to it. For example, think of the knight in front of the terrible dragon. Think what you would feel if you were there, and then try again, this time putting on the knight's personality and armor. This will help you get realistic details for that character. If you make your main character have the same personality as you, then it will be much easier to put yourself in the character's place.

, If you have a main character that in your mind likes honey, and honey has something to do with the story, then tell the reader that he/she likes honey. Many times, trying to make characteristics for your characters can give you good story ideas. Another way to bring details up to your head is to pretend you're having a conversation with your character. Writing an interview with your character can help you discover more details that would suit him/her, and help make them more real.


Naming. You need to name your characters with something that reflects the genre of the story. A fantasy story could have names like Rosh, Rowan, Zephyr... while an everyday school life story would have more normal names like David, Brian, Cody and so on. Giving your character a name that ties in with the story can be interesting. Look up the meanings of the names that you want to use to help you out in this area.

, This is important. For the story to be fun, there has to be a lot of speaking. Otherwise, the character is as dry as a cracker. If you're up to the challenge, you can even make a character that can't speak, and has to make hand motions. This would be much harder unless you just say, ""Hi there, how are you?"" So and So signed. Otherwise, you'd have to either have the person not interact, or take up the challenge of making hand motions.

, Sometimes it can be interesting to make the reader think someone is more important than he really is. For example, if you have read or seen David Copperfield, think of the person who is rather hunched over and who makes very weird faces, (he gets thrown in jail for manipulating someone and stealing diamonds). If you made a character similar to that, the reader's eyes would fasten to that person, then you can make another character in the background that they will wonder about but don't suspect. The first time you see the character that Charles Dickens wrote, you will suspect evil from him. Yes, he ended up being evil at the end, but how interesting would it be to fake it? This intrigues the reader and the element of trying to figure out what everyone's place in the story is draws the reader in., This is very good for the main characters. Usually, the story that they're in impacts the character and changes his/her life or personality, or their outlook on something. Such as, the main character may hate another character, but by the end of the story, the situations they go through together makes them closer.

Keep your rejects.",How to Create a Cartoon Character," A good way to come up with your own idea for a new comic character is to begin by identifying the ones you like and thinking about their characteristics.


For example, are your favorite characters all heroes? Do you always root for the under-dog? Do you sympathize with the villains? Do you love animal characters?;
, What are your favorite sports and hobbies? What kinds of movies, books, and stories do you like best? Finding the answers to these questions could point you in a fruitful direction.


For example, if your ideal weekend is spent catching up on reruns of Dr. Who, then you may want to think about creating a sci-fi cartoon character.
If, on the other hand, you prefer to spend your free-time outdoors skateboarding, swimming, or exploring the woods, then you may want to come up with a character who is at home in these environments and who shares your interest.

, If you'd like to come up with an awesome cartoon character but have no real solid ideas, begin by free-writing or free-drawing for a short period of time. Allow yourself 15-30 minutes to jot down any and ever idea you have.


Refrain from censoring yourself or judging your ideas at this stage. Instead, just capture any idea that passes through mind and get it down on paper.
You can write character descriptions, or if you feel inspired, you can draw or sketch the beginnings of your ideas., If your well of ideas is currently dry (or if there's only a drop or two in it), you may benefit from brainstorming with a creative friend who is also interested in comic characters.


Take turns being the recorder, and bounce ideas off each other. Write down everything, no matter how ridiculous or boring your ideas might seem. This isn't the stage for judging or tossing out ideas.

, Place a series of random words in a hat. For example, you could choose nouns like “candy,” “lollipop,” or “fax machine,” or you could include adjectives like “purple,” “powerful,” or “innocent”.


Draw a word from the hat, and then challenge yourself to create a character based on that word. You can create a character out of the object itself (for example, an animated fax machine or toaster), or a character which is characterized by that thing.Repeat the exercise several times until you get good at coming up with ideas quickly and until you stumble upon something intriguing that you think you can develop further.

, Many of the best characters are based upon real people, and you could already be in close contact with next great character. Think about your circle of friends: is anyone particularly hilarious or unique? You may be able to create a character based on your friend's persona.

, You don't want to cause embarrassment, offense, or hurt feelings if that person sees your character and thinks you are making fun of them. Thus, you may want to base your character on just one aspect of your friend and disguise the character in other ways.


For example, you might find your friend Molly's clumsiness a source of humor, but you might want to switch up the gender of your character to protect the real Molly's feelings.
Of course, if your character is going to be a hero or heroine, then your friend may be flattered to be represented in your character!

, Do you have (or have you had) a terrible boss? Are you a server? If so, who was the worst customer you ever had? Think about the people who have really stood out to you, and you may find that you've got a new character idea in front of you.

, If you've got a free hour or two, plant yourself on bench in the park or grab a seat on the bus. Get out your notebook, and then discreetly sketch (or just describe) the interesting people you see. You may be able to turn one or more of them into a promising comic character.

, You might not think that you are interesting enough to serve as the model for a cartoon character, but don't sell yourself so short. This is the chance for you to reinvent yourself or (literally!) draw yourself in your best light.


You can model your cartoon character on you as you are now, as you hope to be in the future, or you can draw yourself as a kid.
Think about what your best, worst, funniest, most embarrassing, or memorable experiences are. You can draw yourself in those moments, and you can take liberties: for example, do you wish you had reacted differently when you were bullied in the second grade? If so, draw the eight-year-old you as the champion of the bullied.

, Once you have a good list of ideas to work with, it's time to sort through it to find the most promising character idea. Consider the following questions to help you out:


Are any of your ideas too similar to current cartoon characters? If you want to create something truly original, you will want to avoid copying someone else's character and ideas.
Which of your ideas really pop out at you as being interesting or intriguing? Do any of the characters already suggest a story-line? If so, consider starting with them.
Would you prefer to work with a character that is realistic or modeled on someone you know?Do you think you'd have more fun with a fantasy-based character. Select the characters that match up with your answers to these questions.

, Once you've made your selection, you should spend some time fleshing out the back-story of your character. This is sometimes referred to as finding your character's “motivation”. For example, Bruce Wayne became Batman because his parents were murdered in front of him. Ask yourself:


What drives your character? What does your character care about? Your character should have goals and dreams, and it should also have character strengths and flaws.Having an idea of all of this will help you as you begin to try to give your character a form and shape.

, While you might not be ready to fully develop or draw these other secondary characters, your character's persona will be influenced and created in part by the other people or characters in their world. This will then be reflected in how you draw your character.


For example, do you think your character have a family or is she an orphan? Does your character have an enemy? Thinking about that now will help you visualize your character more fully., You may already have an initial sketch of your character, but before you flesh out your drawing completely, it may help to study other comic characters that you admire or that you'd like your character to resemble. Pay attention to the following:


How would you describe the character's personality? How is the artist able to express this through their artwork? Has the artist given the character any distinguishing features?
For example, if the character is heroic or brave, see if you observe the use of strong lines. Perhaps the artist has given the hero a square jaw, or has chosen strong, bright colors for the hero's outfit. , As you begin to develop and draw your character, you will want to think about your eventual audience. Your lines, shapes, and color choices will be affected by your intended audience.


For example, if you are drawing for children, you'll want to keep your shapes simpler, use stronger lines, and select a brighter color palette (perhaps all primary colors).If you are drawing for adults, or if you are drawing political commentary or satire, you may want to create more complex, darker, “uglier” characters.

, When you begin to draw, you'll most likely have better success if you draw with clean lines and create easily readable features.Don't allow yourself to become overwhelmed by trying to capture all of the details of your character in this early stage of making him or her come to life.

, The best way to portray a character's personality is through their facial expressions and body language.


For example, if your character is naive and innocent, you may want to give him large, round, imploring eyes.If, on the other hand, your character is malicious and evil, you can portray this by giving her a hunched figure, thin lips, and squinty eyes.

, You want your character to stand out and be memorable. Think of ways that you can make your character unique. For example, the Simpsons cartoon characters are immediately recognizable by their bright yellow color (or think particularly of Marge Simpson's crazy high blue hair).Experiment with unexpected color or proportion choices, or by giving your character unusual-looking facial features.

, As your character starts to come to life, play around with different styles of lines to portray different character traits.


For example, using thicker softer lines when you draw will help you convey to your audience that your character is approachable and trustworthy.If, on the other hand, your character is highly energetic on perhaps untrustworthy, then you should work with uneven, sketchy lines., If you choose to use color in your drawing, you'll want to think carefully about your color choices and what emotions or attributes they suggest.


For example, dark, murky colors are usually associated with villains or with characters who have something to hide, whereas softer, lighter colors can suggest innocence. Additionally, bright primary colors are often associated with heroes or with characters aimed at children., Small changes in your character's expression can portray big differences in his or hers emotions or reactions.As you draw your character, experiment with drawing different versions of the same character with different facial expressions.


For example, try to capture your character in a sad moment, and then again in a hopeful moment, changing only the facial expressions in the different drawings.

, We express ourselves through our clothes, our toys, our accessories, and our gadgets, and comic characters are no different. Once you have a basic picture in mind, don't forget to focus on the details of what sets your character apart.


Does she have a distinguishing outfit or favorite color to wear? Does your hero need a disguise? Does your hero carry a back-pack or carry any tools or weapons?Sort out the answers to these questions and then get drawing!

, As you begin to draw, make sure to pay attention to real-life models of both people and objects.For example, if your character is wearing a skirt, then either wear one yourself and study yourself in the mirror or have a friend model one for you. Pay careful attention to how it hangs and shifts as you move.
As another example, if your character will wield a sword then find a toy sword (or something with the basic shape, such as a bat), and study how your hand looks as you grip it, note the angle of your arm as you raise the “sword,” etc.

, Once you are satisfied with your drawing, share it with others and get their input. Instead of asking them just whether they like it or not, seek out specific input. For example, ask them to describe the character to you as they see it.Are they picking up on the attributes and personality that you were hoping to capture? For example, if they read the character as being timid, when you were going for quietly strong, ask them what about the drawing in particular led them to think that.

, If you're not able to recreate the picture you have in your mind on paper (or on the computer screen) at first, or if you think that your final result is boring or looks amateurish, don't get too down on yourself. The creative process only progresses by making lots of false starts, and learning to draw and develop nuanced characters is a skill that takes practice., Even if you're convinced that your first (or first few) attempts at creating a cartoon character are abysmal failures, stash them away in a drawer or in a computer file, and revisit them in a few days or weeks.


You can then study them with a more careful eye to see what you don't like about them, or you may find that something about the drawing was a success, in which case you build upon it in your next attempt.

Throw down everything about your villain.,
Watch movies with villains in them.,
Stare off into space.,
Use STEAL to guide your writing:


S: ""Say"".",How to Avoid Creating a Weak Villain in Creative Writing," Add or change everything as you go! A great way to brainstorm, is to sketch and color your villain. You may be drawing them, only to realize they'd look great with scaly purple skin. Or, maybe you decide to add a magical cloak on them. Just have fun with it.;
, You can pick up traits and ideas from seeing other depictions.

, That may sound strange, but soon enough ideas will reel in. Think about villains in your head and suddenly you'll be thinking about a tall guy with blue hair and a scheme to take over Australia!

, You can express your villain's cruelty through what they say. Have them say really threatening things or something that normal people would think is rude and ignorant. If one nice word slips, it may seem he is merciful. Unless that's what you want to convey, you must keep everything either straight-out rude, or sarcastic.






T: ""Think"". You can portray that you're villain is wicked by showing what they think. Now remember, this is easiest to exhibit if you are writing in first person or very detailed third person. Have them think about their next evil plan or invention. Make them pleased when others fear their schemes.
E: ""Effect on Others"". This is something people use in everyday life. If a big tough guy comes down the hall, and everyone cowers in fear, you can tell that he's a jerk or someone you should avoid. If a rosy-cheeked girl gets waves and smiles from everyone around her, you can tell she's kind and someone you might want to meet. It's the same with the villain. Have others shriek and run when your villain's name is mentioned. If your villain is taking a stroll, have the people who surround him or her turn wide-eyed and scared. If your villain is only feared by certain people, have others just casually walk by.
A: ""Actions"". This one is easy. Your villain shouldn't be giving candy away to toddlers--unless it's mind-controlling candy. They should be trying to take over the Earth, or be trying to prevent good from happening. They should also have a master plan at hand which they should carry out throughout the story.
L: ""Looks"". If you see someone who has pigtails and a huge smile on their face, you immediately think of a sweet little girl. If you see a girl with a black eye who looks at people and smirks, you know she's a bully who likes to fight! So, make your villain someone who when you walk by, you stare at them and immediately rush away. Dark cloaks, capes, or strange colored skin is the usual appearance of a villain. But personalize them and customize the look to ensure uniqueness.

Focus on character wants and needs.,
Decide how your main characters will change.,
Establish a plot.,
Think of a setting.,
Consider theme.",How to Create a Character Driven Book1," In a character driven book, your character's wants and needs should be of upmost importance. Oftentimes, the primary action of a character driven book involves how a character's wants, needs, and opinions change over time. As you begin to carve out the basics of your book, spend some considering what your characters want.All characters should yearn for something. This can help drive their actions throughout a story. For example, maybe your main character desperately wants to be a professional ballet dancer. His passion for dance can be the driving point of his actions throughout the story.
Your characters should, on a deeper level, need something as well. Maybe your main character's desire to dance is driven by a deeper need for control. Ballet requires a certain amount of perfection. If your character has had a messy life, for example, he may use dance as a way to create perfection from chaos.;
, In a character driven book, interpersonal and internal changes are what mark the trajectory of your story. No one wants to read about a character who stays stagnant. Your story arch is built around your characters' inner journeys. Decide going into the writing process how your characters are going to change.Your main character's wants and needs should change in response to what happens around him or her. Think of all the things that can change a person over the course of a lifetime. Relationships can change us. Jobs can change us. Trauma and loss can also foster change. Current events can alter a character's worldview.
Think about how certain events will shape your character. Many character driven books, for example, are driven by a relationship. Maybe your ballet dancer can reconnect with his estranged father. He may become less focused on success as he mends some issues from his past. His big realization may be that his career aspirations are unrealistic or too rigid, and they stem from his own troubled past.
When in doubt, return to your theme. Think about the topics you want to explore. You can shape character development and events around your theme. If you're writing a story of redemption, for example, how a character feels about him or herself will be a focal point focal point of your story. What events could occur to shift your character's opinion of him or herself? How will your character change based on these events?

, Even when a story is character driven, there is always a plot. It may not be action and adventure based, but you should have some plot in mind before beginning your story. Character driven stories are often focused on personal journeys. Having a literal journey, like a road trip, can help drive a symbolic one. You could also focus on how certain relationships change. If you're telling the story of a friendship, a romance, or a family relationship, how will this relationship progress? What events will occur to drive this relationship forward?

, Oftentimes, a setting is very important in a character driven book. The relationship characters have to their home is often a big aspect of their identity. Decide where your story will take place and, from there, spend some time thinking about the relationship your characters have with that place. Do they love the setting or do they hate it? Are they longing for escape, or looking for a way to settle down in their current location?

, Every book has a theme. This the central idea or message that the story explores. Figuring out your theme, or having some idea of what topics you want to explore, can help you develop your characters. The theme your work grapples with should be of central importance to the characters.Think about your favorite book. If you had to sum that book up with a few words, what would those words be? For example, say your favorite book is Mrs. Dalloway. What is the first word you think of when considering this book? Words that come to mind may be time, death, trauma, and loss. These are certainly all themes explored in Mrs. Dalloway, primarily through the book's characters.
Think about a theme you want to explore in your book. Do you want to write about love, loss, heartbreak? Do you want to write a story of redemption or courage? Try to jot down a variety of themes you would like to explore in your book. Think about how your characters could exemplify those themes.

, Is his purpose simply to be an obstacle for a hero and a catalyst character for his change? Does he represent an aspect of a story's theme?

, Some tales require the viciousness of a serial killer, while others only call for a bully. Fit your villain with a genre of your story. Horror story needs a demon, army of zombies, evil ghosts or an obsessed person with a skilled trait (architect, scientist, etc). A crime thriller calls for a crime lord, a boss of a rival gang or the ringleader of a corrupt police force. An evil alternate universe twin, a killer cyborg or a destructive robot fits in sci-fi. An evil king or warlock is good in fantasy, as is a priest, a highly placed official or a member of a manipulative secret society. In any type of writing, a villain is more interesting if he or she is considered good and trustworthy by others, keeping his or her ambitions secret.

, It could be as devastating as seeing his parents murdered or as sublime as seeing a prized rosebush destroyed by the whims of nature. The reason for this is to create a turning point in the villain's life. It does not need to be a traumatic incident, your character could be raised in such a way to influence his or her present. Also, even a simple defining moment could change a person`s life depending on the person. Some people can be easily corrupt or develop strong values that motivate them to take drastic action.

, Exaggerate it, twist it, and distort it until it becomes the rotten core of your villain. Is it counterpointed in some way by the hero's experience?

, It does not have to be a big thing--in fact, it's better if it's not. For example, the villain may enjoy strolling in a rose garden in order to clear his/her head. Or, even smaller, the villain enjoys the simple pleasure of cracking open a sunflower seed on his tongue and enjoying the saltiness of the meat inside. What about a dependent relative, a lost love, a treasured pet? Does this vulnerability give the hero leverage in some way, and is the hero noble enough not to use it? Perhaps a lost love is reason enough to corrupt him or her. Even a memory can bring someone much happiness.

, How are they related? Why does the villain love one thing so much and is still filled with malice, hatred, or just plain ""dislike""?

, How does the hero fit into the villain's life? How do his wants mix, match, and collide? How are they similar; how are they different? The villain should be just as powerful if not more powerful than the hero.

, Look how your story folds and your villain develops, and make your decision based on them. Avoid sudden and complete change unless you`re going for the extreme melodrama displayed in How the Grinch Stole Christmas.

, Everybody is afraid of something. The villain may be afraid of anything from the hero to death to the dark or even monsters under the bed! Be creative, but make sure the fears aren't too silly, or your story won't be taken seriously.

, Without the villain the hero cannot overcome obstacles and develop as a character.

, The best villains are ones that readers can connect with. The more human your villain seems the more frightening/captivating their arc in the story will be.

, Don't always make the villain fail and the hero win. Also, a villain is not all evil! A villain should have positive qualities. Just as a hero consists mostly of positive qualities but has a fair share of flaws, a villain should have mostly flaws but definite positive qualities.

, Make sure their death fits how evil they were. If they were a common thief they should only have a simple death like being shot. If they were a brutal/sadistic/plain evil villain then they'll need a more intense, maybe even over-the-top death. It makes the reader feel satisfied that they got what was coming to them.

Create character profiles.,
Decide on a character arc.,
Establish backstory.,
Craft relationships between characters.,
Give your characters strong opinions.",How to Create a Character Driven Book2," Character profiles can be useful tools in a character driven book. As you begin to develop your major characters, consider writing up character profiles to refer to as you write your work.Character profiles list a character's personality traits, physical appearance, personal relationships and so on. You should try to write up a character profile for each major character in your book.
Start with the basics. Write down your character's full name and physical details like height, weight, eye color, hair color, and so on. Also, make sure to chart out basic relationship. Lists parents, siblings, friends, romantic partners, and so on.
From here, talk about deeper issues. Lists your character wants, fears, and needs. Talk about what your character likes and dislikes. What does your character want out of life? What about him or herself does your character want to change? Also, include things like religious and political views, as these are important insights to a character's personality.
You may find, as you begin to write, you do not include every detail in your actual book. However, knowing your character's intimately can be helpful for you as a writer. You may find you incorporate a lot of the information from your character profiles in the subtext of your work.

, A character arc represents your character's emotional journey throughout the course of a work. In a character driven book, a character arc is the driving force of your story. Your character's internal arc will be how you figure out the rising action, climax, and falling action of your story.Essentially, your character arc is how we get from Point A to Point B in your story. Let's return to the ballet dancer example. Your main character should go from obsessing over perfection and control to accepting life's ambiguities. How do you get your character to this point?
Think of events that will shape your character. In our example, the ballet dancer's estranged father resurfaces. As your dancer cares for his ailing father, you can include flashbacks to his childhood. This can reveal an amount of chaos that was frightening. You can also use the progression of his father's illness to drive the story forward, each stage of his father's sickness forcing the ballet dancer to recognize how much of life is beyond his control.

, Your character should come with a history attached to him or her. Try writing a brief biography for each character you create. Where was the character born? What was his or her childhood like? Where did he or she go to school? What important events occurred in his or her life? This information is all vital to a character's current personality.


Much like the information in your character profiles, it's unlikely that you'll include every detail of a character's backstory in your book. However, this information may be useful for you as a writer. You can add details subtly or burry them in the context.

, Character relationships are very important to a character driven story. Oftentimes, a relationship is of central importance to the realizations a character has that drive his or her story arc. As you develop your characters, focus on their relationships with one another.You may want to map out relationships between character. Use a big sheet of construction paper to write out all your characters. Draw color-coded lines between characters to represent relationships. For example, a red line is a romantic relationship. A blue line is a family relationship.
Grudges can go a long way in developing characters. A lot of tension in a character driven work comes from characters who dislike each other or have a troubled history.
Focus on how these relationships will change. Will characters grow apart, reconcile, or develop animosity as time goes by?

, Strong opinions can make for interesting, dynamic characters. They can also help move the story forward. How a character's opinion changes over time can be a focal point of that character's arc. Strong opinions can also foster disagreement between characters, creating compelling conflict in a story.Characters with strong opinions can be very driven. This can help keep a character driven story moving. For example, the ballet dancer is of the opinion perfection and success are vital to a life well lived. He may be dismissive of people he sees as lazy. This can create tension in his personal relationships, as his opinions may make him judgmental or overbearing.
Strong opinions often change during the course of a story. Your climax will seem more exciting if your character is forced to abandon opinions he or she has clung to strongly throughout a work.

Select your point of view.,
Write unique dialogue.,
Have your characters stop and think.,
Make everyday interactions significant.",How to Create a Character Driven Book3," The point of view in your story is the perspective from which a story is told. You can tell a story in first-person, second-person, third-person omniscient, or third-person limited.In first-person, the story is narrated by a character in the story. It's told using pronouns like ""I"" and ""me."" The advantage of this is that you get to see one character's perspective in-depth. The disadvantage is that you often see other character's from only one character's point of view. If you're using first person, you'll have to keep the tone consistent with that character. If a book is told through the point of view of a child, for example, this will be very different from a book told from the point of view of a college-educated adult.
Second-person is when the author uses ""you"" or ""your,"" telling the story as if it's happening to the reader. This can make experiences feel more personal for the reader. However, it's used somewhat infrequently in longer works.
Third-person can be limited or omniscient. A limited third-person narrator tells the story as an outsider looking in, but focuses in on the perspective and inner thoughts of one character. An omniscient third-person narrator can reveal the thoughts of any character in the book. Third-person omniscient can be particularly helpful for a character-driven book if you have a wide variety of characters.

, Dialogue is vital to a solid story. In a character driven work, how a character speaks says volumes about who that character is. As you write your book, make sure you focus on believable, unique dialogue.Listen to how people talk in real life. Spend some time people watching and eavesdropping on conversations. Listen for verbal ticks, such as how people use words like ""like"" and ""um"" when speaking.
Consider how your character may talk. If your character is cynical, his words may be laced in sarcasm. A well-educated character may have a highly developed dialogue, especially if he's insecure and wants to call attention to his intelligence. Try to give every character their own unique voice.
Read your dialogue out loud. This will help you gauge whether it sounds believable or not.
Break up dialogue with action so you can have characters use non-verbal cues to convey mood. A character may, for example, fidget excessively when lying or being deceitful.

, As you begin to write your book, focus on your character's internal monologue. A lot of the action in a character driven book occurs in a character's mind. Allow your characters to stop and think throughout the book, highlighting what's going through their minds.If your story is told in first person, this can be particularly easy to do. You can have the character discussing what he or she is thinking as the action of the story unfolds. However, you can also get into a character's head if you're writing in third person. As a narrator, you're a somewhat omnipotent force and are able to tell your readers what your characters are thinking.
Benign events can cause a character to stop and think. Maybe a passing school bus reminds your character of a traumatic event that occurred on his first day of school, for example. Major events can also drive introspection. Maybe your character has a breakdown after a relationship implodes, causing him to spend a night awake with his thoughts.

, Strive to make small events significant in a character driven work. You can show a lot about a character's relationships with others, and his or her personality, through how that character navigates day-to-day interactions.Have your character respond to small interactions he or she has with other people. This can show how your character sees the world. How these interactions change can show how a character's story arc is playing out. For example, you can include a scene where a character gets very angry when someone cuts him or her in line. This can showcase that your character is high strung about rules. Later, a similar interaction can take place and your character can react in a more relaxed fashion. This illustrates how this character has changed.
You can also have every day interactions with other characters matter. How a character reacts to being touched by a significant other can offer insight into that relationship. The way your protagonist reacts to a phone call from his mother can show you how he does or does not value family.

Recognize that a lot of what you know about disability may be wrong.,
Choose disability-friendly language.,
Read from the disabled community.,
Recognize that disabled people are very diverse and have different experiences.,
Remember that people with disabilities learn and grow.",How to Write a Disabled Character1," Consider each ""fact"" you know about a given disability, and ask yourself where it came from. If the answer is ""pop culture,"" then that information may not be accurate.Perform research from reputable sources. Don't only look to the internet, many medical books are very informative and accurate. See How to Do Research and How to Research a Topic.
Turn researching a given disability, and the tropes associated with it, into a project.;
, People with disabilities are often very careful about what terms they prefer to use. What do they call themselves, and what do they want not to be called? Respecting their language preferences will please disabled readers, and encourage non-disabled readers to do the same.


For example, the word ""cripple"" has a very different connotation than ""amputee"".
Not all disabled people prefer the same terms; there is often diverse opinion within a given population.

, What are their lives like? How do their symptoms affect their experiences? What sort of character would they love to read a book about? Understanding their perspectives can help you build a believable character with a disability like theirs.

, Many disabilities are a spectrum: for example, many blind people are not completely blind, and simply have some degree of low vision.Some disabilities are stronger on some days than on others, based on stress and other factors.The spoon theorycovers how some people need to budget their energy.

, A girl with Down Syndrome will be able to do much more at age 15 than she could at age 5. Disabled characters, including characters with intellectual/developmental disabilities (IDDs) will be able to learn new things and gain skills. They will simply do so at their own pace.

Schedule time to write everyday.,
Set goals for yourself.,
Revise.",How to Create a Character Driven Book4," Writing a character driven book is like writing any book. It call comes down to taking the time to write. Set aside time each day to work on your book.Writing should become a habit for you. Like working out, showering, or brushing your teeth, writing should be a daily ritual.
Find a place to write where you feel comfortable. You can stake out a local coffee shop or clear a desk in your home. Try to keep your work area free of distractions. Leave your cell phone on silent when you write and disconnect from social media.

, It's hard to finish a book if you don't hold yourself to certain goals. Try to set goals for yourself as you're working on your character driven book. Have an established page or word count you strive to reach each day. It's okay to start small to avoid feeling overwhelmed. For example, in your first week try to write 300 words a day. Then, move up to 500 the next week. Keep increasing your word count in small intervals over time., A lot of the work of writing comes in revision. When you finish a section or chapter, revise it after a few weeks. You can go through and read your work with a red pen. Highlight small issues, like typos, as well as larger ones. For example, maybe you feel like your main character's motivation is confusing in a certain moment. Jot this down in the margin.


You can also ask friends or colleagues to help you revise. If you trust someone's opinion as a reader, ask him or her to take a look at your work and give you notes.

"
Avoid unoriginal aspects or ""villain"" stereotypes.,
Give your character depth.,
Make the villain's quest for revenge realistic.,
Make your villain intelligent.,
Decide if your villain is completely evil or not.,
Consider how your villain manages (or tries) to get away with what they do.,
Try having your villain toy with the police.,
Have an underchallenged villain TRY to get caught.,
Let the reader get to know some of the victims before they are harmed.,
Consider how the villain will respond to finally being caught.,
Decide whether to kill off your villain in the end.,
Consider others' reaction to the villain's death, if applicable.",How to Avoid Creating a Weak Villain," A villain that's seen in nearly every children's story will not be taken seriously if they are in your story. Think about fairy tales with villains in them - most of them were vain, jealous, cloaked in black, and had a certain appearance to them, with no backstory or development. If you are writing a comedy, however, it's okay to use recognized villainy for comical effect, such as the ""evil laugh"" and hooked nose.;
, You don't have to explain every aspect of their personality in great detail, but you should know your character inside out. Don't be afraid to develop your villain effectively - after all, a one-dimensional cardboard character is not so strong. No character is ""pure good"" or ""pure evil"", and your villain may truly believe that what they're doing is the right thing, show the audience how they justify their actions.


A good example of a villain with depth would be that as a teenager, their home had been destroyed by an alien UFO landing on the roof and had killed their family. Now that the villain is older, they're bitter and angry at the aliens, so they want to exterminate the aliens so that nothing like that can ever happen again.
No one calls themselves a villain.Consider how the villain justifies their own actions. What is their reasoning?

, If your villain is hunting down the hero because they lost to the hero at a card game at third grade, something is wrong. Is it the villain's belief system, how they were bullied as a child, or that someone destroyed their family, city, or country? Alternatively, make your villain's turning point something original. Give your villain a mutated computer virus that bizarrely infects certain humans and makes them evil.


Avoid giving your villain a mental disorder. This can increase stigma against people with psychiatric disabilities, who are on average no more violent or dangerous than the general public,but far more likely to be victims of violence., Many heroes get away because the villain loiters and talks for too long, enabling a quick escape. A strong villain wouldn't spend 15 minutes explaining to the hero how they're slowly and painfully going to torture them to death, they'd just shoot them on the spot.


An exception to this could be if they have prevented the hero from moving in some manner - for example, tying them to a chair. However, it's unlikely that the villain would describe in detail how the hero is going to be tortured to death. A monologue about how much pain the hero has caused the villain would be more common.

, Perhaps they are just mean, wanting power, or a bully. Be careful about this, if your story calls for a totally evil villain, go ahead, but if all your story needs is a bully, stop reading as you don't need to create strong villain and overdo it.

, It may seem as though any murderous villain is just a killer eventually brought to justice. Well, it is not. You will want your villain to be secretive. Look up any type of odd cult ritual or watch a documentary of any serial killer to find out how to make your villain secretive.

, To do keep everyone guessing, cook up a plan so winded no one will anticipate it! Let your villain move from place to place. You will want people to think your villain is a dangerous mastermind.

, If they are used to everything being easy, the villain may deliberately give their enemies a boost, so that they can be challenged. If it fails, the hero(es) will be even more hurt, humiliated, and disappointed.


She leaves a clue to lead the police to her next victim see if they can catch her before she kills again.
He lets the hero go, because he likes a challenge.
A particularly manipulative villain may give the hero a better chance to beat them, then let the hero fail and be humiliated for missing such an easy shot.

, Let the reader see the goodness within the victims, so they mourn all the more when the victim is hurt or killed. The death of a complete stranger barely affects the reader; the death of a strong beloved character can be heartrending.


For example, Officer Flores is particularly kind and good at his job, and encourages the hero when she feels down. The reader grows to love Officer Flores, only to be torn when the villain kills him.
For example, the hero's autistic sister provides technical support, and cheers up the main characters with her positivity and endearing quirks. Later she is injured in an explosion and hospitalized, turning the hero's frustration to rage.

, Would they fight to the death, or surrender and be taken to jail? Will they try to justify their actions, apologize, or say they'd do it all again?

, Maybe your villain will die grappling with heroes or law enforcement, or perhaps they survive.


Some writers prefer graphic endings, such as the villain murdering two police officers before being shot in the head.
Off-screen deaths are somewhat more family-friendly, such as the villain falling off a cliff, bridge, or building, without any description.
Avoid killing off the villain if your story isn't dark.
Consider redeeming your villain for a lighter, more positive ending.

, How do they react? What do their reactions say about their character?


Are people happy about the death? What might that say about them?
Does anyone wish the villain had survived, and why? What does that say about them?

Read personal accounts from people who have the disabilities you wish to portray.,

Recognize that in real life, getting disability accommodations can be very difficult.,
Portray seeking help and self-advocacy as positive things, not as signs of weakness.,
Try exploring the tension between meeting one's needs and blending in.,
Consider how the character has handled ableism.",How to Write a Disabled Character2," What are their lives like? Where do they struggle? Are there any gifts that come with their disability? What do they feel are common misconceptions?


See if any people with disabilities would be open to being interviewed. There is no substitute for face-to-face time with real people.
If you are polite and clear, many disabled people are willing to offer advice and answer questions. Try asking questions via social media.
Remember that disabled people are diverse. No two people are exactly alike (whether it's two blind people or two people with Down Syndrome).Symptoms can vary between individuals.

, Every person is a unique individual, with interests, strengths, and flaws, if they have a disability or not. Although a disability is a character train, a disability is not a defining character trait.It will influence their life, but their personality (likes, dislikes, relationships, skills) is far more important. Spend plenty of time developing them as a person.


Avoid the mystical disability stereotype. This is the idea that people with some sort of physical difference will always have something bordering superpowers. Examples include autistic people having superior mathematical powers, like in the movie ""Rainman"", or the idea that blind people have enhanced sensory ability. Most disabled people are quite ordinary: they wake up, eat breakfast, go to work, and live fairly average lives. Portraying disabled people as ""beautiful tragedies"" ignores the fact that in fact, most people with disabilities are not any more or less tragic or beautiful than anyone else. , Some writers make the mistake of portraying people with cognitive disabilities as ""irrational"" or ""mysterious"" beings whose thoughts and behavior make no sense. The reality is that everyone has a reason for what they do, and the clarity of disabled people's thoughts is often underestimated. The way of thinking may be very different than others, but if observed closely, there are logical reasons behind every behavior. If your disabled character isn't the main character, that's fine. You can still attribute thoughts to them, and have the main character recognize what's going on in their head. (For example, ""Lucy visibly relaxed as soon as the Christmas music came on. She loved happy song lyrics, so I kept a playlist of songs with good messages.""), People with disabilities come in all shapes, colors, backgrounds, socio-economic levels, and so on. Readers have been calling for diversity,and an easy way to satisfy that need is to write more than one deviation from the privileged ""norm"" at a time. Try writing a black woman with cerebral palsy, a chubby boy with Down Syndrome, or a blind lesbian.

, This may require medication, therapy, and/or lifestyle adjustments.It may take years of hard work. Recovery is not a straight line, and there will be good days, bad days, and relapses.


Mental illnesses such as depression and psychosis are sometimes possible to recover from completely, with enough time and effort. This often involves a combination of pills and therapy, along with a loving and supportive environment.
Some conditions and illnesses have no cures. In this case, the individual's best outcome is to manage their symptoms and understand their limitations better.
Some disabilities, such as deafness and autism, are not ""illnesses"" but simply conditions.

, Many parents of disabled children, and disabled adults, have to fight for necessary accommodations.Faking a disability for accommodations would actually take a ton of energy. (The idea of fakers also makes it more difficult for real disabled people to get the help they need.), Admitting that you have a problem and need help (especially involving medication) is a very difficult task. Many disabled people struggle with the idea that it's ""all in their head.""You can help people with disabilities by showing that it's okay, or even heroic, to ask for help. This can help them have the courage to do this in real life.


Stay far away from stereotype that mental illness medications are for the weak.These medications may be the only way to have a decent or functional life.
For some people, a diagnosis and the subsequent accommodations are an enormous relief.It also affirms that it isn't a moral fault or ""not trying hard enough.""
Show disabled characters asking for help, and non-disabled characters asking the disabled character what they need.This can encourage the idea of people with disabilities asking for and receiving help when they need it.

, People with disabilities (especially teens) may feel insecure about being different and not ""passing"" as non-disabled.If disability is a significant part of the story, then this may be an interesting dynamic.


Some people with disabilities are very nervous about others knowing they are disabled. Others choose not to care what others think of them, and spend less energy on blending in.
Some people can ""pass"" as non-disabled, while others cannot.

, Almost all disabled people experience mistreatment related to their disability (including before they are diagnosed). Many have difficult childhoods, and get treated differently from their peers.Whether they experience constant ableism or are mostly shielded from it, it will affect them, their coping skills, their ability to ask for help and trust others, and how they handle conflict. Consider your character's past and how it has shaped them. They may have dealt with...


Bullying, being left out (few or no friends, very little media representation)
Being talked down to, or talked about as if they weren't there
Trying and failing to perform to non-disabled standards; seeing adults' disappointment
False ""helpers"" who don't listen and get discouraged or angry when the disabled person fails to stop being disabledAbusive therapies meant to ""cure"" deafness or autism symptoms
MoreThis depends on the severity of the disability, the quality of the community, how charismatic the disabled person can act, the family, and other factors.

Give your disabled character something to contribute.,
Let the disabled person be a character in their own right.,
Name the disability.Just as queer-baiting (hinting at homosexuality or bisexuality without outright using it)is frustrating, hinting at but refusing to mention a disability is frustrating to disabled readers.,
Avoid making disability evil.,
Don't make disability be the problem.,
Make characters inspiring because of what they do, not who they are.Most disabled people don't consider themselves heroic for walking or rolling down the street.,
Don't let disability stop romance.,
Show that characters with disabilities have adapted.,
Research individual disability stereotypes.,
Let your character be disabled at the end of the book.",How to Write a Disabled Character3," Many writers portray characters with disabilities as one-dimensional background characters with nothing useful to do. Disabled people aren't helpless.Let your character have meaningful skills and positive points to their personality. Show that the world is better off with them around.


Even a minor character can contribute something small to the plot: the observant autistic boy who notices that something is wrong, or the sister with cerebral palsy who has incredible computer skills.
Avoid having characters refer to the disabled character as a burden, tragedy, etc. (unless you wish to show that this character is cruel)

, Sometimes writers make the character exist only to reflect upon another character (to show how nice/evil the character is, or to burden them with a poor disabled family member).Or the character may be a Manic Pixie Dream Girl/Boy, who only exists to further the other character's development., Do them a favor and outright say the name of the disability. Your disabled readers will love it, and your non-disabled readers might learn a thing or two.


Aliens and fantasy creatures can have the names of human disabilities. The same disability existing in two worlds isn't going to be the least improbable thing in your story.

, Some works have one character with a disability: the villain. The villain might be a brainiac in a wheelchair, or the dangerous psychotic person with a mental illness. Most disabled people are no more evil or threatening than your average person, and also want to imagine themselves as awesome protagonists. Let people with disabilities be heroes for once.


If you absolutely need a disabled villain, then make several good disabled characters. That way, the villain is the exception and not the rule.
Otherwise, have no disabled characters at all. No representation is better than bad representation., Too often, books pose the idea that the person's disability is their key barrier, and they need to overcome their disability in order to be happy.This can be alienating to people who will be disabled for life, and suggests that they cannot be happy unless they become someone they are not.


Instead of showing the person becoming less disabled, show them learning to handle their disability better, and others learning to accommodate them.

, If you wish to show that a character with a disability is strong, then give them non-disability challenges to face. Maybe they won an election, spearheaded a project, or defeated the supervillain. Avoid falling prey to ""inspiration porn.""Disabled people don't exist solely to inspire non-disabled people.

, A common myth is that all disabled people are aromantic and asexual, like children. It is assumed that they cannot fall in love, kiss, or have sex, or that even if they could, they are not desirable. This is incredibly damaging to disabled people's self-esteem and romantic prospects.


If your story involves love and romance, then let characters with disabilities be included in that. This helps show that they desirable and worth dating.
A small portion of disabled people are aromantic and/or asexual (just like a small portion of non-disabled people are). If you have an aro/ace disabled character, consider showing other disabled characters who are in love, to make it clear that disability doesn't negate sexuality.

, Most disabled people are used to their disabilities, and can function pretty well on a day-to-day basis. (Newly disabled people may still be adjusting.) They have had plenty of time to learn what their body needs and get used to it.


In most cases, seeking a cure would be a poor use of time. It would be much more efficient to get accommodations (e.g. support at school, a better wheelchair), and focus their time on projects that use their talents and yield actual results.

, How do writers often fail when writing disability? How could you succeed in those areas? Look up tropes, and ask disabled people what annoys them most in the media.


Autistic people are often represented as clinical, unfeeling, cold,and/or intensely super-powered.Mentally ill people may be portrayed as intensely creative,or as dangerous people who deserve anything that happens to them.Medication doesn't always ""cure"" ADD; it is still a real disability even after treatment., Miraculously curing a disability reeks of lazy writing.Too many characters with disabilities end up cured or dead, suggesting that a happy ending and disability are opposite each other. This message is disheartening to people with lifelong disabilities. Instead, let your character be happy and disabled at the end.


A happy disability-related ending could be getting the accommodations they need: an awesome power wheelchair, a fun and helpful new therapy, their dad learning sign language, etc.
Or give them a regular happy ending: acceptance into their dream college, a sweet boyfriend, being elected to the Senate, or a group of awesome friends.

Brainstorm.,
Choose a way to write your book.,

,
Keep sending your book to publishers until it works out.",How to Publish a Book at a Young Age," Watch a favorite film, read a book or write down a dream that inspired you. Think about things that motivate you or spark your passion––these can be great topics for a book and you'll be enthusiastic about putting it together.


Take notice of how an author of a favorite book of yours describes things and the balance between description and action.
Make a list of possible topics for your novel, and pick the one that suits you best. Sometimes when people want to write a book, the first thing they do is choose a title. Well, that's not how it should be! The best way to choose a title is to write the story first, and then choose a title to match your story. Don't write your story to match your title.;
, You can type it on the computer, or write it in your journal. Whatever makes you more comfortable. Either way, you're going to end up typing it.

, Don't just write down the first words that pop into your head. Put a short plan together that describes the book and what direction you want to take it in. If it has characters, develop them on paper first. If it's a novel, what is your plot or story line?


Thesauruses can be a great help when trying to avoid simple or repetitive words.
Never write a word you do not know the meaning of, check it through a dictionary first. Nothing will happen if you write the first chapter with words you don't know what they mean!

, Set aside a regular time for writing the book and stick to this so that it gets finished. If you need to do research, set aside extra time for this too.


Research can be done online, via real-life interviews with people you know or with experts, and by visiting the library and reading books on your topic.

, Writing a book is not a competition for who can write the fastest. Take your time, especially when thinking of your ideas for the next paragraph.


If you get stuck, it is good to take a break from the writing and come back to it when you feel refreshed. A few days, even a week, might be helpful sometimes.

, You may start the book at age 15 and end it at age 45 if you let this happen! Sometimes it's easy to get sick of working on the book that you're editing, and then want to jump into writing another, but don't! Instead, persevere and continue your first project. It will feel amazing once you get it done,and you will actually feel accomplished (unlike how you would feel if you put it off....)

, The story you write first will not be what ends up being published––now is the time to ""polish"" your work and remove anything that doesn't enhance the story or book, fix grammatical errors and ensure consistency.


Read your work out loud. This is better than reading in your head for noticing any mistakes or rooms for improvement can be found faster and more efficiently.
Try to balance long sentences amongst the short ones.This will avoid boredom and create a smooth rhythm in your writing. Do this often, until it is close, or even is, perfect!

, You might want to do this with several people you know, to get a well-rounded amount of feedback on your work. Ask for advice and suggestions and correction for your story or work.


If someone doesn't like something you've written, chances are, a lot of people won't. Take it in your stride and follow their advice to make changes. Sometimes it's frustrating when you've just worked extremely hard on writing something, and then have all your friends and family tell you that you did a million things wrong, but see this as constructive criticism. Use it to improve your work.

, After considering the comments and suggestions of other people, you're still the author, and you have the final decision on what goes in your book and what doesn't.

Observe others, rather than take action.,
Mimic the customs and practices of others.,
Keep your voice low and unassuming.,
Ask thoughtful questions.",How to Blend In1," To blend in better in social situations, try observing, rather than taking action. Observe how others around you socialize and communicate. You can then hang out and simply watch, rather than participate, in conversations.When you are observing others, you may also notice how certain groups socialize with each other. You may then try to socialize with them in the same way to blend in better with their social group.;
, If you are a tourist in a foreign country trying to blend in, you should try to adopt the customs and practices of the locals. You can also mimic others to try to blend in with social groups at work, chatting about accepted topics of discussion and speaking in a similar tone of voice as everyone else.As a tourist in a foreign country, you can also blend in by learning some of the local language and customs. Speaking with locals in their own language or acting like locals act in general will help you blend in better.

, Modulate your voice to fit the tone and volume of those around you. This way, you can blend into the existing environment and not startle or freak out others.In an office environment, this may mean keeping your voice low and unassuming when you speak. You may take on a gentle, low tone so you can blend into conversations going on around you or the quieter sounds of an office.
In a foreign country, you should also be aware of the volume and tone of your voice. You do not want to be the tourist laughing and chatting loudly in a quiet local cafe. Try to adopt a tone of voice that mimics the locals around you and that allows you to blend in rather than stand out.

, Let others dominate the conversation and speak up every now and then to ask thoughtful questions that help keep the conversation going. This way, you are participating in the conversation but not drawing undue attention to yourself.For example, maybe you are joining an ongoing conversation at the office. Your co-workers may be discussing their weekends. Let them both share and ask questions like, “Do you go to the lake often?” or “How often do you go camping on the weekends?” These questions will keep the conversation flowing and allow you to be a part of the discussion.
If you are hanging out with friends who know each other well, they may not be interested in getting-to-know-you questions like “Where are you from?” or “How do you know each other?” To blend in better during the hang out, focus on contributing to the conversation by sharing your own experiences and thoughts that are on topic.

Identify why you want to be noticed.,
Understand your needs.,
Write a journal.",How to Be Noticed1," Knowing why you’d like to be noticed will help you to better understand your motivations. Sometimes being noticed is helpful when making a first impression during an interview or networking. Being noticed can also be helpful in social situations when you wanting to make connections, develop friendships, or start romantic relationships. Other times, wanting to be noticed may be an indication that some of your needs are not being met, such as feeling loved and feeling like you belong.


This might be an indication that you should work on starting, maintaining, or mending relationship to meet this need.;
, According to Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, basic human needs begin with physiological needs like food, water, and sleep. The next level is safety, in which you need security in life such as a job, a home, and your health. The third level is the need for friendship and belonging and the last two levels are esteem and self-actualization, which involve self-esteem, respect, creativity, and morality.

Be less critical.,
Don't over-analyze your interactions.,
Realize that you're not that big of a deal.,
Get practice.,
Be positive.,
Be fully engaged.,
Watch your body language.,
Initiate interactions.,
Embrace opportunities to meet new people.,
Make notes of what people may like.",How to Become Sociable," Some of the people who call themselves ""antisocial,"" tend to constantly criticize both themselves and those around them. They avoid social interaction because they are on the one hand afraid of being judged by others, and on the other hand (ironically) themselves extremely judgmental toward others. In order to become a more social person, it is important to accept that everybody, no matter how they may seem on the outside, has both positive and negative qualities. What separates the confident people from the insecure people is the attitude that they have toward themselves. Confident, social people tend to focus on the positive qualities of themselves and those around them, whereas unconfident, antisocial people focus on their own shortcomings and the shortcomings of the people they know.


Make a list of your own positive qualities. Be sure to include both internal (intellectual, emotional) and external (physical) qualities. Get in the habit of reminding yourself of these positive qualities on a daily basis, and counter each negative thought you have toward yourself with two positive ones.
Stop referring to yourself as shy, timid, or antisocial. The more you use these words to label yourself, the more you will reinforce the idea that you are incapable of social interaction! If the idea frightens you, remember that your perception by others depends not on them but on you. If you want to become a more social person, you have to start by actually believing that you are and can be a social person. Remind yourself that being sociable is a choice, not a predisposition.
Accept that human nature is good. While there are plenty of bad people out there, it is important to accept that humans can be loving, kind, and accepting creatures. Believing this will make you look forward to meeting new people rather than avoiding it.;
, Over-thinking is usually what prevents people from enjoying social interaction. While it may seem difficult, it is important to break the habits of anticipating what social interactions will be like before they happen, and of over-analyzing  them once they are over.


Rather than focusing on what may go wrong or how you may embarrass yourself, approach every new social interaction with a clean slate and a positive attitude.
When reflecting on past interactions, focus on the positive things rather than the negative ones. Even if it wasn't the most eventful or exciting interaction of your life, try to identify one good experience from each interaction you have, even if it is as simple as having been able to make somebody laugh.

, Interestingly, shy people who feel invisible and unwanted also tend to feel like they are constantly under a spotlight, being watched and criticized by others. This strange paradox of shyness is what prevents people from feeling comfortable being themselves in front of others. This doesn't mean that you should feel like an unimportant person, but rather, that you should acknowledge that you are your own worst critic; other people are simply too busy to constantly judge and criticize you.


Remember that people are so caught up in their own lives and interactions that they have little time to notice if you embarrass yourself, say something stupid, or don't look your best. Even if they do notice, it is very unlikely that they will care very much, as they have their own issues to deal with.
Recognize that everybody, to some extent or another, feels exactly the same way you do. Even the most social people still feel insecure and worry about embarrassing themselves; the only difference is that they choose to take the risk and enjoy themselves rather than worrying about how others will react.

, Just like any other skill, being sociable requires consistency and practice in order to master. This means you will have to get out of your comfort zone and force yourself to interact with other people on a regular basis. Avoid compartmentalizing your life and separating your ""social life"" from the rest of your life. If you truly want to be a social person, you will have to be social in all aspects of your life, from work to school to family.


Get in the habit of striking up casual conversations with the people you meet on a daily basis, including bank tellers, baristas, and cashiers.
Spend your free time with friends, when possible. If you are the type of person who spends a lot of time partaking in a certain hobby or physical activity alone, then consider inviting a friend along next time.
Always accept social invitations. Avoid making excuses like being too tired, having to wake up early the next day, or feeling unattractive. While some excuses are legitimate, others are simply used to avoid interaction. Learn to differentiate between honest excuses and dishonest ones.

, Everybody wants to be around people who are optimistic, upbeat, and happy. Even if you don't feel positive all of the time, you should at least act positive when talking to other people. For example, if somebody asks you to tell them about your life, focus on sharing the positive qualities of your life rather than complaining about the negative ones.


Making your life sound positive will instantly spark peoples' interest, and they will want to hear more about you.

, If you want to seem interesting to others, you will have to show interest in them, especially when you are in the middle of a conversation. When you are talking to somebody, listen to what they are saying rather than worrying about what you should be saying. Make eye contact, nod your head, and ask them follow-up questions.


Avoid constantly checking your phone or looking around you while you are in the middle of a conversation. These types of things come across as rude and suggest that you are uninterested in the person and conversation.

, If you are at a party or other social function, how you position your body sends a message to other people. If you want to be approached by others, you should avoid standing in the corner, crossing your arms, staring at your phone, and frowning.


Making eye contact with others and smiling shows them that you are friendly, open, and non-intimidating. Plus, everybody looks more attractive when they smile.

, If you are constantly waiting around for people to call you or invite you places, then you are wasting your life. Relationships are built upon a mutual effort; if you want to show people that you value their friendship, you will have to reach out to them and initiate opportunities to spend time with them.


Keep in touch with friends, even if you don't live in the same town. Pick up the phone and call them, send them a text, or e-mail them asking how they've been.

, The best way to make new friends and expand your social circle is to say yes to new opportunities to meet others. Accept invitations to parties and social gatherings, take trips to new places, and talk to strangers in cafes, on the bus, at school, on airplanes, etc.


While meeting strangers may seem intimidating, think of it this way: if you don't know them to begin with, then you really have nothing to lose if things don't work out. On the other hand, you never know when a stranger can turn into your new best friend, business partner, or love interest!

, It is hard to remember what each and every person you have met so far likes or what he or she is interested in. So, when you go home make notes of what this person likes. Research it properly and when you meet them again talk to them about it. You will be surprised by the number of friends you will make by just learning what each one of them is interested in It may seem hard and time consuming at first so start by your classmates or colleges.

Remember to not get carried away. For example, do not go as far as stalking the person on social networking sites. Just knowing by how much points did Barcelona won with and the next time they are going to play in a match is enough. Even that person will continue the conversation so you don't have to worry about reaching a dead end.

Wear dark clothing.,
Avoid eye contact.,
Keep your thoughts and opinions to yourself.",How to Blend In2," You can blend in more easily in a crowd by wearing clothing that is dark in color, such as black, dark gray, and dark blue. Bright colors often make you stand out and announce your presence to others.


You may decide to create a uniform of dark clothing that you wear throughout the week, such as dark blue jeans and black sweaters or shirts. You may then wear this dark clothing every day to blend in, no matter where you are.

, Eye contact is a key part of projecting positive body language that is welcoming to others.You can blend in and avoid interactions with people by averting your gaze so you do not make eye contact. Often, people will take a lack of eye contact as a sign you are not interested in making conversation or in connecting with others.


You can also demonstrate closed body language, where you fold your arms over your chest and turn your body away from the person you are interacting with. These actions will likely discourage people from speaking or interacting with you and allow you to blend in more easily in a group.

, You can also blend in by not speaking up or saying much at all when you are around a group of friends or acquaintances. Staying silent when you are around others will make your presence less known and allow you to be almost invisible. This is not a great way to make friends or connect with others, but it will deflect attention away from you.You may also spend time on your own more than with others or with friends, as you will not have to worry about trying to blend into a group when you are alone. This can be isolating and lonely, but it can at least ensure that you will not stand out or be noticed by others.

, Try to schedule time in your day for worrying or a “worry period.” This could be a set time and place for worrying, where you are given free reign to worry about whatever is on your mind. This could be at your desk from 4 pm to 4:20 pm or in your bedroom from 7 am to 7:15 am. You are only allowed to worry during your “worry period,” making the rest of your day a worry-free space.During your “worry period” you can also create a worry list, where you write down a list of your worries and then allow yourself to consider them. You could list small worries, such as, “How am I going to get all my work done for the day”, and bigger worries, such as, “How am I going to afford my rent”. Once the “worry period” is over, you should put the list away and try to go about your day.
If a worry pops into your head during the day, make a mental note of it and then try to go about your day. Remember that you will have time to think about it later and do not need to consider it now. You can add it to the worry list at the end of the day.

, You should also maintain a healthy, balanced diet where you focus on having meals that are nourishing and provide lots of vitamins and minerals.

Confidence is social situations is a key factor is starting and maintaining friendships. This confidence will help you get noticed by others. There are several ways you can communicate confidence in social situations. Try to walk taller, speak clearly, and act like you belong in every social situation. Having inner confidence will show on the outside and make you more noticeable to others.


This can be hard at first, especially if you have never acted this way before. Keep practicing and you'll get it eventually.Try practicing when you are alone at home before you use these methods in public. Stand in front of the mirror and practice talking in a firm manner. Look over your posture and make sure you are standing straight and with purpose. Also try making direct contact with yourself in the mirror to practice doing it with others., Body language is the unspoken form of communication in which you indirectly communicate things about yourself to others. It can be very subtle and you might not even know you do it. You can use this form of communication to your advantage, because it doesn’t even require you to talk. Body language can communicate confidence and command attention. One common stance that exudes these traits is standing in a way that takes up space. Try sitting with a strait back with your arms unfolded. Hold your shoulders apart, making them broad to take up more space. This is much better and commanding than sitting hunched with crossed arms.


This also works when standing. You can adopt a wide stance with your legs, stand straight and tall, and broaden your shoulders to communicate you are present and confident. Research shows that simply adopting this body language, even when you don’t feel confident, can foster you confidence.
Essentially, faking the confidence at first will make you feel confident, and that is because these types of assertive stances release higher testosterone and lower cortical in the brain. , Being assertive will make you be noticed more. In a group situations, try to be more forceful in your comments and discussions without being arrogant. Make statements that start with ""I"" in order to get across how you feel and draw attention to yourself.

Practice ""I"" statements in the mirror to be more assertive in your opinions. This will help you make more of an impact when you are in a group.

, The way you speak to others is another important way to convey confidence as well as be noticed. How you speak with others can determine how they relate to you, and also how you connect with others. Two important aspects of speaking to show confidence are your volume and how fast or slow you speak. If you are not being noticed, it is likely that you often speak softly where others cannot hear you, or possibly you speak so quickly that others cannot understand. Moderating your volume and speed can help to solve these issues to make connection more probable.


Try to speak at an even space to ensure your message is being received. You can even try taking some pauses or breaths between ideas to ensure you are not speaking too quickly. Don’t yell but try to project your voice to ensure you are heard. This might be awkward at first, but doing this will get you noticed more often.
A good way to test this would be role playing with a friend. Turn on some music or the TV to simulate the noise level in the environment you will be in. Try different voice levels with your friend to see if he or she can hear you and understand what you are saying. Ask for feedback to see if your voice is too loud. Practice the volume that is easiest to hear and understand, but not uncomfortable to listen to, such as yelling., Another way to get noticed is to work on your tone of voice. Research shows that your tone of voice accounts for 38% of how other receive message that convey your attitude and feelings. If you speak in a flat monotone voice, others may think you are bored or feeling down. Pay attention to your tone and ensure you are using a strong, attractive tone.


Speech experts recommend speaking from the diaphragm, which ensure that you will not have a nasally or weak sound. They also recommend taking a signing class or acting class to learn how to breathe properly and project your voice from the diaphragm. Acting in this way will help you get noticed more by those around you.

, Being your true self is a fantastic way to be noticed. This allows you to rely on what makes you uniquely you to influence others and their perceptions of you. Being authentic means be who you truly are at your core, and it is a key way to make deep connections with others and be noticed. Being authentic can be intimidating because you may feel vulnerable letting others in on all your quirky thoughts or having them know your true opinions, but this is how they will begin to see who you are and notice how you are a unique contribution to the group.To be authentic, you shouldn’t censor your opinions or feelings about things, especially if you are in a group of people who will listen without judgment. However, it is important to remember that certain topics, such as politics, abortion, sex, or religion, are typically uncomfortable when you’re in company you don’t know well. Stick to topics that are uplifting and show your personality, creativity, and spontaneity.

, Changing the way you dress can make you more noticeable to those around you. This doesn't mean you should wear wild clothes or strange outfits to get others to notice you. Instead, dress in clothes that compliment your body shape, your height, and your coloring. Wear clothes that you feel comfortable but that will also help you stand out. Try to spice it up a little to lift your spirits and help you get noticed. Pick a brightly colored tie or pocket square that isn't garish. Pick a dress that has a nice, bold pattern that isn't too busy. Just switch around your wardrobe to express the newer, confident you and people will start to notice.


You can also try new hair styles or get a hair cut. You can also change around your accessories or wear new shoes. These should make you feel better about yourself and get you noticed by those around you."

There might be different activities going on in different parts of the space. If this is the case, you can start with the area in which you feel most at ease.

Try to position yourself in a part of the room where you’re likely to be most comfortable.

, If you focus on what you have in common, you’re likely to start to feel more confident. One of the reasons that strangers often talk about the weather is that it’s one thing we all have in common. This isn’t a bad place to start, but try to think of other options.

For example, “I’m Pam’s daughter,” if the people at the party are friends of your mother, or “I’m an anthropology major,” if this is a college department party.
You can follow up by asking the other person to say his own name, but most of the time people respond by introducing themselves without being asked.

, If you don’t know anyone at the party, no one will have heard you tell your favorite funny anecdotes. Think about sharing a funny thing that happened to you. This will make you seem more relatable and friendly.Be careful not to tell a story that may offend others. After all, humor is sometimes different across different groups of people.
If you have a good story, it can fill in a conversational lull. Or you can connect your story to someone else’s statement, saying, “That reminds me of something that happened to me one time…”

, Making small talk is a way of sharing general information with another person as a means to learn what you might have in common. For example, asking about favorite movies is often a good way to find mutual interests. Something as simple as asking about the recent blockbuster can lead into multiple conversational paths.


Making small talk might lead to deeper conversations, or it might not. Small talk is often less about the information shared than the good feelings that it provides.
You’ll want to stick to non-intimate, non-controversial topics to keep your conversation on a light note.

, One of the things you’ll have in common with everyone else at the party is that you’re both there. Perhaps you all had to battle traffic to get to the party. Use this as a means to get to know other people, whether through questions, comments, or observations.Be unfailingly complimentary in your comments. This would be the wrong time to complain about the lack of your favorite drink, or how you’ve always hated evening gatherings.
You could ask other people how they know the hostess, or if this is their first time among the group also.

, When you're nervous about not knowing anyone at a party, it might be difficult to concentrate on the conversations that come up. It will help your focus to repeat parts of what another person has said to assure them you've heard what was said. Use nonverbal cues, such as nodding, eye contact, and leaning towards the person, to let the other guest know that you're actively listening to what she has to say.Try to avoid talking over the other person while she’s talking, even if she’s talking about a topic you’re interested in.
Ask plenty of open-ended questions about topics the other guest has brought up in order to keep the conversation going.
Be sensitive to the emotions that the conversation is bringing up in the person. Generally, party conversations tend to be fun and light. If you find your conversation getting too intense or emotional, it's okay to back off a little.

, Conversations at parties start and end rapidly, and if you’re talking with someone you’ve just met, it’s a good idea not to keep the conversation going on too long.Have an excuse prepared for needing to leave. This is a time when it’s okay not to tell the truth.
You can always say, “I have to get up early tomorrow,” or even just, “Please, excuse me. I need to find the ladies’.”
You can say, “It was nice to meet you,” or “Great talking to you!” Some people like to shake hands, but at some parties this might be too formal.
If you like, you can include an excuse for breaking off the conversation. For example, you can say, “I don’t want to dominate your evening,” or “I should probably let you talk to other people here.”

Start a side conversation.,
Notice if you can help someone else.",How to Be Social at a Party when You Don't Know Anyone There3," You’ll need to speak with a louder voice if you want to be heard. You’ll need to let others know that you’d like to talk by physically moving closer to them than you might at a quieter party.Large parties are often more chaotic, with people interrupting one another, or talking quickly to make sure they get their point across.
One way to effectively join in a group conversation is to repeat the last phrase that another person said, and join it with your own thoughts. For example, if someone’s just shared a story about being in Paris in April, you might echo, “Yes, Paris in April is beautiful, and for my college graduation, I was able to go to Rome, which I thought was wonderfully diverse.”
Topics often change very quickly in a group conversation, so don’t worry too much about being exactly on topic. Being friendly is the main consideration.

, If you’re the kind of person who’d rather be at home with a book, you might have a hard time adapting to being in a large group of people. Each person has her own way of getting energized for a party. You might listen to the music, and try to get into the rhythm of it. Or, you can think of party scenes from some of your favorite movies, and imagine yourself in the role of the heroine.Even if you’re not totally at ease about being at the party, trying act as if you’re comfortable can help speed the process. (This is sometimes called, “Fake it until you make it!”)
If you find yourself getting drained, make an excuse to get away for a short time. Taking a break by yourself can be a way for an introvert to recharge her batteries and return to the party refreshed.

, If you really appreciate the kind of focused conversation that can happen between two people who know each other well, you’ll have to adjust to the fact that this isn’t likely to happen at the large party. Rather than becoming grumpy about what’s not going to happen, it’s a better idea to rescale your expectations.Conversations in groups tend to be very broad, about a wide range of rapidly shifting topics. The goal of party conversations tends to be less on exchange of information and ideas, than on sharing a common good feeling.
Good conversational choices for talking in groups include: short funny anecdotes, joking around, wordplay.
Topics to avoid include: detailed analysis of a topic, anything that might unintentionally offend others, including political discussion, or discussions of religious faith and practice.

, In a large group of people, you can sometimes find conversation easier by addressing one person, rather than the whole group. Little side conversations often break off of larger group conversations, either related to the topic the larger group is discussing or completely unrelated.It’s okay to talk while others are talking when you’re in a large group; it’s not rude to have a side conversation.
Sometimes the conversation might end abruptly if the group conversation shifts to something more interesting. It’s okay to move back and forth between the small side conversation and the larger group conversation.

, If you’re attentive, you may notice that there’s another person who can’t make his way into the conversational flow. See if you can signal your willingness to help him by making eye contact with him, nodding or smiling.Sometimes you can help support another person who’s trying to make a point. For example, by asking a clarifying question about the subject he’s brought up or restating what he’s said in a new way.
If you’re good at talking in groups, make sure that you’re not taking up too much of everyone’s attention. One way to do this is to use your skills to help others join in the discussion.

Work out what is driving your need to be liked by everyone.,
Accept that some people won't ever like you.,
Show enthusiasm.",How to Be Liked by Other People1," If it's a genuine desire to be harmonious, friendly and considerate of your fellow human beings, that's a great reason to seek out being liked. On the other hand, if it's motivated by needing to have confirmation that you're a good and worthy person, then you'll need to reach that acceptance inwardly first, otherwise you'll risk having others take advantage of you and you'll end up being miserable every time someone fails to like you.


If you feel that you need to change yourself, to be more ingratiating, pleasing or giving in when around other people, spend some time learning how to voice your own preferences, wishes and needs in a way that isn't bossy, threatening or angry. Learn to communicate assertively and firmly, while remaining polite and considerate of others. Understand that compromise is a good tool too, allowing both sides to get a little of something each of what they want while still getting along with each other.;
, That's a simple result of the diversity of people in the world. People annoy one another for various reasons and sometimes, no matter what you do or say, you remind another person of someone they don't like and they unconsciously don't like you for it. Your political, faith, lifestyle, etc. choices and your values are other reasons why not everyone will like you and it's not only hard to stay completely neutral, it's unrealistic because that's not what being human is about. So, in some cases, just be ready to stay polite but accept that liking each other isn't going to come through.

, Communication is the transfer of energy/emotion. Everyone seems to love someone with enthusiasm because we all admire it and wish we had more! Enthusiastic people seem to brighten up a room with their positive energy, and we want that to rub off on us, we want to be a part of it. When someone is enthusiastic about our thoughts and ideas we immediately feel understood, appreciated and just plain great! No one will ever be offended by you getting excited about their ideas!

Be friendly.,
Demonstrate liking and appreciation.,
Match and mirror.,
Listen.,
Link to others' interests.,
Ask for advice.,
Share compliments and praise.,
Adopt their values/beliefs.,
Develop attending skills.,
Help others.",How to Be Liked by Other People2," Make it clear that you're willing to talk to people and that you'll be interested in what they have to say to you––the biggest compliment of all. Show smiles and warmth. The first contact with another person is your face! Make sure that you present as warm, friendly and happy. A smile and a sincere desire for friendship will resonate in your voice and be demonstrated in your every action. First impressions are powerful; present the way you want to be remembered - so smile! Smiling shows that you are happy to see the other person and like them. Smiling and warmth make others feel good around you; use this skill and you will shine.

, Most people instinctively like people who like them (and vice versa). Many people like each other, but rarely tell each other. Make it a point to tell people close to you that you like them and appreciate them - they already know this, but it's still great to hear. With people you've just met, if you like them, say things like ""It's been great getting to know you; I love to meet warm, open people."""" I really liked the way you talked about (insert comment)."" Or, ""Thank you for making me feel so welcome in your home. I had a great time today - let's pick another time to get together soon."" These are just a few examples. Can you come up with better ones? Sincere appreciation like this supports friendship and cements relationships.

, Matching and mirroring simply means that you match the approximate characteristics of the other person to help create alignment with them. Therefore, if they cross their legs, do the same shortly after. If they tend to talk more slowly, slow your rhythm down so it is closer to theirs. If they use certain lingo, you can use it later in the conversation. If they are reserved, you be more reserved. And so on. Remember, we like people who are like us. This is a natural process that most people do unconsciously anyway - now you can know to do it consciously. It is a very powerful tool because vocal tone/speed and body language account for 93% of communication. This tool will make people very comfortable around you and is a very subtle technique.

, Listening is the foundation of all skills. Every person on the planet loves to be listened to! Think about it. How do you feel when someone ignores you or talks over you? Do you feel connected to these people? No! Who are the people you are closest too? It's highly likely that they are the people who listen to you intently and are concerned about your issues and well-being, right? Listening says, ""I'm listening because you, and therefore, what you have to say, are important."" People's greatest desire is to be truly listened to. Help them accomplish this most important goal, and they will like and admire you for it. Practice ""conversational generosity"" - don't speak more than 30 percent of the time (10 to 20 percent is optimal).

, Opposites don't attract! People like each because of their similarities. So, whenever possible, notice similar interests and be sure to talk about and expand on them. This may take some searching and questioning to discover their interests - that's okay - people will be glad that you are so interested in them that you ask several questions about them. Even if you don't have any similar activities, have them discuss an area you find interesting or want to explore.


For example, you boss might love golf but you have never played. However, if you have a sincere interest in learning the game, ask your boss to explain some things about the game to you. It's likely that you boss will be thrilled that you are interested and will feel complimented that you want him or her to be your teacher and that you value his or her advice. Think of ways you can use this tool.

, An old quote by Thoreau states, ""The greatest compliment ever paid me was when someone asked me what I thought, and attended to the answer."" Asking for advice is perhaps the most sincere compliment you can pay to a person. You also have to humble yourself ever so slightly to ask for advice, and this vulnerability will create a sense of openness and trust between you. People are always happy to give advice and will associate that sense of happiness to you quickly. Aren't your friends the ones whom you go to for advice? How can this person give you advice and not be your friend? See how strong this link is? People also admire someone who can ask for and accept advice. So few people can do this well that it has become an admirable trait. Try it and see.

, No, this is not ""kissing up"" or being phony - this never works! What we are looking to do is notice praise-worthy things people discuss and mention them to the person. Notice the difference in the next two responses. Your new friend tells you they just won an award for helping children and you say either ""that's great!"" or ""Wow, that's quite an accomplishment! You must have made a tremendous contribution to the lives of those children, you should be very proud."" Which response would you rather hear? Are they both true? Yes! Will one response have more impact and create a stronger connection? Definitely, yes! Noticing and commenting on the good people do and their special qualities is a great way to live, it is classy, and a great way to connect with others.

, As you are listening to the other person speak, notice their values/beliefs, and discuss areas where your values/beliefs sincerely overlap with theirs. Remember that is best to speak 30% or less of the time. Take at least half of this time and use it to agree with, support, or expand on whatever the other person was talking about. You will never make a friend by disagreeing with them. Let points you don't agree with slip by, and chime in when you hear something you agree with. By doing this you will make a friend, and at the same time, subtly promote the areas you believe in and starve the areas you don't.

, This simply means that you attend to the needs of the people you are with. It follows the lines of simple good manners, i.e., holding the door for someone, offering them a drink or a chair, buying them lunch, shaking their hand right away when you see them, etc. Almost any small courtesy or act of kindness falls in this category. These simple acts say without words that the other person is like, respected and appreciated. (And an action is worth what? That's right! A thousand words!)

, Helping others may impress people around you, but helping not only impresses others, it gives you that warm glow inside you. You lose nothing but give out kindness and may even receive thanks (but don't do it with that expectation in mind). Help your friends and all those around you, don't leave them when they have a problem.

Spend more time than usual getting ready.,
Wear something that makes you feel confident.,
Don’t carry a purse or bag.,
Stand up straight.,
Give yourself a compliment before you leave the house.",How to Be the Most Irresistible Woman at a Party1," Take the extra time to focus on yourself and put the effort into your appearance. Put on your makeup slowly and thoroughly; don’t skimp on curling on your eyelashes or making sure that you love your lip color. Focus on ensuring that you like everything about your appearance and that you go the extra mile in terms of feeling beautiful and confident.;
, Wear one of your favorite outfits that you’ve worn before. When you know you look good, you feel and look more confident.Confidence is key to irresistibility because people are naturally attracted to confident people.


Many people feel confident in clothes that are sexy, and many people find women in sexy clothes irresistible. If you are comfortable, wear something that is sexy but still maintains an air of mystery. A good rule of thumb is to have one sexy element in your outfit, but then to keep everything else subtle.
For example, you could wear a loose, low-cut top with a pair of skinny jeans.
You could also wear a dress that is short but not low-cut.
You could also try wearing classically irresistible colors, such as red and black. These colors are bold, and people’s eyes will be drawn to you.

, Try to put everything you own in your pockets, if you have them. If you need to carry a bag, ask the host of the party if you can leave it somewhere safe in their house. Carrying a bag will tempt you to play with the distractions in it, like your cell phone, instead of engaging with people at the party. It also gives people the impression that you’re about to leave.

, Good posture makes you look and feel more confident. Pull back your shoulders and try to imagine yourself standing as tall as you possibly can. Remind yourself to stand up straight throughout the course of the party.You also want to make sure you look comfortable, relaxed, and approachable. Knowing what to do with your hands and being aware of fidgeting (especially if you don't have your phone or purse on you) will help you seem more at ease. Keep your hands occupied with a drink, a small plate of food, or set your hand on your hip. If you're having a conversation, you can use your hands to gesture, to gently touch the person you are talking to on the arm. Try not to play with your hair or jewelry too much, as you may appear nervous.

, Think three great things about yourself. Maybe your hair looks great, you’re easy to talk to, and you just got a promotion at work. Or maybe you did a great job with your winged eyeliner, your friend just chose you as a bridesmaid, and you finally finished a chapter of your novel. Whatever it is, use it to pump yourself up before you go out!

Talk to everyone at the party.,
Give compliments.,
Use the Platinum Rule.,
Have a list of questions to ask if the conversation lags.,
Ask people about themselves.,
Make eye contact.,
Speak slowly and smile.,
Flirt.",How to Be the Most Irresistible Woman at a Party2," Don’t just talk to your friends or the people you know at the party. Introduce yourself to new people, and make yourself open to strangers and new conversations. Try to find something in common with each person you meet.When you're chatting people up, remember to try and make them feel comfortable. People are drawn to others who make them feel at ease by showing a nonjudgmental air and overall acceptance. If someone tells a joke that falls flat, acknowledge it with a little chuckle.

, People love to hear good things about themselves. It could also start an interesting conversation if you ask a question that stems from the compliment.For example, you could ask, “I really like your headband. Where did you get it?”
You could also try, “The host’s dog loves you! Do you have one at home?”

, You might be familiar with the Golden Rule, which is to treat others the way you want to be treated. The Platinum Rule, however, is to treat others the way that they want to be treated. In other words, be receptive to people when you have conversations with them.For example, if the person can’t hear what you’re saying, ask her if she wants to go stand outside for a few minutes, where it’s quieter.
Or, if you are talking to someone who can’t stop talking about her daughters, keep asking questions about her daughters. Don’t feel like you need to shift the conversation to a different topic every few minutes.
Or, if you are talking to someone who seems shy and reticent to talk about herself, talk about yourself more. Connecting with someone on an interpersonal level has a different path depending on the particular person involved.

, Sometimes you don’t connect with a particular person, and that’s okay. But if you want to keep the conversation going with someone, it can be helpful to have a list of backup questions for when the awkward silence happens. Here are some sample questions:How do you know the host?
What do you think of the food?
Have you tried any of the drinks here?
What do you do for a living?
What did you do last weekend?
What’s your favorite thing to do on a totally free Saturday?
Where did you grow up?

, People love to talk about themselves and will like you if you ask them about their hobbies, interests, careers, and family. Let the conversation flow naturally. If the person wants to talk about his cats for ten minutes but then talk about you, let it happen. Avoid topics you really don’t want to discuss, but be open to having new conversations.

, Eye contact lets people know that you’re focused only on them, not on the party surrounding them. Make eye contact for as long as you can with the person (without it seeming weird).If you are having trouble making eye contact, focus on the space between the person’s eyes.

, To convey the impression that you’re relaxed and comfortable, speak slowly and smile at the people you’re talking to. Smiling makes you appear friendly and open. Speaking slowly lets the person know that you’re not nervous about speaking to her. Both traits are important when you’re trying to socialize well and make new friends!, If you are interested in anyone at the party, make efforts to flirt with him. There are many different ways to flirt with people, so you should only do what you’re comfortable with. Here are some suggestions for ways to flirt:


Touch the other person. You don’t have to do this extensively, but a light touch on the arm or shoulder can convey flirtiness to the other person. Use a compliment as an excuse: “I love this shirt; this blue really brings out your eyes.”
Initiate the conversation with the other person. Being assertive and starting the conversation will signal to the other person that you sought him out and are interested in him. Say, “I don’t think we’ve met before, but I think we should.”
Tease the person a little bit. Light teasing can be flirty, but be careful of hurting the other person’s feelings. What’s light for one person can be hurtful to another. Try something along the lines of, “I hope you’re better at dancing than you are at beer pong!”
Leave the conversation early so that the person wants to see more of you. Maybe he will seek you out later in the night! Say something like, “I’m going to go get another drink, but you should find me later.”"
"
Put yourself out there.,
Stop caring what people think -- or look like it.,
Develop your confidence.,
Get a grip on social norms.,
Embrace your awkwardness.,
Don't show up too early or too late.",How to Be Less Awkward1," If you already feel too awkward to even know how to properly greet your next-door neighbor, then the last thing you probably want to do is to put yourself out there and spend more time interacting with people. However, the more time you spent with people, the more comfortable you'll be socially, and the less afraid you'll be of saying or doing the wrong thing. Make a goal of spending more time with people and less time holed up at home.


Meet a variety of people through different networks, such as the school newspaper, the tennis team, or a youth group, and learn how to hang out with people with different interests and backgrounds.
If you don't feel like you thrive in a group environment, invite a friend or an acquaintance for coffee or a small outing first. Getting to know people on an individual level can help you build the confidence to hang out in a group setting.
Don't be silent. You can still not be putting yourself out there even if you're in a room full of people. Though you don't have to try to be the belle of the ball, if you're the shy sort of awkward, then make it a goal to speak up a bit more and to make your presence known so you're more comfortable with people reacting to you.;
, Though it's impossible for anyone, even Justin Bieber or Brad Pitt, to ever fully stop caring about what people think, you can still make an effort to care less about what people think about you. If you're paralyzed by the thought of doing something wrong because you don't want to offend, bore, or annoy anyone around you, then you'll never be able to overcome your social awkwardness.


The next time you talk to someone, tell yourself that you're taking a risk and being dynamic, and that it's better to get the reaction you want than to do nothing.
People can also tell if you're obsessed with what they think if you're constantly asking questions about what they think. If you always say things like, ""Do you think my new haircut sucks?"" or ""Do you think I should stop playing the cello?"" then you'll look like you don't have a mind of your own.
If you stop caring about what people think, you'll be on your way to developing your confidence and sense of self. Working to meet your private goals and doing the things you love is a lot more important than pleasing the people around you.
Don't let people catch you checking out your reflection in a window or staring at yourself in the mirror. This will make it look like you're overly-concerned with your image.

, Though developing your confidence is easier said than done, you need to work on improving your self-worth if you want to be less awkward. Part of being awkward stems from feeling like you just don't ""get it,"" and don't know how to act around people who all look like they know what they're doing. Well, until you see that you're not any worse than the people around you, you won't be able to interact with others on an equal playing field.


Take pride in doing the things you love. Whether you love classic movies, building model planes, or running, you should spend time doing the things you enjoy to improve your sense of self.
Though no perfect wardrobe or haircut will actually make you feel confident, taking the time to shower, groom yourself, and offer a presentable face to the world will make you feel better about yourself for sure.
Hang out with people who make you feel good about yourself instead of the people who put you down. Part of the reason you may be feeling awkward around other people is because the people you're with don't make you feel valued.

, Another reason that people feel awkward is because they feel like they just don't know what to do in a social situation, and find themselves constantly saying something inappropriate or misreading social cues. Well, there's no handbook that can teach you exactly how to understand social norms and to be less awkward, but there are a few things you can do to get a better grip on social norms:


If you have a friend or just an acquaintance who has amazing social skills, try to spend more time around that person to get a better understanding of how he pulls it off.
If you did something that really offended someone or just failed socially, make a note of it so you can avoid it the next time around.
Learn to read the dynamics of situation before you jump into it. If people are joking around in a group, it's not the time to talk about the hard math test coming up. On the other hand, if one person is talking about how sad he is after his break-up, it's not the time to tell an off-color joke.

, You don't have to be as cool as James Dean to make people like you. In fact, being awkward, bumbling around, and spilling food all over yourself can actually endear you to people. Though you can work on improving your social skills, you shouldn't try to be super smooth, or people will know that you're not really being yourself. Embracing your awkwardness doesn't mean saying, ""I'm so awkward!"" every two seconds; but it does mean being comfortable with your occasional lack of social grace.


Learn to laugh at yourself. That will make people more comfortable around you and will be happy that you're willing to admit you're imperfect.
You don't have to be self-deprecating to make fun of yourself occasionally using the right tone. For example, if you always spill on yourself and someone has pointed out the big awkward ketchup stain on your pants, just say, ""Trust me, it's usually worse,"" instead of looking all embarrassed and uncomfortable.

, Though this may sound like a small point, a lot of social awkwardness comes from bad timing. If you showed up super early to an event and are the first one there, then you may get stuck talking to the person organizing the event without having much to say, or you may feel like you're just in the way and are better standing off to the side. On the other hand, if you show up to an event way too late, everyone will have already developed their dynamic, and it may be more difficult to insert yourself into the conversation.


If you're going to a party, showing up exactly on time may make you look a little bit too eager. Show up at least fifteen minutes late if there's no rigid deadline. Of course, don't show up late if it'll look rude.

"
Be interested -- not interesting.,
Ask thoughtful and open-ended questions.,
Master the art of small talk.,
Avoid personal subjects at first.,
Don't overshare.,
Read the person to avoid offending him or her.",How to Be Less Awkward2," This is a key rule when meeting new people. You may be obsessed with reporting the coolest fact you read on the news or you may want to wow your new acquaintance with your extensive knowledge of Italian cuisine, but if you want to have a positive social interaction, you should focus on showing interest in the other person's life instead of talking on and on about yourself. Here are some ways to show interest without coming on too strong at the beginning of a conversation:


If the person is reading a book, ask him how he likes it.
If the person is wearing a sweater with a college's name on it and you know something about the school, ask if the person went there and talk about what he thinks of it.
You can ask the person where he or she is headed if you bump into each other, and that can strike up a conversation about that person's interests.
Ask the person about his or her plans for the weekend.

, When you should interest in a person, you shouldn't just ask any question that comes to your mind or the person will think you're being random or even rude. Ask questions that can lead to a long answer and show that you're putting in some effort in getting to know the person. Don't ask a question that can be answered with a simple ""yes"" or ""no"" unless you have an immediate follow-up. Here are some ways to pose a thoughtful question:


""Nice tennis racket. How long have you been playing?""
""Mary always throws the best parties. How do you know her?""
""I love Catcher in the Rye. Are you reading that for fun, or for school? What do you think of it?""
""What did you think of Mr. Peterson's test? I couldn't believe how hard it was.""

, To get to know new people, you have to master the art of small talk. Small talk may sound silly, but it's exactly what gets you to know a person and to be able to have a more meaningful discussion as the conversation progresses. Making small talk just means being able to keep up the flow of a conversation, to learn to build from one topic to the next, and to read social cues to see what the person really want to talk about. Here are some things to keep in mind as you try to make small talk:


Make the person comfortable. Put the person at ease by smiling, not leaning in too close, and giving him all of your attention.
Reveal something small about yourself. Say that you love watching hockey, that you grew up in Brooklyn, or that your favorite subject is history -- just give the other person something small to work with.
Be a good listener. If the person mentions that he has a sister in passing, you can circle back to it if the subject of siblings come up; then, you can say, ""You mentioned you had a sister. Are you close in age?"" and the person will be impressed that you remembered.
Engage the person. Make sure that you're asking questions and keeping the conversation moving back and forth without dominating the conversation or letting the person do all the talking.

, As you and the other person get to know each other, you can start to talk about more personal topics. At first, though, it's better to steer clear, or you'll risk making the other person uncomfortable. One of the reason people feel awkward is because they bring up a subject that clearly makes the other person uncomfortable but they don't know why. Here are some topics to avoid when you're talking to a person for the first time:


Serious breakups
The death of a loved one
Sexual experience
Health problems you may be having
Deep personal struggles
Embarrassing moments

, Oversharing is related to getting too personal. You may be the kind of awkward person who sees that the other person has nothing to say, and then compensates by talking nonstop, wondering, ""How the heck did I end up talking about my grandmother's bronchitis?"" Though you may think that talking about anything that comes to your mind will make the conversation keep going, it's actually better to pause and redirect the conversation in a more comfortable way. Here are some other things you should avoid mentioning to a new person unless you want to risk oversharing:


Your deepest longings
Your deep-seated issues with your parents
Your unsatisfying childhood
Your feelings of sadness, loneliness, alienation, or any other deeply negative emotion
The weird rash on your arm
That time you got so drunk that you threw up

, You should get a sense of what the new person is like before you try out your raunchiest jokes or start harshly criticizing a past president. Remember that every person is different, and that not everybody shares your perspective on politics, religion, or even sports. Remember that you and the new person may be in a similar social circle, but that this doesn't mean that the person has the same perspective on all the people around you. Here are some topics to avoid so you don't offend a new person:


Any lewd jokes
Harsh criticism of the current or past president
Comments on the undoubtable/impossible existence of God
Criticism of a person you both know
Criticism of all the fans of an ""inferior"" sports team that the person might like
Inside jokes that you share with other people
Any general comments that would make the person think, ""I guess I have to get to know this person for that weird comment to make sense...""

"
"
Don't be too eager.,
Give meaningful compliments.,
Manage your body language.,
Put the person at ease.,
Know when to leave.",How to Be Less Awkward3," Being awkward around your peers and perfect strangers is difficult enough, but being awkward around someone you actually like can begin to feel impossible. Still, there are a few things you can do to have more social grace around your crush, and it starts with playing it cool and not acting like a puppy who is ready to hump the leg of anyone who comes by. Here are some ways to play it cool without looking too eager:


Smile and say hello, but don't go in for a hug unless you're at ""hug"" status with the person. If you're not sure, wait for the person to initiate the hug.
If you see the person coming down the hall, approach him or her if you're nearby, but don't run to the other end of the building just to say hi or you'll look like a stalker.
Don't nod too vigorously at everything the person says, thinking that it will just help you show your interest. Making meaningful replies is more effective than nodding.
Avoid laughing at every little thing the person says -- especially if he or she isn't even trying to be funny.

, To be less socially awkward, you have to be able to recognize the difference between a ""creepy comment"" and a ""nice comment."" Don't tell a girl, ""You have such soft, fluffy hair. I just want to run my hands through it,"" unless you want her to slowly back away. Instead, say, ""I like your haircut. It makes you look kind of like "" The compliment should let the person see that you're paying attention without feeling like you're putting too much pressure on.


""You have a great smile"" or ""You have a great laugh"" are usually safe bets.
Complimenting a girl's dress or jewelry can make her feel special.
Complimenting an aspect of the person's personality can work too; telling a guy he has a great sense of humor will make him feel good.
Use your compliments sparingly. If you compliment the person every two seconds, he or she may get annoyed or even overwhelmed.

, One socially awkward move is the ""close talk,"" which is standing so close to a person that you're practically already trying to kiss him or her. You may be doing this just because you want to show interest, but standing inches away from a person and leaning in so far that the person keeps moving back will not endear you to your love interest.


Maintain a respectable distance and use your arms to gesture occasionally to make your conversation more dynamic.
Make eye contact but look away every once in a while so you don't come off as too intense.
Don't reach out to touch a girl's hair unless you're invited to. It's important to respect her personal space for her to remain comfortable with you.

, Remember that the person you like may return your feelings and could be feeling a little awkward too. You should work on putting the person at ease by being friendly, laughing at something the person said if you know it was meant to be funny, and giving the person the reaction she wants from her statements. If she says something funny, laugh; if she's being serious, get the big grin off your face. Make the person feel like you're on the same level and that you won't be pulling any tricks.


If you're entertaining you love interest as a guest, make her feel more comfortable by offer her a drink, snacks, or a seat.
Poking fun at yourself a bit will make the person feel more relaxed.
If the person accidentally spills or drops something, just say, ""That happens to me all the time.""

, Since social awkwardness does have a lot to do with timing, you should not only know when you should enter a conversation, but you should also know when you should leave it. If you're talking to a person you like, you should get out of the conversation before you both run out of things to say, when you're still having an easy flow of conversation, so the person will want to keep talking to you next time.


And if the person makes it clear that you're not wanted by checking her watch or phone or looking around for her friends, then politely say goodbye.
If you're not wanted, just say, ""It's been fun talking to you"" instead of, ""Well, I know when I'm not wanted,"" which will only make things worse.
And if you've had a good conversation, just say, ""I look forward to catching up again soon"" and leave with your head high.

Get yourself out there.,
Pursue hobbies that interest you.,
Find a cause you are passionate about.,
Do something new often.",How to Become Interesting to Other People1," You have to meet people in order to become interesting to them. This requires you getting out there, even if doing so is beyond your comfort zone. Join clubs, attend parties, sign up to play on a team, or do anything you can that will introduce you to new people.


Attend these events with a friend, if you are uncomfortable going in not knowing anyone. Having someone familiar there can make the situation less awkward, which can help your most interesting self start to emerge.;
, By delving into activities that appeal to you, you have the opportunity to meet people who like the same thing. You also get to talk about what you love, which can show how interesting you are.


If you like reading, for example, you could start book club or attend one sponsored by your local library.
Keep your values in mind as you spend more time cultivating your interests. If you’re someone who loves to help others, for example, spending time volunteering will feel genuine to who you are. The more authentic you can be in your interactions, the more likely people are to take interest in the real you.
Look online to find local events that pertain to your interests. Meetup.com is a great resource to find people near you., There’s a good chance there is something you believe in. Become involved in it when you realize what it is. Reading about the different causes gives you information you may not have had previously, which can make you more interesting to others.


Joining a cause or movement also connects you with others. Meeting people and learning from them not only makes you more informed about what’s going on, but gives you more to talk about.For example, you may choose to become more active in local politics, women's rights, or animal rights groups in your community or nationally.

, There’s not much that’s interesting about routine. Never going out and exploring something new prevents you from becoming more worldly, and ultimately, more interesting. Find something to do you never have as often as possible. You’ll meet new people and have more to talk about.Travel can expose you to new and exciting experiences beyond your every day life. Seek out new places to broaden your horizons.

Read as much as you can.,
Listen to others.,
Ask questions.,
Learn how to be a good storyteller.",How to Become Interesting to Other People2," You can’t be very interesting if you don’t know much. Whether its current events, politics, history, or the local sports team, learning more about them gives you material to talk about. Immerse yourself in books, newspapers, magazines, and online news to keep you well-informed. Seek out topics you are interested in to learn new things you can share with others.


Forget trying to learn about something that doesn’t strike your fancy. You’re not going to retain the information well and you won’t feel excited about discovering the ins and outs of it. Instead, focus on what you’re interested in and you’ll get much more out of it., Some of the best ways to learn something new is to hear about it from others. Make sure you actually listen to what the person is talking about instead of just waiting for them to finish so that you can interject. Being a good listener during a conversation shows the person that you are genuinely interested in what they have to say, which is a great way to make a new friend or build upon an already existing relationship.


Learning to really listen when in a conversation can take a tremendous amount of willpower. You may want to interrupt so that you make a good impression with your knowledge or humor, but doing so can actually backfire. You may come off as rude or a know-it-all. Instead, give the speaker your full attention and only comment when they are finished and when you can add something meaningful to the conversation., Asking someone questions shows that you are interested in finding out more about them or what they are talking about, and also helps you to learn more information. People who are interesting never stop trying to learn. They are often extremely curious and do what they can to find out about their interests as much as possible.


Get more out of the conversation by asking questions that can’t be answered with a simple “yes” or “no.” For example, instead of asking, “Are you interested in rock climbing,” you could say, “What kind of activities are you interested in?” This gives you the opportunity to learn more and have a deeper conversation with the person., Most people love to listen to stories. Cultivate a knack for telling stories by starting with an engaging hook and making the story simple. The best stories are humorous or reveal a truth about our world. Try to make the stories you share with others fit this model for the most success."
"
Keep your ego at home.,
Talk about your experiences.,
Come up with a plan.,
Be yourself.",How to Become Interesting to Other People3," People often mistake having confidence with being interesting. However, the opposite is true. If you come across as too into yourself, you’re going to lose potential connections and friends.


Avoid talking about stories or ideas that make you come across as egotistical. Additionally, don’t make the conversation only about you. Instead, make sure you ask the other person questions and make them feel like they are valuable to you and your story.For example, you might relay a story about yourself and then shift the attention to someone else. Say, ""Rob, I saw you nodding. It seems like you can relate to that experience. Will you share it with us?""

, Not everyone will have the same opportunities you have had. Telling others about what you’ve done shows them just how interesting you are. The more engaging your stories, the more they will want to hear them.


Practice being a good storyteller by rehearsing your stories before they make their debut. Shape them into something you’d want to hear and chances are, others will, as well.Focus on sharing ""human stories"" that build bridges rather than set you apart. Think about your audience and share experiences that you think they can relate to.

, You don’t want to go into a party or social scene without having some sort of game plan. Think about interesting conversation starters and stories you want to tell before you walk in. Avoid using small talk as an opening, if possible. If not, be sure to have something else to talk about in your back pocket.


Giving someone a compliment is an excellent and often effective conversation starter. The person will likely elaborate on what you’ve complimented them on, which can lead to you showing just how interesting you are. Furthermore, the person will likely feel comfortable and open to talking to you since you began the interaction with a compliment., Don’t be afraid to show the world your quirks. In fact, they could be what makes you so interesting. Interesting people rarely follow the crowd. Instead, they trail-blaze and create their own.For instance, if you are drawn to bright colors or bold patterns, wear them with pride. Your clothing choices may catch others' attention or serve as an ice-breaker to make a new friend.

"
"
Avert your eyes.,
Stay anonymous.,
Preoccupy yourself with something else.,
Use your phone.,
Listen to music.,
Pretend to be late.,
Use an App.",How to Avoid Strange People1," Averting your eyes signals to the other person that you are not interested in a conversation. Even if the other person has already engaged you, a slight diversion in eye contact can signal to them that you do not want to continue the conversation. The rest of your body language can also play a part. Angle your body away from the person and cross your arms or look down.
If you're with a friend, turn and engage in conversation so you can avoid looking at the person you don't want to talk to.;
, Acting as if you are alone in your environment makes people want to leave you alone. If there's something about you that stands out, it can act as an unwanted conversation starter.


Clothing can help you blend in or stand out. If you want to blend in, try wearing jeans and a dark-colored top, with plain shoes.
In the summer, wear sunglasses; in the winter, wear a big coat with a hood.

, Sometimes averting your eyes isn’t a strong enough cue to signal to the other person that you do not wish to talk to them. Instead, draw your attention toward something in your environment. Changing your body language is a strong indicator that you do not have time to converse.


Rummage for something in your bag, if you have one.
Stop, and look at something around you. Try window shopping if you are on the street, or read a sign that is posted in the hallway.
Pretend as if something is wrong with your shoe, and stop to fix it.

, You do not have to actually use your phone, just pretend to be speaking to someone. Turn slightly away from the person watching you and begin a one-sided conversation; they'll be none the wiser.


Pretend to answer a phone call. Keep talking as you walk away from the person you want to avoid.
Make sure that your phone is silenced or on vibrate; it would be a dead give-away if you were to receive a call while you are pretending to talk on it!

, Wear headphones or earbuds so it seems as if you are listening to something. Pretending to listen intently can signal to the other person that you do not want to be disturbed. If you seem to be lost in what you are listening to, you can even get away with not acknowledging the other person.

, Even before you are close enough to converse with someone, you can nonverbally signal to them that you are too busy to talk. Check your watch often and look like you're in a hurry. Tell them ""I'm sorry, I'm running late,"" if they try to engage you.

, There are many apps in the works now for smart-phone users to help them avoid others they don’t want to see. uses location-tagged social media (like facebook, twitter, and Instagram) posts to help you avoid large crowds . and work similarly by helping you find out the location of a specific person, if you would like to avoid someone in particular .

"
"
Isolate the behavior that bothers you the most.,
Be firm.,
Walk away.,
Seek outside help.",How to Avoid Strange People2," It could be that the person you want to avoid is actually very nice, but they have a particular habit that rubs you the wrong way. Manage your interactions with this particular person to keep the annoying habit at bay.


If it is the other person’s hygiene habits (a bad smell, picking teeth, etc) that make them seem strange, stand farther away when talking to them or keep conversations to a minimum. In the case of a bad smell, wear loose clothing to pull over your nose (discreetly) so that you won’t be distracted by it.
Try changing the conversation if he/she consistently brings up a subject you are uncomfortable with.
Interact with this person only if there are others around so that you won’t be stuck with the other person by yourself and you can make an easy escape.
Set parameters for your interactions. If you notice the behavior only emerges at certain times (for example, boasting after taking an exam) or around certain people, avoid that person at those times.

, For some people, avoidant (nonsocial) behavior won’t work. You will need to be more obvious in your intentions. Don't be afraid to be direct; this might be the only way to let the other person know that you are uncomfortable.


If someone you don't want to talk to insists on approaching you, it's fine to make an excuse and leave.
If you want to be more direct, tell them, ""I'm sorry, I don't want to talk right now.""

, If all else fails, walk away. You do not have to stay in a situation that makes you uncomfortable. Even though it might feel rude at the time, if someone keeps pestering you in a way you don't like, it's best to leave.


This is especially true if the person is a complete stranger. Walk in the other direction to disengage.
If it's someone you know, you can use an excuse to slip away, or just start walking.

, If the strange behavior crosses a line, ask advice from a trusted friend. They might be able to shed some light on the situation. You can also go to an authority for help if the person continues to bother you.


If a strange person's behavior constitutes harassment, speak to a teacher or supervisor to discuss what actions to take.
If you feel you are in physical danger, seek help from law enforcement.

Find a conversation partner.,
Join a group.,
Break the ice.,
Introduce yourself.,
Find a common interest.,
Compliment the person.,
Listen intently.,
Offer information about yourself.,
Be sincere.,
Use discretion.,
Make a common excuse.,
Use an interruption to your benefit.,
Consider the person’s time.,
Get contact information.,
Return to the original subject.",How to Be Social with People You Don't Know," Scan the room and see if there is anyone else who appears approachable and/ or to be hanging out by herself. You can then slowly make your way towards her to start up a conversation.


Ask your host beforehand if there is anyone else there who isn’t normally part of the group. You can keep an eye out for this person and mention that your host suggested you talk.
Look for cues that the other person doesn’t know anyone, too. This includes scanning the room or standing in the corner away from the crowd. Even if you notice that another person approaches your intended conversation mate, you can also join the two of them and start a conversation.
Remember that it’s important to take initiative in situations where you don’t know other people. Not only can it draw people to you, but also make you seem approachable.;
, In some cases, you may be at a large event like a conference or wedding where people tend to congregate in groups. Gradually ease yourself into the crowd of people with whom you’d like to engage and then take the opportunity to make a statement and introduce yourself.Stand by a member of the group until you make eye contact and can introduce yourself.
Listen to the conversation for a few minutes as you try and join the group. You can start by standing a bit to the outside of the group and move in slowly by saying, “May I move in a bit? I’m really interested in what’s being said.”

, Once you’ve found a person or group with whom you want to socialize, you’ll need to relieve the tension of approaching someone you don’t know. Find a general or clever statement that can kick off a conversation.Figure out things to say before you actually get to the person. For example, if you see an individual you’d like to talk to, notice something that the person is wearing or doing as a way to break the ice. For example, you could say “There are so many accountants in one space- this lawyer feels like a fish out of water.”
Turn to the person standing next to you and make a funny comment or compliment. For example, if someone makes a controversial statement you could say “Did I just hear him correctly?” or “I couldn’t keep my eyes off of your beautiful bag.”

, After you’ve broken the ice, introduce yourself to your conversation mate or mates. Make sure to ask for the other person’s name and repeat it. Not only does this show your interest in the person, but it can also help you remember the person’s name. Say something brief about yourself. For example, try ""Hi, my name is Catherine and I’m new to the office. I work in the public relations division. What’s your name and where do you work?""Try commenting on the person’s name to help you remember it and further break the ice. For example, you could say ""Krishna is such a beautiful and unusual name. What is its origin?” or ""Alex, you and my dearest cousin share a name!""
Consider introducing yourself to one person in a group and asking for an introduction to the rest of the participants., It can be relatively easy to keep a conversation going once you’ve introduced yourself by finding something that ties you to the other person. Draw on the common situation or something you notice about the person to hold the person’s interest. Your conversation partner may also be able to introduce you to others with similar interests.


Notice what the person is wearing or something else about them. For example, you could say “I noticed you have the new iPad Air. My model is four years old and I’m in the market for a new one. How do you like that one?” or “I couldn’t help but notice that you’re reading the same book as me. What do you think of it?”
Use the situation to your benefit. For example, if you are at a sporting event say “Are you here participating or watching?” At a work event you could say, “I work in sales and marketing, where do you work?”

, Most people love flattery. Find something nice about the person to say and compliment it. This can help stimulate further conversation and may help you meet other people, too.


Make sure your compliment is sincere. Most people can tell when someone is feeding them a line and it may turn the person off of you and the conversation.Focus your compliment on something about their appearance, demeanor, or item they own. For example, you can say “I couldn’t help but staring at that beautiful nail color,” or “That was a beautiful talk! You are so eloquent and engaging,” or “I see you have the latest Android. I’ve been trying to get my hands on it and can’t. I’m totally jealous you have it!”
Thank the person if they compliment you back. You can use this as a way to invite them to get to know you better.

, Ask questions and repeat key points during the conversation. Not only does this show that you’re listening closely, but also that you are interested in the person or group.Use natural pauses in the conversation to ask questions about something the person has said. You can also repeat an item as a part of your question. For example, you could say “You said that you’re headed to a remote region of Nepal for business. Where are you going? I’ve been to Nepal before and might be able to offer some tips on things to see and do.”
Recognize any changes to the overall tone or demeanor, which can signal you to ask a question or offer a statement. For example, if the person appears hesitant to say something you could say “You mentioned that one of your duties is to check up on lab ethics. How do you find balance if you encounter a bad situation?”

, A good conversation is all about balance between each conversation partner. Make sure that you have a chance to talk and let the person or group know something about you and your interests.


Allow the conversation to flow naturally and offer information at the right moment. For example, if the group is talking about something that you work on or have interest in, you could say “That’s a really interesting point, Sara. I’ve been working on a similar issue and have noticed the same patterns. Has anyone else here seen them?”
Give your opinion or make statements without being overbearing or interrupting others. For example, you can say ""I see your point, but I don't share it. I believe that it's right for every person to have the same right to work.""
Make sure the information you offer about yourself is similar to what others tell about themselves. For example, if the conversation is strictly related to work, keep your comments to your professional life and don’t add anything about your personal situation.

, Most people don’t like being around someone who acts fake. One of the best ways to attract people to socialize with you is by keeping your comments and questions sincere.Acknowledge what the other person or members of a group are saying. For example, you could say “I really understand where you are coming from on that point, Edward.”
Try and talk about different topics. Since you don’t know the people, consider keeping the conversation light and funny.

, Avoid giving away too much information or talking about others when you’re with people you don’t know. Saying too much may make people uncomfortable and want to stay away from you.Keep comments that might be offensive or touch on a sensitive topic to yourself. It’s often a good idea to keep your views on politics or religion to yourself when you’re with a group or person who you don’t know.
Ask honest questions if you’re unsure of something. For example, you could say “I thought stem cell research was fairly controversial within the evangelical community. Could you tell me a little bit more about it?”
Remember to not say anything negative about others. If you’re among people you don’t know, you unlikely don’t know who is friends with whom. Refrain from making any negative comments or agreeing with something mean someone else says. You can get yourself out of these situations by saying something like “Oh, I don’t know him, so I don’t have anything to add.”

, Chances are that you’ll want or need to end a conversation with a person or people you don’t know.Make up a common excuse to get you out of the conversation and leave the experience positive.You might tell the others that you are:


Going to grab another drink or some more food.
Making an important phone call.
Heading to the restroom.
Getting some fresh air., If something or someone interrupts your conversation, take it as end your interaction.This can help you find another person or group with whom to socialize or bring into the conversation.


Recognize natural pauses in the conversation. If there are a lot of “ums” and “ahs,” this may be your cue to excuse yourself. You could say “oh, I just realized how late it is” after looking at a clock or your watch or “I’ve really enjoyed talking, but I need to excuse myself and go to the restroom.”
Look for a common item in the room that jogs your memory. For example, say “wow, I didn’t realize that the buffet is closing down so early. I need to grab something to eat because I haven’t had dinner yet,” after glancing towards the food.
See if there is anyone else with whom you’ve chatted at the event and mention the person to your conversation partner. For example, you could say “You know, I was just talking to that gentleman Tom about this same thing. Maybe we could make our way in that direction and get his views. He had a really interesting take on the matter.”, Frame your exit as beneficial to your conversation mate or mates. You can make comments such as “I don’t want to monopolize your time” to signal that you’re ready to finish the conversation.Excuse yourself with phrases such as “I’m sure don’t want me to monopolize your time with all of these interesting people around. I’ll let you go in the hope that we’ll see each other again soon.”, Ask the person or group for a way to stay in contact or follow up on the conversation. This can naturally cue them that you need to excuse yourself and that the chat is over.Ask the person for their email address or phone number because you’d like to continue the conversation. If you’re in a business setting, you can ask if the person has a business card. Let the person know you’ll follow up to figure out a way to meet again.
Take a quick glance at the information and confirm it back to the person, which shows that you respect her.Make sure to follow up with the person if you’ve said you will contact her for coffee or another conversation.

, Bringing the conversation back to what you first discussed can help end the exchange. Repeat the person’s name in your final comment and consider asking a question to end on a positive note.Keep this transition natural by asking a question related to what broke the ice.For example, you could say “Sara, I’m so sorry but I have a terrible memory and can’t remember the name of that nail polish. Could you please tell me again?” After she mentions it, tell her “I need to find my phone and put the name in before I forget it again.”

Instead, find the right mix of humor and seriousness that will let women know you’re fun and easy to be around, but are also strong and serious.


Tell a joke every once in a while.
Avoid being funny all the time. Don’t make it your goal to make people laugh.
Use humor to fill potentially awkward silences or to break the ice with a girl.
Make sure your humor is always appropriate for the setting. For instance, don’t joke about death at a funeral or a wedding.;
, Work on being approachable and easy to talk to. Often people who are shy turn girls off, for they appear boring and uninteresting. Instead, be approachable so people can sense that you're engaged and open to new relationships.


Don’t be afraid to chit chat. Be friendly and talk to people.
Look well-adjusted and happy. In order for girls to approach you, they need to sense that you’re a well-adjusted and happy person. As a result, try to smile and respond to people in a positive way.
Smile and look at girls in an inviting way. Make sure you make eye contact with girls in a positive way. However, don’t be creepy and don’t stalk them with your eyes. Just let them know that you’re friendly and interested.
Let others know you like to have a good time. Show others that you are interested in having fun. If girls know that you’re into having a good time, they’ll likely gravitate to you., To be a chick magnet, you need to constantly show respect to the women and girls around you. Respect speaks volumes. Women who know you respect them will want to be around you.


Show respect to the girls and women around you. Don't speak for them, assume you know what they want, or bully or push them into doing something they don't want to do. As for all people you come in contact with, you should respect their opinions, listen to them, and engage them as equals.
Show respect to everyone around you.
Be polite to women and to everyone you come into contact with, not just women you want to date. Women and girls can tell when you're faking it to impress them, and most of them will not be attracted to a guy who is disrespectful of anyone.

, For many women, maturity is an extremely attractive quality. By acting mature, you'll show the girls around you that you stand out in front of the rest of the guys they know.


Don’t goof off with your friends in front of girls.
Don’t act out at school to get attention, if you go to school.
If a girl shoots you down, politely thank her for her time and move on. Nothing is less appealing to other girls than a person who can’t take rejection. Letting a rejection roll of your back with ease will show everyone around you how confident you really are.
Do your work and do it diligently. Success is an important part of being mature. Women often gravitate toward successful people., When people perceive you as someone who is relaxed and does not get excited over small things, they’ll likely see you as someone worth being around. Because of this, you should act as cool and calm as you can. This will compliment your confident demeanor and help you attract women.


When you’re meeting a girl, don’t show that you are anxious about the details like what or where you are going to meet up. While it’s okay to be clear and direct about important details, don’t show that you are anxious about them.
Avoid acting over-excited about getting a date with a girl or anything similar. If you show you are over-excited, you may seem desperate.
Don’t let your emotions get the better of you. Always act calm and cool, even if you’re excited about something., Avoid vulgarity at all times. When you're vulgar you demonstrate that you lack class and don't respect the people around you. Consider the following:


Don’t curse.
Avoid saying inappropriate things. For instance, don’t joke about sex or sexual relations. This could be a major turn off.
Never make inappropriate gestures to your friends or to anyone else., Even though you want to let all of the girls know how cool you are, bragging or boasting may undermine your entire game. Bragging or boasting might turn girls off. It might also signal to some people that you are actually insecure about yourself or your position.


Let your coolness or ability speak for itself. If you’re super awesome, people will talk about how you are super awesome.
Invite girls to events you take part in, rather than bragging about them. For instance, if you’re a star baseball player, invite them to your game.
While it may be okay to talk a little about the cool things you’re doing, you’ve done, or other achievements, never go into detail and just mention them briefly., Perhaps the most important part of being a chick magnet is exuding confidence. Confidence helps draw people to you. This goes for women, too.


Tell yourself that you are a competent, capable, and attractive person. Trust in this and trust in yourself.
Non-confident people tend to make other people question themselves. , Thinking positively will not only help you build confidence, but it will also help you create a positive mind frame that others can sense. Such a mindset will give you motivation and put you in the right place to gain the attention of girls.


Thinking positively will translate into being positive to other people. Positive people are more fun to be around.
Focus on the good in everything. If something bad happens to you at school or at work, like you receive a poor grade or you are passed over for promotion, try to find good in it. View it as a learning experience. Others will see this and may be impressed., Staying focused on your goal of being a chick magnet is very important. If you lose focus, you’ll likely make a bunch of mistakes that will undermine your ultimate goal of attracting women. Make sure you:


Don’t lose your cool if you’re angry or frustrated.
Don't treat anyone with disrespect, especially girls or women. Your reputation will affect how other girls view you.
Get in the habit of having a chick magnet-related routine. Make sure you do the same stuff every day to prepare yourself for the world and for meeting women. Allocate enough time for grooming, for exercising, and for everything else you need to do.

, An important element of being a chick magnet is positive body language and good posture. Positive body language and good posture will show women that you are confident, put together, and approachable. It may also put people at ease when they are around you.


Smile when appropriate.
Avoid crossing your arms.
Never walk or stand slumped over. Your shoulders should be high and chest should be out a little bit., One great way to be a chick magnet is to make sure you are in shape, attractive, and appealing to women. While you don’t have to have six-pack abs or giant muscles, you should try to be relatively fit and healthy.


Consider toning up. Toning up your body might be a little work, but it will pay off. Try some light weight training and a cardio activity like running or swimming.
Don’t go overboard on the weight lifting or muscle building. Many women are intimidated or turned off by a person that is completely ripped.
Watch what you eat. Make sure you don’t overeat. Overeating may cause you to pack on the pounds and ruin your chance of being a chick magnet., When dressing, you should be comfortable yet look sharp. This is important because comfort will make you appear confident and laid back, but looking sharp will let girls know that you are put together and conscious of your appearance.


There's no need to put on a fancy outfit that doesn't feel like you at all. Instead, try to build a wardrobe of decent clothes that feel comfortable.
Girls will swerve to avoid slobs, so make sure your comfort does not trump looking sharp. If you’re comfortable in jeans and a t-shirt, this is fine. Just make sure that your clothes are clean and free from stains or unintentional rips or tears.
Avoid wearing the same shirt you already wore a few days ago. While you may think no one notices, some girls do., While comfort and sharpness is important, you also need to wear clothes that look good on you. Put a good bit of thought into this before changing your wardrobe.


Avoid clothes that are either too small on you or too big on you. Clothes that are too large are especially dangerous, as you might look slobby or larger than you actually are.
Choose shirts that complement your figure and skin tone. If you’re not really trim or built like an athlete, avoid clothes that are too tight. They may not be flattering.
Try clothes that compliment your hair and eye color. If you’ve got green or blue eyes, wearing other green or blue might draw those colors out. This might help attract women.
If you're wearing a shirt that is supposed to be tucked in, tuck it in. Leaving the shirt untucked will make you look sloppy, but tucking it in too much will give you a not-so-cool appearance. Make sure you pull your shirt out just a little bit so it hangs over your belt a little bit., Keeping good physical hygiene is key in being a chick magnet. If you’re unhygienic, this will probably turn girls off. As a result, make sure you always clean and groom yourself appropriately.


Shower every day. Make sure to use soap and shampoo. It will leave you smelling and looking clean. Also, make sure to wash behind your ears.
Brush your teeth twice a day (or after meals). Brushing your teeth regularly will help ensure you’ve got white teeth and good breath. It will also help prevent tooth decay and gum disease.
Use deodorant.

Take a cue from nature and learn the best ways to camouflage yourself., Neutrals include black, white, brown, khaki, navy and gray.Limit use of any bright colors to one small item, as an accent.


Avoid graphics, including logos, and wild patterns on your clothing. Unless you are hanging out with a group of fashionistas, those busy leggings and rapper-designed sneakers will attract attention, and a lot of it!
Limit accessories to 1 or 2, and keep them small and tasteful. Leave the expensive handbag or watch at home.

, Wear a suit to a formal academic or professional meeting, but not to a movie date.


Avoid wearing hobby or job related gear out of context. A fishing vest should only be worn when fishing. Also leave the camo at home unless you are actually hunting.Bring appropriate gear for the weather. Walking around in the pouring rain without an umbrella or jacket will attract attention from others, much like wearing shorts in a snowstorm.

, Cover tattoos and/or noticeable birthmarks with clothing or makeup, if possible.


If you are planning to get some (or more) body art, make sure it is on a part of your body you can hide easily without having to wearing odd clothing. A tattoo on your upper arm that can be hidden under a short sleeve shirt will help you be invisible, while a full arm sleeve requiring long sleeves in hot temperatures will draw attention.
When removing a piercing, use a spacer to prevent the hole closing. You can get one at jewelry stores or piercing shops.

, Dye your hair only shades found naturally in hair. Avoid trying out the newest trend in styles or cuts. It’s better to let others work out the kinks and wait until the style is widely socially acceptable.


Your hair doesn’t have to be your natural shade, but blue or green will create the opposite effect of what you want! Trendy hair colors like gray and pale pink will also garner lots of attention.

, Avoid emphasizing one feature over others. Makeup application has become a popular artistic expression and pastime, but just as following the latest clothing or hair trends garners glares and double-takes, so will dramatic makeup.

Look busy to prevent being approached.",How to Avoid Being Noticed2," Whether in class, at social gathering, or out in public, attempts to withdraw from everyone around you will only make you more noticeable. Lone individuals are much more likely to be noticed and remembered than a quiet member of a crowd or group. The better you “fit in,” the more invisible you are.

, When someone addresses you, respond politely and directly, and don’t avoid eye contact. Pay attention in class so you can answer a question if called on by your teacher. Avoiding spreading gossip and say only kind things about others.


There’s no need to engage in a detailed conversation with everyone you meet, but saying thank you to the cashier or bank teller will make them less likely to remember you than looking at your feet and not saying a word.
If you have an issue with someone, address it with them in person. Talking negatively about someone brings more attention to you than to them.
A good rule of thumb is to treat others like you would like to be treated if in their shoes.

, You don’t want to be the center of attention, but you also don’t want to appear to be avoiding it.Sit at a table near other people instead of a dark corner alone. You will look less like an outsider than just another person in the room.
Avoid sitting in the back or front rows in class. The teacher is more likely to call on you if you look like you are trying to hide in the back.

, On the bus or train, use your smartphone or bring a book. Wear headphones when walking around or sitting down. In class, take notes to show you are paying attention.

If you are from Florida and used to warmer weather, pack layers instead of heavy clothes. Also pack neutral colors and common items, like jeans and t-shirts until you observe local styles.


Look up normal temperatures during the month of your visit and the rest of the year. Compare these to those where you live to get an idea of how local people might dress for the weather. Wear a neutral or modest outfit the first day or two until you have observed what most people in the area are wearing.Wearing graphic leggings and trendy shapes might make you stick out in a rural setting, for example.

, A Gucci bag or Rolex will make you stand out in most places, and will also make you a target for thieves.


Keep accessories simple. Unless you are attending a special event, leave most of your jewelry at home.
Use good judgment. Louis Vuitton luggage might look perfectly natural in L.A., but will be a flashing sign of wealth in a small town.

, Nothing says ‘tourist’ like a camera bag, tennis shoes, and a handful of maps.Use your smartphone’s map application instead of a physical map. They usually have GPS features too, so are easy to follow.
Carry a nice camera if you have one, but your phone probably has a good camera on it already, and is sufficient for most outings.

, Especially when traveling abroad, adhering to local customs will help you fit in better even if you look “foreign.” People always appreciate it when you take their culture into consideration by following basic social rules. In Muslim countries, wear pants instead of shorts. Avoid sleeveless shirts and low collars.
Look in travel guides and on travel sites online to see what is commonly acceptable for men, women and teens to do. You don’t have to act like a native by missing out on fun experiences, but do them with the humbleness of a guest.
Ask friends or family who have visited the same place for advice on cultural differences.

, “Hello,” “please,” and “thank you” are necessary words to know. Also know how to ask someone if they speak English, and how to tell them you don’t speak the native language fluently.


Speak clearly and at a normal pace. Take time to pronounce words correctly.
If someone doesn’t understand you, try different words or thank them and find someone who speaks your language.
If traveling within your own country, people may know you are from out of town by your accent. If you cannot avoid being noticed for speaking differently, you can shift their attention to detail by being polite and respectful.

, Americans speak much more loudly than most other cultures. Use a softer voice than you do at home to ensure you are not yelling at native speakers.

, Looking nervous or uncomfortable will attract attention and may cause people to avoid you. Walk with good posture, make eye contact when speaking to people, and smile. , If you don’t know where you are going, walk confidently to a café or shop to ask for directions or look at a map.Keep your gaze straight ahead instead of looking quickly and repeatedly in all directions, especially while walking. Avoid stopping in the middle of a street or public area.


Never pull out a map on the street or in a busy public space.
If you don’t see an official you can ask for help, like a policeman or guard, go inside a business or tourist site nearby and ask for directions. Asking multiple passers-by on the street will bring all eyes to you.
If you are confused about where you are, try to keep your gaze ahead of you. Looking forward makes you appear to know where you are going. Try not to look all around you as you walk.

Recognize that sometimes, crowded places are unavoidable.,
Consider the environment.,
Arrive early or late.,
Make a plan.,
Have an exit strategy.,
Seek out or ask about quiet places.,
Know alternate routes.,
Make a calm-down area if possible.",How to Avoid Crowded Places," Sometimes, you'll be taken aback by a crowded place, with no warning that there was going to be a crowd at all. Other times, you just flat-out can't avoid the crowd for whatever reason - maybe it's ""rush hour"" at your current location. Because of this, it's important to have coping mechanisms for when you do have to deal with crowds. Some examples of coping mechanisms are:


Humming or singing to yourself quietly
Playing with a fidget or stim toy (for autistic people, stimming may also provide some help)
Wearing earplugs or headphones to drown out the noise
Focusing on visual stimuli (e.g. looking at a phone screen)

Deep breathing or meditating
;
, In order to avoid a crowded area in the first place, you're going to have to have a rough idea of how many people tend to gather at the area in question. For example, concerts are typically jam-packed with people who are all loud and you're almost guaranteed to get jostled around. On the flip side, somewhere like a bookstore or a library is much quieter and the people in it are less likely to be in clusters. All environments are different.


If you're in an environment such as school or work, it's more likely to be crowded at some times than others. Try to use the less crowded times to get where you need to go.
Avoid extremely crowded and chaotic environments (e.g. stores on Black Friday). These areas will most likely trigger a panic attack, sensory overload, or both.

, When you can't avoid a situation where there's going to be a crowd, taking steps to minimize your exposure to said crowd can do a lot. Show up a little early to school, before the crowd arrives, or arrive a little late to the party, when people will already be settled and you can have more time to talk to the host directly (although this may be a bit loud). Minimizing your time in a crowd can help you cope a lot.

, When you're going to a place that may be crowded, a way of dealing with the potential crowd is to plan what you're going to do when you get there so you can get from Point A to Point B with minimal problems. For example, if you're at work and you need to drop off papers, restock a room, and get to a meeting room, try planning to do all of those tasks without wandering around, unsure of what to do.

, Try to locate exits as soon as possible, before a crowd comes in. (It may be beneficial to have a map of the place, if possible.) When you walk into a place, always look for a place to get out. Do your best to know about at least two: the one you came in through and another door that you know leads to outside or a quieter place.


Some places, such as classrooms or office buildings, may only have one door (and thus, only one exit). In these cases, you may just have to try and get to the door before or after everyone else does.
Don't open a door without knowing where it leads; you might end up finding only a utility closet, or even worse, walk in on someone in the bathroom!

, Chances are, there's somebody ""in charge"" where you're at. Try asking them about what places are quietest, and where exits are located - if they're giving you a tour of the place or are your designated guide, that's even better. Most people who know the area better than you do will be happy to tell you where the quieter locations are.


If you don't smoke, try to avoid going outside to the smoking area, especially if you're sensitive to smell. Secondhand smoke, aside from smelling bad and getting on your clothes, is bad for your lungs.
Public bathrooms, especially ones in schools, may smell fairly bad. You may want to consider a different area if the bathroom is public, or is extremely crowded.

, At a point when it's quiet, search around to find alternate routes that would allow you to get somewhere quieter. That way, if there's a crowd when you don't expect one, you can get out of the situation faster. Oftentimes, there are alternate routes to important places, so try utilizing one of these routes when you know there's a crowd.

, Obviously, if you don't come to the area all that often or if the area isn't yours, you may not be able to create a quiet area for yourself. However, at a place such as work or school, it may be possible to create a quiet spot for yourself where you can go if there's a crowd. Make sure the quiet place is actually located in a quiet area, has plenty of things for you to mess around with while you calm down, and is easily accessible - you shouldn't have to be forcing yourself under your desk if you can't fit there.


If you go to school and the school administration won't allow you to make a quiet spot, point out that the spot could be used for other students who need it (e.g. other students who are also frightened by crowds, disabled students, etc.).
At work, a boss might not let you disappear to a quiet area if there's a lot to do. In these cases, use other coping mechanisms unless you really have no other choice but to use the area; you don't want to lose your job.

Calm down: There is always a way out, so convince yourself that you can breeze through this one too.,
Mentally classify the guests: If they are close friends, you could be more relaxed; but if they are clients, colleagues or seniors from work, you need to make some plans.

,
Write it down: Quickly jot down what you plan tonight; keep the menu small as you would need a lot of energy for an elaborate arrangement

,
Shop: Go to a mall or store that has a smaller queue.,
Hydrate yourself: Drink a couple of glasses of cool water after reaching home.,
Breathe in life: Lie down on a flat surface, a carpet or a comfortable bench (not a bed or couch) and breathe deeply.,
Dress up: Wear something light and comfortable for the evening.,
Implement the plans: Start dinner preparation as per your plans and try not to deviate much, in an impulse to impress.

,
Get help: If you can get friends or family members to pitch in, request them to do smaller chores like fixing the table, arranging some fresh flowers, switching on some soothing music etc.,
Post preparation: If you finish the dinner preparation in time, grab a chair, get a glass of juice or water and mentally prepare yourself for the conversation you are going to have.,
Smile: Take care to smile adequately (not too much or too less) and make them feel at home.,
Graceful see off: If your guests want to bid an early goodbye, do not insist on their staying back longer (for all you know, they might have had a long tiring day too); see them off cheerfully without showing your haste to crash.

,
Cleanup: This is the most difficult part of the entire evening, especially when all your tiredness comes flooding back.,
Relax again: Dip your feet in some warm water before you retire for the day.",How to Be a Good Host After a Tiring Day,";
,,, Don't overdo the shopping. Just go as per the requirements of your list.

, Quickly take a warm shower (it helps, any season)

, This breathing should inflate your stomach during inhalation and flatten it during exhalation. Do this for 10 minutes (keep a timer if necessary). It relaxes you immediately.

, Try to look relaxed and presentable (take deep breaths, whenever you can).

,, Or better still, invite them to the kitchen to help you.

, As you've had a busy day, you will automatically tend to think of it and the conversation might revolve around it. Instead try to think of something positive about your guests and make it a point to discuss about the same.

, Introduce humor into your conversation as everyone could use some at the end of a day. Listen more, do not lead the conversation towards yourself or how tiring your day was, lest your guests feel unwelcome.

,, Don't crash on that inviting couch but finish off this chore as soon as possible. Help is a must-get. If you don't have help, try to finish only the amount you can manage before you are completely burned out.

, Try adding some herbal/olive oil into the water for better sleep and a fresh new you in the morning!

Many existing services are under utilized for very much the same reasons why they are required for in the first place. This due to a lack of empowerment amongst those who serve.;
, The same value applies for other avenues and career choices. Display passion and zest for and strive to make a difference even in small ways. A warm and welcoming smile can make the greatest difference especially to those using the services of your community projects.

, This means to promote the ability of children, adults and communities to follow their chosen goals without too much frustration and in joint consideration of other peoples needs. Most often what we think is right for them, may not necessarily work for them.

, One needs to promote the expression of care, empathy and concern for the physical and emotional well being of families and disadvantaged communities, BY THE COMMUNITY. A careless or indifferent attitude, by the way, does not hold you in good stead for any position of this nature.

, You need to promote respect, appreciation and acceptance for diverse social groups and people. This can be done by addressing issues of discrimination such as racism, sexism and ostracizing attitudes. People come in different colors and creeds. These are human beings non the less, with the same genetic and blood type makeup as the rest of us.

, One has to promote peaceful and respectful processes in which children and adults can have meaningful input into decisions affecting and concerning their lives. An authoritarian and ""my way or no other way"", attitude will only work against you. In turn you also subdue the helping spirit that others come to expect of you.

, Promote important community structures that help attain personal and community goals. In simple terms think not selfishly and only of your own motives and what you can or cannot get from this endeavor.

, Anything loose, such as headphone cords, chains, or straps, draw attention. Large moving masses with little detail attract less attention than the large moving masses with detail.

, Put your headphones inside of your jacket, tuck your watches under your sleeves, keep your pants loose so that your wallet doesn't create an outline, and wear some kind of cap or sunglasses to obscure your eyes.

, Light grey, dark green, blue, black, and white do not attract much attention. Off colors such as orange and blue, yellow and purple, or bright green and red naturally attract the eyes.

, Also, odd hairstyles will have the same effect.

, If you must carry something important, try to keep it as small as possible, or in a backpack.

, A clean shave will be less likely to attract attention than a scruffy or full bearded face.

, If not, wear a hat or other head covering to conceal the glasses.

, Don't try to cut across streets or go in the opposite direction.

, This decrease your outline and is less likely to draw attention. Obey all traffic laws as well.

, Keep the weapon in a concealed holster and do not draw your weapon unless you deem there is a threat.

, Try to keep your head looking forward, or slightly towards the ground. If something catches the crowd's attention, move your gaze to mimic the crowd.

, This will keep you from being grabbed straight off of the street.

, If you're in a third world country, chances are you won't be walking around in a parka with three iPods. However, if you're in Manhattan in the middle of December, walking around in a bikini is going to be a dead giveaway.

, Choose the areas which are the darkest, as people naturally have a harder time seeing in dark areas. Also choose places where the sun will shine directly perpendicular to you, as this will conceal many of your facial features. (To get an idea of how this works, get a piece of paper. Write a word down on it. Roll the piece of paper in to a cylinder and shine a light on to it, then look at it from the opposite direction.)

, The larger number of people available, the less likely you will be selected as an individual target.

They should be able to advise you and to suggest options for the specific type of group therapy that you want to join – whether it’s psychotherapy, support, or otherwise.Be sure to follow up, as well. Once you’ve gotten a recommendation, contact the leader of the group therapy or the organizing body and repeat your questions.
Be sure to ask questions about any recommended groups. For example, who leads the groups? What are the leaders’ credentials? Group therapy can also differ a lot in size and structure. How many people are enrolled and what is the format?;
, The internet can be a powerful search tool for individual as well as group therapy, so don’t forget to take advantage of online resources. You can start by looking on a general search engine like Google, under “Group therapy in .” Also try search tools that are specifically designed to find counselors and therapy groups.


One useful search tool is Psychology Today’s Therapy Group search engine. Go to the website and then enter details about where you live. It will find groups situated in your area.There are also online groups for more specific problems. For example, the Depression Alliance has a director of self-help groups located throughout the UK at www.depressionalliance.org. Try “Mind,” too, which runs local therapy groups and counselling services., You may be able to find a group by making inquiries with the right organizations in your community, too. Many hospitals, mental health centers, community centers, and even universities host therapy groups. Consider calling or emailing places like these to see whether they have – or know of – counselling for your specific issue.In general, try your local hospital and ask about counselling and mental health services. They may already host groups on-site or can refer you to a mental health or community center.Another place to try is at nearby universities. Universities and colleges normally have counselling and mental health services available for students and faculty. Call and ask about they have group sessions and about the possibility of accessing their services.If you are looking for a support group, consider relevant organizations. For instance, you might call the Veterans’ Administration if you are looking for a support group for military widows. If you are looking for support for substance abuse, try your local Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous.

, Counselling groups aren’t casual venues for people to come and chat about their problems – they focus on specific issues and need to be quite focused in order for members to share with each other and benefit. In other words, you’ll need to have an issue in mind for therapy. What is the problem that you need help with?Are you struggling with a specific mental health issue like depression? Perhaps a group for depression or grief is for you. This can bring you together with others who also struggle with depression and who can share their own experiences and methods for coping.
Do you have problems with stress or anger? Counselling will put you in touch with others and teach you healthier ways to control and manage your impulses.
Support groups can also offer help, understanding, and a sense of solidarity for people with certain life experiences, like the loss of spouses or children, survivors of abuse, or substance abusers.

, Group counselling can include treatment for highly specialized mental health disorders. If you have been struggling with a specific and diagnosed disorder, like bipolar disorder, panic disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, or depression. This sort of group may be for you and put you together with others who share the same problem.Group Cognitive Behavioral therapy can be particularly effective for some mental health disorders, such as Anxiety Disorders.Group counselling is also common in the treatment of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, which commonly appears in combat veterans or victims of abuse. The therapy can help individuals to cope with symptoms and to process feelings of shame, guilt, and anger., You may also be able to benefit from group counselling even if you don’t have a specific mental health issue. Groups are available for general problems – problems that don’t involve a diagnosis but can severely impact people’s everyday lives. This type of group may be for you, too.Do you have problems with shyness and social interaction, for instance? Try a group like the Toronto Shyness and Social Anxiety Group. There are also groups like Emotions Anonymous for people who have general emotional struggles.Again, you may also be able to find groups to support you in loss. Cancer survivors, survivors of sexual assault, and people who have lost loved ones can all find support groups for trauma and loss. There are also groups in many areas that provide support or simple solidarity for women and LGBTQ people.

, If you live in a remote area and cannot find a nearby counseling group, then locating an online group may be a good option for you.You can ask your doctor or therapist for recommendations, or conduct a search for a group that meets your needs.


For example, if you are looking for support for obsessive compulsive disorder, then you could search for ""obsessive compulsive disorder support group"" or ""obsessive compulsive disorder forum.""
Before you decide to join a group, make sure that it seems like a supportive environment. You can read some old posts to see how friendly it seems.
Also, make sure that the group is current and regularly updated. Check the post dates and see how soon people respond.

, One big consideration when deciding on a group is whether it is “open” or “closed.” This distinction affects the amount of privacy you’ll have – and perhaps what you’ll be willing to open up about.An “open group” allows new members at any time, even after the program of therapy has started. You might need some time to get used to the other members, especially if you join late.
On the other hand, “closed groups” usually do not allow people to join while the counselling runs its course. Members have to be there from the start and therefore get to know one another. The atmosphere will be more confidential, but you may need to wait some months before you can join.

, Size is another big consideration. You might not get as much out of participation in a small group, as the pool of people’s experience will be less. On the other hand, large groups can be unmanageable and impersonal. They can make you feel anonymous and like you aren’t really fully participating in the counselling. In general, it’s best to find a balance between the two.While small groups will give each member more one-on-one focus, larger groups offer a larger degree of experiences to share. The ideal group size is therefore somewhere between about 8 to 12 members., Diversity is usually a great thing – it exposes you to an assortment of different experiences, viewpoints, and ideas. When it comes to group therapy, however, diversity does not always lead to better outcomes. In fact, it can stand in the way of a coherent group dynamic. Look for a group that has similar people with similar problems.Groups normally work the best when members have similar difficulties and similar levels of function.
A good counselor may also screen potential group members before accepting them in order to achieve a coherent group dynamic.

, Once you’ve found a group that works for you, make a commitment. Successful groups work when members stick to it, attend regularly, and contribute. In the end, how much you benefit from group counselling will largely depend on what you put in.Try committing to at least 3 sessions for a start. That way, you can test the waters and decide if the group is right for you.
Keep in mind that group sessions are usually confidential, to better create a safe space for members. Respect that confidentiality by not sharing information another member reveals during your sessions or by disclosing that you attend the group with that person.
Be a regular attendee and let the group leader know if you will miss any meetings.

, Many print publications now allow writers to enter their contests via the Internet. Select your favorite publications and check their websites for news about current or upcoming contests. A few publications may even have free e-mail newsletters that you can sign up for the receive updates in your Inbox.

, Many universities publish literary magazines that are open to outside submissions, and a few of these may even run writing contests from time to time.

, Even though the writing market is a competitive place, many writers are more than willing to offer help and advice to others, especially those just starting out. The odds of you getting an e-mail back from a busy, world-renowned writer may be fairly low, but many moderately successful writers who have had manuscripts published run blogs and are willing to answer writing-related inquiries. You can also check out message boards and other online writing communities.

, Websites that offer writing tips may be able to suggest a few legitimate contests for you to check out, and some of these websites may even offer contests of their own. Some of these are writing communities offering free or paid memberships, while other websites are open to all visitors.

Know your rights.,
Consider your odds.",How to Enter Writing Contests on the Internet2," The organization responsible for putting the contest together can reveal a lot about how legitimate it is. Contests started by print publications are generally the most ideal, with a few online publications coming in next. Contests sponsored by organizations that have nothing to do with writing may not offer much renown, even if they are legitimate, and contests put on by individuals should generally be avoided.

, Many legitimate contests do not disclose the judges. For instance, contests that are held annually and organized by major publications are usually judged by their editors. If you feel uncertain about the validity of a contest, though, not having the names of the judges can be a bad sign.


Moreover, when you do receive the names of the judges, you should look them up. A no-name judge can be another bad sign, and if the judge is well known, you should familiarize yourself with his or her work in order to know how to appeal to the judge.

, Most legitimate writing contests have some fee, so a fee in itself is not a bad sign. If you are asked to pay an exorbitant fee, though, run away and don't look back. Standard fees for poetry and short stories usually average about $5 to $15, while fees for longer works can range from $20 to $50.


Contests put out by publishers that require you to purchase something to enter are another bad sign. In these instances, the contest may merely be an excuse to improve sales.

, Some writing contests offer a monetary fee, while others only offer publication. Both can be legitimate, but be cautious with contests that only offer publication to a blog or low-quality periodical. If the publication has no reputation in the literary community, it will not do much to help your own reputation as a writer.


Also be cautious about prizes that depend on the number of entries. The grand prize may be $500 if 200 people submit, but publications that need to rely on the entry quotas are often small and struggle to meet those quotas. As a result, the ""promised"" prize may not be distributed if they have too few entries.
Avoid contests put on by publications that require you to purchase a copy of your own story. These often fall under the category of ""vanity"" publishers. Most legitimate contests that publish winning stories will at least send their winners a copy of the publication their work appears in.

, Contests that publish all the winning entries and offer the same prize to everyone who enters are not really contests. There is no merit to be gained by a competition in which you do not compete. Moreover, the contest fee is more like a reading fee, since you are only paying to have your work read and nothing more.

, The majority of contests will want first publication rights for winning entries. This is considered normal and acceptable. You should avoid contests that claim any rights to non-winning entries, though, and you should also avoid contests that claim all rights, even if those rights are only claimed for winning entries. Ultimately, your work is your work. You must grant publishers the right to publish your story, but you should steer clear from anyone who wants you to sign over your work completely.

, You may have found a legitimate contest with a low fee and great prize, but before you enter, you should also consider whether or not you stand a decent chance at winning. Extremely well-known contests generate a lot of interest, and many high-level, professional writers will enter. Winning these contests can do a lot to boost your reputation, but if you are just starting out, you may not have what it takes to play in the big leagues yet. Typically speaking, small to mid level contests are better for beginners than expert contests.

Follow the rules and guidelines.,
Obey the submission process.,
Pay the fee.",How to Enter Writing Contests on the Internet3," As with any contest, you need to adhere to the tenants in order to have any shot at actually winning. If a contest is looking for entries under 700 words, do not send in an 800 word piece. Similarly, if contest entries must follow a certain theme, do not send in a story that has nothing to do with the theme.

, Nowadays, many online writing contests ask writers to use an online submission process that goes through a submission management system. If the contest specifically states that you should go through this system, e-mailing your entry or sending it via snail mail is grounds for disqualification.

, If you plan on entering the contest online, you will need a credit card. If you do not have a credit card, you may need to search for a contest that will allow you to send your entry in by mail and pay the fee by check or money order.

",How to Edit a Documentary," It is easiest to edit a documentary that has a lot of coverage.;
, Split footage up into folders, e.g. ""b"" roll, interview, etc.

, Watch all the footage, listing highlights, overall action in the scene, and anything else that you feel is important. Write down what happens and what you think is appropriate. This is a huge job, so don't underestimate how long it will take. Make sure to break the core into manageable chunks.

, This is where you capture the gust of what the interviewee says, not the entire dialog. Do this by breaking down the interview into half minute segments. Work out where these should go in the interview at the end. This will be useful when it comes to the paper edit.

, Editing a documentary can put a lot of strain on, especially if you are working in HD. Do an offline edit where you convert to standard definition. When you have locked off (finished) the edit, re-import HD footage.

, Create a two column table in word with one column for video and the other for audio. Each row is a different scene. Put all clips and interviews in order and play around until you are happy with it. You can edit after that. This is helping you create a blueprint for your edit.

, Break down interviews and other longer things into manageable segments. This can be done in final cut by marking when someone goes onto a new topic.

, On top of this start putting appropriate shots.

, Put all your footage in order on the timeline without doing any editing.


Putting on loud music can help you do this, as it drowns out your internal dialogue and doubts.







,, Start cutting.

,
Analyze structure of similar documentaries. With editing, it's easier to get lost in the small details. By analyzing similar documentaries it can make you think creatively about it again. With longer documentaries unless you have a presenter, it is common to have a parallel narrative.
Do you find it unpleasant? If so, write down why.
Do you feel overwhelmed by the task? If so, break it down into more manageable chunks.
Are you disorganized? If so, write down why.
Are you a perfectionist? Don't go for perfect. Instead, go for what is achievable. Rough cuts are only rough, so just do it and don't try to make it perfect.
Go for a walk. A gentle stroll helps you to reflect.
Work under time restrictions.

, When you feel fairly happy with your rough cut, show it to people who are not involved and ask for their feedback. At this stage, you can still make drastic changes. However, remember that their feedback might not always be helpful, so always follow your instincts.

, Based on the feedback, go back and do more editing.

, Watching your documentary on a different screen such as a TV, mobile, or ipod could help you spot things you didn't spot.

, Colour correct your documentary to achieve continuity between different cameras and achieve a particular mood.

, It's a great tool, for this is plural eyes.

, Beware that sound editing could take longer than expected.

Share your story with a friend!",How to End a Short Story," This will refresh your memory and allow you to evaluate what you've already got, and what you need to add. While you read, ask yourself some questions:


What is the goal of the story? In other words, what do you want your readers to take away from it?
Do you want a surprise ending? An abrupt ending? An inconclusive or open-ended ending? A happily-ever-after ending?;
, Is it literary fiction? Science fiction? Romance? The genre of your story may help you decide what types of ending are most appropriate. Your ending should be related to what the rest of your story has promised your readers.If you're not sure what types of endings are most conventional for the genre you've chosen, pick a popular author (like Stephen King for horror or Flannery O'Connor for literary fiction) and read a couple of their stories. You can learn a lot from reading how other authors end their work.

, Write short descriptive sentences that summarize each scene or important plot point. For example: ""Larry goes to the store to buy bread, but forgets his wallet. He returns to the house and discovers a stranger sitting on his front porch."" This outline will help you figure out the ""bones"" of your story: what happens, with whom, etc., which will come in handy when trying to decide on an ending.

, This part doesn't have to take the form of complete, polished sentences just yet. Your goal here is to produce a bunch of possibilities, so write down any and all of your ideas, no matter how vague, silly, or unconventional they may seem. There are many ways to brainstorm your ideas, so try out a few techniques and see what works best for you!


It can be helpful to draw a ""mind map,"" either with pen and paper or on a computer. Start with what you know about your story -- characters, events, settings -- and assign each element its own bubble. Begin to add details and questions, drawing connecting lines between bubbles to show how your ideas relate to each other.You may also try writing down some keywords on index cards or small pieces of paper. Try putting your cards together in different combinations and see if you like what happens!

, As you consider your ideas, look for themes, patterns, and repetitions. Are there ideas or characters that seem particularly important? Your ending will likely need to deal with those.


If you're having trouble picking a direction, try making a list of what your characters want. Characters with strong wants or needs are more compelling to your audience. Famous author Kurt Vonnegut once said that ""Every character should want something, even if it is only a glass of water.""Ask yourself: Have your characters achieved their desires, or not? What could be the consequences of where your characters are now?
If you're still stuck, try figuring out what problems or themes your story has introduced. If there's a problem, how can it be resolved?(You could think about something like the Harry Potter books here: if the problem is Voldemort wanting to take over the world, what is the resolution?)

, Once you've thought about which direction you want your story to take and brainstormed some ideas, sit down and free-write for 30 minutes or so without stopping. Try to sketch out the ending from start to finish, but don't worry about getting the sentences just right and correcting spelling just yet. Focus on getting your ideas in order for now.You may find it helpful to set a timer. Once your time is up, take a break and then come back to what you've written.
Find a quiet, low-distraction place to write so that you can focus on your writing.
Try to write for the full 30 minutes without stopping to self-edit. What you produce will probably be messy, but it's useful to get your ideas out all at once without breaking your writing flow.

, Make sure your ideas are consistent with the rest of what you've written; for example, a happily-ever-after ending might work for a romance story but perhaps not for a horror story.

, Make sure your chosen ending tells your readers what they want to know. Don't leave any loose threads hanging; for example, if one of your characters was about to have surgery in the middle of the story, your readers will probably want to know what happened to her., As writer Kurt Vonnegut advised, ""Use the time of a total stranger in such a way that he or she will not feel the time was wasted.""Endings such as ""it was all a dream"" or ""they were dead all along"" are usually a bad idea, as they almost never resolve conflict or provide a logical conclusion, and this can make your reader feel like they were tricked.Avoid the deus ex machina (literally, ""god in the machine"") ending, where something happens to occur in the nick of time to help a character overcome a difficult obstacle: for example, a detective in a suspense story only solves the mystery because he gets a call from a mysterious person who has all the answers. , Try not to ""change the rules"" on your reader. So, for example, if your heroine has never wanted to get married and she changes her mind at the end of your story, make sure that her reasons for that decision are shown throughout the story, rather than just having it suddenly happen.

, For example: ""Millie walked to the closet. She listened to the scratching within and tried to overcome her fear. Suddenly she grabbed the handle and opened the door. A little mouse ran out of the closet, and she laughed."" This way you know exactly what happens; you will come back and polish the language in Part 4.


Keep an eye on length. A good ending will be proportionate to the rest of the story. , Focus on concrete and sensory details. In the above example, you might describe what the scratching sounded like, and what Millie imagined could be within the closet that stirred her fear.

, Make sure you've provided enough information about characters' thoughts, feelings, and reactions. In the above example, the ending might reveal that Millie was really just afraid of fear itself, and seeing the mouse made her realize her own silliness.

, Make sure you're consistent throughout; you don't want a story where one part is shallowly described while the rest of the story is described in even the most minute details.

, Here is where you can make all the final tweaks and changes to make your story read smoothly. Proofread carefully, make sure all your grammar is correct, and polish up any unclear or awkward spots in your language.

, Because you've spent so much time and effort writing the story, you may have a very different perspective of it than other readers. Having a friend read your story can help you discover if there are any places that seem confusing or out of place to readers. You may also find out that your friend thinks it's amazing just as it is!

Look at the demographic the workshop is designed for.,
Look for a writers' workshop that deals in the kind of writing you want to do.,
Look for a workshop oriented toward where you are in writing your manuscript.,
Look for a workshop that provides you with sufficient attention.,
Look at how long the workshop will last.,
Look at the facility holding the writers' workshop.,
Look at the credentials of the instructors/facilitators.,
Look at the results achieved by workshop participants.,
Look at the overall cost.",How to Find a Creative Writing Workshop1," Some creative writing workshops are designed for writers of all ages, while other writers' workshops are intended for only young writers (children and teenagers) or for senior citizens. Some workshops are intended only for women writers, while others are intended for writers of both genders.;
, Creative writing workshops are available that specialize in screenwriting, poetry, comic books, or in fiction genres such as science fiction, fantasy, horror, and mysteries. Being surrounded by other writers who share your writing interests will be more beneficial than enrolling in a workshop where few of the other writers enjoy the kind of writing you do.

, Some creative writing workshops are geared toward writers who have only an idea for a story, while others are geared toward helping writers shape the manuscripts they are currently working on.


Workshops geared toward helping writers shape their existing manuscripts may require participants to send 1 or more copies of their manuscripts in advance of the program. This is particularly true of writers' workshops lasting a day or less that are connected with an event such as a science fiction convention.

, The smaller the workshop, or the smaller the groups the attendees break into at a larger workshop, the more likely you will be to receive personalized attention and specific critiques on your work. For a larger workshop to give you this attention, the workshop leaders should be assisted by a sufficiently large staff of tutors and facilitators.

, Creative writing workshops may last anywhere from a few hours to a day to several weeks. (Workshops at community colleges may consist of several weekly sessions each lasting 1 to 2 hours.) Shorter workshops may be more intensive and focused, while longer workshops may have a more laid-back feel to them.


Be aware that some writers' workshops that bill themselves as week-long sessions actually run only 5 days.

, Creative writing workshops held in conjunction with a university or community college are usually held on campus. Writers' workshops associated with conferences, conventions, or festivals are usually held in the same facility holding the main event, which may be a hotel, bed and breakfast, convention or retreat center, church social hall, or other facility.


The facility holding the event often determines the availability of on-site meals and beverages and other amenities, such as room service, Internet and library access, phone, television, and air conditioning. For workshops where meals on-site are not available, consider the distance to nearby restaurants for meals or the ability to prepare your own meals.

, Creative writing workshops may be led by professional writers who may have little to no prior teaching experience or experienced writing teachers (community college instructors or college professors) who may have relatively few professional writing credits. Check the resumes of the workshop leaders both in the workshop brochure and on the authors' own websites or other Internet sources, and, if possible, read some of their works to get an idea of their writing styles.


Also look at written testimonials the workshop leader has received. Note the number of testimonials, the credentials of the people giving the testimonials, and also pay attention to the words used to praise the leader. Testimonials that give details about the workshop as well as its leader will give you a better idea of what to expect from the course
Assuming credentials are equal, you may prefer to study with writers whom you admire instead of writers you are unfamiliar with, but you may run the risk of only imitating that writer's style and not finding your own.

, The most obvious measure of how successful a writers' workshop is, is in how many of the participants get their work published. Look for the names of specific past participants and the titles and publishers of their published works, instead of general statements stating that a given percentage of past participants have gone on to be published authors.

, The total cost of a creative writing workshop depends on its length, the level of the talent leading it, and the place where it's held. You'll also have to figure in the cost of travel to and from the workshop site, as well as for any amenities not included (such as food) and for incidental expenses. If you can't afford a particular writer's workshop, you may want to consider a less-expensive workshop closer to home that offers fewer frills but will provide you needed feedback on your writing.

Check with your local writers' group.,
Check with your local library or bookstore.,
Check college class schedules.,
Search the Internet.",How to Find a Creative Writing Workshop2," Some writers' groups, particularly statewide writing guilds, sponsor literature festivals that may include writers' workshops. Smaller groups that don't offer workshops can obtain information about workshops from other groups and disseminate this information to their members through their newsletters or email groups. In addition, the other members of your group can give you advice based on what writers' workshops they've attended in the past, including those you're considering.

, Libraries and bookstores often host writers' groups and sometimes put on literature-related events and consequently are aware of similar events located elsewhere. You can visit the library or bookstore in person, by telephone, or check its website.

, Universities and community colleges normally offer non-credit or continuing adult education classes on a semester, trimester, or quarterly basis and usually send out the next session's schedule prior to its start. You will find listings for any writer's workshops, which include a short description of the class, its schedule, and the instructor's name, whose credentials may also be included in the class description.

, In addition to visiting the websites of the sources listed above, you can also type ""creative writing workshop"" or ""writer's workshop"" into an Internet search engine, along with a literary genre or prospective location, and receive a list of upcoming workshops. Visit the sites of those workshops that interest you and use the criteria under ""What to Look For"" to decide on which workshop is best for you.


Some websites maintain their own lists of writing conferences, festivals, and workshops, such as that at http://www.newpages.com/writing-conferences/, which lets you narrow your selection geographically.

Make changes to your theme.",How to Develop a Theme when Writing," ""Subject"" is a more general term than ""theme."" In non-fiction, the subject is a general topic of interest, while in fiction, the subject is some aspect of the human condition explored within the work. A theme is an explicit or implicit statement about the subject.


As a non-fiction example, a white paper could have as its subject be the improvement of the security of the cargo transportation supply chain. Its theme would be the forms of business data and means to access it that could provide those improvements.
As a fiction example, the Hans Christian Anderson story, ""The Ugly Duckling,"" has a subject of alienation in that the main character is depicted as different from his peers. The themes, however, are themes of failure to fit in, as well as self-discovery as the ""duckling"" grows up to discover he was actually a swan.;
, The purpose behind your writing will shape how you develop your theme in the piece. There are numerous purposes as to why someone writes. Your writing may serve any of these purposes (or any combination thereof):Documenting or recording an event or information
Reflection on an idea
Demonstration of knowledge
Summary of information
Explanation of an idea
Analysis of a problem
Persuasion
Theorization that speculates or seeks to explain an issue
Entertainment

, Understanding who your audience is lets you determine which themes are appropriate to your audience. This will also help you identify how best to present those themes to your audience. You can determine what themes are appropriate to your audience by realistically assessing how much knowledge and experience the audience has.


For example, in a business marketing letter, your audience will be prospective customers. Your purpose is to inform or persuade them to buy, and your theme might be to show them how your product will meet their needs. You may include statements of needs your customer will identify with, and then follow each statement with a short paragraph about how your product relates to that need.
Dr. Seuss wrote books for young children, requiring him to use a limited vocabulary. His ""The Star-Bellied Sneetches"" had a theme of learning to accept differences. In the story, the Sneetches learn to accept differences after applying and removing their belly stars so many times that they no longer remember their original appearances. In telling the story, Seuss used short words, made up words, and wrote in a distinctive rhyming cadence that made his words. This helps the reader recognize and remember the lessons behind them.

, Longer works, such as novels or memoirs, permit the inclusion of other themes subordinate to the primary theme of your work. In contrast, shorter works, such as short stories or editorials, usually have room to address only a single theme, although they may give passing reference to supporting ideas.

, Most stories start with a kernel of an idea. This may hint at the theme of your story, or the theme may emerge through the development of the story. If you have an idea for a story, it will be helpful to sketch out the story. Then you can start to determine the different directions it can take. This then points to potential themes that you can focus on. Outline your story, listing the characters and setting out the order of events that will happen in the story.

, Once you’ve identified a theme for your story, you can start to think about ways in which to represent that theme. Start with a free association exercise. In this exercise, focus on your theme – either the word or phrase (such as “family” or “environment” or “corporate greed”). Let your mind wander and observe the thoughts, people, images and so on that enter into your mind. Write down these thoughts and images.


Try out the technique of “mind-mapping”. In this technique, you start with a central idea and begin to map out the ways in which the story develops. This way, you can also start to identify how the theme weaves through the story., Your story’s characters are tasked with goals and aspirations. These motivations drive your character to act certain ways. These actions often feed into your theme.For example, if your character is passionate about becoming a vegan, you might start to examine themes of whether humans have the right to take control over the natural world.
In many non-fiction pieces, such as a letter to the editor, you are the “character” and your motivation is what will define the theme. For example, if you are writing a letter to your congressperson about a recent oil spill in your community, your theme could be something like the need for environmental cleanup and responsibility.

, The characters in your story are faced with a conflict that drives the plot. This may be an event or an antagonist. When you figure out the central conflict of your story, you may start to uncover your theme.For example, your character’s parent committed a crime. Your character, a police officer, is faced with a moral dilemma of whether to arrest the parent or not. Your theme could start to emerge from this conflict.

, Research is important in both non-fiction and fiction. In non-fiction, you are primarily looking for facts to support your theme and the points supporting it. In fiction, research also feeds into making your characters and the environment in which they interact as realistic as possible.

, There isn’t any rule that says you can only have one theme. You may have a dominant theme with sub-themes that strengthen and deepen your thematic dimension.For example, perhaps your dominant theme is the human impact on the environment, and you have sub-themes of corporate greed and the breakdown of community in modern society.

, A solidly presented theme will emerge through many different facets of your story. Start thinking about how your theme will become apparent to your readers. Some of these ways include:


Through characters’ actions, thoughts and speech
Through symbolic use of the environment
Through repeating ideas
Through highlighting symbols or landmarks
Through contrasting values

, Narration means to present facts and details in an organized, usually chronological fashion to tell what happened and who it happened to. Narration is used in most newspaper articles and commonly in stories told in the first person., Description is the use of words that invoke the senses to build an image in the reader's mind of the item being described. Description is particularly powerful in fiction as a substitute for narration. Instead of writing that a character was angry, you describe the character as having bulging eyes, flared nostrils, and a beet-red face, and use ""thundered,"" ""shouted,"" or ""screamed"" in place of ""said"" to describe the character's voice., Comparison is showing the similarities of two or more things. Contrast is showing the differences between two or more things. Comparison and contrast can be used in both fiction and non-fiction. For example, comparison and contrast was used to describe the lifestyles of the protagonists in Mark Twain's ""The Prince and the Pauper."" It can also be used for a side-by-side comparison of laptop computer features.

, A form of comparison and contrast, the analogy compares something familiar to something unfamiliar to explain the unfamiliar item. An example of an analogy is comparing Earth’s size in the universe as a grain of sand.

, Symbolism is using something to represent something else, such as the storm gathering around Roderick Usher's house in Poe's ""The Fall of the House of Usher."" This represents Usher's own disquiet after his sister's burial. Symbolism is more common in fiction than non-fiction and requires the reader to be familiar with the symbols you use and their intended meaning.


Try a recurring motif to institute symbolism in your story. You might have a recurring motif or detail of a person singing “Ave Maria” in your story.

, Allow lots of people read your writing. It is helpful to get other eyes on a piece of writing so that you know whether your ideas are conveyed clearly. Ask these readers about their impressions. See if they can identify your theme without prompting.


Be open to the ways that other people respond to your writing. They might be able to point out errors that you regularly make, which can help clarify and improve your writing. They might also ask thought-provoking questions that helps you consider an angle you hadn’t previously considered.
Remember that this feedback is not intended to be personal; they are responding to the writing, not to you.

, Get some distance from your writing by putting it away for a bit. Sometimes when we write, we’re so invested in the story and shaping the words that we lose sight of the bigger picture. Take a break from your writing by turning your focus to a different project for a few days. Then come back to your writing and reread it.

, Based on your own evaluation of the piece, as well as the feedback you’ve solicited from others, make alterations to your theme. You may recognize that, while you thought your theme was one aspect, your readers interpreted it very differently.


For example, perhaps you have been focusing your theme on a firefighter’s triumph over her parents’ disapproval. But then you realize that your story is really about the firefighter’s struggle in a male-dominated profession.A change to your theme might necessitate adding or deleting some passages that do not strengthen your theme.

Ask any employees (or clients, if possible) to do the same.
For example: if you specialize in marketing, several of your phrases could be different types of marketing subcategories.;
, Knowing what people are looking for when they visit your website will help you create keywords that cater to your customers' prospective searches.


It might also help to come up with potential search queries (e.g., ""how to take a photograph"") to better empathize with your customers.

Referencing your interactions with customers or clients should help you come up with some common search queries.

, These are words or phrases that don't directly relate to your product or field, but qualify as byproducts or subsequent searches.Sites such as http://soovle.com/ or https://trends.google.com/trends/ can generate obscure keywords in relation to a main keyword.
These keywords are often referred to as ""niche topics"", meaning that they modify topics that fall outside of your field's focus but not outside of its category altogether.
For example, a keyword focused on ""athletic shoes"" has an obvious association with ""running"" or ""bouldering"", but a less-obvious phrase might be ""getting in shape"".

, Chances are, if you have a competitor in your field, they've already done the keyword research. While you should have keywords that are specific to your own business, using the same general keywords and some of the niche topics as your competitor will expedite your process.Your competitors' keywords are accessible by using a paid app like KeywordSpy or SpyFu, as well as by using free sites like https://www.semrush.com/.
You can also reverse-engineer keywords by looking at the keywords your competitor hasn't yet used and then implementing them.

, These include keywords that are too difficult or advanced for your consumer base, keywords that don't quite apply to your company or product, and keywords you're already using.

, Unless your marketing budget is suitably large, you likely won't want to start out with the most expensive keywords.


You can view the cost-per-click (CPC) of a keyword or phrase by typing it into a site like https://serps.com/tools/keyword-research/ and reviewing the results.

, When you looked up your competitors' keywords, you likely found some that you aren't using. However, using high-ranking keywords that your competitors aren't using may give you an advantage.

, Again, using a site like https://serps.com/tools/keyword-research/ for this step will make your process easier, though you can set up an ad through Google to use the AdWords Keyword Planner as well.


This step will help you weed out any keywords that don't quite meet your return on investment standards.

, One thing to remember during this process is that there is a difference between an algorithm's interpretation of an organic keyword and a human being's interpretation of the same. If you see any keywords that don't look like they belong, consider removing them during this time.


This is also a good time to ask your employees, marketing experts, or customers what they think about your list. The more input you have, the better.

, The final test of whether or not your keywords are relevant, broad, and/or applicable enough will be putting them to use.


You'll want to keep a close eye on your site's analytics during this time. If site traffic notably increases, your keywords are working.

, You should do this about once a quarter to ensure that your previously relevant keywords are still relevant.You may also find that some keywords that weren't working for you at the beginning of your campaign are now directing more traffic.

, Looking at updated reports on customers' interests, common search queries, and most frequently purchased items should give you an idea of which keywords you should prioritize.


Looking at customers' favorite items especially will help inform your keyword prioritization.

, As your site's traffic increases, you may find yourself in a position to spend more on higher CPC keywords. If this is the case, it's probably worth experimenting with some of the higher CPC keywords you ruled out earlier.


You'll want to keep a close eye on how these keywords perform initially, since you risk not achieving a profitable ROI.

, Google updates often, meaning that a keyword which previously set your site at the top of the results page might now bring up an information box or separate article.

Write your bibliography/works cited before placing your footnotes.,
Go to the end of the sentence you want to footnote.,
Cite your quotation or reference.,
Cite an online resource.,
Continue footnoting your article or essay with additional notes.",How to Do Footnotes1," A footnote is commonly, but not always, a shortened version of a citation at the end of the book. Whatever content your footnote will include, however, it's probably the last thing to do in the writing of a text. Write your complete paper, including a list of references, before insert footnotes.;
, In Microsoft Word, you would go to the References tab, click on the Footnotes group and select ""Insert Footnote."" A number ""1"" should appear to the right of the sentence, and a number ""1"" will appear in the footer of your first page. In the footer, type the information you'd like to include foot-noted.


The cursor should be placed after any punctuation. The number linking to the footnote should appear outside the sentence, not inside of it.
If you do not know where to find the menu to insert footnotes in your word processing program, go to the help menu and research it before starting to footnote your paper.

, In the event that you're using footnotes in place of parenthetical in-text citations, the footnote should include the name of the author or editor, title (in italics), compiler, translator or editor, edition, name of series (including number or volume), place of publication, publisher and date of publication and page numbers of citation.


For example: Reginald Daily, Timeless wikiHow Examples: Through the Ages (Minneapolis: St. Olaf Press, 2010), 115.

, You need the following information in this order to footnote a website: author or editor of the website, title of the website (in italics), URL and date of access.


For example: Reginald Daily, Timeless wikiHow Examples, http://www.timelesswikihowexamples.html (accessed July 22, 2011).

, Go to each location in which you've referenced another source and repeat this process. Use an abbreviated version of the source in subsequent footnotes that have the same source. You will need the author or editor's last name, an abbreviated title (in italics) and the number or numbers that are cited.


Regardless of what style you're using, the use of footnotes does not replace the need for an ending list of references in the article, even though they are made superfluous. Include a ""Works Cited"" page in MLA format and a Bibliography for an APA style paper.

"
"
Add footnotes that clarify sources to the reader.,
Be brief.,
Use these types of footnotes sparingly.,
Double-check that a footnote is appropriate.",How to Do Footnotes2," Instead of including publishing information about the source in the footnote, often writers will footnote additional ""asides"" or tangentially related information in footnotes, often gleaned from other resources not directly cited. David Foster Wallace, in his long novel Infinite Jest made use of pages-long footnotes as a kind of in-joke. In academic writing, this should be used sparingly, but is common in memoir or other non-fiction styles of prose.


Science writing conventions will often footnote additional research studies that came to similar conclusions, but aren't being directly cited in the study at hand.

, If a paper quoted a source that talked about wikiHow articles and you wanted to clarify it, your footnote after the number might look like this: ""WikiHow examples are used to clarify text in situations where it would be helpful to have a visual cue. Reginald Daily, Timeless wikiHow Examples: Through the Ages (Minneapolis: St. Olaf Press, 2010), 115.""

, Long explanatory footnotes are distracting to the reader. If you find yourself with lots of extra information you need to put into footnotes, consider finding a place for it in the text, or otherwise revising the article or essay to account for it.


Editors will often recommend that any information included in parentheses in a piece of academic writing be footnoted instead. Consider the progression of the prose, the ""flow"" of the writing, and see if asides might be better off at the bottom of the page.

, Before using footnotes to reference sources, check with your editor or instructor to make sure you should cite the sources using a footnote. Typically, MLA or APA guidelines prefer you use a parenthetical in-text citation of a source, rather than a footnote, and reserve footnotes for supplementary information or alternative references to the same information. Footnotes are to be used only when necessary.


In Chicago style, footnotes are used in place of parenthetical citations and are more common.

Decide on a medium.,
Give yourself a question or topic that you want to write about.,
Set a timer.,
Close your eyes.,
Start writing.,
Relax.,
Read what you have written.,
Highlight or circle anything that is interesting to you.,
Continue with your writing.",How to Do Automatic Writing1," Do you want to use a computer for your automatic writing session or do you want to use pen/pencil and paper? This is completely based on your personal preference. Some would argue that pen and paper is the only good way to use automatic writing,but if you can type faster than you can write (and you’re more comfortable with it), it may be more helpful to use a computer.You can also try out each medium to see which one you prefer, or you can change between the two if you like.
If you choose to use a computer, you can open a Word document or a default word processor such as Word Pad (on Microsoft) or TextEdit (on Mac).
If you are not skilled in typing on a computer without looking at the keyboard, it is probably better to use pen and paper so that you will not have to concentrate on the act of typing.;
, If you are practicing automatic writing to improve your creativity, or to help yourself get started on a writing assignment, then it will be helpful to have a prompt of some sort.You could, for example, write about something that has been on your mind a lot lately, or about a dream you had recently that stands out in your mind. Perhaps a problem you have, or something you are excited about. Maybe you have an idea for a story in mind, in which case you can use that as your topic. If you don’t quite have all the details of story you’d like to write clear, you can simply write about all the different ideas and pieces of the story that you do have.
You could, for example, answer the “5 Y’s” about your topic. That is, Who? What? When? Why? How? Or you could just have the topic you want to write about in mind.

, 10 minutes should be a good starting point.Setting a timer will help you avoid wondering if you’ve been writing for long enough.


Remember that 10 minutes is merely a suggested starting point. If you want to write for longer, then do so. If you set your timer for 10 minutes, but you feel like you have more to write, you should keep going until you feel that you’ve gotten it all out.
On the other hand, you should not stop writing until the 10 minutes are up. Even if you feel that you have run out of things to write. Keep trying, and eventually your hand will write something., A key part of practicing automatic writing is to close your eyes while you write. This prevents you from thinking about something you previously wrote, or from correcting something you have written.If you feel that you will be tempted to peek at your work during this exercise, you might also consider putting on a blind fold while you work.
If you find that you cannot write with your eyes closed, then do it with your eyes open, but remember that you are not allowed to stop writing to change what you have written. Do not cross anything out, do not erase, do not stop. If your mind suddenly changes directions, then simply start writing whatever it is you are thinking, even if it means starting a new sentence in the middle of a different one.

, Write whatever comes in to your mind as it comes into your mind. Ideally, it will be related to your topic, but if it is unrelated, you should still write it.Pay absolutely no attention to grammar, spelling, sentence structure, style, or anything that you would normally be worried about when writing. These things are of absolutely no importance in automatic writing., After you have completed a round of writing, stop your writing, and give yourself a break for a few minutes.

, Now you should go back to what you have written and read through it. Don’t judge yourself harshly. What you have written may not make any sense at all, and it definitely won’t be pretty.

, As you are reading, you may find things that you find particularly interesting. You should make note of these by highlighting them or circling them to come back to.Using these ideas, you can complete another round of automatic writing, if you feel that you want to continue the exercise.

, If, after using automatic writing you feel that you are ready to move on to the next step in your writing process, then do so. On the other hand, if you feel that you have moved forward, but still haven’t gotten what you wanted out of the exercise, feel free to repeat as often as necessary.

Failing to adhere to the rules and guidelines of a contest could have negative consequences, so double check the submission guidelines before you send in your work.


If there is a word or page count, adhere to it. Trying to exceed the word/page count will irritate the judges, get your submission disqualified, or both.Stick to the topic or theme if there is one. Many writing contests are open-ended, but some are only seeking stories, essays, or poems that fit a given theme/topic.;
, The majority of contests are open to anyone who wants to submit, sometimes requiring an entry fee but otherwise free from any other requirements. However, many contests impose guidelines on who is eligible to submit. These eligibility requirements are often based on the type of institution holding the contest and its location, though some are put in place to offer new writers a chance at success.


Many contests are exclusively open to writers who have not yet published their first book.
Some contests are only open to writers who have self-published their work and want to publish their work through other outlets.
Depending on the country in which the contest is being held, you may have to write in a given language. For example, some contests in the United States only accept English-language submissions.
Citizens of countries with international embargoes may not be eligible to submit to contests in certain countries. For example, citizens of Syria, Iran, North Korea, and Sudan are not eligible to submit to writing contests based in the United States., Most contests require submissions to meet specific formatting guidelines that affect how your writing looks on the page. This is usually done to ensure that all submissions look alike so that judges can focus on the work you've written instead of getting distracted by how large, small, or unusual your font is.Many contests will only accept submissions that are in a certain font and font size.
Some contests require submissions to be follow formatting restrictions, like double-spacing or aligning the margins.

, Before you send off your work, you should double check that you've updated your contact information. If you've moved, gotten a new phone number, or started using a new email address, you'll need to change that information on your cover page, manuscript, and envelope. If you're submitting your work online, be sure you've updated your submission portal profile to include your new contact information., Having an entry checklist can be helpful if you're forgetful or if the contest has a lot of requirements. It's not a requirement, but a checklist can help ensure that you send out a complete submission package.Before you submit your work, you'll need to be sure you've included:


a completed entry form (if required)
a check or credit/debit card payment that covers the entry fee (if there is one)
the final draft of your work, complete and edited from start to finish
any other material or information required for submissions
proper postage (if sending a hard copy by mail)

, Contests have a hard deadline by which submissions must be received, and any late entries will be returned unread or discarded. Judges cannot legally accept a late submission, so don't waste your time and money if your submission won't be received on time.It's best if you submit your work as early as possible. Not only are you guaranteed to make the submission deadline, your work will also be read sooner - meaning the judge will be reading with fresh eyes.If you missed the submission period for a contest, just look for the next upcoming contest from that or another institution. Contests can generally be found year-round.

, Many literary magazines hold annual contests that are open to the public. These contests typically award publication, a cash prize, a subscription to the magazine, or some combination of these prizes. You can find literary magazines that are open for contest submissions by searching online, or by browsing literary magazines for upcoming contest announcements., There are plenty of writing contests outside the literary magazine world. Some are through educational institutions, others through nonprofit organizations, and still others through professional organizations.You can find out about these and other writing contests by searching online - just be sure you qualify before you submit you work.


Many schools, especially colleges and universities, hold annual writing contests with various categories. Some are only open to current students and alumni, though, so read the rules carefully.
Literary organizations often hold annual or semi-annual writing contests. However, sometimes these contests are only open to current members of those organizations., Most contests request first-time publishing rights, meaning the contest organizers will be the first literary journal, website, or press to publish the piece of writing you submit. This is somewhat standard, though some contests will accept previously published work. However, in some contests, your work becomes the property of the host or sponsor. In this case, you may get published or paid for your writing, but you'll never be able to use it or any part of it in any other printed format., It may go without saying, but you should only submit your strongest work to a writing contest. If you've recently finished a piece of writing and have not yet revised or edited it, it may not be ready for submission. Remember that the work you submit will represent your talents as an author, whether it's chosen or not.Think of submitting your work as an opportunity for exposure. Contest judges, many of whom are published authors or literary agents, will be reading your work, so send them your best.
Choose a story, essay, or poem that you feel strongly about. Ask a few trusted friends who are familiar with your work to read over your submission and decide whether it's your strongest piece of writing.

, Before you submit your work, you should make sure it's polished and ready for publication. Many contest judges will not allow you to make changes once you've sent in your submission, while others may simply discard your work if it's got too many errors.Be sure to check for grammar, spelling, and punctuation errors in your manuscript.
Check your work for continuity. Make sure your characters maintain the same names and characteristics from start to finish and check that you use a consistent narrative voice throughout.
Have a trusted friend look over your work. Ask your friend if the writing is clear, makes sense, and remains consistent.

, The format in which you submit your work is largely a personal choice. Not every writing contest gives you the choice between electronic and paper submissions, though many do. Check the contest guidelines to see what your options are, and if you're required to use one or the other then follow the contest rules.Sometimes emailing or electronically submitting a piece of writing can affect the formatting and layout of your work on the page. This could be distracting or even annoying to the contest judges.
The downside to paper submissions is that they are at risk of getting lost in the mail or misdelivered, whereas an electronic submission is guaranteed to be received instantly.
There are many pros and cons to both submission formats. Consider what's most important to you and submit accordingly.

Take a deep breath.,

Keep copies of the writings.",How to Do Automatic Writing2," You will need a comfortable place, where you won’t be interrupted in order to use automatic writing in a more spiritual way.You do not have to do this exercise for any particular amount of time, so there is no need to set a timer. However, some recommend setting aside 30-45 minutes to do your writing., Are you more comfortable writing with pen and paper, or do you prefer typing on a computer? This is completely based on your personal preference. While there are those that argue that it is best to use pen and paper,you should generally stick to what you are more comfortable doing.


If you’re not sure how you want to do it, try doing it both ways and choose whichever is more comfortable for you.
If you use a computer, use whatever word processor you most typically use (e.g. Microsoft Word, NotePad, TextEdit on Mac, etc.)

, Do your best to clear your mind of all thoughts, for example, about things you have to do later in the day, things you are worried about, etc.


If you are particularly stressed, upset, angry, or worried about something, then put off your session for another time. It will be difficult to clear your mind if you have a big issue you are focused on.
Take a few deep breaths, try focusing on the air going in and out of your nostrils, and how it feels. Is it cold going in and warm going out? Is it shallow or deep? Clearing your mind is a skill that you must practice. As you practice more, you will improve.

, This might be “spirit guides”, “angels”, or “my higher self”, for example. If you wish to do this, you can do it by praying to them or through meditation.Some suggest that this is a good idea, while other’s leave it out altogether. Do what feels right for you.

, Keeping your eyes closed will allow you to let your mind communicate more directly with your hand(s), and keep you from judging what is coming out on the paper or screen.


For this method, it is absolutely imperative that you have your eyes closed. If you feel afraid to close your eyes, then focus your eyes on the wall in front of you. Although you may end up with nothing more than marks on a page, you will improve with time. If the entity you are channeling wishes to write words and sentences, then they will do so.

, If you are using a computer, put your hands on the keyboard as though you were about to type something.

, Type, write, or draw whatever comes into your mind. If you are using paper, this may mean drawing symbols or doodles.


If you want to have questions answered when channeling entities, you can also do this. Begin by writing down the question you want answered, and then letting your hand freely guide you to the answer.Don’t try to interpret anything that you are drawing, writing, or typing as it is happening. Simply let it happen. Your mind may try to come back into control, but do your best to simply let the thoughts flow freely.Only you will be able to know when an automatic writing session is over. Keep going for as long as it feels comfortable, and stop if/when it begins to feel negative or uncomfortable., When you are finished with your session, take a few deep breaths to come back to yourself. If you wish, you can thank the entity you have channeled., At this point, you can see what has come out on the page/screen. Hopefully you find something that makes sense for you. If not, try not to worry. Put it away for the day, and try again tomorrow. This is a skill that takes a lot of practice.Remember that even if you are not able to achieve the result you desire, automatic writing is still great for strengthening your creativity.

, Over time, you may see patterns, ongoing messages or other connections that are worth piecing together.

,

Consider the type of binding for the user manual.,
Build a template document for your manual.",How to Create a User Manual," To write a successful user manual, you need to develop a profile of your user, either formally, by creating a written profile, or informally, by taking the time to make reasonable assumptions about your user's characteristics. Such a profile is useful when you're part of a team writing the user documentation and can also be helpful in taking the product itself from concept to final form. Things to think about when forming a user profile include:


Where users will use the user guide, such as at home, in the office, at a remote job site, or in the car. This may determine not only the content, but the style the user manual takes.
How users will use the user guide. If the manual is one they will consult only infrequently or to look up information, it should primarily take the form of a reference document. If it is something users will consult frequently in the beginning, the reference section should be accompanied by a ""Getting Started"" section and instructions on the most common tasks the product will be used for.
How much experience users have with the product or others like it. If your product is new or significantly different from similar products, you'll need to include an explanation of how it differs from other products as well as instructions on how to get started. If the product deals with something users often have trouble with, such as many computer applications, you'll need to provide appropriate information and detail in an understandable fashion.;
, Unless the user has a technical background, it is probably best to avoid highly technical language in favor of clear, simple explanations. The text should also be organized in a way that mimics the way users think; listing product features grouped by function often makes more sense than simply those used most often.


Sometimes there is no getting around using technical terms, such as for a graph-creating software application that includes Fibonacci charts along with more common pie and bar graphs. In such a case, it is helpful to define the term and provide some background, such as an explanation of what Fibonacci charts are and their use in financial analysis.

, Offering a feature as the solution to a general problem works fine when marketing the product, but once the user has the product, he or she needs to figure out how to put it to use. Identify specific problems the user will face, state them in the user guide, and then follow with instructions to solve them.


If the problem is a complex one, break it down into smaller parts. List each part with the instructions on how to solve or cope with it, and then follow with each subsequent part in succession. Breaking information down this way is called ""chunking.""

, You'll need a front cover for any user guide that's more than a reference card and a title page for any manual that covers more than a folded sheet of paper (4 or more pages in length).


If the manual is copyrighted, a copyright notice goes on both the front cover and title page.
If there are terms and conditions for using the manual and product associated with it, place them on the inside front cover.

, If the user documentation is more than 1 manual, make reference to the other documents, with the correct version numbers, here. The preface is also where to put a ""How to Use This Guide"" section if there is one.

,, In most cases, procedures and reference materials should each have their own sections, although you can tell the user to refer to specific content in one section from the other. This way, the user can find the information he or she is looking for faster.


Procedures should be written in a consistent structure throughout the instruction section of the manual. Begin with an overview of the task, then describe what the user has to do and what result he or she should see. Steps should be numbered and begin with action verbs, as the steps in each section of this article are written.
Reference materials can include lists of options, troubleshooting tips, and frequently asked questions. Glossaries and indexes can be added near the end of the manual, although a list of frequently used terms can appear at the front. The index can be omitted if the manual runs less than 20 pages.

, Graphic images, or screenshots, can illustrate certain points in the manual better than text, particularly in complex procedures where users need to have visual confirmation that they're performing the steps correctly. Graphic images can be produced using computer-aided drafting (CAD) or graphic editing software, digital cameras and photo-editing software, or in the case of screenshots, either your computer's built-in screen capture ability or a graphics program with screen capture capability.


Once you create a graphic image, save it in as compressed a format as your word processing or desktop publishing program will allow you to use. You'll also want to reduce the physical size of your image to something that will fit more easily on the page while still providing sufficient detail for the user. (If necessary, you may need to cut the original image into parts and show the relevant parts along with the supporting text.)
If you're using multiple graphic images in procedures, make them a consistent size, either in the same dimensions of length and width or in the same proportional reduction from their original size. This will make the images more attractive to the user. Likewise, when creating screenshots from a computer, make sure the computer is displaying a standard color scheme when capturing images if the user manual will display the screenshots in color.
Although graphic editing programs such as Photoshop and Paint Shop Pro offer decent screen capture capabilities, dedicated screen capture programs such as SnagIt also feature the ability to easily modify, catalog, and annotate screen captures.

, Although computers can support a number of different fonts, the goal of a user manual is to be an easily readable. Choosing only a small number of fonts that look good together is the best way to achieve this goal. Fonts can be broken down into 2 types: serif and sans serif fonts.


Serif fonts feature small embellishment lines at the ends of the main strokes that form the letter. Serif fonts include such fonts as Times New Roman, Baskerville, and Book Antiqua. Serif fonts work best for large chunks of text displayed in 10 to 12 point size in the main body of a printed user manual.
Sans serif fonts display only the strokes that form the letters without embellishment. Sans serif fonts include such fonts as Arial, Calibri, and Century Gothic. Sans serif fonts can be used for large chunks of text in sizes from 8 to 10 point in a PDF or Web-based manual, although the lack of serifs makes sentences displayed in sizes 12 point or larger harder to read. They can, however, be used effectively in larger sizes to display titles and headings, and they're also great in the smaller sizes for footnotes and numbers in columns and tables.
You should generally choose plain fonts such as Arial or Times New Roman for your user manual, although you may want to use a decorative font for pull quotes or for titles if you're writing a user manual for a video game with a fantasy or science fiction setting. (In the case of pull quotes, you can often get by with one of the plain fonts and display the pull quote in italics.)
Once you have decided on the fonts you want to use, create a sample page to verify that your fonts go together well on paper. You'll also want to show this sample to whoever has approval over the manual's appearance before you proceed further with writing it.

, Once you've chosen your user manual's fonts, you need to decide where everything goes on the pages.


Generally, you'll want to put the manual's title or the chapter title in the header or footer, possibly using the manual title on the left-hand page and the chapter title on the right-hand page. You'll want to have the page numbers in the header or footer as well, either to the outside (header or footer) or in the center (footer only). You may want to have the first page of each section or chapter differ from the other pages by placing its page number in the center of the footer and subsequent pages in the outside corner of the header.
You may want to have callout text in colored or shaded boxes to separate it from the rest of the text. Be sure to choose a color or level of shading that doesn't overwhelm the text.
Allow reasonably ample margins on all sides, with extra space on the edges that will be bound together.

, If your user manual runs more than 4 pages, the pages will need to be bound together in some way. Although internal documents may be stapled together at the corner, external user manuals that ship with a product are usually bound in one of 3 ways:


Side-stapling is appropriate for manuals composed of folded 8.5 x 11-inch (21 x 27.5-cm), 8.5 x 14-inch (21 x 35-cm), or 11 x 17-inch (27.5 x 42.5-cm) sheets of paper. Most inexpensive manuals of 48 pages or fewer are bound this way.
Saddle-stitching is more commonly used for third-party reference guides than for user manuals that ship with products other than automobiles, although some lengthier user guides are bound this way. (Paint Shop Pro originally shipped with a saddle-stitch bound user guide when it was produced by JASC Software.)
Spiral binding is appropriate for user guides designed to be used in more rugged settings, such as the outdoors, where side-stapled or saddle-stitched manuals would fall apart. Some spiral-bound manuals may also have laminated pages to keep them from being ruined if the manual gets wet or muddy.

, Many word processing and desktop publishing programs offer you the ability to create a template document for your user manual, so that as you type, the text will automatically display in the font you selected for the portion of the manual you're working on. (This article, in fact, was written initially using a Microsoft Word template.) Most of these programs also include a set of pre-defined templates that you can modify for your needs, instead of creating the template from scratch.


Word-processing and desktop publishing programs also offer the ability to create ""styles,"" preset font and point-size formats for headers, footers, headings, and body text. You can select one of the defined style names (e.g., ""Heading1,"" ""Normal,"" ""Quote"") or create your own style with its own name. As much as possible, follow the conventions for established style names if you have multiple styles for the same class of text. (For example, Microsoft Word labels text styles for headings as ""Heading1,"" ""Heading2,"" etc. for headings from the main heading through several levels of subheads.) Try to create all the styles you'll need upfront so you don't have to stop and create them during the actual writing process.

See if the writer adds letters to common words.,
Watch for hyperbole.,
Look at any references.,
Scan for capital letters.,
See if the writing feels otherwise aggressive.,
Detect sarcasm in literary works and other media.",How to Detect Sarcasm in Writing1," Sarcasm in writing can be difficult to detect in text due to the absence of verbal tone, which is often used to convey sarcasm when speaking. If someone is being sarcastic in writing, he or she may add multiple letters to common words to indicate a sarcastic tone.


A writer may use multiple letters to indicate an elongated syllable. In real life, if someone makes a statement you do not believe, you may respond by saying, ""Right,"" but stretching out the word sarcastically. Therefore, a sarcastic use of the word ""right"" in text may be written as, ""Riiiiight.""There are other examples of words being stretched out misspelled to indicate sarcasm. Someone may sarcastically type, ""Excuse me"" in apology as, ""Excuuuse meee."" A person may also give a sarcastic, ""Okay, then,"" as ""Oooookaaay, then!"";
, Hyperbolic language, usually marked by the use of intense adjectives, may be used to indicate sarcasm in writing. If someone's enthusiasm for a given subject seems unusually intense, that person may be being hyperbolic. This is often an indicator of sarcasm in text.Usually, in sarcastic writing, a writer will choose a more intense version of a common word to indicate hyperbole. This can point to sarcasm. For example, instead of saying, ""The weather's been nice today,"" a sarcastic writer may write, ""The weather's been fantastic today."" As ""fantastic"" is a more intense adjective, its use may indicate sarcasm.Hyperbolic language is likely to indicate sarcasm if the adjective used seems to conflict with the situation. For example, say someone posts a Facebook status saying something like, ""Got a D on my chemistry test and I feel like a genius!"" It's unlikely someone would feel like a genius after receiving a poor grade. Therefore, you can reasonably assume this is sarcasm.
You can also look for elongated letters alongside hyperbolic language. When speaking, someone may draw out hyperbolic intensifiers to indicate sarcasm. In text, someone may add letters to indicate this verbal tendency. For example, ""I just pulled an all-nighter studying for Professor Mendez's algebra exam and I'm just feeling fantastic.""

, World references or references to popular culture embedded in the text can indicate sarcasm. If you're unsure if a writer is being sarcastic, see if he or she uses any references. Use of references may very well indicate sarcasm if they're used in a way that feels off.For example, say someone is responding to another writer's political view in the comments section of a news article. That person may say something like, ""Your response is about as tempered as a Tea Party rally."" The Tea Party is a political organization known for its intense, sometimes aggressive rallies. Saying a response is ""tempered"" and then immediately comparing it to such a rally likely indicates sarcasm.
The speaker may also ask a question that's obviously true to indicate sarcasm. For example, someone may ask an obvious question on a forum, to which the obvious answer is ""Yes."" A sarcastic speaker may respond with something like, ""Could Moses count to 10?"" Given Moses is known in the Bible as the bearer of the 10 Commandments, it's very likely he could count to 10. The answer to this question is also, obviously, yes. The writer is likely being sarcastic., Oftentimes, in sarcastic writing, certain words will be capitalized. This is to indicate a tone that may be used to indicate sarcasm when speaking. If a sentence contains capital words, it may very well be sarcastic.For example, say someone is disagreeing with another writer's point on a political forum. The writer may respond with something like, ""Okay, THAT makes sense."" The capitalized ""that"" indicates that, in a sentence, the word ""that"" would be spoken slightly louder than the rest of the sentence. Verbally, that would indicate sarcasm.
Capital letters may be used in conjunction with other elements of sarcastic writing. For example, the speaker may say something like, ""Okay, THAAAAT makes sense! FANTASTIC point."" This could indicate sarcasm, mixed in with a hint of aggression.

, Oftentimes, sarcasm is used by a speaker who's angry or frustrated. If the writing feels otherwise aggressive, it's more likely to be sarcastic. It the writer is engaged in a heated argument, for example, you're more likely to find writing that is laced with sarcasm.

, Sarcasm has been used as a literary device, or a writing technique used to help get an idea across, for as long as people have been writing stories. Writers of books, screenplays and comedy sketches often employ sarcasm as a way to develop a character's personality.


For example, the Game of Thrones character Tyrion Lannister is known for being witty and sarcastic. The following dialogue is dripping with his signature sarcasm:“No man threatens His Grace in the presence of the Kingsguard.” Tyrion Lannister raised an eyebrow. “I am not threatening the king, ser, I am educating my nephew. Bronn, Timett, the next time Ser Boros opens his mouth, kill him.” The dwarf smiled. “Now that was a threat, ser. See the difference?”
Satire is similar to sarcasm in that it's a way of using humor to bring attention to foolishness or weakness. Satire is bigger in scale than sarcasm; an entire book, play or movie can be satirical, and satire is usually meant to make fun of social institutions, not just individuals. For example, George Orwell's Animal Farm is a satire of Soviet Communism.
Parody is another literary device that is related to sarcasm. A parody is an imitation of a something that is meant to mock the original to comedic effect. For example, when Tina Fey appears as Sarah Palin on Saturday Night Live, she's parodying Palin's way of dressing and speaking.

Get an outsider's opinion.,
Submit your work.",How to Edit a Manuscript," If you've just finished writing your manuscript, you're probably feeling a well-deserved sense of accomplishment. When you're attached to your work immediately after completing the manuscript, it can be very difficult to distance yourself from your work enough to make the necessary cuts and revisions. Rather than trying to jump right into the editing phase after completion, it's best to set your work aside for a while so you can approach it with a fresh set of eyes.A fresh read allows you to effectively view the manuscript as if you were reading someone else's work, which can make it easier to distance yourself from your own words.
If at all possible, give yourself at least a week without reading or working on your manuscript in any way. If you can give yourself a few weeks it may be even better.;
, When you're ready to sit down and begin editing, it may be helpful for you to have a hard copy printed out. Seeing your words on the computer may force you to see the work as you did while you were writing it - in other words, things that made sense to you in your head may read differently when viewed as a final product.Some writers find that reading words on a printed page makes it easier to spot mistakes, weak spots, and poorly-written passages.

, Before you actually get down to editing the manuscript, you may find it helpful to read through it once as though you were a reader picking up a printed book. Don't make any changes to the manuscript while you're reading through it - you're still in the preparation stage. Simply make notes in the margins when you find a section that is confusing or poorly written so that you know where to focus your attention when you return to the manuscript.Aim to simply get an overall impression of the work as a whole.
Think of yourself as an outside reader. Try to get through the entire manuscript in no more than three or four readings so that you can take in the piece as a complete work.
Were there any parts of the manuscript that feel incomplete or confusing? Make note of those sections, but don't worry about revising them yet.
What were the strong/compelling/interesting parts of the manuscript? Mark those so you know what you're most reluctant to cut.

, Reading aloud can help you hear the words instead of simply seeing them. Many people find that hearing words spoken out loud makes it easier to catch errors. Reading aloud also makes you slow down, which could be another reason that it is easier to catch errors.

, Go back through the manuscript with a fine-toothed comb. Is there anything about the actual content that is not working? For fiction, are there any plot holes or places where the narrative falls apart? For creative nonfiction (memoir, essay collection, reportage), are there any gaps in your work where perhaps something that made sense to you may not make sense to an outside reader? For a scholarly manuscript, does the research clearly support your conclusions?Are there any conclusions your writing jumps to that may not make sense to a reader?
Does everything in the manuscript make sense? Is everything consistent from start to finish? If you have a thesis or central argument, is it complete and sufficiently supported?
Are your characters realistic and believable? Are they interesting and complex, or do they fall flat and two-dimensional?For nonfiction works, are you presenting each individual fairly and honestly?
Are there enough sensory details in the manuscript? Does the narrative come to life and draw you in?
Make revisions as necessary to satisfy these and any other points of concern within the manuscript.

, If you're writing a scholarly submission, you'll need a proper introduction and conclusion. If the manuscript is a creative work, it will need a compelling beginning and a strong ending. And on a page-by-page level, the entirety of the manuscript should be arranged with a clear and logical progression that leads the reader naturally from the beginning to the end.Look for transitions that guide the reader from one paragraph to the next. If your transitions are weak or lacking altogether, compose a sentence or two that will serve as a transition to the next paragraph.
When you were reading through your manuscript, did you find yourself losing interest at any point in the middle of the work? If so, perhaps you need to restructure the body of the manuscript. You may have loaded all the strong sections at the beginning and ending and forgotten to focus on the body of the piece. Rewrite these sections as needed.

, Once you've taken care of the larger issues like plot and structure, you'll need to take a close look at the language that you use in each line. Look for consistency in your line work and strong, well-polished sentences.Make sure that the point of view and tense stay consistent. Don't suddenly jump from one person's perspective to another, or from past tense to present or future tense.
Are there any awkward sentences that are confusing, clunky, or just poorly written? What about run-on sentences? Never-ending paragraphs? Remember that readers tend to prefer short, action-packed paragraphs instead of long-winded, drawn-out ones.
Look for and replace/remove ""crutch words"" - those words and phrases you tend to fall back on out of comfort or over-reliance. Instead, try rephrasing those sentences with fresh, original prose or cutting these parts out altogether.Find any sentences that are unnecessary (""filler"" lines) and cut them out. No matter how much you may like the way you composed a line, if it's not essential and doesn't contribute to the plot or to any character's development it's a waste of space.

, No matter how thoroughly you edit your manuscript, there may inevitably be some issues that you are blind to. That's where having an outside reader can come in handy. If you want a professional editor, you can search for editing services online. You can also ask someone you know and trust to review your work, but it should be someone who is capable of giving you objective feedback. It's best to avoid asking parents or significant others for feedback, as they may have a hard time looking past your relationship to find issues that need to be improved.Ask your reader/editor whether:


your manuscript makes sense
your ideas are clear and well-organized
the transitions between ideas, sentences, and paragraphs are all smooth and well-executed
your writing style is appealing and easy to engage with
there are any grammatical, syntactical, or formatting issues, If you haven't kept your computer's spellcheck function on during the writing process, turn it on now. Run a spellcheck for the entire document and look for any misspellings, improper use of capital/lowercase letters, and grammatical errors. Correcting these mistakes will help make your manuscript look more professional and polished, and could be the difference between a publisher's approval and rejection., Many people learned to type by putting two spaces after each period. Today, however, most editors and publishers (with relatively few exceptions) only use a single space. Having two spaces after each punctuation mark forces the editor to comb over your entire manuscript and take out the unnecessary spaces. You can save your editor a lot of time and effort (and thereby make your manuscript more appealing) by using the conventional method of only one single space after punctuation marks.If you need to remove extra spaces throughout your manuscript and you're using Microsoft Word, you can use the ""find and replace"" function. Simply navigate to ""Edit,"" hover your mouse over ""Find,"" and click ""Replace."" In the ""Find what"" section, type the space bar twice, and in the ""Replace"" section, type the space bar once. Then click ""Replace All."", If you're submitting to a publisher, you should have a decent idea of how that publisher wants your manuscript to be formatted. If the publisher hasn't directly communicated her desired formatting guidelines, check the publisher's website. Most publishing houses include guidelines on their website that dictate the font size and style, spacing between lines (usually either single-spaced or double-spaced), indentations, margins, page breaks, and page numbers.The standard font type is Times New Roman with a 12-point font.
Many publishers want page numbers, but not all do. For those that do, they may request that the numbers be printed in the top right, bottom right, or bottom center of the page.
If you're submitting a scholarly manuscript, be sure that your citations are formatted the way the publisher wants them., Now that you've made changes to the sentences, structure, and plot of your manuscript, taken out unnecessary portions, and reformatted it as necessary, read through the manuscript again. You'll certainly notice a lot of improvement, but try not to get caught up in how much better the manuscript is. Instead, look for any places that may need further revisions, and focus on polishing those sections as well.

, If you feel comfortable sharing your work with someone else (a trusted friend or family member, for example), do so. Just as you needed to have fresh eyes before you could begin revision, the freshest eyes belong to an outside, unbiased reader. There may still be parts of the manuscript that make sense to you in your head, but to an outsider would be confusing, unclear, or simply unlikeable.Let your reader know that you want an honest, thorough assessment of the manuscript. Tell your friends to save their praise for when the manuscript is published, and let them know that you want useful, thoughtful feedback on what needs improvement.
If you feel that the feedback you get is valid, make any necessary changes to the manuscript. Remember that it's normal for most manuscripts to go through numerous extensive revisions before being published.
Treat your friends to a nice meal or a bottle of their favorite liquor (assuming you're both old enough to legally drink) to show your appreciation.

, When you feel that your manuscript is well polished and complete, it's time to try and publish it. If you have an editor or agent, submit your work to that person. If you're sending it to a publisher, confirm that that publisher is currently accepting new manuscripts. Be sure to include a letter of thanks to show your appreciation for the editor/agent/publisher's time and interest, and show thanks to anyone else who's helped get your manuscript to the publication stage.

Consider the writer.,
Examine context.,
Think about the medium.",How to Detect Sarcasm in Writing2," If you know the writer personally, consider the writer's personality and point of view. This may offer insight as to whether or not this person is being sarcastic or not.


Sarcasm is frequently used as a form of humor. If the writer is known to make jokes, he or she may be using sarcasm in text. Sarcasm is also used when someone is frustrated. Is this person one to get annoyed easily?
Also, consider the writer's opinions. If this is a writer is, politically, pretty far to the right, he or she saying Obama's new healthcare policy is ""just wonderful"" is probably sarcasm.

, Just as you can figure out the meaning of the word by examining the words around it, you can detect sarcasm by examining context. Where did you encounter this piece of writing you believe is sarcastic? Given the context, is there any evidence that would indicate sarcasm?


What was happening leading up to the sarcastic sentence? Was the writer expressing an opinion, joking around with another person, or engaging in an argument? All three of these situations are ones where sarcasm is a likely response.
You should also look at the text proceeding the potentially sarcastic portion. It may be leading in to sarcasm. For example, let's return to an above example. If the writer spent a paragraph criticizing Obama's healthcare plan, and then said the plan was ""just wonderful,"" you can reasonably assume the ""just wonderful"" sentiment was meant to be sarcastic.

, Where are you reading the text? Are you on an online forum or are you reading an e-mail for work? Certain mediums are more prone to sarcasm than others. You could get in trouble for sending a sarcastic e-mail in a professional setting. However, people use sarcasm all the time when casually commenting on articles online.

Do not acknowledge it.,
Reiterate the sarcasm.,
Respond to a sarcastic work e-mail appropriately.",How to Detect Sarcasm in Writing3," If you are the target of sarcasm, there are a variety of ways to respond. If you do not want to engage in an argument, you can choose to simply not acknowledge sarcasm.


Simply ignore the sarcastic comment. Return to the point you were trying to make without engaging in it. For example, let's return to the healthcare example. You could simply reiterate your own points in favor of healthcare while not acknowledging the ""just wonderful"" comment.If you want to deescalate a potentially intense situation and get back on track to making progress, simply ignoring sarcasm is a good route.

, Sarcasm may not be intended to be taken seriously. If you're just joking around with someone, and they text you a sarcastic comment, you can text back one of your own. Exchanging sarcastic texts and e-mails is a great way to have fun with a friend., A sarcastic e-mail is often a cause of frustration, especially if you get one in a work setting. This is often unprofessional and you may be unsure of the best response. Try to remain calm and respond to a sarcastic work e-mail appropriately.


Wait a few hours to respond. If you're frustrated by an e-mail, you may end up saying something you don't mean in response. Give yourself time to process before firing back.Be the bigger person in this case. Do not fire back with sarcasm of your own. Instead, respond with something like, ""I'm sorry you're feeling frustrated."" As a lot of meaning is lost through written communication, it may be a good idea to take the conversation offline. Say something like, ""I'll be in my office at 3 today, if you would like to discuss this matter further.""If the sender refuses to deescalate the situation, and responds with further aggression or sarcasm, you may want to report the issue to someone in human resources.

Choose your topic.,
Discuss your initial ideas with your thesis supervisor.,
Create a working title.,
Review the current literature.",How to Draft a Thesis Proposal1," You might begin with a vague idea of what you want to research. You will need to define a topic that has interest in your field, can fill a gap in knowledge, and has a manageable scope. The topic should interest you and be something you are capable of researching and writing about.For example, you can start with the general idea that you want to write about how children are portrayed in 19th century Russian literature and your favorite authors are Turgenev and Tolstoy.;
, Before you begin writing your proposal, discuss your ideas with your supervisor. They can help you understand the complexities of your topic and suggest how you can best approach it. Having guided input will help you to write a better proposal.

, A working title is a short statement about your thesis. It can very briefly state what your research topic is and how you will conduct your research. This can help you narrow your topic and be better prepared to discuss it with your professor and committee.


Your working title should be longer and more descriptive than your final title.
For example, your working title could be “Tracing the Portrayal of Children in 19th Century Russian Literature in the Works of Turgenev and Tolstoy.”

, A literature review will provide you with information about what has already been published on your topic and help you identify gaps in earlier research. This can help you figure out where more research is needed. It can also show you how your thesis will fit into work already conducted in your field.Use the literature review to synthesize information about previous work done on your topic or topics related to yours.
Find the strengths and weaknesses in earlier studies that can be improved by your thesis.
Reviewing previous literature will help you figure out the potential significance of your thesis.
For example, you will want to start by looking for other works on Turgenev and Tolstoy as well as works that discuss the portrayal of children in 19th century Russian literature.

Choose what the main sections of your proposal will address.,
Create subtopics for each main section.,
Add other information you will need in your final proposal.",How to Draft a Thesis Proposal2," Knowing how a proposal is structured and what it should contain will help you outline yours. Find out if there are obligatory sections required for a proposal in your field. Your supervisor or committee might also ask you to include specific sections in your proposal.


Generally, a thesis proposal has an introduction, an abstract, a literature review, a discussion about methodology and theory, a timeline, and a bibliography.
Depending on your field, you may also present preliminary data and include appendices.

, Break down each main section into more specific subtopics. Include as many details as you can. This level of detail will make it easier to plug in information while you are writing the proposal.You do not need to know everything at this point. This is just to get you started.
For example, subtopics in the methodology section can include:

Specific novels or stories you will focus on.
Why you believe Turgenev and Tolstoy should be examined together.
How you will approach different genres.
How you will treat different stages of each author’s career.



, Your final proposal will require a bibliography, so put endnotes in your outline. You will also need to submit a timeline. Prepare for this by including notes on the outline about how and when you will accomplish each section.


This level of detail will save you time when writing the proposal.
You can also come up with a preliminary list of chapters.

"
Provide an introduction.,
Present your literature review.,
Describe your theoretical approach and methodology.,
Include your timeline.,
Write an abstract.",How to Draft a Thesis Proposal3," Start with an introduction to your work. Discuss the significance of the problem you will address in your thesis and what it will contribute to the field. In your introduction, also state your research objectives and the questions you plan to address.


For example, your introduction might start like: “Turgenev and Tolstoy wrote about memorable children, women, and peasants. While there are many studies about portrayals of women and peasants in their novels, there is much less scholarship about how children are depicted. This thesis will address children in these authors’ works.”

, Write out the information you learned during your initial review. First, summarize the important information you found in your sources. Next, present an analysis of that information and how it impacts the work you intend to do in your thesis. Discuss any works you will use in your research.For example, you could say something like: “Eikhenbaum and Berlin’s standard studies of Tolstoy will provide background information to this study. Neither of these works addresses any children who appear in Tolstoy’s novels.”

, Discuss your theoretical approach and the methodologies you will use to conduct your research. This can be one or two sections of the proposal. Talk about any initial data you have collected and your early ideas about the implications of your findings.


Address any possible concerns the committee might have with your methods and explain why you chose those methods.
This is where you should include information about working with human subjects or other data collection that might require additional permissions.
Information and discussion about initial data can be a separate section.

, Your proposal should clearly spell out the timeline you outlined. Indicate how much time you will need for each stage of the proposal. A good timeline can help demonstrate the feasibility of your research to your committee.Provide dates wherever possible.

, The abstract for your proposal will be a coherent summary of the entire proposal. A good abstract can be read as a stand-alone document. Structure the abstract based on your research questions, and address information about each question in that section of the abstract.Write your abstract last when you can best summarize your thesis."

Make a list of the main ideas you want to cover once you’ve chosen your topic and done some research.,
Begin to organize your points.,
Cut out any points that aren’t necessary.,
Add details.",How to Decide on Chapters for Your Book1," Use what you’ve researched, especially the areas that interest you the most. Make sure you cover the most important aspects of your topic, as well, aspects that anyone in the field would expect you to cover.


The same goes for something like a biography. For instance, it would be strange to write a biography of JFK without talking about his assassination. For a novel, list the main plot points you see happening in the novel. At this point, just brainstorm to try to cover as much area as you can.;
, What logically comes first? With an informational book, begin with easier topics, and move to more difficult ones. With something like a biography, the easiest place to start is near the beginning of someone’s life or career, so you can move chronologically.


For a novel, this task may not be as simple. While some novels move forward linearly—that is, they tell the story in a straight line—others jump back and forth in the story, revealing different parts out of order, time-wise. You have to decide how you want to tell your story.

, Maybe one of your main ideas is too basic for the type of book you’re writing, or maybe it is so out there that it doesn’t quite fit with everything else.

, The main topics in order serve as your outline; now you need to add details to each topic. Use your research and your own ideas together to fill in your outline.


With a novel, think about how different scenes could contribute to the plot; what could the main characters do to fulfill that part of the story?

Stop, Process.,
Think fast!,
Decide how to reply.,
Do's:

Reply fast.,
Don'ts:

Cry (anywhere besides a Meg Ryan rom-com, crying is unnecessary).,
Disarm them.,
Remember when to walk away.",How to Respond to Sarcasm," Immediately following the application of the device ""sarcasm"", take a second to decide why it was used. Was it used for humor, insult, or a dorky way for history teachers to connect to their rad students. Follow these tips to help decide:



Humor: Was the quip used quickly in a light setting? Was it followed by a smile and a longing look of approval? If so- it was probably intended humorously.

Insult: Was the situation heated before the comment? Did the statement contain hurtful material. Perhaps regarding your recent weight gain. It's not your fault, your carbohydrate loading for an upcoming marathon. Hopefully. If any of this applies, you've probably just been dissed.

Reaching out to youth: In more cases than necessary, sarcasm is used as a foolish ploy to gain youth attraction. This is usually initiated in forms of awkwardness anchored with puns and other word play. Characteristics include the phrases ""Uh-duh!"", ""NOT!"", and the topical application of ""uh-WINNING!"".;
, Regardless of choice, the most important things is to reply quickly. Any dawdling will immediately become a sign of weakness, showing limited exercise of your sarcasm muscles. A quick response ensures a hearty comeback. (On a special note, the faster you reply, the less creative your comeback has to be)

, Will you crush your competitor with a sassy comment about her birkenstocks or simply outwit your friend with a humorous quote. Things to keep in mind while replying to sarcasm would be found in the following steps:

,
Use previous knowledge on opposite.






Exploit their weaknesses, mainly their weird eye tick.







,






Use commonly used sarcastic replies (see Reaching out to youth).
Back down, once a comment is said, it's out there. Don't go back, man.

, Sarcasm loses its edge when you respond properly. Try one of the following:


Correct them. Explain the facts clearly and calmly. This response has the bonus that it can be combined with the laughter of step 3. But be prepared that the sarcastic won't care for your explanations since he or she is not on a lookout for justice.
Ignore it. They won't use sarcasm if they don't see any effect. Either pretend you didn't understand, or continue with the conversation. But your price for peace here is sleepless nights (one or more) when you're kept awake with regret and contempt.
Agree. Be sarcastic about their sarcasm. Be careful, however, as this can extend into a game of wits and the most sarcastic person walks away the winner, often leaving misunderstandings in its wake.

, A person who can only respond with sarcasm probably isn't worth listening to. But walking away leaves the sarcastic person pleased with his win and you emotionally devastated.

Move through your outline, main idea by main idea.,
Make the chapter long enough for the material.,
Don’t forget to subdivide.,
Don’t be afraid to rearrange.,
Use transitions.,
Don’t force chapter breaks.",How to Decide on Chapters for Your Book2," Try keeping one main idea for each chapter. However, be flexible. Some chapters may use more than one idea, if each one doesn’t cover much ground.


Some ideas may need to be expanded over two chapters or even three, especially if it is a major plot point. Is the hero trying to figure out his love life? Maybe that will take more than a single chapter.

, No set standard exists for the number of words per chapter. They can range anywhere from 2,000 words to 5,000 words, depending on what needs to be said. Some novels don’t even have chapters, per se, but are just divided into two or three major sections.


On the other hand, major sections without chapter dividers would not work for an academic book. Remember chapters are signposts. They give your reader an idea of what’s coming and a chance to stop and take a breath. Chapters help break up your material in manageable chunks for the reader.

, Chapters can easily be broken up into smaller sections. In academic works or nonfiction books, you can use major headings in chapters to help make information manageable.


In a fiction book, you can break the chapter up into major scenes, though you don’t use headings. The standard practice is to use an extra line space between scenes or three centered asterisks to divide up scenes in a novel.

, The order you decide on in your outline may not work when you actually begin writing. Rearrange ideas and chapter as needed, though always check to make sure you change any references to other chapters when you need to do so.

, When moving from chapter to chapter, provide some introduction or transition to the next chapter. It’s even possible to do so in novels, by providing a bit of foreshadowing about what’s ahead.

, A long chapter can be divided up into two smaller chapters, but don’t do it if it makes it awkward.

Fill in the cells beneath the column headings with the appropriate information.,
Organize the information by priority.,
Save the workbook.",How to Create a Writing Schedule in Excel," When Excel opens, you'll see a blank workbook.;
, Most versions of Excel open with 3 worksheet tabs at the bottom, labeled ""Sheet 1,"" ""Sheet 2"" and ""Sheet 3."" To have a tab for each month, you'll need to add 9 more.


In Excel 2007 and later, click the Insert Worksheet tab to the right of the rightmost worksheet tab. (It displays a small worksheet with a tiny orange starburst to its upper left.) A new numbered tab will appear to the left of the Insert Worksheet tab.
In older versions of Excel, right-click (click your right mouse button) on any tab and select ""Insert�"" from the pop-up menu. Select ""Worksheet"" from the options in the Insert menu and click ""OK."" A new numbered tab will appear to the left of the tab you right-clicked.
You can also add a tab by pressing the Shift and F11 keys on your keyboard. A new numbered tab will appear to the left of the tab whose worksheet was previously displayed.

, The default names of ""Sheet 1,"" ""Sheet 2"" and so on aren't meaningful names; you'll need to change them to the names of the months. You can do this in one of the following 2 ways.


Double-click on the tab. The tab name will be highlighted, as your cursor changes from an arrow to an insert bar. Type in the new tab name.
Right-click on the tab and select ""Rename"" from the pop-up menu. The tab name will be highlighted as above. Type in the new tab name.

, On the first (January) worksheet, create the following column headings in the first row of the spreadsheet: Publication, Article Title, Editor, Tasks, Payment, Deadline, Date Sent, Reply Received, Comments.


Most of these headings will spill over past the width of the column. To expand the column width, place your cursor on the divider between two column labels so that it changes to a vertical line with horizontal arrows projecting from it. Double-click your left mouse button and the column width will automatically adjust to fit the title entirely within the column.
Once you have entered the column names, you may want to bold or italicize them to make them stand out from the information in the columns. To do this, select the titles by dragging your cursor through the cells containing the titles. To bold the selected text, click the Bold (""B"") button in the Home ribbon menu in Excel 2007 or later or the toolbar in older versions of Excel; to italicize it, click the Italicize (slanted ""I"") button.
To copy the column headings to each of the other worksheets, select the headings and press the Ctrl and C keys on your keyboard simultaneously. Click each successive tab, and when its worksheet displays, press the Ctrl and V keys simultaneously to paste the headings into each of the other worksheets. (You will have to adjust the column widths to display the entire heading within the column.)

, For the most part, the column headings are self-explanatory, but the following information is provided as suggestions to make the writing schedule easier to use.


If you're working on several articles for the same publication during the same month, list them all together, using one cell in the ""Publication"" name and successive vertical cells for each article.
If you frequently call or e-mail your editor while working on your assignment, you can list your editor's phone and e-mail in the cells beneath that person's name or insert columns to the right of the name column. (To insert a column, right-click the column to the right of the column where you want the new column to appear beside and select ""Insert�"" from the pop-up menu. Select ""Entire column"" from the Insert menu and click ""OK."")
Use the Tasks column to break down a lengthy assignment into smaller tasks, such as ""Research,"" ""Interview,"" ""Outline"" and ""Writing."" (Do this in the rows beneath the row in which you entered the article's title, rate of pay and deadline.) You can then enter your own deadlines for each task, each earlier than the deadline for the article itself and enter the completion dates in the ""Date Sent"" field. (If you do this, you may want to bold the deadline date for the article and the date you sent the completed article to your editor.
Use the Comments column to note whether the article was accepted or rejected, if a rewrite was requested and when it was sent or to summarize your editor's comments.

, You can do this by using the Sort dialog. In Excel 2007 and later, you access this by clicking the Sort button on the Data ribbon, while in older versions of Excel, you select the Sort option on the Data menu. Your most likely priorities to sort by are either the deadline for the article or the rate of payment.


To sort the entire worksheet, click the button in the upper left where the row and column labels meet, then access the Sort dialog. Indicate that your data has headers or a header row to exclude it from being sorted, then select either ""Payment"" or ""Deadline"" as the column header to sort by. If your version of Excel provides ""Sort On"" options, choose ""Values."" If sorting by ""Payment,"" choose ""Descending"" order (""Largest to Smallest"" in Excel 2007 and later); if sorting by ""Deadline"" choose ""Ascending"" order (""Oldest to Newest"" in Excel 2007 and later).
If you plan to break an article down into smaller tasks, do the sorting before adding the additional tasks, particularly if you prioritize by deadline, as the individual dates will be considered in the sort.

, Use a name such as ""Writing Schedule,"" followed by the year. This way, you can create a new workbook for each subsequent year by doing a ""Save As"" to create a new workbook for each successive year.

"
Think ahead about what you want, and what you think your boss or teacher wants.,
Don't start the conversation immediately with ""business,"" unless you know your boss or teacher is in a rush.,
Respect and honor their authority.,
Add careful flattery.,
Keep your own discussion short and to the point.,
Keep the mood light, even in difficult conversations.,
Thank them for any help they do offer.",How to Smooth Talk1," Don't just go into the talk blind. Ask yourself what you're hoping for out of the interaction, making a clear goal before you start talking. Even better, ask yourself what they might want out of the talk? Can you find a way to make sure everyone gets what they want? Having something to offer the other person, even if it is small or meaningless, is a great smooth talking tactic.


Are you trying to get out of trouble, and know the teacher or boss believes you should be punished? Find a way to fix the problem or remedy the solution, a plan to make things better later.
Are you asking for a favor? Find a way to make the request personal to them, showing how helping you helps them as well (you'll pay them, the project affects their neighborhood, etc.)
Empathy, or the ability able to imagine things from another person's perspective, will make you an exponentially better smooth talker. Know what they want, and it is much easier to get what you want.;
, Spend some time talking, building a personal relationship, before launching into the professional one. People are much kinder to those they feel close with, and smooth talk is the art of bringing out the best, happiest, and friendliest of everyone to make it more likely they'll help you. Jumping right into business makes many people feel used, the exact opposite of a good smooth talker's goal., Coming out with a challenge will turn things into an argument instantly. Instead, remain polite, submissive, and kind. This doesn't mean you let yourself get pushed around. Rather, it lets them feel in control, and thus more open to compromise and kindness. The key to smooth talking -- never get noticed. It's easiest if you don't rock the status quo.Listen intently when they talk. Nod along and add phrases like ""that's a good point,"" ""I hadn't thought of that,"" and ""I respect that opinion.""
""I love my job,"" or ""I really love this class!"" shows that you're not trying to attack, you're trying to improve. Remember that a smooth talker works with someone, not over them.Offer to let speak first and thank them for the chance to share your side. Remember, you're not trying to outrank them, you're trying to talk them on your side.Always use proper titles, like Mr. and Mrs, or sir and ma'am, when appropriate.

, This can quickly go from kind to creepy if you over do it, so limit yourself to a few short, quick compliments, well-separated apart. A good rule of thumb is that, whenever you need to say anything negative, sandwich it between two short compliments. For example:


""I understand why you run such a tight ship at work, and it really makes us so productive! I'm still not sure it is fair to make us all come work on Saturday. But I understand you're thinking about it because you want us to keep being such a great, powerful company.""
In your compliments, watch for telltale signs of comprehension and relaxation, such as crinkles in the corners of the eyes (a sign of a hidden smile), unclenching fists, and shoulders becoming less tense and drooping slightly. This often means you're getting somewhere positive.

, You don't want to seem evasive, leaving out large chunks, but they don't need to know what shirt you were wearing or exactly what you did when you played hooky and got caught. Just tell your story in a basic, no-frills way, letting them ask questions if they have them. If you're requesting help or a favor of any type remember this simple 3-part request:


Tell them the problem that needs to be solved. If possible, show them how the problem affects them. This could be ""I cant afford to get in trouble"" or ""there is no product for young users.""
Show them a proposed ""solution."" Again, show how they can make it a reality, coming with ideas, not just issues.
Give them proof of your future ""success."" Let them see why supporting, helping, or not punishing you will lead to a better world for both you and them., Again, smooth talk is about easing your way in and out of the conversation, not rocking the boat and making a scene. A few jokes, light laughs (even at your own expense), and small smiles will keep everyone at ease and make it much easier to make your request, ask forgiveness.


""Okay, I admit that I may have had a temporary case of ""bone headedness,"" but we both know that I have been reliable, professional, and helpful ever since I started.""
Remember to make eye contact when talking -- this builds trust and companionship.

, If your smooth talking works, then thank them profusely and let them know that they should come to you if they need any help. Building up strong, lasting relationships now makes smooth talking easier in the future, so don't just take your ""victory"" and dash -- it will come back to bite you next time you're around."

Make notes on how you swear.,
Think about where you can and cannot swear.,
Consider using a reward system to motivate yourself.,
Think about what you are trying to say when you swear.Sometimes, swear words are used in ways that are far different that their actual meaning.,
Use euphemisms.,
Invent new, inoffensive expletives You can invent nonsense words to use instead of swear words.Since these words are newly invented, they won’t offend some people like swear words will.,
Use outdated swear terms.,
Borrow fictional swear words.,
Swear in a foreign language.,
Bleep yourself.,
Speak eloquently.,
Keep a vocabulary list of the new, less offensive words and phrases you have learned and are practicing.,
Stop using swear words in writing.,
Use apps to remove swear words electronically.",How to Replace Swear Words with Less Offensive Words," Brainstorm all of the swear words you use, and make notes on when you use them (when joking with friends, when you are angry, when you stub your toe, etc.).Knowing how and when you swear is the first step in figuring out inoffensive replacements.


For instance, you might be able to identify your number one swear word, and start by replacing just that one.
Think about both when and why you swear. Do you swear to impress friends? Out of habit? Because other people around you do?;
, You might be interested in limiting or eliminating your swearing in certain contexts, such as when you are at school or work.However, you might be fine with swearing in other contexts, such as when you are at home or hanging out with friends. When trying to replace swear words with inoffensive alternatives, you might first try to replace them in only one context, before moving on to others.

, You can help yourself consistently replace swear words with inoffensive alternatives if you reward yourself when you are successful.You can try a positive reward system. For instance, you can buy yourself a new pair of shoes if you make it through a week of replacing swear words.
You could also try a negative motivator. For instance, you can make yourself put a dollar in a jar each time you use a swear word.

, Start thinking about what you are really trying to say when you swear, so that you can develop a list of good alternatives.


For instance, the “B” word technically means “female dog,” while the “A” word means donkey, and the ""D"" word means wishing one person to an evil place, yet all of these words convey very different meanings when used as swear words.
Sometimes, swear words are used when a more precise word or phrase could be used to express a thought or feeling. For instance ""This exam really f***ed me over"" doesn't really say much, while ""I didn't do well on this exam because I hadn't studied enough for the section on thermal dynamics"" is much more specific.

, Euphemisms are relatively harmless words or phrases that are used in place of more offensive ones.Using a euphemism instead of a swear word is a quick an easy way to clean up your vocabulary. Many existing swear words also have common euphemisms. For instance, try saying:


“Funk!” instead of “f***!”
“Darn!” instead of “damn!”
“What the eff?”, ""What the heck?"", or ""What the barnacles?"" instead of “What the f***?”. Also ""What the hell?"" (acceptable with limitations).
“SOB” instead of “Son of a b****”
“BS” instead of “bull s***!”
“Screwed up,"" ""stinks,"" or ""sucks"" instead of “f***ed up”
“Goofball” instead of “dumba**”
""Rats!"" instead of ""crap!"" or ""s***!""

, Use your imagination to invent replacement words and phrases like:


""Boccalocca""
""Egumwalasha!""
“Dinglebuff”
“I literally buhdangled my pants”
“He was so glogged up”
“I got my weewuu beat at bowling last night”
“I can’t find my nogwrangling keys!”

, Some words that were once used as offensive swear words have either become more acceptable, or have generally been forgotten. You can have fun researching some of these words and phrases, and practice using them to replace contemporary swear words. Some examples include:“Consarn it!” instead of “damn it!”
“Zooterkins” (a seventeenth-century term for “God’s wounds!” or “Zounds”!)
“Sard” (an Old English term for f***)
“Waesucks” (means “woe’s sakes,” but can be used in place of ""s***!"")
“Gadzbudlikins!” (unknown derivation)
“Fopdoodle” for “dumba**”

, Science fiction books, films, and television shows often invent alternative languages, including swear words. You can use some of these as less offensive replacements for swear words. For instance:“Ying-takh!” or “puh-takh,” from Klingon, to replace the “S” or “F” words.
“Frack” or “frak” from Battlestar Galactica, to replace the “F” word
“Goram,” from the Firefly series, to replace “G** d***!”

, You can use swear words from foreign languages as replacements. Since others around you may not know the foreign language, the replacement word will be less offensive. Avoid using swear words from a foreign language around others that speak that language, however. Some examples of foreign swear words include:“Scheisse” (pronounced “shy-seh”), German for “s***”
“Aborder,” Cajun for “f***”
“Culo,” Spanish for “a**”
“Perfututum,” Latin for “totally f***ed”

, Television, radio, and other media sources often use a “bleep” or “beep” sound to censor swear words and other undesirable or offensive phrases. You can adopt the same approach. Any time you feel the urge to swear, just say “bleep!” For example:


“This bleeping movie is stupid!”
“I lost my bleeping phone!”
“I’m so bleeped.”

, Circumlocutions, or ways of getting around saying something that you don’t want to or shouldn’t, can be used as another way of replacing swear words.They can also be an opportunity for you to practice speaking creatively and eloquently, and to have fun while doing it. For instance, try saying:


“By the beard of Zeus, I declare: I have lost my keys and this has thrown me into a woefully anguished state of mind” instead of “I can’t find my keys. I’m so f***ed.”
“That motorist displayed neither noble character nor common decency when our paths crossed” instead of “I can’t believe that f***ing jacka** cut me off at the four-way stop!”
“Woe is me! My addled brain confounded my feet, and I have unfortunately collided with this rock!” instead of “S*** I just stubbed my toe on this f***ing rock!”

, Writing down and memorizing words and phrases to replace profanity will help you remember to use them. You can also have fun learning new replacement words.

, Once you start removing or replacing swear words from you spoken vocabulary, you might want to start cleaning up your writing as well. Texts, emails, and other common forms of writing are all contexts in which you might swear. Since it is hard to guarantee that information will be kept private once it is written down, you can use less offensive language in these contexts. You never know when your boss will check your social media accounts, for example! Some techniques include:Using Grawlix. Grawlix is a string of typographic characters meant to represent profanity without actually writing the word. For example, you can type “#$&*” instead of “s***,” or “*&#%!” instead of “f***!”
Use combinations of letters, numbers, and symbols to form nonsense words that resemble swear words. For example, “5h17” instead of “s***,” or “13itch” or “81tc#” instead of “b****”
Use acronyms instead of full phrases. For example, “WTF” instead of “what the f***,” or “SOB” instead of “son of a b****”

, Certain apps, such as Clean Reader, have been developed to remove swear words from e-books.Similarly, certain media players, such as iTunes, allow you to select a “clean” setting that removes explicit songs when listening to your music.Using these apps may help reduce the amount you curse by exposing you to fewer swear words.


These apps cannot remove swear words from printed texts, obviously.

Begin with open, flirty body language and a big smile.,
Use a calm confident tone, instead of trying to find the ""perfect words."",
Ask questions and listen intently to find out what conversation they care about.,
Share information and stories about yourself, creating openness and honestly.,
Give him or her space instead of lunging in for the romance immediately.,
Know when to make a move.",How to Smooth Talk2," These are the real keys of successful smooth talking and flirting -- a genuine smile and open body language. Some researchers even believe that the single most effective move you can make is to look a girl or guy in the eye and smile.To keep things smooth, also focus on:


Keeping your chin up.
Shoulders back, chest out.
Spine up straight when either sitting or standing.

, There is no script or playbook that you can use every time to be a smooth talker. What actually matters is not what you're saying but how it's said, and that is luckily easy to control. You should:


Use clear sentences. Speak slowly to avoid mumbling.
Hold solid eye contact, smiling, and nodding when listening or talking.
Keep up a slight smile up when speaking, unless the conversation turns to something more serious.
Talk to everyone around you, not just him/her. Confident people happily chat with everyone., Conversation is about finding common ground and building a good relationship from there. Smooth talk is no different -- you just want to take a step back and let him/her show you their interests. Once you know what they are interested in, you can start tailoring your conversation to fit both of your shared interests. In reality, smooth talk for dating is much more about listening than saying anything.


""What do you love to do that is not work?""
""What brings you here?""

, You shouldn't tell everything, but you do need to give a little information to get a little. More than not, this happens naturally, but when you're trying to smooth talk it often gets tempting just to keep on talking. While you should feel free to be yourself and tell stories, try to limit yourself to under a minute of talking at any one time -- smooth talking is about listening, remember. When you wrap up stories, try to turn them into questions:


""Have you ever heard of something like that?""
""That's my embarrassing middle school band story -- did you ever play any instruments?""
""Anyway... that's my job, and it feel really fulfilling. But I want to hear more about you!"", The biggest problem when most people ""smooth talk"" dates is that they come off as creepy, desperate, or for better or for worse, ""practiced."" Real smooth talkers never appear to want anything at all -- they are relaxed, calm, and in control -- and this is a really appealing quality when so many people use pick-up lines and weird tactics to meet dates. So hold back, focus on the conversation and don't feel like you need to ""make a move"" or risk losing him or her.


Keep some distance -- you should be able to hear each other talk, but you don't want to press up close right off the bat.
If he or she is scooting closer as you talk, and you feel comfortable moving forward, you should feel free to move closer as well.

, Smooth talking a date is about getting to know her and searching for a spark. But how do you know when you've found it? While everyone is different, and this list is by no means exhaustive, the following cues generally mean you should ask her to dance, tell him that he should kiss you, or offer to exchange numbers. A general feeling of connection or ""gut feeling"", though hard to describe, does mean something, so trust yourself!


Looking at your lips
Breaking the ""touch barrier"" by stroking your arm, shoulder, back, etc.
Asking if you've got plans soon, or are free later
""I'm having a really great time getting

Distribute copies.",How to Draft a Collaborative Writing Agreement," You should set up your word processing document so that it easy to read. Use a sufficiently large and legible font. Times New Roman 12 point is standard.;
, Insert the title at the top of the page. You can title the document “Writers’ Collaborative Agreement” or “Screenwriters’ Collaborative Agreement.”Center the title between the left-hand and right-hand margins.


You can also make the title in all caps, bolded, or a slightly larger font so that it stands out.

, In the first paragraph, you want to identify all of the writers to the project. You can also state where the contract is being formed. You might want to use language like the following:


“This Agreement made at , by and between (the ‘Parties’).”, Recitals summarize the intent of each party. You can also explain the writing project in your recitals: whether it is a screenplay or book, as well as the subject matter.


You might write: “The parties intend to collaborate on an original screenplay based upon the life of Margaret Thatcher (the ‘Work’), and desire to establish their rights and obligations in the Work.”, Generally, you will probably own the work equally—50/50, if there are two writers. However, you can assign ownership percentages in any way that you want. Make sure to include a provision explaining how ownership will be divided.


You could write: “The Parties shall collaborate in the writing of the Work and, upon completion, shall be the owners of the Work in the following percentages: .”, Screenplays are usually registered with the Writers Guild of America. You will want to explain that the work will be registered as the joint creation of both parties. You should also mention whether you will register your copyright., You want each writer to know the deadline, so insert a provision to this effect. You could state, “Parties agree the Work will be completed by . Failure to complete the Work by the deadline shall not be construed as a breach of this Agreement.”, Life intervenes, and sometimes an author can’t finish a collaborative writing project. To protect yourself, you should include a provision giving the other writer the power to complete the writing project alone.


A sample provision might read: “If, before completion, either Party voluntarily withdraws from the collaboration, then the remaining Party shall have the right to complete the Work alone. The remaining Party shall also have the right to work with another collaborator, in which case the ownership percentages will be revised by mutual agreement in a writing.”, One or more of the authors might perform other tasks, such as marketing the work or performing background research. You should explain what these other tasks will be.


For example, you could write: “It is further understood by the Parties that , in addition to writing services, shall perform the following tasks regarding the Work: .”, You will want to make sure that all collaborators consent to any sale of the work. Include a provision requiring mutual written consent.


A sample clause could read: “Neither party shall sell or dispose of the Work without the written consent of the other Party. This consent will not be unreasonably withheld.”, You can decide in the collaborative writing agreement how you will be listed as authors. This might not be a big deal for you. However, some people like to see their name first, so you can decide by contract how the names will appear as authors., When you work collaboratively, you typically share the costs necessary to create and promote the work. However, you don’t want one writer to incur costs without the collaborators knowing. You can include a provision requiring mutual consent for all costs.


Your provision might read: “Expenses of any amount for which Parties are mutually responsible shall not be incurred without advance mutual consent in writing. Each Party may decide to absorb the full costs of an expense in order to advance the completion or promotion of the Work. If a Party decides to absorb a cost, it cannot subsequently require compensation from the other Party.”, Imagine that you successfully write and sell a book or screenplay. You will get a sum of money. Now you need to explain that this money will be used first to pay off expenses (including commissions). Typically, writers state that monies will be applied in the following manner:First, to pay commissions.
Second, to pay any expenses.
Third, to each writer in proportion to their ownership percentage.

, A successful book or screenplay can create many income streams. For example, you could have motion picture rights, sequel or remake rights, and stage rights. Include a provision in your collaborative writing agreement where you agree to share the proceeds from the following:motion picture rights
prequel rights
sequel rights
remake rights
television rights
stage rights
radio rights
rights for book and other media publications
computer-related rights
merchandising rights
other rights currently unknown

, One writer might be paid to revise the work. This often happens with screenwriters. In this situation, you should state whether the other writer will get a portion of the money paid for the revision.


If the money paid will be shared, then include a provision like this: “If the Work is sold and either Party, or both, is employed to revise the Work, the compensation shall be shared in the same proportion as the ownership of each Party in the project.”, A warranty is a promise each writer makes to the other writer. Typically, you warrant that the material you create is not plagiarized from someone else and that you aren’t defaming someone in the material. If a person breaks a warranty, then you can terminate the agreement.


A sample warranty provision could read: “Each Party warrants that any material written or provided in connection with the Work does not constitute a violation of copyright, right of privacy, or common law, and that it does not contain any defamatory or illegal material.”, Typically, you terminate the agreement if the other writer breaks one of their promises under the contract. For example, an author could incur an expense without consent and charge you for it. You typically give the other side a chance to fix the problem.


A termination provision could read: “Either Party may terminate this Agreement by giving a written notice of termination in the event the other Party breaches any of its obligations under this Agreement, and the breach is not cured within 30 days of receipt of written notice.”, If either writer breaks the law—by, for example, defaming someone in your written work—then both of you will be sued. However, if you include an indemnity clause, then the author responsible will agree to defend you and pay all of any settlement or jury verdict against the both of you.


A sample indemnity clause would read: “Each Party agrees to indemnify and hold the other harmless against any loss or damage arising out of a breach of any of the warranties or other representations in the Agreement.”, You should state where each side must send its written notices. Include a provision stating the addresses as well as the preferred method of sending the notice., Disputes are not uncommon, and you can decide in the contract how you will resolve disputes. For example, you could agree to mediate a dispute, with each side splitting the costs of the mediator.


A sample dispute resolution clause could read: “Disputes arising under this Agreement shall be submitted to the Writers Guild of America for arbitration in accordance with the Guild’s arbitration procedures. The arbitration committee’s determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the Parties.”If you are not a member of the Writers Guild, then you can select a different arbitration committee to hear the dispute, such as the American Arbitration Association.

, This clause states that the written contract contains the entire agreement. This clause is helpful because it prevents one side from later claiming that a prior agreement should trump the contract.


A sample clause could read: “This Agreement contains the entire agreement between the Parties concerning the subject matter hereof. All prior agreements, discussions, warranties, covenants, and representations are merged herein. Any amendments or modifications of this Agreement shall be in a writing executed by both Parties.”, Add a line for each writer’s signature and a line underneath for them to print their name. Also add lines for the date., Ideally, each side should show the contract to their lawyer before signing. If you don’t have a lawyer, then you can find one by contacting your local or state bar association and asking for a referral.Ask your lawyer if anything is missing in the contract or whether you should revise the terms. You shouldn’t sign the agreement until you agree with everything in it.

, After everyone signs the agreement, you should make copies and distribute them to the following people and organizations:each writer
your agent
the Writers Guild (if applicable)

Draw up a list of curse words.,
Begin your list of taboo words with the most powerful swears.,
Base your repertoire not only on meaning but on sound.,
Break gender roles.,
Swear for pain.,
Curse to take control.,
Swear to replace violence with verbal retribution.,
Curse to get a laugh.,
Swear to relieve tension after a close call, like an accident.,
Swear to bond with others.,
Swear softly but with feeling to add emphasis to what you're saying.,
Curse for your health.,
Swear for good business.,
Curse away, but not with the intent to hurt someone.,
Consider the individual who is on the receiving end.,
Avoid taboo words that have negative racial connotations.,
Stay away from words that are gender-offensive.,
Avoid gay slurs.",How to Start Cursing," Divide the list into 3 parts. Begin your list with the most powerful swears. Finish with the most benign. Although swearing is a spontaneous act, a ""database"" of swear words will better prepare you to swear.


Base your list on taboo words that registered most deeply with you--they'll be the ones for which you have the most conviction.
Chances are you’ve heard plenty of curse words in your lifetime. About 0.7% of the words used daily by a person swears.;
, Finish with the most benign. The word you found most potent? Put that on your A list. Benign? Put it on your C list.


Suggestions for your A-List are the curse words you’ll seldom use. They’re more taboo than the others. They have the potential to be more offensive, also. So be careful how you use them.
Middle-of-the-road curse words are suitable for your B List. They’re less abrasive and harsh than the “top-of-the-line” curses.
Use “gentler” curses for your C List. Include in this group words like ""hell,"" ""damn,"" and ""crap."" A word like damn is fun to say and not overly offensive. It’s almost, but not quite, a non-swear. ""Damn! It's raining again.""
Practice saying the words on your list so that they won't sound awkward or forced when the time comes.

, Sound conveys meaning and sometimes renders emotion clearer than a word which has a literal meaning. Think about the charge you get singing along with a chorus even if it's only a sound like, ""oooooh.”


Swear words tend to sound quick and harsh. The sound departs from the sound of most words in our daily language and so it enters the realm of taboo because it's heard as offensive or abrasive.Damn is a soft word and it hardly raises a feather.
Other curse words are abrupt, harsh and guttural. They work better in a heated moment. Think of them as two steps more potent than damn.

, Swearing is anti-taboo. Why be restricted? The swear most often uttered by women is ""Oh My God."" Men are partial to swears that are more taboo, less restrained. Men and women share an affinity for some words like hell. Women tend to choose more benign forms of swearing (for the most part).Perhaps this is due to a double-standard for swearers. When women swear it can be seen as uncouth. More so than for men., You’re activating the ‘fight or flight’ response which leads to a surge of adrenaline and an analgesic effect. A test showed that people who swear are able to hold their hands in ice-water twice as long as people who don’t. Use your A List for pain swears.
""Ouch"" is nice. But something a bit stronger, harsher has a better chance releasing emotion and easing the pain.

, When you’re faced with a bad situation, swear! It can give you a sense of power and control, rather than a feeling that you’re being passive and letting things happen to you.Use you’re A or B List for control swears.
You’re fighting back when you swear. This can help confidence and self-esteem.l
Cursing can jump-start you to take further action. Cursing is the beginning of action and can spur you to continue along the action path.""I'll fix this #*@&! thing if it's the last thing I do.""

, Swearing allows you to respond forcibly to other people’s offenses without resorting to physical violence. You’re resorting to verbal violence instead which is, of course, preferable (remember the ‘sticks n’ stones’ poem).Use your A List for this situation.
Channel your anger into using sharp/insulting words by swearing.Swearing also serves as a warning, like an animal’s growl.Swearing is sort of the halfway step between doing nothing and throwing a punch.
""Only an #*@&! would do that.""

, Swearing with your friends can be fun. Exchanging curses without really meaning them is like a verbal toss n' catch. Creative curses are a release from the normal constraints we face in less friendly circumstances.Use A, B or C Lists for this one. Combine curses. The odder the combination, the funnier.
""My #*@&! head feels like a #*@&! #*@&! cantaloupe.""

, You can verbalize emotion, relief, humor all at once.


Use your A, B or C List for this.
""Holy #*@&!. We almost hit that car.""

, Swearing in a group can show that you're being your down-to-earth self. It signals that you're honest and open. It makes others comfortable around you and can help them to trust you more.Experiments rating the believability of court testimonies, found that believability was improved when swears were used.
Empathy for political speeches was improved when the speakers used mild swears.Use your B or C List for this.
""Sometimes I don't know what the hell I'm doing. But I try my damnedest, don't I?""

, It shows that something is important to you. Swearing while playing a sport, for instance, is quite common.Use your B or C Lists for this.
""I've got to get my head out of my #*@&! and start getting my serves in.""

, Cursing affects our bodies. It increases circulation and elevates endorphins.


Cursing also has psychological benefits. It helps to establish an overall sense of calm and well-being, as long as you're not angry or out of control.A, B or C Lists for this one.
""#*@&!. I'm not going to die from this. Calm the #*@&! down!""

, You're sharing your true impressions with fellow-workers. For your professional associates, cursing is a window into your thoughts.


Witty uses of coarse and casual swears boosts morale and lowers stress among low-level workers, according to research.Research shows that the liberal use of four-letter words allowed factory workers to bond over shared frustrations and to build solidarity.B and C Lists for this. Less often, use the A List. And be careful to choose the right situation and the right audience!
""Let's get this damn thing finished and go home.""

, When swears are intentionally directed at individuals they’re hurtful. Use them to disparage experiences and situations, not people.Use your vocabulary. Swearing at someone who offends you might offer relief, but it won't explain why you were offended as effectively as telling them why. Try to be kind and gentle in this., Or even in the vicinity. Don’t repeat curses that you know are particularly offensive to the individual.


If it’s clear that you’re aware of the individual’s sensitivity and use the curse word anyway, it could be interpreted as targeting that person. And if it is, you could be the subject of litigation., They can directly express a racist point of view that you wouldn't otherwise feel comfortable expressing.


The ""N-word"" is too taboo to use. Even if it's clear to you that you're not intending to be racist, the word is offensive to African Americans and has racist connotations. The upside to using the word is not close to the downside.
Many cultural groups have offensive slang terms that are used to degrade the group.You might think that your intentions are to be creatively taboo. But you can't account for how the word sounds to the person you're targeting. They might have a whole history of dealing with racism and are constantly on guard for it.

, Stay away from curse words derived from body parts. Be aware of how the word will be heard. If you take a step back and ask why should a part of the body be used as a tool for insulting someone or expressing displeasure, it becomes clear just how inappropriate those taboo words are.

, Again, there's really no upside to using them. In the rare case that you're certain the word will be taken as humorous and doesn't express a biased-sexual-orientation view then . . . perhaps. But gay slurs should, mainly, be avoided. If the word is being used to imply inferiority, then don’t use words that represent someone’s sexual orientation.

, If you say something so complex and outrageous, no one will be impressed. Here's an example: say someone calls you fat. Don't say: ""Well, I could use my belly to blow your skinny face into the ground."" It just seems pathetic, trying to save face with humor. Instead, maybe try ""Well it's better to be fat and happy rather than an anorexic stick like yourself.""

, All comebacks should flow perfectly. Try to avoid stuttering as well.

, Like someone says you're the stupidest person ever, you could say, ""And why are you telling me this?"" The only thing they could say after that is, ""Cause you can't do anything good.""

, This will help you get a comeback, and can embarrass your opponent as well! for example, if they say that you are disgusting, you can say ""look who's talking"" back.

, Maybe an even better comeback would be ""I don't have time for immature viewpoints such as yours"", then walk away. It leaves them in the dust. Be sure not to sound panicked like ""Oh crap! Oh no, I don't have time for this!"" Make it so you seem superior to them.

, That shouldn't have to be explained any better.

, If they say your clothes sucks don't talk trash about their clothes. You'll sound desperate to have a comeback. Say it gets you where you need to go.

Don't make eye contact.,
Walk quickly.,
Look ""closed off."",
Keep your body busy.",How to Ignore Someone1," Not making eye contact is the best way to ignore someone. Once you lock eyes, you're acknowledging that you know that person exists and are blowing your cover. If that person is near you, avoid their eyes at all costs by making sure to make eye contact with every person but them, looking straight ahead, or even looking at the floor.


If the person is shorter than you, then just stare right over their head. If the person's taller than you, make sure not to look up.
If the person is the exact same height as you and standing nearby, try blurring your vision so you have a ""dead"" look in your eyes if you do lock eyes by accident.;
, Another way to ignore someone is to walk as quickly as possible. This will show that you're a busy person with places to go, and that you have no intention of lingering around to catch up with the person you're ignoring. Walk with your arms at your sides and your head held high, like you're staring ahead at your next goal, even if you're really not going anywhere special.


If you see that person approaching from a distance, leave enough space between you so you don't brush up against that person.
Don't go out of your way to walk away from that person. If you cross the street or duck into a hallway, that will make it look like you care too much. But if you see the person from a far distance and you're sure he doesn't see you, then you really should just try walking in the other direction.

, If you happen to be near the person, fold your arms over your chest, cross your legs, slouch, and do anything you need to do to look completely unapproachable. Your body should say, ""Don't talk to me, buddy,"" and hopefully the person will get the message.


Don't smile, either. Keep a straight face, or even a frown, planted on your face to look like you don't want to talk to anyone.
You can also go for the creepy blank look on your face - that will scare anyone off from trying to talk to you.
If you have longer hair, bangs, or a hat, try to keep part of your face covered to discourage the person from trying to make eye contact.

, As an alternative to looking closed off, you can also just look really, really busy, like you couldn't possibly talk to that person because you have your hands full and don't have a second of time to spare for a silly conversation with him.


If you're with friends, turn toward them and gesture wildly, looking so animated that you couldn't possibly stop to talk to the person you're ignoring - let alone to look at them.
If you're alone, look engrossed in a book, magazine, or a textbook. You can even quietly read the words to yourself, looking like you're intent on memorizing them.
Keep your hands full. Whether you're walking or sitting, hold your phone, textbooks, or even an unwieldy potted plant. This will discourage the person from trying to talk to you.

If they are frustrated, you have essentially won.",How to Insult Somebody Creatively," If you insult someone without taking a moment to gather your wits, you'll probably just be plain defensive or come across as confused. When you insult them, take a small amount of time to think about it. Not too much or they'll catch on, but a long pause is just fine. If you're short on ideas use a previous insult and modify it. Chances are, they won't catch it.


Take a few deep breaths (draw your breath in noisily if it helps), concentrate on what needs to be said and draw on your pre-rehearsed comebacks (see step 2).;
, Think up appropriate ways to insult the different people who might insult you. If you have a starting point, the rest will come easier.

,, Instead, just smile and laugh it off. It will make the person wonder what they're doing wrong.

, or any other variants such as ""That's what she said!"" You can use ""your mom"" jokes to make them be quiet when they are coming up with a comeback to stop them, but they're not creative and people have become used to ignoring them.

, If you then talk about how their insult would apply to them more than you, they are removed of this crucial power and you have pointed out that which is evident––they're projecting their insecurities onto you.

, If they come up with a comeback, chuckle a bit say, ""It's a bit too late for sarcasm, but thank you."" You must remain grounded in your apparent idea that they were complimenting you, they won't believe it, but it will make it harder for them to insult you effectively.

, Once again, it is all about removing their power and therefore increasing yours.

, If so, interrupt them and pick apart their insults.

, Frustration is the equivalent of an arm bar in martial arts, you haven't won yet, but you're about to. this point is critical. You have the choice to either apologize at this point or continue and send them into a swearing or crying wreck. You need to feel when they're frustrated.

Use your phone.,
Play music.,
Ignore someone online.",How to Ignore Someone2," Using your phone will also help you ignore almost anyone. There are a few things you can do to ignore someone with your phone. First, you can just use the phone to look busy whenever you see that person. Talk to someone else on the phone, laughing wildly, or look engrossed in an intense text-message exchange with someone you actually want to talk to.


Change your phone number so the person can't call or text you.
Block that person's number from your phone so you can't receive messages from them.
Set an alarm on your phone to ring when you know you're near that person, so you can pick it up and pretend to be talking to someone.

, Invest in some headphones, and wear them at all times when you're alone, even if you're not listening to music. When you see that person, blast your music to deafening volumes and bounce your head to the beat, so you look completely absorbed in your tunes, with absolutely no time to waste on the person you're trying to ignore.


If you want to be really annoying, you can even close your eyes and sing along to the music, giving the person you're ignoring almost no chance to talk to you.

, Ignoring someone online is even easier than ignoring them in person because you don't have to physically avoid them. To ignore someone online, just make sure to avoid any of that person's emails, Facebook posts or messages, Twitter feeds, or any other attempts to contact you online.


Block that person from any of your social networks. Make sure he has no way of reaching out to you online.
Change your email address and other usernames if you have to. That person should have no way of contacting you online.

"
"
Find a new walking route.,
Avoid that person's favorite hangouts.,
Go places that person will never go.",How to Ignore Someone3," If you want to ignore someone by changing your routine, the easiest thing to do is to change your walking route so you no longer bump into that person. If you always bump into that person between classes, take the long way to get to your next class so you don't have to see that person. If you always run into that person at work, start using a different hallway or bathroom to minimize contact.


If you always see that person when you're walking no matter where you go, start driving places.
If that person seems to have changed their walking routine to fit to yours, keep changing yours until they give up.

, This one is a no-brainer. If you know that person's favorite bars, restaurants, and parks, just don't go there anymore. It won't be worth it, unless you want to spend the whole time there actively ignoring that person.


You can also learn the days when that person goes out. If he only goes to their favorite restaurant on weekends, and you really want to go there, you can just go during the week.
If that person only goes to a certain bar during happy hour, just hang out there later at night.

, If that person is a meat lover, start checking out the vegetarian restaurants in your hood. If that person hates jazz, check out the latest jazz concert in your area. If their mortal enemies with one of your friends, then that friend's parties are a great place to escape that person.


By actively going to places where that person will never go, you're not only ignoring them, but seeking out newer, cooler hangouts that don't involve that person.

Ignore someone in school.,
Ignore someone at work.,
Ignore someone socially.",How to Ignore Someone4," Ignoring someone at school can be tricky, especially if you share all of your classes with that person, but you can still find a way to ignore someone in school without being too obvious about it. Here's how to do it:


If you normally sit next to that person in class, switch your seat. If you have assigned seats, talk to your teacher and ask if you can change.
If you see that person in the cafeteria, see if you can sit in a new place.
If you run into that person in the hallways, just look straight ahead, like you're so focused on getting to your next class that you didn't even notice.
If that person asks you a question in class, just look away and pretend that it didn't happen.

, Ignoring someone at work can be difficult, because it's likely that you sit near that person or even work on projects with that person. Still, there are a few things you can do to minimize contact.


Avoid the break room or kitchen when that person is there. Learn when the person goes in the kitchen to get their lunch or for a refill of coffee, and make sure you keep a different eating and caffeine-drinking schedule.
If you sit near that person at work, stay focused on your computer, and keep a stack of papers at your desk so you can always look really engrossed by them instead of looking up at the person.
Don't jeopardize your professional life. If you really have to talk to that person to get some work done, do it. The person will be even more annoyed if you talk to them at work and then ignore him completely after work.

, Ignoring someone socially is easy if you know what to do. You just have to lean on your friends and try to stay as far away from that person as possible even if you're in the same room. Here's what you can do:


Stay busy with your friends. Talk with your friends and laugh it up like you're having the most hilarious conversation in the history of the world.
Dance. If the person comes near you and there's music playing, grab a friend to the dance floor and start rocking out. If the person still approaches you, close your eyes like you're really feeling the music.
If that person is standing in your circle, be extra engaged with everyone else around you. When that person talks, scratch your ear or check your phone - act like nothing is happening.

"
Be assertive.,
Ignore consequences.,
Question authority.,
Cultivate an air of disinterest.,
Dress the part.,
Use the right body language.,
Don't let anyone into your physical space.,
Say whatever comes into your head.,
Have a sense of entitlement.,
Hang out with people your parents don't approve of.",How to Have an Attitude," You want to make sure that your personality is dominating and that your presence can't be ignored. Otherwise, who is going to notice that you've got attitude? Practice doing this so that you can pull it off naturally.


Assert your independence by not following along with things just because they are popular (clothing styles, popular music, t.v. shows, movies, etc.).
Act as if you are better than other people and therefore more deserving of things. You want to couple this with your assertiveness. Do things like borrow your sister's clothes without permission, heckle your parents into buying you an iPhone, play your music really loudly late at night when other people are trying to sleep. Never apologize for your actions.
Be stubborn. When people try to get you to act differently, do something you don't want to do, or change your behavior, make sure that you stick to your guns. You're going to have attitude however other people feel about it.;
, When you have attitude you're going to get a lot of flak for the way you're acting. People (in particular, adults) are not going to be happy with you and they'll probably try to mete out punishment. To have proper attitude, you'll need to ignore these consequences, or do things in spite of the consequences.


Ignore what you don't want to deal with and dismiss anything except what you want to do. This means not doing your homework, or your chores and spending the time watching movies, playing video games, hanging out with your friends, etc. instead.
Ignore reality. Everything that you do is going to have consequences. The more you have attitude towards the authority figures in your life, the more you're going to be punished. Likewise ignoring things like school, trying to get a job, or expecting things to simply fall into your lap, are probably not going to work out well for you. To maintain your attitude, you're going to have to ignore these potential consequences.

, Part of having an attitude is questioning the people who have the power to make you do things you don't want to do and punish you if you don't do them. Learning to question their decisions and commands is actually a useful skill that develops your independent thinking.


Use the phrases ""But so and so's mom always lets her do it"" or ""But everyone else gets to do it,"" when you're trying to get your parental units to do let you do something they don't want you to do.
Always ask why when someone asks you to do something (this works especially well for parents and teachers). For example, if you hate math, make sure to ask your math teacher what the point of algebra is. If your parents set a bedtime, challenge that bedtime and ask them why you have to go to bed at that time.
Disobey rules. Another way to have attitude and severely irritate those in authority, is to disobey the rules that they set in place. When they punish you (if they catch you), act like you don't care and ignore the punishments, as well.
Do things like stay out past your curfew, borrow the car without permission, go out with friends without telling anyone where you are. When you get grounded, or otherwise punished, ignore the punishment.
Constantly push the boundaries, at school and at home, to see how far you can go without getting in trouble. Just operate under the assumption that everyone has a breaking point and that you can push them to it by constantly arguing with them, lying to them, and rebelling against their rules.

, Coping an attitude means not giving a single care about other people. You need to have an air of ""I'd rather be anywhere but here"" whatever it is that you're doing. This is especially important when your parents, or authority figures want you to do something.


The use of “yeah, whatever” to any attempt to get you engaged in activities that you don't want to do, and a scoffing laugh, can get your attitude across perfectly well.
Using sarcasm can be a very effective tool to showing your disinterest and superiority. These phrases are particularly good for having an attitude (said in a sarcastic tone): “how interesting” and “I am so glad you told me that.""
Laugh derisively when given a suggestion or a talking to by an authority figure. This will show them how little you care for their opinion.
Make sure that when people are talking to you that you are busy texting on your phone. You can also do this in class when you're not interested in whatever the teacher has to say.
Be uncommunicative. When your parents take an interest, make sure to respond as shortly as possible. For example: when they ask “How was your day?” you shrug and mutter, “Fine.” If they ask “What are you doing this weekend?” just say, “eh...whatever.”

, You need to make sure that people notice your attitude and one way to do that is to dress with the intent of showing how little you care, or by actively trying to piss people off.


Wear things your parents won't approve of like clothing that doesn't fit you right, has inappropriate slogans on it, or is dirty and ripped.
Create your own style. You want to make sure people know that you don't care what they think about you and one way to do that is to be obvious about crafting your own style. Remember, you don't just want to wear all black to show your attitude (anyone can do that), you want to make yourself unique.
Piercings and tattoos are all the rage with the rebellious and those who are trying to really piss their parents off. You will need to be over 18, however, to get a tattoo or piercing without parental consent, unless you go to an disreputable place (and that's bad for things like infections, so it's not recommended.

, Body language is the perfect way to communicate how you're feeling. Showing the proper amount of attitude means using the right body language, so that other people know what's up.


Cross your arms across your chest. While this is a defensive gesture, it can also be a gesture of irritation or boredom and can mean that you aren't interested in the person or persons you're with.
Rolling eyes is a great way to express irritation or derision towards another person. Whatever they say make sure to roll your eyes, especially if you've gotten in trouble for breaking rules.
Not making eye contact or making too much eye contact are good ways to show attitude. Not making eye contact can be really irritating to other people because it shows a lack of interest on your part. Making too much eye contact can be intimidating.
Slamming doors and making a lot of angry noise (like playing angry music really loudly) can show your displeasure and disrupt everyone else's life. It's especially good to use this tactic after you've had an argument with an authority figure.

, Your room is your own personal realm and you get to rule it however you want, and that includes letting people (like your family) into it, when and if you choose to do so.


Yell at family members who try to come into your room. Put signs on your door that it'll be instant death for anyone who tries to come into your room without your express invitation.
If someone knocks on your door, tell them to ""go away!""

, Don't filter the things that you say. If they're rude, so what? You're looking to have an attitude and an attitude means not caring how the things you do and say affect others.


Point out the mistakes of others. When people screw up (especially adults like your parents or your teacher) make sure that you ridicule them for it. Say things like ""Oh my god, mom, I can't believe you burnt dinner. Can't you do anything right?""
Speaking your mind is a great skill to cultivate and it is also one that will serve you well if you're copping an attitude. If someone is wearing a truly hideous outfit, make sure that you tell them so. If your friend is acting like an idiot over a boy, make sure that you mention it loudly.

, This is an important part of having an attitude, because the attitude comes from the belief that you are better than everyone else (hence pointing out mistakes, and shooting down suggestions). Act like people's time and energy belongs to you (especially people like your parents; definitely take them for granted).


Act like you know everything. When someone tries to change your mind or convince you otherwise, simply laugh at them or roll your eyes and walk away.
Never say ""please"" or ""thank you."" These are phrases that are way to polite and mannered for your attitude, so you'll want to avoid them at all costs. Never try to help out around the house and definitely don't try to give your teachers at school a hand, even with something simple like holding the door for them.

, You will want to make sure that you're hanging out with people who support your attitude, which basically means hanging out with people that your parents won't like or approve of; people who have as much attitude as you do.


You can easily find these people at school, as long as you cultivate an air of disinterest in them and in everything, they'll be dying to be friends with you.
You definitely want to make sure that the people you're hanging out with are people who aren't going to tell on you to your parents that you stayed out past curfew or your teacher that you haven't done your homework all year.

Smile.,
Make eye contact.,
Nod your head.,
Mirror their body language.,
Speak occasionally.,
Repeat what the other person says.,
Ask to be excused for a moment.,
Give body language cues.,
Find a break in conversation.,
Say thank you.,
Use an exit line.,
Offer a consolation.,
Go to your destination.",How to Ignore Someone While Pretending to Pay Attention," Putting on a smile gives you a friendly demeanor, and suggests to the other person that you are happy talking to them., Looking another person directly in the eye suggests attentiveness, and creates a connection. You don't need to stare at the other person. Even when paying attention, this is over-the-top and aggressive. Occasionally making eye contact shows the other person you are paying attention., Occasional slow nodding as the other person talks makes it seem like you are agreeing with them. You don't want to do this throughout the whole conversation, or too quickly, which will make you look impatient., Use your body to mimic what the other person is doing. This doesn't necessarily mean copying specific gestures, but look at things like the way they are sitting or where their arms are positioned. Try to position your body in a similar way., You don't need to respond directly to anything the person has said. A generic leading phrase like ""That's interesting"" or ""Tell me more"" will give the other person room to keep talking. Phrases like this are signs of active listening, and the other person may interpret them that way.Open ended questions like ""What do you mean by that?"" or ""Why do you think that is?"" will give the person an opening to continue talking, which prevents you from having to join in.
Other vague phrases or sounds, like ""Okay"" and ""Mmm-hmm,"" are good ways to encourage the other person to continue talking without you having to contribute.

, Try to use the last phrase the other person said, and repeat it as well as you can. It doesn't need to be too long, or even a full sentence (you'd probably need to really pay attention for that). You don't need to do this all the time, just on occasion. This will make it sound as if you are agreeing with, or thinking about, what the other person just said.For example, if the person has been talking about deep-sea fishing, you could say ""So you really caught a shark?"" Then you can add an open-ended question like ""What was that like?""

, This can buy you time to do something else for a few moments, while letting the other person believe that you will let them restart. It is less rude to a friend or acquaintance to let them know you are putting them on hold., Start changing your body position to let the other person know you are looking to get out of the conversation. Avoid eye contact, shift your body into facing a different direction, or move into a more uncomfortable position like the edge of your seat. Generally this is a good way to start winding down conversation, not just ending it, as body language cues can sometimes be vague., Any pause or lull in the action should do. Usually you can tell when the other person uses words like ""well"" or ""anyway"" as space-fillers. This can give you an opportunity to start a quick good bye., Thanking someone for their time, company, or information is gracious and good manners. You don't need to talk about enjoying the conversation if you didn't, but a simple thank you is polite, and suggests to the other person that you valued the interaction., It is always better to emphasize something you need or are trying to do. This can be something like ""I need to get this project done soon"" or ""I really wanted to talk to this person as well."" Exiting for something you need makes the exit appear to be more about you than the other person.If you started the conversation, a line like ""I just wanted to see how things were going"" or ""I'm glad we could catch up"" can signal to the other person that the conversation has reached a good stopping point.
Make sure your exit line is honest. Lying is a good way to get yourself caught, which will embarrass both of you later.

, If it someone you think you may want to talk to later, offer to keep in touch. If the person has been discussing a hobby or interest, offer to share information with someone else you know who might be interested. You don't need to have been paying attention to the details for this, just remember the basic thrust of what the other person was talking about., If you left the conversation by telling the other person you had somewhere to be, or something to do, get on it. If you suddenly delay, or wind up talking to someone else, then it will look like you were dodging the other person."

Broad insults are great for days when you’re mad at the world or just want to be seen as a crusty curmudgeon, while specific insults are best when you want to haul someone up short for doing wrong by you.


Being specific also lets you focus on the person’s behavior instead of on the person as a whole when the person’s action is what prompts you to deliver an insult.
Being broad-based, in contrast, can be useful when you’ve had enough of a person because of the sum total of his or her bad behaviors and wish to have nothing further to do with that person.

, You can deliver your insult directly to the recipient of your wrath in no uncertain terms, damn him or her with faint praise, or let someone else insult the recipient for you.


Insulting the person directly requires you to be willing to confront others, both the person you’re insulting and any of his or her supporters who may be within earshot. You’ll also have to be prepared for any possible reprisals, whether in the form of counter-insults, threats or acts of violence, or criminal acts against your property.
Damning with faint praise means to use words that sound innocuous or even complimentary, but are actually intended to put someone down. Examples would be calling someone “alliaceous” or “cepaceous,” which compare the person to a bulb of garlic or an onion, or branding someone who speaks nonsense a “phlyarologist.” These words are best delivered in a gentle tone of voice and to recipients whose vocabulary isn’t as large as yours.Letting someone else insult the person for you can mean reporting actual derogatory comments made by a third party to the recipient, embellishing the third party’s comments to make them insulting, or attributing your insult to a third party when delivering it to the recipient. All these options require the third party to be someone whose opinion would matter to the recipient without the recipient’s checking to verify the third party actually said what you claimed the third party did., As the world increasingly becomes a global marketplace, you are more likely to encounter people of different ethnicities and cultures than before. Each culture has developed its own insults according to what it considers the most offensive things, which may or may not be the same as yours.


Animal references are popular, such as the German ‘’Schweinhund’’ (“pig dog”) or ‘’Esel’’ (“jackass”).
Scatological references (bathroom humor) are also common, such as calling someone a “p*** artist” in Ireland, meaning that the person urinates on himself or herself when drunk. Other countries prefer going Number 2, as in Taiwan’s ‘’Gou pi’’ (“dog f**t”) or Bosnia’s ‘’Sanjam da prdnem na tebe’’ (“I dream of f**ting on you”).
Some cultures go in for sexual references, such as China’s ‘’Ham sep lo’’ (“salty wet man”), their way of calling someone oversexed.
Wishing someone harm always seems to be in style, as in the Dutch ‘’Krijg de kanker’’ (“Get the cancer”), which sounds so much cooler than the classic “Curl up and die!” Then there’s the Bosnian ‘’ A bog da ti kuca bila’’ (roughly, “May your house be live on CNN”), which is equivalent to wishing your celebrity crush be stalked by paparazzi for the rest of his or her life for not giving you an autograph.
Some cultural insults border on the downright funny, as with the Japanese ‘’Tofu no kado ni atama wo butsuke shinjimae’’ (“Hit your head on a corner of tofu and die’’). You might hurl this insult at your celebrity crush for not giving you an autograph if the person is a vegetarian with a reputation for either bad luck or clumsiness.A few cultures are noted for their intolerance for the foibles of others. Yiddish, notably, has words for people who brag (‘’barimer’’), overeat (‘’fresser’’), are cheap (‘’karger’’), are clumsy (‘’klutz’’), are losers (‘’schlemiel’’), or always have bad luck (‘’schlemazel’’). Perhaps they simply like to ‘’kvetch’’ (whine).Sometimes, you can use the rules of a culture’s etiquette to your advantage to enhance the insult. German has two words for the singular “you”: the formal “Sie” and the casual “du.” It’s considered bad form to address someone as “du” before you get to know them well. Calling a stranger ‘’du Esel’’ is adding insult to insult., Directly attacking the recipient by name-calling is not always necessary to insult him or her. You can instead attack a person the recipient cares about or admires, put down or accomplishment the person is proud of or a skill the person is trying to master, mock a particular mannerism, or highlight something you find particularly annoying.


People who the recipient cares about are usually members of the person’s immediate family. One insult of this type is the “yo-momma” joke, where the insult describes how fat, lazy, ugly, old, poor, or stupid the recipient’s mother is supposed to be: “Yo momma so old, her prom date was a Neanderthal.” These jokes started to become popular in the 1990s; by the mid-2000s, MTV had built a show around them.Skills that are often targeted for insults include driving or cooking, as in “You treat me like a god. Everything you make is either a burnt offering or a sacrifice.” Similarly, the most effective insults targeting the recipient’s mannerisms are for those mannerisms the recipient is most self-conscious about or those he or she knows bother you most and are often delivered by exaggeratedly mimicking those mannerisms.
Insulting the recipient’s accomplishments can be particularly biting if the recipient has put in a lot of time and effort into them. Imagine how writer S.J. Perelman felt after the publication of his first book, ‘’Dawn Ginsbergh’s Revenge’’, when Groucho Marx told him: “From the moment I picked your book up until I laid it down, I was convulsed with laughter. Someday I intend reading it.”, If you think the recipient is likely to take what you say the wrong way, you may want to soften your words by leading with something that sounds like an apology, such as “with all due respect” or “I’m not saying this to make you mad.”The danger with this approach is that your intended apology will probably not be seen as sincere once the recipient hears the insulting part of it, and claiming you’re not trying to make the person mad may actually anger him or her.

, With this style of insult, you start off by saying something that sounds either neutral or positive, and then turn it into something demeaning to the recipient. This style is often used by comedians in their nightclub routines.


Groucho Marx was a master of this style of insult, with lines such as “I never forget a face, but in your case I’ll be glad to make an exception” and “I’ve had a perfectly wonderful evening, but this wasn’t it.”If you decide to use this style of insult, pause shortly after your opening before you deliver your insulting follow-up, unless your insult is short, such as “I worship the ground that awaits you.”, Sometimes, you’re just too mad or too tired to preface your insult with either a pseudo-apology or an innocuous opening. In that case, just hit the recipient with your insult.


Ad hominem insults, or insults against the recipient as a person, are commonly delivered this way. They normally feature name-calling (“You idiot!”), but may also feature profanity or curt instructions as to where the recipient can go.
Acts of incompetence can also be insulted this way, as in “Your cooking sucks.”
This style works particularly well with made-up insult words, such as comedian Don Rickles’ famous “hockey puck.” (Rickles’ insults are delivered in an exaggerated “in-your-face” style that has earned him the nickname “Merchant of Venom.”)

It definitely will make them uncomfortable so they will want to end the conversation as quickly as possible, Smiling is a universal gesture across all cultures and conveys a positive feeling.


Fake smiles are easy to spot, however, so it might help to think of something that makes you happy in order to genuinely smile around an irritating person!, Nodding while the other person is talking indicates that you are listening without you having to say anything, and can be a gesture of encouragement., Leaning toward the person you are speaking shows interest. Conversely, slouching conveys disinterest. , Certain signals like eye rolling or sighing, can indicate annoyance. Be conscious of what you are projecting."

Don't be afraid to say ""I'm sorry.""",How to Give Someone the Silent Treatment," In some situations, words are not needed and even not appreciated.Especially if you may say something that either may not be helpful or make the situation worse, keep your words to yourself. You can avoid hurting someone’s feelings by simply not saying anything at all.


While silence may be beneficial in the moment, do make a point to address the issue at a later time, especially if it’s something that has hurt you or offended you. The silence is a temporary approach that shouldn’t be prolonged.
Don't let anyone bully you into speaking if you choose not to speak. However, it can be beneficial to state that you are choosing to remain silent. Say, ""I'm having a hard time controlling my emotions right now, and for that reason I'm choosing to stay silent. Let's talk about this later when we're both more calm.""
Sometimes, it's not a good idea to use the silent treatment in a relationship. If you’re using silence to punish someone or manipulate behaviors, it ultimately prolongs and does not resolve the issue.;
, The primary characteristic of the silent treatment is not talking to the person. Basically, you don't say anything, not even if the person tries to engage you in conversation.You actively choose not to respond to any comments, discussions, or accusations.


If the person keeps engaging, simply tell him you are not willing to engage at this time. Say, “This isn’t something I want to talk about at this moment” or “I’m not in an emotional space to talk about this constructively. Let’s talk later.”
Be aware that silence can anger someone, and this person may begin to demand a response, or escalate his or her actions to protest your silence.

, Another form of silent treatment is ignoring other types of communication, such as phone calls, emails, messages, and text messages. If you are giving someone the silent treatment, it can be effective to ignore these forms of communication, as well.Again, you can alert this person to your silence. Say, “This isn’t a good time to talk. Let’s revisit this in the future.”

, This tactic works best in a crowd. The person may speak up and say something, but you continue whatever you are doing without acknowledging that the person wants your attention.In fact, you don't even respond non-verbally. You don't make a movement to acknowledge the person spoke, for instance, such as turning your body or face. If you do, it gives the person an in.If the person keeps talking, you can ask to talk to the person later when you have both calmed down. For instance, if someone in a meeting keeps trying to bring up the same topic, you could say, ""Thank you for that information, but right now isn't the time for it. Can we talk about that later?""

, If you are trying to avoid talking to a person, try to skip places where you know he or she will be. Go another route, or choose a different time to be in a place you know the person will be.This is one way to create distance you need while you sort through your emotions and take a break from the person.


If you work with this person, avoid eating at the same time for lunch breaks. If this is a classmate, sit further from him or her. If it is your family member, plan activities to do if you think you may be home at the same time.

, If you're showing anger or even sadness, another person can take that as a response. Of course, in some situations, it's hard not to show any emotion, but if you can do it, it leaves the person with fewer ways to attack you.Monitor your reactions and emotions as much as possible.


Monitor your facial reactions and eye contact. Many emotions are evident on the face, so try to react as minimally as possible., One purpose of the silent treatment, at least by some people, is to avoid the conflict altogether. That is, any time the conflict is brought up, you refuse to talk about it.While this is not a productive way to handle all conflicts, you may want to handle certain situations through silence.


For instance, if you’re out in public and do not want to start arguing, you can say, “This isn’t the time or place for this discussion. I refuse to talk about it further until we can better engage this.”

, Whether from a child or from an adult, it never helps to engage a tantrum. Tantrums serve to get attention or to manipulate a situation to go a certain way.Instead of engaging over-the-top behaviors, it's best to ignore them and not allow the behavior to have any emotional anchor on you.If your parent threatens hysterics on account of something you may do in the future, or if your partner threatens drastic behavior if you leave, calmly disengage from the situation.

, Especially if this person is egging you on, withhold your statements.


If this person keeps pressuring you, you can say, ""I'm doing my best not to say anything that may hurt or offend you, and it's best that I say nothing at all.""

, If someone is taunting you or spouting off negative comments to you, don't dignify the words with a response. By not responding, you enact your power of standing for yourself, and of not allowing the comment to affect you.If someone is attacking you or belittling you, there's no sense in defending yourself or reaching that same level of stupidity.


It's best to ignore the comments, not let them emotionally affect you, and move on.

, Arguments can reach the point where rationality flies out the window and you find yourself yelling for no apparent reason. If you notice someone reaching a point of inability to listen to rational statements, there's nothing you can say to respond well. Instead of intensifying the situation, take a step back and say nothing.


You may try to explain things or make a defense for your actions. Many times it's best to say nothing and move on.
When in an intense argument, it can be beneficial to shift your attention to fully listening to the other person. The other person will see that you are attentive and being heard, and may begin to calm down.Monitor your own emotions and keep from saying things out of anger.

, If you really are too mad or can't deal with your emotions, tell the person you want to step away for a bit. That way, you're not ignoring, but you'll have time to get yourself under control.As an example, you could say, ""I really want to talk about this situation with you. However, my emotions are running really high right now. Can we come back and talk about this in an hour when I feel more calm?""

, It's easy to get caught up in emotions when you feel accused of something or that you're being unfairly treated. You may need your own calming during an argument. Retreating to silence may be a way for you to calm down, clear your head, and begin thinking from a more rational state of mind., If you're regularly using the silent treatment against someone you love, it can damage the relationship. In fact, many psychologists consider it a form of abuse, as you are intentionally punishing the other person for something he or she has done.Regularly using silence as a way to retaliate is not a way to solve problems, and can build up resentment in the other person. If you notice yourself engaging in this behavior, approach the person and break the silence.

, Instead of focusing on the emotions around the issue, focus on the issue. Don’t get sidetracked by things that the person said that trigger you, stay on track with what’s important. Work on the issue together to figure out how you can move forward.If you’re ready to move forward, say, ""Can we take a moment to talk about this problem? I'd like to work it out.""
If your arguments often get sidetracked, you can take a moment, write your feelings on a piece of paper, and then trade papers. That way, you can express your emotions without interruption or being sidetracked.

, Instead of giving into the silent treatment, let the person know how his or her action made you feel. Stick to ""I"" statements instead of ""you"" statements, as that focuses on how you feel rather than putting blame on the person.For example, if you're unhappy because your spouse has come home late again, you could say, ""I feel anxious when you don't come home on time and don't call. I fear for your safety, and I miss your company."" That's a better thing to say than ""You're never home on time, and I hate it."" The first one opens a discussion. The second one places blame.

, Once you've both aired your grievances, take time to brainstorm a solution. Of course, that may mean you both need to compromise, which means you'll both have to give a little.To compromise, find your core concerns first. Then brainstorm ways to meet the needs with both of you benefitting.

, To truly communicate, you must take time to listen to what the other person is saying and feeling as well. If you've gotten to a point where all you want to do is give the person the cold shoulder, that's probably an indication you need to have a serious conversation.Listening to what someone has to say shows that you are engaged, interested, and respectful.


Actively listen to what the person is feeling and thinking, and show him or her that you are listening by summarizing what they've said every so often and asking relevant follow-up questions.

, Everyone makes mistakes, and it’s important to take responsibility for your actions when you hurt someone. If you handled a situation wrong, own up to it. Don't be afraid to apologize for any actions you have done that have caused harm."

Figure out what would make this person less annoying to speak with.,
Have an exit strategy.",How to Feign Interest when an Annoying Person Talks to You2," Paraphrasing is an excellent way to indicate interest and generate empathy and understanding. It lets the person know you are listening. To paraphrase, you repeat back to the person what they said, using your own words.Phrases like “I heard you say,” “it sounds like,” and “you must be feeling” indicate to the listener that you will be paraphrasing.
A good paraphrase for “I’m so sick of sitting in traffic for an hour on my way to work!” might be “Wow, it sounds like your commute is really exhausting!”
Paraphrasing requires active listening--you need to pay close attention--so this may feel draining with an especially annoying person. Consider looking at it as a skill-building opportunity (paraphrasing is a great communication tool). You also may not wish to use it for a great length of time.

, Questions show interest and engagement (even if you feel neither of these), and help the other person feel you are trying to connect with them.This can also help you refocus the conversation to something you may find more tolerable. For example, “You mentioned your sister; how is she doing?”

, You can still be respectful and kind to a person who drives you crazy. Most likely, they are not trying to annoy you intentionally.


It is not rude to set boundaries, however. If your coworker has been talking nonstop for the past fifteen minutes, it’s okay to say, “I’m so sorry I need to cut this short, Maria, but I need to get back to work.”, Words like “Uh-huh,” “yeah,” “wow,” “that’s crazy,” or “how fascinating” will do the trick. If you add nothing else to the conversation, the other person will likely lose interest in talking to you.

, It is probably not best to divulge any more details than are absolutely necessary to someone you don’t enjoy talking to. This also helps keep interactions to a minimum.

, Is this person only obnoxious when discussing certain topics? Get them on a different track.


For example, “I can’t say that the state senate race really interests me that much, Bob. But speaking of races, are you still running these days?”

, If you can’t get a word in edgewise, it’s okay to interrupt a monologue.Apologize for interrupting and make your point: “I’m so sorry to interrupt, but I was hoping you could help me with this problem.”

, Imagine you’re an actor, performing a scene with another actor who is playing the role of an annoying person. This helps depersonalize the interaction, and helps you remember that a scene doesn’t last forever!, Keep a positive attitude when around the annoying person. Most likely, they are not aware how much their behavior bothers you., If they constantly stand too close to you, tell them to step back. It’s possible that no one ever told them their behavior is a problem.


For example, you could say, “Joe, I’ve noticed that whenever we talk I always feel like we are crammed in an elevator together. Would you mind backing up a bit?” Even a good-natured, “Hey man, back up!” may suffice.

, It’s okay to end a conversation, especially if you have more pressing matters to attend to. Here are some ways to end it:


Make an excuse. Look at your watch and “remember” you need to be somewhere. Say you need to get something to eat, or need to use the bathroom.Say “It’s been so nice talking to you.” Even people with poor social skills will recognize this as a natural end to the conversation.
Wait for a lull in the conversation. Then you could say, “Well, I should get going. Have a good day!”
Blame yourself for not keeping up the conversation. For example, maybe you are a terrible multitasker. Try saying, “Jim, I’d love to talk more, but I can’t do a good job listening to you while I’m organizing these files! I’ve never been good at multitasking. I should probably get back to it.”
Walk away from a conversation when it’s done. If you stay there, one or both of you may feel pressure to keep talking.

Find common ground.,
Get distracted.,
Enlist help.,
Be polite.",How to Feign Interest when an Annoying Person Talks to You3," Whether you are making small talk at a party or with a relative, finding a shared interest can make annoying people more interesting to talk to.


Stick to safe subjects. If you have a devoutly religious uncle, and you don’t practice any faith, don’t talk about religion! Change the subject if something controversial comes up.
Think of a topic or hobby you are both interested in. If the cousin who only talks about himself plays guitar like you do, steer the conversation to what he’s enjoyed playing lately.
Ask an annoying partygoer how they know the host or if you share any mutual friends., Something in your environment may provide an excuse to end a conversation.


Look at the refreshments at a party and say, “I need to get some of those brownies before they’re gone! Excuse me!”
Blame noise level. If you are at a loud event, pretend you can’t hear the person. Then slip away.
Work on something else while they’re talking. Make copies, straighten shelves. This sends the message that you are busy.
Answer the phone: “I’m so sorry, I need to take this!” Respond to an email that just popped up.

, Other people can help you find a way out of an annoying conversation.


If you are going to a party where you know an annoying person will be a guest, have a friend help you manage the situation. For example, you could tell your friend, “I’m going to talk to Kelly for ten minutes. After that, come and pull me away with an excuse.”
Flag down a passing co-worker and ask a work-related question to interrupt the annoying person.

, Even though the conversation may be annoying, it may be worth it--for work, social, or family reasons--to tough it out. You can find ways to be respectful and contribute to help keep the peace.


Talk about yourself. Your family, in particular, may be interested in hearing what you have been up to. This also can help you steer the conversation.
Ask your elders to share old stories. You may learn interesting things about their lives.
Focus on the task at hand. If you need to deliver something to their desk, drop it off politely and leave.
Don’t take rude behavior personally. If you work in a customer-centered job, you may have to deal with annoying people frequently. Politely address their concerns."

Decide why you are rushing.,
Realize the commitment a fraternity involves.,
Ignore the campus stereotypes.,
Do your research.,
Narrow your options.,
Be yourself.,
Be upfront.,
Talk to everyone.,
Ask questions about the fraternity.,
Narrow your options again.,
Remember, that if you don't get a bid from one of your top two and you still want to join--keep rushing.",How to Rush a Fraternity," This is the most important part, because if you don't know why you are there, then you will most likely be very unhappy with your decision down the road. People rush for many different reasons; some want a resume booster, some want to find a family, some do it because their parents want them to. Don't rush a fraternity for other people, do it because you want to rush. Find a few good reasons, and stick to that. You don't want to tell one fraternity one reason and tell another reason to another fraternity; despite the rivalries, fraternities still cross-reference potentials with each other. And above all, don't say you want to join a fraternity ""to party and meet girls"".;
, Most fraternities still have a pledge system (there are a few that have done away with it and created a whole new system) and pledging is a major commitment. Usually, pledging involves mandatory study hours, weekly meetings, projects, maybe even a group trip. It's a drain on a college student's time, so make sure you have enough time to commit. It may also drain your bank account, because depending on which fraternity you join, parties, projects, house gifts, etc., will be paid for out of the pledge class' pockets, not to mention the fraternity dues that are standard. How much you spend depends on which fraternity you join, and most are willing to help you find a job or a low-interest loan to help you in tight financial situations, so don't turn away from a fraternity just because the fees are the highest on Greek row.

, Don't let people make your decisions for you. Some people may refer to a certain fraternity in a positive light, some may refer to it in a negative light; the point is, people are unreliable and there is no better source than your own judgment.

, Find the place on your campus where fraternities advertise for their rush events. The best time to do this would be the first week of school, in the fall, because ALL of the fraternities will be there. Find out how many there are, what type of fraternity each one is, and what the rush events are for each one. Even if you have no interest in rushing a particular fraternity, take a rush flier anyway; your opinion might change later.

, Most likely, there will be way too many fraternity houses to hit in one week (unless your school has a formalized recruitment). Make a quick character judgment when you're picking up rush fliers, and decide on which ones you would most likely get along with. Don't pick a fraternity because they hold the best parties or pull the most girls or because they dress the best, pick a fraternity because you like their character.

, This is one of the most important parts. Despite their reputations for being meat-heads, ""frat guys"" can spot superficiality very easily. Be comfortable, confident, and RELAX! If a fraternity doesn't like your personality, find one that does.

, Don't lie, for the same reasons as number 3. It can only hurt your chances of getting a bid.

, Not everyone in a fraternity is the same. There are many different personalities in every fraternity, and if you don't like one person's personality, find another person. If it turns out you don't like anyone in a particular fraternity, then that fraternity is likely not right for you.

, Asking questions lets a fraternity know you're interested, and more importantly, fraternities love talking about their chapter or national history. Find out the time commitment, the financial commitment, the perks, the downsides--whatever. Good questions are, ""What was your favorite memory in the chapter?"" and ""Why did you join this fraternity?"".

, When you've been to every fraternity that you think you might get along with, pick the ones that you know you'll get along with. A good idea is to narrow it down to the two you have the best rapport with, else you risk not receiving a bid, and moreover that will lead the fraternity you want to believe you're not serious about joining. Besides, having two top choices makes a fraternity compete for you. After you pick these two, spend the remainder of the time rushing them. If they like you as much as you like them, chances are, you'll get a bid from one of them.

, Hang out with them outside of rush week, on a more personal basis. The few that you hang out with will most likely convince the rest of the chapter that you're a right fit. Most of the time, a bid isn't offered because they solely want to wait and see if you're serious. It's not the end of the world either.

Learn to tell when someone is making a joke.,
Learn to respond when someone else tells a joke.,
Learn to take a joke.,
Learn what jokes cross the line.",How to Develop a Sense of Humor1," Listen for errors, for exaggerations, and for absurdity. Incongruous statements are often jokes. Check for physical signs, such as a flattened or overly animated voice, a sudden exaggerated accent, or expressive gestures and facial expressions. Someone who looks from face to face in a group might be telling a joke and checking for comprehension.


Indicators that someone might be making a joke depend on the kind of joke. Someone using sarcastic humor might roll or bug their eyes. They might act especially casual, but say the opposite of how they feel.
Someone using ironic humor might use excessive slang, speak in a monotone, or profess to care deeply about a nonessential outcome.
People often use humor to make fun of themselves, or others, in a friendly way. If someone is describing an embarrassing situation, they might be trying to make you laugh rather than asking for pity.;
, How do you respond to humor? Do you tend to laugh, or smile? Not everyone laughs when they are amused, and this can lead others to believe they have no sense of humor.Try laughing or smiling when something is funny, but don't force it. If a smile doesn't feel natural, you can just say ""that's funny.""


Learn to banter. If you understand the tenor of the joke, you can try to make the same kind of joke in return. This is a common expression of friendliness and of flirting.

, You might want to develop your sense of humor if you find yourself easily offended or upset. If you are being teased, try to joke back instead of getting mad. If you are not certain whether or not you are being teased, ask yourself ""is it likely that this person would want to upset me? Is it just as likely that they are trying to be friendly?"" If you can't tell, you can ask.


If something meant to be friendly upsets you, ask yourself what bad feelings it brings up. Humor can help you discover hidden insecurities and fears.
If a joke hurts your feelings, you don't have to pretend you think it's funny. Everyone has sensitivities, and everyone has sensitive moments. If you are being persistently teased in a way that hurts you, explain that you don't enjoy the teasing and would like it to stop.

, If a joke is racist, sexist, homophobic, or otherwise bigoted, you should feel free to politely shut it down. Ask ""can you explain the humor, here?"" or say ""I can't go there with you."" You probably aren't the only person offended, so you'll be doing a good deed by speaking up.


People who tell offensive jokes often defend themselves by saying ""it's just a joke."" You can retort ""yes. It's a sexist/racist/islamaphobic (etc) joke.""

Try telling jokes you've learned, and don't be too disappointed if they don't make your friends laugh. Try to tell your joke as if you commenting on the weather. A casual delivery is often the funniest part of an absurd comment.


Make up jokes. Look for the absurdity of a situation you are in, or an illogical decision you made, and try to tell it like a funny story.
Write silly captions for the photographs you take. Do the objects in your photographs appear to be doing something other than what they are doing? Saying they are doing something they are obviously not is one easy way to joke.

, Most conversational humor focuses on shared circumstances, whether it be the weather or the workload. Jokes about commonalities don't have to be particularly funny: their first function is to increase a sense of connectedness. If it's snowing outside, say it's a good day for a picnic.

, Jokes about acquaintances should not show that acquaintance in a bad light. If you are making fun of a mutual friend, for instance, try to joke about a positive aspect of that person, rather than a weakness. If a colleague is always on time, say you set your watch by them. If your child writes a good paper for school, say they'll be promoted to teacher next.


Avoid jokes that comment on the appearance of others, even positively. The ways appearances are evaluated is inevitably radicalized, classed, and gendered. Joking about someone's appearance is likely to put them in an uncomfortable position, and may look like a power move on your part.

, Joking with yourself is an excellent way to relax and move on from stresses.It is also a crucial tool for dealing with the vicissitudes of life. Learn to take your problems lightly, and laugh at your mistakes. When you make a mistake or have a disappointment, laugh at yourself, and think of how to turn it into a story later.


To see the humor in a situation, you need to take a step back. This bit of critical distance can put things in perspective.
Developing a sense of humor helps you develop resilience, and can ease you through your darkest times."

Figure out what you don't find funny.,
Explore comedy.",How to Develop a Sense of Humor3," Your sense of humor is particular to the way your mind works, and has a lot to do with how you were socialized. The next time you find something funny, think it over. What is funny about it? Was it surprising? Familiar? Exaggerated? Write down all the elements if you can. What elements could be altered or removed for the humor to be lost?


For example, you might laugh at a video of someone falling while trying to impress someone. You would probably still laugh if they fell and weren't trying to impress someone, but you would laugh less. If they fell and were badly hurt, you probably wouldn't laugh at all.
Determine whether or not you share a sense of humor with anyone you know. Does only your sister know how to make you laugh? Ask her what makes her laugh.
Your sense of humor is likely to skew toward your other abilities. Are you a mathematical thinker? You might find wordplay funny. Are you a big-picture thinker? You might have a strong sense of irony. Think about your strengths and how they connect to the things that amuse you.

, The next time you don't get a joke, don't despair. Think it through. Did you not understand that it was meant to be a joke? Did you think it was a serious statement, or did you think it was a mistake? Most jokes depend on social context to be understood.Study your friends and colleagues when they find something funny. What do they react to?


If you understand that something is a joke, but you are offended, ask yourself what bad feelings the joke brought up. It is often harder to take humor that is about our weaknesses and wounds.
Check to see if you are missing social context. Ask a friend to explain their joke if you don't understand it. You might find the joke funny once you understand why your friend does.

, Watch different comedies and videos of stand-up comedians to learn the kinds of humor that appeal to you. If videos do not ever make you laugh, try listening to recording of a comedian, and reading humorous novels and comics. You might find you respond more to written words than to voices, or to illustrations than to facial expressions.


Most comedy isn't funny to most people, so don't give up if it takes you a while to find something you like. If you don't like Adam Sandler, try Maria Bamford.
If you are having trouble finding a comedian or comedy you enjoy, look for work that is produced by people with a background similar to your own.

Know that Paul says that tongues will cease at some point:


Paul says in 1 Corinthians 13, ""Where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away.,
Realize that tongues is primarily a gift for new believers: Paul goes on to say, ""When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child.,
Understand that tongues are unintelligible to others, and so do not edify them:


Paul makes the point that when someone speaks in tongues ""no one understands them; they utter mysteries."",
See clearly that there are strict guidelines for how tongues should function in a church service:


Here is how Paul says tongues are to function in any public setting where believers are gathered together, ""If anyone speaks in a tongue, two—or at the most three—should speak, one at a time, and someone must interpret.,
Understand that tongues can sometimes cause dis-unity rather than unity:


Here is something very, very key to consider, why did God confuse the language of the people at the tower of Babble?,
Consider whether you use your spiritual gifts in a loving way or not:


1 Corinthians 13, also known as ""the love chapter, is sandwiched in between chapter 12 and 14 where Paul talks about tongues and spiritual gifts.,
See whether what Paul says about love can generally apply to the gift of tongues:


In 1 Corinthians 13 Paul says, ""Love is patient, love is kind.,
Know that spiritual gifts are always given to build up the church and to make one a better witness for Christ.,
See that anyone who speaks in a tongue needs to submit to the Bible's guidelines for how to use the gift:


In 1 Corinthians 14:37 Paul says, ""If anyone thinks himself to be a prophet or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things which I write to you are the commandments of THE LORD."",
Notice that sometimes tongues can be divisive and even demonic:


Why does Paul say later in Chapter 13, ""Love does not delight in evil?"",
See that we need to never, ever push the gift of tongues on anyone:


Love ""always protects?"",
See that we need to always use caution with the gift of tongues:


In any use of tongues we need to be cautious.",How to Biblically Understand the Gift of Speaking in Tongues," For we know in part and we prophesy in part. But when that which is perfect has come, then that which is in part will be done away. When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child; but when I became a man, I put away childish things. For now we see in a mirror, dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I shall know just as I also am known."" Here Paul lays out that prophesies, tongues and knowledge will end at some point, but when?
First he says, ""We know in part and we prophesy in part. But when that which is perfect has come, then that which is in part will be done away."" So he only mentions two of the three here in this statement. He mentions knowledge and prophesy but not tongues. ""That which is perfect"" that Paul is talking about has to be Heaven, because later he says that then we ""shall see face to face."" We didn’t see God face to face when the Bible was completed. So this is referring to when we get to Heaven, not the Bible being completed. So what part of what he says applies to tongues? When will tongues ""be stilled"" as he says?;
, When I became a man, I put the ways of childhood behind me."" Some say that this statement applies to tongues. Yet, Paul did not directly state what in particular is to be put away as child-like.


Tongues are a gift that strengthens a believer in the early time of their faith for some, this was why most new believers in Acts received tongues as their first spiritual gift, but when we become mature we are to ""put the ways of childhood (the new believer) behind"" us. So some say that Paul is telling them that they will need to outgrow tongues. He says many times in chapter 14 that to prophesy is far better than to speak in tongues because prophecy edifies others and builds up the church more.
So what does becoming a man spiritually mean? It means to be able to eat spiritual steak and not just drink milk. When we fully understand more of who God is, Paul is/may be saying, we won’t need tongues, when we are mature. Tongues are for the new believer, the baby Christian, but as we grow in our walk we should be able to have the gift of teaching or preaching in order to instruct others, etc. Everyone can agree that Paul says ""where there are tongues, they will be stilled and where there is knowledge, it will pass away."" So when will tongues be stilled and when will knowledge cease? Not in heaven. Not when the Bible was completed. It is still a gift for today. But Paul is saying, it is for the new believer. Tongues is something that encourages people and nurtures their faith, when they are still at the beginning of their faith. But it says that somethings are set aside as we come into maturity as a Christian.

, So is this a good thing? No, for unless it is interpreted, no others can be edified by anything that is said in a tongue? 1 Corinthians 14:11 says, ""If then I do not grasp the meaning of what someone is saying, I am a foreigner to the speaker, and the speaker is a foreigner to me. So it is with you. Since you are eager for gifts of the Spirit, try to excel in those that build up the church.""
Paul is saying here that tongues, alone, generally do not build up the church. Yes! The person oneself may be edified, as Paul says, ""Anyone who speaks in a tongue does not speak to people but to God,"" so it could be seen as a good self-edifying time of prayer to God. But people in the church cannot be edified unless the tongue is interpreted. It may make someone feel closer to God when they speak in tongues, but it will not make anyone else feel closer to God unless the tongue is interpreted.

, If there is no interpreter, the speaker should keep quiet in the church and speak to himself and to God."" Why? Because no one else understands what is being said in the tongue. Therefore, it cannot and does not edify any other person unless it is interpreted.
Also note that he says only two or ""at the most three"" people are to speak in a tongue in public worship. In 1 Corinthians 13:1 Paul says, ""If I speak in the tongues of men or of angels, but do not have love, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal."" So, it doesn’t matter, if someone is able to speak in the tongues of angels, but does so without love for others. If they do not respect others in using their gift of tongues, Paul says that they become only ""a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal.""
Neither of those are a good or necessary thing. If a cymbal is used in an orchestra in time and rhythm, it sounds good. But if it is randomly clanged for no reason at all, that is not good. That is the picture Paul is trying to paint. What purpose does random tongues speaking serve? Tongues does not serve a purpose in the church unless it is in rhythm and order with the service. Paul is saying it becomes a distraction, if it is not done in love, if it is random.
So how can the gift of tongues be done in love in the church -- only when the tongues are quickly interpreted so that everyone can know what is being said. Amen. Paul says, ""Unless you speak intelligible words with your tongue, how will anyone know what you are saying? You will just be speaking into the air."" To speak in tongues without an interpreter does not promote fellowship but rather it can isolate people.

, He confused their languages so that they could NOT have fellowship with each other. He caused them all to speak a different language so that they would not be united enough to build the tower that they were trying to build.
So for everyone to be speaking in a different language divides people. It does not promote unity. Overall, does the gift of tongues in public worship unite the church or dis-unify the church? Paul is saying that it can dis-unify the church. Why? Because if no one knows what you are saying, how can you have fellowship with them? Paul says in 1 Corinthians 14:16, ""When you are praising God in the Spirit, how can someone else…say ""Amen"" to your thanksgiving, since they do not know what you are saying -- Yes! -- as that is the problem with uninterpreted tongues.
To practice the gift of tongues in public worship changes the time of gathering together from a community meeting and time of fellowship to a singular event that is between you and God. No one else understands what the speaker is saying, unless it is interpreted, so what is the point? In community worship, speaking in tongues is pointless unless it is interpreted. That is why Paul says tongues need to be interpreted, if they are used in the church.
Paul says, ""Anyone who speaks in a tongue edifies themselves, but the one who prophesies edifies the church."" Is it good to edify yourself -- Yes! -- but, when Christians gather together the focus needs to be on edifying the other Christians, not on yourself. We need to think of how we can bless the other people, not just how we can build ourselves up.

, Why did he do that? Paul did that for a reason. At the end of chapter 12 Paul says, ""Now eagerly desire the greater gifts. And yet I will show you the most excellent way."" So what is the more excellent way? Love.
Paul is saying spiritual gifts are great, but love is better. If someone has every single spiritual gift on the list, but doesn’t have love, then he/she has nothing. Love should be the highest goal for the Christian, not spiritual gifts.
Often times spiritual gifts can actually even become an idol. People start to worship the spiritual gift rather than God. That might happen in some churches regarding the gift of tongues.

, It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. "" Think of this passage in the context of tongues.
Are tongues patient? Not generally in how they are practiced. To be patient would be to talk in turn, not everyone speaking at once.
Are tongues kind? If someone degrades someone else or says that they are not Christian because they don't have the gift of tongues no, that is definitely not kind or loving to other believers!
Do tongues cause envy? Usually the reason why people speak in tongues in church is to show how ""spiritual"" they are. In essence, they want other people in the church to acknowledge them because of their gift of tongues.
Do tongues lead to boasting -- Yes! -- if it becomes like a super power that the Christian who has it brags about to the ones who don’t have it. This is not loving and being in fellowship with other believers.
Do tongues make some people proud -- Yes!, but why -- because it really is a great privilege to instantly know another language without having to learn it or study it for years. It takes most people 3 years to learn a new language, on average, but with the gift of tongues, you can bypass all that effort. But is this spiritual gift given to make ourselves more prideful or to boost our ego? No. Of course not. That is never why spiritual gifts are given. They are given to us so that mature Christians can edify one another. Period.

,


Do tongues build up others or do they sometimes dishonor others? Anytime that you are leaving other people out for any reason, that dishonors them. Are tongues self-seeking? Often times yes. If people are doing it to appear more spiritual, that is self-seeking. If they do it to get the praises of man, that is self-seeking, yes. Are some tongues speakers easily angered? If you tell them their tongue has to be interpreted or they must remain silent in any public setting, yes that can anger people with the gift of tongues. But these are the rules Paul lays out that we are all supposed to follow. These are not just man made rules that tongues must be interpreted.

, So Paul is saying essentially, ""This is not just me writing this. These are not just my opinions. These are 'the commandments of the Lord.' "" As in everything he just said about gifts of the Holy Spirit including tongues is on the same level as the 10 Commandments. So they need to be taken very literally and very seriously.

, How does that relate to spiritual gifts or tongues? Well, evil would be any kind of dissension in the body of Christ. Disagreeing on the gifts of the Holy Spirit can cause dissension. So, that is not good. Also, some have said that they have heard tongues that were demonically inspired rather than God inspired. We would hope that people could discern the difference, but it is not always possible, such as when the fruit of speaker is not yet known by the hearers.
Regardless of whether someone can speak in tongues or not, if the tongue is from Satan, we should not delight in it at all, obviously. There are counterfeit tongues. Satan can give people a counterfeit gift of tongues. In many other religions around the world people are also able to speak in tongues. Their gift of tongues is not from God though, but from Satan.
Tongues would always need to be interpreted, so that we can know for sure whether what is being said is from God or not -- as in to make sure it's not from Satan.

, In regard to tongues, we need to protect others from possibly getting a demonically inspired gift of tongues. To push people to speak in tongues might lead them without knowing it to demonic tongues.
If the Holy Spirit wants to give someone the gift of tongues, He will. We don’t need to force it at all. It will be an easy thing to do, if God really wants you to do it. But to force it can actually cause Satan to give you a counterfeit gift.
To desire tongues more than we desire following Christ is totally out of line. The Spirit of God will say, ""Jesus Christ is Lord of all."" Yes? (1 Corinthians 12:3). So, we need to be careful. That is ""whatever you are doing, do it as unto The Lord,"" as you are guided by the Bible and the Holy Spirit. If you have the mind of Christ then agreeing together is important, not doubting. Expressing disagreement with the clear Word of God in the Bible is dissension. You must follow Jesus, not the gifts or words of a man or woman who is not speaking the Gospel with Love.
Paul says, ""Love always trusts."" Then you will trust that a true servant of the Lord is saying good things to you or about you, even if you can’t hear it or understand what he/she is saying, yes? So, if someone prays for someone in a tongue, how can the other person know and trust that what is being said is good? One cannot for sure know that what is being said is good, by the unknown words that are spoken. So you will know them by their fruits, and then your trust is placed in the Lord, not in the flesh.
You trust by Love, and then do not cause dissension. Trust the Lord's servant as you trust the Lord. Who is a true servant of the Lord? A servant must be consistently proclaiming The Truth including: Jesus Christ was born of a virgin, came as God in the flesh, died and was raised again to life as Lord and Savior of all. And we must repent and be born again by receiving Salvation ""in His name by grace, through faith not of oneself, not of works, it is the gift of God,... saved unto good works that God foreordained that we should do them"" (Ephesians 2:8--10). And we actively love, speak well of, and forgive one another, and we take communion in remembrance of Jesus Christ, and we baptize believers; and say that Jesus is now living forever, always making intercession for us and is our soon coming King. As long as that person is agreeing with and speaking that kind of Gospel, under authority of God's word in the Bible presented accurately, then Trust the servant of the Gospel as unto the Lord.

, It might be exciting for some. It can be used to witness to people we would not have otherwise been able to witness to. It can draw someone closer to God. But any public setting, the worshipers and service need to be controlled and moderated by a pastor or other minister. We need to always, always exercise the gift with self-control.
In 1 Corinthians 14:32 Paul says, ""The spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets."" This means we should be able to control any spiritual gift that we have. A spiritual gift should never cause us to be out of control, out of order -- or to go against the Bible.
Paul goes on to say, ""For God is not the author of confusion but of peace."" Amen! Other translations say, ""God is a God of order, not disorder."" So, anything that causes disorder or confusion is not from God, or for sure God does not approve of it. Always remember to seek agreement, to be in one accord.

Keep practicing and reviewing.",How to Become More Aware of Your Own Body Language," How do you think another person would perceive you right now? Are you slouching and trying to hide away or are you standing up tall and proud? A good time to check out yourself is when you are waiting somewhere, or you are in a meeting. Use this time to ""step outside of yourself"" and to view how others would be viewing you. Simply imagine what others might be seeing when they're looking at you. Is it a good picture?;
, Get a good friend or a family member whom you trust to be objective. Have them tell you how they feel your body posture, facial expressions, and overall demeanor comes across to them. Tell them they are at total liberty to be honest; after all, they see you all the time when you are busy seeing them and others. Most of the time you will find that they do have an opinion; and be sure to take this as constructive criticism, not destructive or mean.

, Ask them for advice on how they think that you could better project your image. Try a different way of standing (stand up tall!), or try different facial expressions. Get them to give you feedback on these practice changes as you do them. Remember those that work best so that you can continue working on them.

, People often make short remarks about us that we either deflect or resist really taking in because we don't want to change and we don't like thinking that we're being criticized. But some of what people say about improving ourselves is very useful information. If you overhear someone criticizing you, or something gets back to you through someone else, assess this information critically rather than emotionally. If there is a grain of truth to what is being said, you have a ready-made answer to what has to be changed. For example, you might learn that people find you morose, grumpy, irritable, bad-tempered, lazy, etc. and a lot of that will definitely be showing through in your body language. Time to shape up and not react emotionally to these tidbits of feedback!

, Many people now have the ability to film themselves with a camera or a computer. Try it out. Find a passage to read or think of a situation to act out. Film it (or get a trusted friend to film it). Play it back. Consider:


What are your initial reactions?
What things about your performance bother you? Please you?
Are you cringing at anything?
Write a list of the things you'd like to change. For example, muttering, saying ""um"" a lot, looking defensive, clenching your fists, etc.

, It's not a case of trying to be perfect; it's a case of trying to be the best that we can and to bring out the best of our personalities so that other people can see the real us and don't have to dig through the layers of self-defensiveness and poor habits. You are capable of being the real you with just a little extra effort. Once you are aware of your own body language and the signals that it is sending out, you'll be totally amazed with how effective changing the negative body language will be for boosting your self-esteem and attracting people to you. Good luck!

Being sarcastic with a teacher or a police officer could cause you trouble. If you want the respect of your teacher or another adult, use respectful language.;
, Try to avoid telling jokes about issues that the person is insecure about, such as weight. It is not very tasteful, for example, to make jokes about a fat friend again and again.

, If you wait too long, it loses its value and makes you look bad. A good way to give yourself a couple seconds is to simply stare at the person with a small smile, as if you are thinking something about them. If you manage to quickly think of a joke, say it. Otherwise, just smile a bit wider, then shake your head and look away. The image of “you aren't worth the effort” is sometimes the best way to scoff. Don't wait too long, though; it looks strange.

, Be very observant of what people look like and what they are wearing. While looking at someone, observe his or her clothing. What famous person does it remind you of who has no fashion sense?

, Many people will set themselves up, so take advantage. You need not make the person feel bad; just show him the problem with the point that he is trying to make. Sarcasm comes in many forms:


Reductio ad absurdum (most useful in this situation)

Reveal that the other person’s comment is absurd.
Example:
“No, you don’t NEED it, and that's final!”
“We don’t actually NEED anything except for food, air and water, so why don’t we all go live in caves and spear large animals for food every day?”


Past experience (also very useful here)

Show the person that he does not have the expertise that he says he has.
Example:
“I can tell you about sarcasm. I’m a great writer!”
“You must be proud that your writing has been rejected ten times!”


Random Example:

""Where's My Toothpaste?
""On The Moon! Obviously It's In The Bathroom.


Inversion of truth

Say just the opposite of what is true to show that the answer to the question is obvious.
Example:
“Do you think this dress makes me look fat?”
“You've never looked so thin!”


Inversion of meaning

Say the opposite of what you mean.
Example:
“Oh, great!” or ""That's all I need!"" instead of “Oh, no!”
“Yeah, right!” or “whatever you say” instead of “I’m not so sure.”
“Big deal!” instead of “That seems trivial.”


Exaggeration

Being comforting.
Example:
""I don't think Bob likes me.""
""Yeah he must really hate you mustn't he?""
Play the role suggested by the first person’s comment.
Example:
“Shut up, will you?”
“Oh, I'm deeply sorry, Your Highness, should I go get you your tea and crumpets now?”


The obvious alternative

Suggest another reason why something happened.
Example:
“You stole my homework to copy it!”
“No, I didn't!”
“Hmm... The dog must have eaten it, then!” (The obvious alternative to “You stole my homework!”)


Leveling

Ask someone how to do something when you are already doing just that.
Example: Can you show me how you use a keyboard?



, If sarcasm is the only thing you do, you'll likely find less people willing to talk to you. Remember that the more people you have, the more potential targets you have. Keep a good nature about your jibes, and most people will enjoy the humor of the personal joke.

, Follow the WGL rule: either Wink, Grin, or Laugh. Use body language. Shoving about playfully usually works well, too, but there's always the possibility of you accidentally knocking the person into oncoming traffic, or over the face of a cliff (unless, of course, there is already an Acme trampoline at the base of the cliff).

If a friend is listening to an iPod, help yourself to one of their headphones and start singing along to the song (if you're tone deaf this works really well). Have incessantly loud conversations in public places on your cellphone. It doesn't even matter if you're actually talking to someone. Share friends private details at extreme volume over and over again. When they tell you to be quiet, just be louder.


Remember, you don't have to even know the words to the song, just make them up as you go along – the dumber your lyrics the better! And, for bonus points, if you are watching TV, sing along with all of the commercial jingles. You could also sing something over and over to the point where no one can stand it anymore. If they leave, start screaming at the top of your lungs until they come back.;
,  ""How have things with you and Casey been going?""  ""Yes.""  ""Does that mean good?""  ""No.""  ""Never mind..."" 

, People can get really annoyed if you sneak up behind them and make an animal noise. If someone is yelling at you or scolding you, make a questioning sound in return.

, and then when they explain keep punctuating every explanation with a ""why?"" question.

, Ask private or embarrassing questions. You can either ask a ton of these to one person, or spread it around. If you are going to do this to any random person, do things like ask a man if he is pregnant.


Laugh for no reason and at random times. Don't explain yourself either when someone asks you why you are laughing, just scold them like they have offended you.
Alternatively, make up inside jokes that only you know and don't share them with anyone. When someone asks you why it's so funny, just tell them that it's an inside joke.

, Shuffle around constantly. Act as if you can't keep still. Make some kind of a repeated movement in someone's peripheral vision.


Gawk at something non-existent on the top of someone's head. When you're having a normal conversation with someone, suddenly open your mouth slightly and stare at a point just over their head or right on top of their head. If they touch their head nervously and ask ""what?"" just stifle pretend laughter and shake your head and return to the conversation. To make it even more annoying, keep doing it throughout the day at inappropriate times.
When someone asks you anything, reply ""sure, you want fries with that?"" Also every time they state any opinion about anything, make sure you interrupt and yell ""That's what she said,"" even if it wasn't inappropriate.
Tell people, in English, that you do not speak English, and you are learning from a tutor. This works even better if you use really long or rarely used words. The kind of words that only people fluent in English would use.

, Announce to everyone around you that you have to go to the bathroom, and that you think that they should all go too, as they have been holding it in for quite a while. When they do go to the bathroom, call out to them things like: ""Are you doing okay in there?"" To make it even more annoying, if there are other people in the bathroom, proudly announce to them: ""My friend is in there,"" pointing at the bathroom stall. When you are finished in the bathroom, come out with a sigh of relief and be sure to tell them all about your time in the bathroom (even if they would rather you didn't).

, Text speak also works. As many non-words as you can put into any kind of communication are smart choices if you want to be annoying. Say 'lol' at the end of everything, even if it's not funny.


Alternatively, always write 'liil' instead of 'lol' and then type 'oops sorry, I'm always typing the wrong keys, liil! oops, i mean kopl, i mean LOL!

, Make up a fake screen name on AIM, and send a message to every 'buddy' or user you know. Start a conversation to make it seem like you're their best friend, or your boyfriend just broke up with you.


On Facebook, make a fan-page or group titled your name. Invite everyone you do or do not know to join. Make the persona a more ridiculous and mean version of yourself. Refer to that person in third person.
Go on a social game and dress as girly and cute as you can, complete with a girly username, and use a ton of emoticons. If someone asks, ""Are you a girl?"" say ""... no"" or ""i Don't know"", whether you are or not. Note: This makes the conversation very, very awkward.
On chat boards, pretend you're a little kid. Whenever someone uses adult language, ask what the word means, or say, ""My daddy/mommy says (insert word here) all the time! You two are alike."" Misspell almost every word you type. Ask stupid questions like, ""How do I log in without Mommy helping me?""

, On Facebook, put every single move that you make as your status. Be very detailed. This will annoy people. A lot. On Halloween, post the synopsis of every horror movie on Netflix, at fifteen minute increments.


Start a long, dull email conversation with one other person, but include everyone in all of the replies.

"
Ruin the plot.,
Make loud noises.,
Be physically annoying.,
Annoy the staff.",How to Be Annoying3," If you have already seen the movie playing in a theater, stick your head through the doorway and yell out the ending. Yell it from the back of the theatre. Alternatively, make up the ending, or yell the ending to a different movie, like ""Harry Potter sorta dies but not really I guess.""


When an important part is playing, like the killer is revealed, or the couple finally gets together, sneeze or cough loudly and disturbingly. Then start yelling about why you have coughed/sneezed. ""*Cough* OH SORRY I JUST HAD SOMETHING STUCK IN MY THROAT!"" Make sure everyone can hear.

, Laugh obnoxiously at really corny jokes. Shush everyone who says anything, and then go into this loud discussion on how it's very rude to talk during a movie because some people might be trying to watch it.


Make those annoying slurping sounds trying to get those last few drops of soda.
Bring two or more people with you to start a loud and obnoxious conversation while the movie is playing and make sure to be near as many people as possible. If anyone tells you to zip it, throw popcorn at them.
If no one wants to be with you, bring your cell phone and don't bother to put it on vibrate. Make sure that your cell phone goes off like a car alarm and don't answer it for at least a minute.

, Make sure to sit in the middle of the row, then every 10 minutes get up and go to the aisle. Walk around a bit and then return to your middle seat. Maybe pause halfway down the aisle to your seat. Buy some kind of cheap sticky candy, like gummy bears, and surreptitiously toss them out into the aisle or on the people in front or behind you at random intervals. If anyone looks at you strangely, eat one.


If someone is sitting in front of you, start kicking the person's seat and don't stop. You can also put your feet up. The dirtier your shoes are, the better.
Bring your jogging suit and start doing laps of the aisles, be sure to pant loud and move your hips like an expert walker.
Get up to go to the bathroom, and then when you get to the exit, hold it open for a few minutes while you watch the movie.
If you are at a movie with your boyfriend/girlfriend, stand up and make out during the best parts; it will drive the people behind you insane.

, Ask the manager at the concession stand if the straws are free. Stare at the ticket-taker for long periods of time.


Ask for special permission, demanding they make room for your imaginary friends or your disabled brother George. If they refuse, tell them something totally unrelated. Like that your father's asparagus is essential. Act like what you said actually matters. If they acquiesce to your request, act like you don't know what they are talking about. You might get kicked out, but who cares.

Mess with your teachers.,
Talk too much.,
Embrace nonsense.,
Make your body an instrument.,
Mess with computers.",How to Be Annoying4," Criticize their handwriting or assignments. Use the word ""pedagogy."" Inquire as to your teacher's private life. Refuse to do assignments. Switch seats constantly. If your teacher takes role, pull a Billy Madison and make farting sounds with your hands rather than saying ""Here.""


Correcting a teacher's grammar is a great method of irritation. Improper corrections are all the better, as in ""I think you mean, 'Whom is going to recess,' don't you Miss Farquhar?"" Also make up words and pretend like everyone in the class should know it. If the teacher tries to explain that it is not a real word, tell him/her how ridiculously stupid they are.
Whenever the teacher explains something, say that you don't get it. When they go over it again, say you still don't get it. Repeat, ad infinitum.
Keep saying the same number in math a lot. This will really make your classmates and your teacher want to die. Example: ""What is four times two?"" ""Eight"". ""Six times seven?"" ""Eight"". ""Five times four?"" ""Eight"".

, At lunch, go over to someone, sit uncomfortably close to them, and say, ""OMG Bob, you're the best buddy ever!"" If their name is actually Bob, call them Steve. Mimic everything someone says. Answer every question incorrectly, or at least raise your hand. Always say, ""Eli Whitney and the cotton gin."" Get your friend's name, and then run away.


Say,"" Hello"" in a british accent to everyone in the class for no reason. Then ask boys who have female friends whether his female friends are his girlfriends, and ask girls who have male friends whether her male friends are her boyfriends.
Ask someone why they've been crying, when they are not. If they tell you they weren't crying, start explaining to them why it is okay to cry. Go into detail about a very personal time that you had been crying. For example ""One time I cried so hard after I had to take a terrible dump."" When they walk away, grab them and pull them close to you again. Make sure to spit excessively when you talk to make it even more awkward.

, Make strange sounds like an ambulance, the sound of a performance or even echo sounds or clicking your tongue. Record your sounds in your phone and activate them constantly.


Stare at the ceiling while someone is speaking to you when they ask you what you're doing say ""It just like... sits up there"" in a really weird tone. Or stare at the floor and say that it ""sits down there.""
Sing songs about your friends which they find very annoying. Sing it over and over again with an unusual tone. ""Bob takes a poop with his little tiny toilet. / Bob takes a crap with his little tiny butt,"" is a classic.

, Crack your knuckles really loudly. Fart, burp, cough, sneeze, wipe your nose on your sleeve. Say ""Sor-RY"" in a really stupid voice when you do something that you don't need to say sorry for. Repeat one word over and over in a sing-song voice.


Bring gum to class and chew loudly in your neighbor's ear.
When you are next to the teacher and the teacher is talking, cough without covering your mouth.

, Change the desktop picture. Choose something your friend will find embarrassing or lame, like a picture of the Jonas Brothers or a cosmic kitty, then draw everyone's attention to it when they come back to the computer. Delete the icons or rearrange them into crude shapes.


Change settings constantly. Make the mouse or track pad ultra sensitive, or set the monitor to go to sleep after thirty seconds of inactivity.

Decide on what kind of awesome club you'd like to have.,
Organize and plan.,
Create a calendar.,

Decide on basic rules.,
Be clear.,
Get some members to join your club.,
Be ready to explain when people ask about the club's purpose.,

Raise money for a cause.",How to Make Your Own Club," Do you want an animal club, a sports club, a collector's club or maybe a club of super fans of a music group or a movie,or a nature lover club, or maybe just a club to hang with your friends? Maybe even a tree house club! There are many reasons for forming a club, but the most important thing is to follow your passion. Ask your friends for their ideas too.;
, Get a binder or folder to keep all of your club documents in. Maybe decorate it to make it colourful and customised. We will add more to it later.

, Put all the club meeting dates, locations, and trips on it. Let all of your members have a say in it. You should probably have a scheduled ""planning meeting"" so you and all of your club members can plan together when everything happens.

, An interesting, fun, attractive name will help to attract members. Maybe all your names put together or something to do with the club like Book Buddies. You may also like to consider whether it is possible to abbreviate your name so that it sounds great when shortened. For example, M.U.S.I.C. might stand for Mixing Universal Soul Inspiration Club.

, It is best if you can use the room or area regularly and even better if you can decorate it to make it look like your club. But this isn't always possible, so you might like to develop a portable kit of signs, banners and other club objects that you can set up anywhere to make any room or space transform into your club when meeting.


If you want you can meet in somebody's bedroom, den or treehouse. If you have permission from an adult then you could meet at the park or a local cafe.

, If you know somebody who can make clothes, you're in luck. Make your own club colors, too. However, some club members may not like the idea of a club uniform, so make sure to ask their opinion about it first.


Uniforms increase the cost and effort of members. Keep that in mind before insisting that there be one.
A simple t-shirt with the club's logo or name might suffice and is an affordable way of developing a ""uniform"" of sorts.

, A club website or wiki can be really helpful for arranging meetings and passing on all communications. You can use a free service such as Yola or Google Sites to make a website. Or, you can start a wiki.

, Many formal clubs have a ""constitution"". That is fairly formal, so you might like to just start with a basic list of rules that apply to your club; if your club becomes more developed, a constitution could be created and voted on at a later stage. Consider things such as:


Membership fees
Office positions and who can hold these positions
Meeting dates, or regularity
Annual general meeting requirements
Funding
Volunteering
Activities (what the club exists to do, what activities it promotes, what activities it does not want, etc.)

, Make sure that all members are aware what the club does and what they can and cannot do. This is especially important if someone keeps breaching the basic rules and making the club unpleasant for others; you can point to the rules and say ""no more or you're out"".

, People will want to join if you tell what the club and its reason-for-being are all about, so prepare some fliers or posters with this information.


Make a list of people. Take all of the members that you came up with before and make a nice looking list. Make sure you have lots of room to add more people.

, If you don't have lots of ideas yet, don't worry, just let them know this. It is better to be honest and find people who can help build up your club than to have people scratching their head about why you cannot provide all the things that you told them the club offered. Many people like to join a club when it is just starting, as they can get a position in it easily and help build it up with you.


You can also have the existing members list some ideas.

, You might ask the members for a small donation or contribution. Maybe you won't need money but can ask members to donate time, food for meetings, paper for posters, skills such as drawing / painting / sign creation etc. The more who pitch in, the less money will be needed for running it. Money is more likely to be an issue as the club grows in size and activities.

, When your club is small, it is important to ensure that everyone is free to come at a set time. If your club grows in size, still try to accommodate as many people as possible but realize that the more members you have, the harder it will be to ensure that everyone can make the same meeting time.

, This will help everyone to know in advance that something is happening. The agenda doesn't have to be long or even closely followed; it is just a great way of organizing the meeting time so that it benefits all the members.


Consider having different things to do at each meet-up, to keep things fresh and interesting.

, Ensure that there are plenty of places for members to sit, that it's easy to hear or see demonstrations and that there is actually enough room for everyone.


Bring refreshments like chips and soda to meetings. Members can be asked to donate something each meeting, and occasionally you might even have a potluck supper or a shared picnic.

, Accomplishments help make a club better and give the members a sense of purpose. Accomplishments could be things such as being a good friend, self improvement, creating things, providing help, etc. These achievements could be acknowledged through badges, certificates, ribbons and even trophies, depending on what the achievement is.

, If your club has a focus on something that you and all the members really care about, you might like to raise money as a club to send to a larger, more official organization such as the ASPCA in New York or SPCA in Canada if you like animals, or the Sierra Club if you care about the environment or a local tree-planting group if you care about trees and your neighborhoods amenities etc. Schools, local hobby groups, local sports teams etc. are other possible target groups for your club's fund-raising efforts. Make sure people know your club exists.

Dress for the venue.,
Assemble a desirable group.,

Determine the pay off beforehand.,
Choose your moment carefully.,
Offer a handshake.,
Communicate your needs clearly.,
Follow the doorman's lead.,
Recognize the risks.,
Collect the money discreetly.,
Show confidence and respect.If you are hesitant or suspicious, the bouncer may think that you're involved in something he doesn't want to let into the club.,
Read the atmosphere when deciding whether to bribe.",How to Pay off a Doorman and Get Right In," Whether you're trying to get into a club, a house party, or an underground rave, looking out of place can make you a less desirable addition to the event. You should choose an outfit that matches the vibe of the venue you are trying to get into. If you look the part, you'll look like you belong in the party.You may want to consider wearing a light, stylish jacket, especially when going out on a chilly night. This way, you can avoid the hassle and extra charge of coat check.
Men should avoid business and business casual clothing. Prioritize festive articles that fit well and are unique. Bedazzled items and those with overly flashy designs, like a large embroidered dragon, should be avoided.
Women should consider outfits and accessories that show off their assets. For you, this might mean a low cut top, short skirt, and a plunging, 22 to 24 inch necklace. Heels are also highly recommended.;
, Many promoters and hosts try to create an atmosphere at the venue through the kind of people let in and the ratio of men to women. In many cases, this means that for every man in the club, a promoter will want at least two women.You can greatly improve your chances of getting into the club by stacking your group with women.


Women who are dressed for the venue and considered stereotypically attractive will often be given higher priority. A couple attractive female friends or relatives in your group could make the bouncer more likely to grant you entrance.

, This is less of an issue if you're only trying to get yourself into the venue, however, when trying to get a group of two or more in, this is very important. Mobbing a doorman with a group of people can make him feel uneasy or like you're trying to pressure him into letting you in. This tactic rarely works well.


The spokesperson for your group should be well dressed and confident, at the very least. A charismatic, likable people person can also help earn you admittance., Larger venues will likely have a in-house security team. This means there may be several doormen or bouncers that you could potentially pay off. Observe the doormen carefully before you approach and try to determine which one is the supervisor. This person will have the least difficulty waving you in to the venue.


Each situation will be different, but if you notice a doorman directing other staff, or if staff members approach a particular doorman, this may be a good indication of the supervisor. Avoid making the mistake of assuming the biggest doorman is the supervisor. This is not always the case., You'll want to pay off the doorman in crisp, same denomination bills. A crumpled wad of five and ten dollar bills might make you look desperate, even if the total of this money is considerable. A single hundred dollar bill or a few twenties are the best choice.The larger the group you are trying to get into the club, the more money the doorman will expect to let you into the venue. Smaller groups of two and three people may be able to get by with a twenty or forty dollar bribe, but larger groups should be willing to shell out eighty dollars or more.
The kind of venue you are attending will also influence how much you are expected to pay the door staff. The more popular and classy the establishment, the more money you'll be expected to offer to get in., Though it is generally acceptable to pay off a doorman to get into a venue, in many cases there are poorly enforced rules in place prohibiting this practice. An obvious hand off could get the doorman, and yourself, in trouble with the venue. To prevent this, you should choose a moment when there are few staff around and the doorman is relatively by himself.


The line outside busy clubs can make it difficult to privately interact with a doorman. You may want to approach the doorman in a way that puts your back to waiting guests and blocks him somewhat from their view., This is the most popular way of handing off money to a doorman. Have your money neatly folded in your right hand. You may be able to hide the money in your palm by holding it in place loosely with your pinkie and ring finger. Extend the hand holding your money to the doorman in greeting, and transfer the money to him as you disengage.In some cases, there may be a policy against touching clientele. In this case, you may have to block your transaction from view and place the money directly in the doorman's hand.
The bills in your hand should be folded so the denomination is clearly visible. This way, the doorman can tell at a glance you're actually handing him a twenty and not trying to slip him a five., The doorman will need to know how many people you are trying to get in and the male to female ratio of the group. You might also want to inform the doorman how much money he's being given to help you out so that he doesn't have to inspect the money.For example, while shaking hands or shortly after you've handed off the money, you might say: ""Hey man, can you help us out? I've got $100 and I'm with those three gorgeous ladies and that guy.""
You may only get a nod as confirmation your pay off has worked. The doorman will want to accept the money without anyone noticing and act like nothing happened. At the right moment, the doorman will come get you.
In some cases, this technique can backfire. There is no guarantee that your bribe will get you into the venue. There's always the risk that your money will be taken and you still have to wait in line., You may be allowed into the club right away, but frequently the doorman will have to wait until the timing is right. He may be waiting for his general manager or house manager to take a break or get involved with some other task. Stand somewhere clearly visible, and be on the lookout for his signal for you and your group to enter the club.


The signal you receive will often be a simple gesture, like eye contact and a nod or a beckoning motion with his hands. If you miss your chance to get in, you may not get a second one., While it's highly unlikely you'll get into trouble with the law when trying to pay off a doorman, some establishments have strict policies about staff accepting bribes.If you get caught bribing door staff, you could be refused entrance to the venue or be banned from the establishment.These is also a chance that the doorman will take your money without giving you any special treatment. Once you hand off your money, there is rarely anything you can do to enforce your bribe., Huddling together obviously in front of the venue and pooling your money with your friends will come across as disrespectful to the establishment and other customers. If you're too obvious with your bribe, it may upset other patrons waiting in line. An angry line of people will make the doorman's job harder and decrease your prospects of getting in.You may want to take a short walk from the venue and gather money from your friends when you are out of sight. This way, there's little possibility of someone catching you gathering together your bribe., Rudeness or arrogance can anger doormen and cost you your bribe without gaining you quicker entry. But even if your bribe gets you nowhere, you should always treat your doorman politely. Rude behavior may lead to you and your friends getting banned from the venue for the night.Doormen are often instructed to only let people into the club that fit with its atmosphere. If you are nervous or seem out of your element, he might think that you simply do not belong.
Doormen frequently have to deal with unpleasant people and situations. Argumentative and drunken club-goers can make them sensitive to rudeness. Keep this in mind when interacting with any doorman.

, Glamorous events with a line several blocks long and an army of doormen will be very difficult for you to bribe your way into. Other patrons can also make paying off a doorman difficult. Fights and difficult patrons can sour a doorman's mood and make him less likely to accept your money. Botched bribe attempts by novice venue attendees can have the same effect.


Before you approach the doorman, take a moment to observe the situation. If he looks especially stern, or if many customers appear to be hassling him, it may not be a good night to try to bribe your way into the venue."

Get a comically-sized car.,
Turn up the volume of the radio.,
Behave strangely at traffic stops.,
Ask for ""directions.""",How to Be Annoying5," Whether Suburban-sized ridiculous or Smart Car-tiny, make sure you do your driving during rush hour, that way you'll be the obnoxious gigantic vehicle on a crowded road that's trying to claim space for itself, or that you're darting in and out of traffic like a deranged eco-bunny.


Always have a trailer attached to your vehicle with nothing on it, or something absurd, like a horse.

, Play something embarrassing while your friends are in the car, like the theme song from ""Titanic"", little kid songs and nursery rhymes, or really crude gangster rap. Alternatively, play ""Rule Britannia"" at top volume. This works especially well if you are not in a British country.

, Honk your horn. If you're behind someone at a stoplight, start blaring the horn and don't stop. If you want, you could leave your hand planted on the horn.


When stopped at a traffic light put your head on the steering wheel and pretend to be unconscious or dead and remain stationary. When somebody comes to investigate wake up loudly.

, When driving, pull over when you see pedestrians and wave, smile, and shout with your window down at random people in cars or on the sidewalk. Ask them where an imaginary place is. Become irritated when they don't know.


Yell a random word (e.g. pickle) at someone, then roll your window back up.
Inquire as to the availability of upscale mustards in neighboring automobiles.

Call at inappropriate times.,
Say nothing.,
Leave too many messages.,
Call strangers.",How to Be Annoying6," Call late at night, when your friend is sleeping. If you cannot call that person for the first time, try a few more times. If still you are not connected to that person, try an hour or so later or few hours. Wait until you know your friend is busy to call and continue calling until they answer.


Use different numbers to dial to that person from time to time. This may reduce your chances of being caught, and increase the likelihood that your friend will answer. Put *67 before the number you are calling so the person does not know who it is. Start blabbing and repeat the same things multiple times. If they ask who you are, keep blabbing.
Call your boss at two a.m. to ""just talk."" Wait for your pink slip.

, Don't say anything when the line between that person and you are connected, just keep listening to them repeatedly, ""Hello? Hello? Hello? Who are you? Anyone? Say something!"" Breath heavily.


As you are talking, start pressing all of the keys so they beep. It will make the other person mad because of all of the beeping.
When you are not talking, use the buttons to ""beep out"" your friend.

, When leaving a message, scream at the end. After screaming say ""PS"" and then something random like ""and a partridge in a pear tree!"" Singing also works.

, Call a random person and start sobbing hysterically into the phone and say, ""I knew this would happen! I knew it was only a matter of time! What am I supposed to do?"" If the person says, ""I think you have the wrong number"", say, ""Nobody loves me!"" and hang up.


Halfway through your conversation, say in a robotic-type voice ""This phone will self-destruct in...' then start pressing a random number key and counting down from 10 as you are pressing the button.
When you pick up the phone, act like the connection broke. Then after ten times, say ""Oh, hi."" Or if they hang up, call them back and pretend like the connection broke again.

Eat really loudly.,
Be rude.,
Mess with the servers.",How to Be Annoying7," Forget your table manners. Chew your food as loudly and obnoxiously as you can. Always chew with your mouth open. Fart, burp, sneeze, and be generally disgusting by covering your face in spaghetti.

, When leaving, always complain about the service and food. Make certain your complains are as inane as possible: ""My pizza slice had three pieces of pepperoni on them!, ""I wanted four ice cubes, not five!""


If it is a restaurant with balloons on each table for kids, go around taking all the balloons and claim you collect them for a living.
Come in the restaurant dressed up as a caveman. Have the five o' clock shadow and everything too. And instead of replying with ""Yes."" say ""UGH!"" instead.

, When the server asks ""What would you like to eat?"" respond, ""Food!"" If the server suggests a dish to you, scream at the top of your lungs, ""I'm allergic to that!""


Try pointing to a dish on the menu, asking, ""What's in that?"" When your server answers, pick a random ingredient (lima beans, for example) and scream, ""I hate lima beans!""
Tell your server that you need four extra seats for your imaginary friends. If they refuse, shout that you'll tell Santa that they have been naughty.
Order random and/or impossible things. For example, ""I would like the Blue Jean Sandwich with a side of toilets, please. I would also like an elephant. Oh, and don't forget the monopoly. How's the Tinker Bell here?""
Sit on a reserved table or a really large table alone and refuse to move.

Talk to a current member.,
Contact a local chapter.,
Petition for membership.,
Receive a majority of the chapter's vote.,
Begin attending your chapter's meetings.",How to Join the Order of Eastern Star," The Order of the Eastern Star is an order that's closely associated with the Freemasons. Thus, many of the membership requirements for the OES are identical to those for joining a Masonic chapter. For instance, as with Freemasonry, OES members must be adults — that is, 18 years or older — to join.


Note that some Masonic chapters can have minimum ages of entry of up to 25 — these local rules don't affect the minimum age of entry to the OES, which is always 18.;
, While Masonic organizations are not religions or cults in themselves, they do have spiritual components. For this reason, the OES, like other Masonic organizations, requires its members to believe in a supreme being. This belief does not necessarily have to be well-defined; however, people who explicitly have no religious or spiritual beliefs are not permitted.Note that, like all Masonic organizations, the OES is open to peoples of all faiths.All that's necessary is belief in a supreme being — the form and name(s) of that being are left up to the individual member.

, Men who join the OES must already be fully-recognized Master Masons (not Apprentice or Fellowcraft). The process of becoming a Mason requires learning and demonstrating Masonic values, memorizing Masonic catechisms, and much more. For a detailed guide on joining the Freemasons, see our guide on the subject. Note that, to become a Mason, you must:Be a man
Be over 18-25 years old, depending on your chapter, (21 is a common minimum age)
Have a good reputation
Believe in a supreme being (see above)
Be able to support yourself and your family (if you have one)
Live a moral, ethical life
Have a profound desire to better yourself, your community, and the world

, Generally, women are not allowed to be Freemasons. However, they are still allowed to join the OES if they have a qualifying relationship to a man who is an affiliated Master Mason. These relationships include most, if not all, family bonds (either by blood or by marriage). A woman with any of the following relationships to a Master Mason may join the OES:Wives, daughters (including legally adopted daughters), mothers, widows, sisters, half sisters, granddaughters, stepmothers, stepdaughters, stepsisters, daughters-in-law, grandmothers, great granddaughters, nieces, great nieces, mothers-in-law, sisters-in-law, aunts, and first and second cousins.
Note also that female applicants to the OES are held to the same moral and ethical standards as male ones.

, Women who don't have one of the relationships to a Freemason listed above but are, or were, active members of the International Order of the Rainbow of Girls (IORG) or Job’s Daughters International (JDI) may still join the OES. Both of these organizations are Freemason-affiliated youth organizations that allow girls as young as 10 (for JDI) and 11 (for IORG) to join.


Note also that membership in the Organization of Triangles or the Constellation of Junior Stars, two organizations unique to New York State, can also qualify women to join.

, If you meet the qualifications described above, you may apply to join the OES. The easiest way to do this may be to talk to a friend or relative who is already a member. This person will most likely be familiar with your local chapter's entry requirements and can give you the advice necessary to make an informed decision about applying for membership.


Additionally, this person can serve as an important character reference. Because members of Masonic organizations (including OES) are required to have good reputations, the word of someone who's already a member can go quite far towards improving your chances of entry.

, You don't necessarily have to know an OES member to apply. To start the process yourself, simply contact a chapter near you. The precise entry instructions and requirements for each chapter may vary, so contacting the nearest chapter directly is a good way to ensure that you have exactly the information you need to join.


If you're unsure which OES chapter is nearest to you, consult the official listing of Grand Chapters on the Order of the Eastern Star website.This contains links to all of the large regional OES chapters around the world, which includes several chapters outside of the US and Canada.
Each of the regional chapter pages in the official OES Grand Chapter listing should contain information on subordinate local chapters near you. If you can't find this, try getting started by contacting your regional Grand Chapter directly.

, Like the Freemasons themselves, the Order of the Eastern Star requires applicants to complete and submit an official petition to be considered for membership. Usually, the petition is a short official form (obtained directly from the chapter) that demonstrates your eligibility and desire to become a member. Each chapter's precise petition procedure may vary, but, in general, an applicant should expect to provide at least all of the following:Basic personal information (name, contact info, etc.)
An acknowledgement of belief in a supreme being
An acknowledgement that you live in the jurisdiction of the chapter
Information about your Masonic status (or your relationship to a Mason)
Sometimes, official documentation of your Masonic status (or that of your relation)
A small application fee (usually returned if you are rejected)

, Petitions are received and carefully read by the OES chapter as they are submitted. If you are deemed eligible, the members of the chapter will vote on your petition.

, Once you've been admitted to the Order of the Eastern Star, you will be notified (and your application fee will be retained by the chapter). Meetings of Masonic organizations are kept closed to outsiders, so it's not possible to say exactly what you'll talk about or do at your first meeting (other than that it will be perfectly safe, dignified, and completely in line with high Masonic morals).

Be a man at least 21 years of age.,
Believe in a supreme being.,
Have high morals.,
Have an educated understanding of Freemasonry.",How to Join Freemasonry1," This is the most basic requirement under most Grand Lodge (the center of authority for Freemason groups) jurisdictions. Some jurisdictions accept men who are 18 and over, and in other cases exceptions are made for the sons of members, or for university students., There are a few jurisdictions that don't require members to believe in a deity, but this is a requirement for most Freemasons. You must believe in a single god or deity above all others. People from all religious backgrounds are welcome as long as this holds true. , This may be the most important quality to have as a potential Freemason. The fraternity's motto is ""better men make a better world,"" and honor, personal integrity, and responsibility are held in high esteem. You must be able to demonstrate that you are a man with good character in the following ways:


Have a good reputation such that those who know you would vouch for your character.
Be a good family member, with the means to support your family., Many people seek to enter the fraternity because they heard about it in movies, books, and mainstream media. Freemasonry is often portrayed as a secret society that is trying to take over the world, with clues to this effect hidden all over Paris and DC. The truth is that Freemasonry is comprised of regular men striving to support each other in fellowship, friendship, and good citizenship. Becoming a member gives you access to the following:


Entrance to the monthly gatherings at Freemason lodges, where you commune with fellow Masons.
Initiation into the teachings on the history of Freemasonry.

"
"
To be one, ask one.,
Interview with the Freemasons.,
Wait to hear their decision.,
Accept an invitation to join.",How to Join Freemasonry2," The traditional way of joining Freemasonry is to ask someone who is already a member.If you know someone who's a member, let him know that you're interested in joining, and tell him you'd like to petition for membership. He should direct you to the appropriate venue to issue your petition; you'll have to answer some questions about why you want to become a member. If you don't know someone who's member, there are a few things you can try:


Look for a ""2B1Ask1"" sign. You'll see this on bumper stickers, shirts, hats, and other items displayed by Freemasons who want to welcome new members.
Look for the Masonic square and compass symbol. This is a bit harder to spot, but you may see someone wearing it on a t-shirt or another item.
Look up your local Freemason lodge in the phone book. Call the lodge and ask them how to pursue membership in that jurisdiction.

, After you've submitted your petition to a particular lodge, the Freemasons there will review it and decide whether to invite you in for an interview with an investigative committee. If they wish to call you in, a date and time will be arranged. During the interview, you can expect the following:


You'll be asked questions about why you want to become a Freemason, and you'll be asked to describe your life story and your own character.
You'll get the opportunity to ask them questions about how things work at the Lodge.

, After the interview, the Freemasons will conduct an investigation into your life, which will include calls to people close to you who can verify that you have a high moral character. They may also conduct a background check to determine whether you've had issues with crime, drugs or alcohol.

, Once the investigative committee has made their decision, you'll receive a call and an official invitation to join the fraternity. You'll receive further instructions about meetings.

Get a Master Mason degree.",How to Join Freemasonry3," This is the first stage of initiation, and you'll learn the basic principles of Freemasonry After you gain enough knowledge and put in some time, you'll work your way up through two more symbolic degrees.


Throughout the apprenticeship period, you must continue to demonstrate good character.
Before you can advance to the next degree, you must demonstrate proficiency in understanding the degree work you experienced.

, You'll delve deeper into the teachings of Freemasonry, especially as they pertain to the arts and sciences. To complete this degree, you'll be tested on your knowledge about everything you've learned so far.

, This is the highest level you can achieve, and it usually takes several months to get there. To get the degree, you must demonstrate proficiency in the values of Freemasonry. Your completion of the degree will be celebrated with a ceremony.

Determine whether your old test qualifies.,
Include necessary documentation for school administered tests.,
Follow Mensa guidelines for privately administered tests.,
Fill out an application and fee payments.,
Send your documents to Mensa for evaluation.,
Wait patiently to hear if your test results were accepted.",How to Join Mensa1," Various intelligence tests administered throughout your schooling are acceptable to Mensa as proof of your superior intelligence. Many supervised intelligence tests are accepted by Mensa, however, each document must be individually assessed by a Mensa psychologist.A short list of accepted tests include:


ACT (composite)
GRE
LSAT
PSAT
Reynolds Intellectual Assessment Scales
Stanford Binet;
, You'll have to get a letter from your school on school letterhead that's been signed by an approved representative to prove that your test was properly administered. If your test was administered by a psychologist, have her sign the original or a notarized copy of your reported test results.


A school administrator can sign in place of a school psychologist, if necessary.
An official transcript reflecting your test score that has your school's seal stamped on it or a transcript enclosed inside an school envelope is also acceptable., These tests should have been administered by an appropriate proctor, in most cases a psychologist, and will require that professional's documentation on official letterhead. In addition to this, you will be expected to include documents containing:


Your name
The testing date
The full range of the IQ scale
The percentile you were ranked at
The original signature of the proctoring psychologist
The license number of the psychologist

Search for an astronomy club online.,
Visit the websites of astronomy clubs that interest you.,
Attend an astronomy club outreach event.,
Join the club.",How to Join an Astronomy Club," You can find an astronomy club near where you live in 1 of several ways:


You can type in ""astronomy club"" and the name of the city where you live in the search field of any Internet search engine to get a list of astronomy clubs that meet your criteria.
NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory maintains a Night Sky Network website that provides an alphabetical list of astronomy clubs (http://nightsky.jpl.nasa.gov/club-list.cfm) as well as a search engine (http://nightsky.jpl.nasa.gov/club-map.cfm). Either type in the name of an astronomy club, or type in your address, city, and state, then select the distance away the club can be from where you live.;
, The club's website should state where the club typically meets (most often a college campus), membership dues, what upcoming activities are scheduled, and which are open to non-members. (Viewing nights at the club's site are typically restricted to paying members, but nights scheduled in public locations are typically open to everyone.) The website may also feature membership application forms and the opportunity to sign up for email notification of events.

, Astronomy clubs are devoted to educating the general public about astronomy. As part of this, clubs may set up displays at science fiction conventions or Earth Day celebrations, visit schools, and host viewing nights in city parks or state recreation areas. These events are open to the general public (or students, in the case of schools), and do not require an astronomy club membership to participate.


In the case of science fiction conventions, there is often a membership fee to attend, but this is for the convention, not the astronomy club activities being held at it.

, Once you've decided a particular astronomy club is for you, get an application form, (either online or from a member), fill it out, pay your money, and start taking part in its activities.

Begin with a plan of your final time chart.,
Write down all the main events that you and the other members consider relevant and important for inclusion on the time chart.,
Go through the list of events.,
Mark off the chosen events on your timeline drawn under step one.,
Make a decision how you will create the time chart in its final format.,
Consider different types of format.,
Arrange for the time chart to be created.,
Keep a record.",How to Make a Time Chart for a Club or Guild," Draw a line; it can be either horizontal or vertical and you can change it as you plan if it seems better in the other direction.;
, Consider such things as:


When the club or guild began
Visits by VIPs
Awards
Adoption of new standards or rules
Entry of new classes of members
Change of premises
Special purchases, including property
Fundraising events

, Make sure that the events suggested are relevant, interesting and overall contribute towards giving readers a good sense of the direction that your club or guild has been taking over the years.

, Leave spaces between the years to give a sense of time moving on. Mark decade changes with large dates; other dates can be smaller. Include illustrations, photos etc. where appropriate; signal this by marking on the draft plan.

, Consideration should be given to how the time chart is to be displayed, durability, quality, materials to be used, human resources available and costs. For example, a large silk runner that has hand stitched dates and fabric photo input will likely be expensive and time-consuming compared to a poster but its lasting legacy will be greater and might even become a club or guild heirloom.

, There are many possibilities for the format and you may like to consider two formats; one for long display and one for mass distribution amongst club or guild members. Here is a small starter list to fire your own imagination:


Poster
Quilt
Fabric wall-hanging
Engraving on metal
Website version
Small paper version for a printed newsletter
Bookmarks
As part of a club or guild history book publication
Light projection

, Decide whether it will be made by professionals, by volunteers, or perhaps by a combination of both. You will also need to consider whether or not you would like to unveil the time chart as part of a ceremony. If so, plans should begin for such an event and the timeline should be adhered to closely.

, Keep an archive of the time chart that your club or guild creates. Just as you are rounding up past events for this time chart, some day there many well be future generations who round up your efforts as part of the past and this will feed into their capacity to keep history alive and accurate.

Go to your nearest book store.,
Look in the magazine for ""Show Dates"".,
Go to the American Federation of Mineralogical Societies website and follow the links to find a club near you.,
Go to the meeting and consider joining the group.,
You may find there are several clubs near you and those clubs may have different interests.",How to Find a Rock and Gem Club," If you live in an area that's far from the city,then you will need to go to a web bookstore,if you have a PC. You will not be looking for a rock or gem book, but a magazine that is made for people like you. One that is usually readily available is ""Rock and Gem"" magazine.;
, This is a listing by months of all the club shows going on in the United States. By carefully going down the list, you will find the city or town closest to you. Often, the show person will have his or her number listed. You can call and find out if there is a club closer to you,and find out when and where the meetings take place.

, There will be contact information that you can use.

, Once you are at the meeting, you will find yourself being introduced as a new potential member. The great thing about being in a club is the social interest in many of the same things you like about rocks, minerals, fossils or gems. You will have a world of experience around you to help, and at the same time a deeper appreciation of how our everyday life comes from deep within the earth.

, For instance, some clubs have many field trips while others have few. Join one or join them all.

Sign up in advance.,
Take the practice test and do the online evaluation.,
Break up your study times.,
Investigate test test trends.,
Prioritize your worst subjects when studying.,
Start studying sooner than later.,
Use mnemonic devices.",How to Join Mensa2," You'll want to give yourself ample time to prepare for the test, so when signing up for your Mensa assessment, choose a date that meets your study needs. Comparable academic tests, like the GRE (Graduate Record Examination), generally takes well-studied students one month of study to adequately prepare, but can require as many as six months for those who are out of practice with the material or test taking., Practice tests are available in many countries, and these will inform you of the main areas the actual test will target.Take note of these areas so that you can direct your studies later more effectively. You can also get a general evaluation of how well you will do by taking the online Mensa evaluation at:


https://www.mensa.org/workout

NOTE: in many countries, practice testing is available both online and in print. This will, however, depend on your home country, and should be further investigated at the Mensa international homepage., You can improve your long term recall and hopefully your Mensa test score by taking short breaks between periods of intensive study.Try to spend about 20 minutes focused on the thing you are studying and then allow your mind to rest for 5 - 10 minutes. During your break you might:


Juggle
Play Basketball
Play Soccer

, The first portion of the test, the Wonderlic, will require you to answer 50 questions in 12 minutes or less. The second test, the Mensa Admission Test, has multiple sections totaling in over 100 questions. Knowing how long you have on each section and what to expect will prevent you from wasting precious seconds puzzling out directions or reading unnecessary information. Generally, your test will include:


Determining whether the definition of two words is similar, contradictory, or unrelated.
Word scrambles, where you have to make a sentence from words provided and state whether it is true or false.
Identifying the word in a set that doesn't belong.
Geometric patterns., If, after the practice test and Mensa workout, you notice that your mathematics scores are solid but your linguistic skills wanting, you should arrange your study schedule to buff up your weak subjects.As an example, you might study for an hour and a half every morning, spending your time accordingly:



First round of study (20 minutes): language practice
10 minute break

Second round (20 minutes): language practice continued
5 minute break

Third round (10 minute): math review
5 minute break

Fourth round (20 minutes): science review

, Cramming for a test last minute can contribute to your overall anxiety which, in turn, can lead to less restful sleep. If you plan on reviewing your trouble areas the night before your test, be sure you get plenty of sleep, as sleep deprivation will impeded your learning., Mnemonic devices are word associations, rhymes, or initialisms/acronyms that help you to remember something.An example of this that you may have learned is the name ""Roy G Biv,"" which stands for the color spectrum: Red orange yellow Green Blue indigo violet.

"
"
Get plenty of rest.,
Plan a pre-exam routine.,
Eat a healthy meal before your test.,
Eat in moderation.,
Dress comfortably.,
Exercise before your test.",How to Join Mensa3," Sleep deprivation has many negative health effects, and could be the deciding factor in whether or not you pass your test. Sleep deprivation can hurt your ability to concentrate, reason, solve problems, and can even make you more forgetful than usual., Having a routine can make the day of your test feel like any other, which can help reduce test anxiety and stress. Be consistent with your routine and eventually your routine will become a comforting series of events.


Your routine shouldn't be shorter than 10 minutes, but shouldn't be too much longer than 30 minutes.
You can make a mental checklist of things you need part of your routine, which will help you remember important items on the day of your test., Hunger can make you distracted, which can hurt your performance on the test.Protein rich foods, like eggs, nuts, yogurt, and cheese, can improve your mental sharpness. Where carbs are concerned, stick to complex carbs, like whole grain products, brown rice, and whole rye to name a few. These will keep your glucose levels stable throughout the day and help you do your best on the test., Eating too much can leave you feeling drowsy or lethargic, both physically and mentally.This can lead to lower test scores than you would expect. To prevent yourself from overeating, you might want to plan out several healthy snack leading up to your test, like some fruit, whole grain toast, and eggs for breakfast, followed by a granola bar snack an hour before your noontime test.

, An itchy tag or constricting waist band might also distract you while test taking. Remember, this test is about your mental ability, not your fashion ability. Choose clothing that breathes well and fits comfortably.


You may want to dress in layers in case your testing location has poor temperature control. Even in the summer, sub-arctic AC temps can lead to discomfort and lower scores.

, Be careful not to overdo it! Fatigue can hurt your test taking abilities, but light exercise before your test can work out jitters and improve the flow of oxygen to your brain. If you don't exercise regularly, some simple exercise you can do before your Mensa test might include:


Going for a walk
Doing jumping jacks

"
"
Arrive early.,
Skip questions when necessary.,
Chew gum.,
Choose peppermint flavor for improved performance.,
Guard your minutes by keeping track of time.,
Await your test.",How to Join Mensa4," Tests are anxiety inducing enough, you don't want to add more to yourself by running behind on the day your test is scheduled. Running into the test room, your heart and mind racing, will likely put you in a less than optimal mental state for test taking.


Visit your testing location prior to the day of your test to squash any pesky worries that you won't be able to find it the day of.

, Though Mensa proctors will tell you that test questions get harder as your progress through the assessment and not to skip ahead, wasting unnecessary time on a question you don't know will make it difficult for you to answer later questions you do know., Chewing gum raises alertness, speeds your reaction times, and allows you to remember new information at a quicker rate.Especially if you have difficult staying awake during a test, you should consider walking into your test already chewing a stick of gum.

, Peppermint can invigorate your mind, sharpen your attention span, and improve your memory.Even if you hate peppermint candy, you can make use of this cognitive enhancer by putting a dab of peppermint essential oil on your wrist or shirt sleeve. That way you can take a whiff periodically to enjoy its benefits., One of the most challenging aspects of the Mensa test is the short time limit in which you will be expected to complete it. Keep an eye on the clock to keep yourself on task, and be quick to cut your losses and move on if any one section is taking too long.

, Your test results will be sent to you two to three weeks following your test, but this time may take longer depending on the number of applicants and other factors.Test results cannot be conveyed over the phone, but if you write a simple request for results to be sent to you via fax or email, including your name, email, and signature, Mensa shall do so when finished scoring your test.

Consider why you want to be down to earth.,
Start small.,
Hold yourself accountable.",How to Be Down to Earth1," Perhaps you want to change your demeanor because your behavior bothers other people. You may seek to reform your habits for the sake of peace or happiness, or to bring your life into greater balance. Perhaps you feel that you are living beyond your means, or that you can't control your feelings, or that you spend too much of your life with your head in the clouds.;
, There is no one way to be ""down to earth,"" and there is no single big change that you can make to immediately become ""down to earth."" It is a lifestyle, a demeanor, and a label. It is a collection of habits. Thus: if you want to be more down to earth, you'll need to start by changing your habits. Try to identify specific behaviors that do not feel ""down to earth,"" and begin by gradually changing these behaviors.


There are many ways to be ""down to earth."" Ultimately, this is a quality that you want to see in yourself, and a quality that you may not find in your current way of being. Start from where you are.

, It can be hard to stay self-aware, especially when you are evaluating the way that you act on a day-to-day basis. Look for someone that you trust to hold you accountable – a friend, a family member, a teacher, a counselor. Speak frankly with this person about your desire to be more down to earth. Together, identify specific habits and behaviors that you can change to reach your goal. Ask the person to keep an eye on the way that you're acting, and check in with them periodically to review your progress.

"
"
Be humble.,
Think before you speak.,
Look beyond yourself.,
Accept people for who they are.,
Listen to people.",How to Be Down to Earth2," Do not inflate your own self-worth. Do not let your identity become wrapped up in wealth, or status, or material things. Remind yourself that other people's needs and perspectives are just as important as your own. You may be better at certain things than most people, but you may not be so good at other things. Let go of the ego, and keep perspective.

, Slow down and say exactly what you mean. Catch yourself when you are not being mindful of the people around you. Be straightforward and unpretentious. Try not make assumptions about people or situations, and try not to needlessly hurt anyone with your words.Learn to express what you want without making demands. Explain yourself, when possible, and ask rather than order. Instead of saying, ""Take out the trash,"" say ""Do you mind taking out the trash so that I can keep cooking dinner?"", Maintain personal hygiene, but seriously consider how much time you spend looking in the mirror. Think about how often you mindlessly check your phone or your Facebook account. Try to spend less energy on your social and physical appearance, and spend more energy on things beyond yourself. Volunteer your time, and go out of your way to help others. Do this until it is second nature.

, Instead of trying to change them or criticize them: try to learn from them.Focus less on how people are different, and more on how people are similar. Try to see the silver lining in every situation.


Confront hate in your life. If there is someone that you strongly dislike, try to objectively consider why you dislike them. Think about whether they're really doing anything wrong.
Treat everyone as a human being. There is no reason to feel inferior or superior. Try to treat people on the basis of character, not personality.

, Be present and attentive, and don't just wait for your chance to speak. Value someone's right to speak, even if you do not agree with what they're saying. Never turn your back on people or interrupt them while they're talking. Respect people as you would like to be respected.

"
"
Keep the big picture in mind.,
Lead a simple life.,
Live in accordance with your values.,
Be grateful for what you have.,
Be patient and thoughtful.",How to Be Down to Earth3," Try to not to get too tangled up in the details. Remind yourself that things will work out one way or another, and that even the worst of situations will eventually pass. Don't give up on the important things, but try to recognize the details that are merely distracting you.

, Separate your needs from your wants, and try to focus on the things that are truly important. Consume only what you need, and be mindful of how much waste you produce. Live within your means, whatever that means for you.


Avoid overspending. Buy things for their practical function, not for how they look or how they will make you look.
Simplify. Go through your possessions, and sell or donate the things that you don't use or need. Stop holding onto things just because they're ""yours.""

, Connect with the people, the places, and the causes that are important to you. Care about the planet, the future, and the people in your life. Learn to live a more environmentally friendly lifestyle, and think seriously about your impact.

, Appreciate how wonderfully lucky you are to be alive, breathing, and growing in this moment. Show your gratitude for the people who make your life worth living: friends, family, loved ones, acquaintances.


Accept your life for what it is. Don't give up on your dreams and aspirations – but do not try to make a fantasy a reality.
Cultivate a gratitude practice. Make a habit of thanking people and complimenting people. Every morning, write down five things for which you are grateful.

, Accept the things that you cannot change, and work to thoughtfully change the things that you cannot accept. Be aware of your surroundings, particularly the way that your behavior affects the way that other people feel. Don't be afraid to wait, or to go with the flow.

Read regularly, especially the news and literary classics. Know what is happening in the news (subscribe to and skim through TIME magazine or The Economist) and read contemporary novels geared towards society and your generation. Read poetry and also visit book stores and pick up novels by the great authors. (Tolstoy, Dickens, Hemingway, etc. are all respected but look for things that interest you.)

Learn about the art of film. Purchase a movie guide. Rent (and possibly buy) films of all genres. The cable channel Turner Classic Movies generally airs unedited, commercial-free classics, and The Criterion Collection distributes digitally restored DVDs of authoritative motion pictures.






Pick up side interests in other arts that pique your curiosity, such as, for example, culinary art (cooking and cuisine), decorative arts (furniture arrangement), and calligraphy (handwriting).

Remove drunken photos and photos that aren't flattering. Also remove photos of friends behaving badly. You can now be guilty by association.
Monitor the post your friends send to you and delete anything that could appear too risqué or inappropriate.
Delete friends that are too provocative, such as the the obviously fake profiles of lingerie-clad women who send friend requests out to thousands of men.
Remove yourself from groups that are no longer appropriate for your new image. Replace them with more social or economic associates.

, Your days of getting the most cheap beer for the buck is gone!


Instead of going for low quality domestic beers you should look to nice imported beers or a classic cocktail like vodka tonics, martinis, or a well drink.
Try some different cocktails and find one you like and can sip. Not all bars have a great wine selection so you should have a backup cocktail preference.
As your income increases you can improve your preference to higher quality beverages and top shelf cocktails.
Avoid getting into drinking contest. Shots are for getting very intoxicated quickly. The more sophisticated male will be content with enjoying the beverages and spending time with old friends and making new ones. Hopefully you will even remember these friends and be able to plan future meet ups.
If you're in a place known for an excellent imported beer selection you should try the beer. Ask the bartender or server for their recommendation. If the restaurant is known for wine or their vast collection of quality liquors you should discuss it with someone who knows. Don't be afraid to discuss the menu. Make notes in your phone when you find something you really like.

, You should be a gentleman from within too. Keep your thoughts clean like you clean yourself.

Know what to expect from a posh country club.,
Consider a working class country club.,
Search for country clubs in your area.,
Shop around.,
Research the club's application process.,
Inquire about different membership levels.,
Find a sponsor.,
Fill out the application.,
Submit to a background check.,
Attend an interview.,
Tour the grounds.,
Wait for a response.,
Pay the initiation fee.",How to Join a Country Club," Posh country clubs cater to the upper class, so they cost more and are generally considered more prestigious. The application process also tends to be more rigid for these clubs.These clubs offer activities like golf, polo, and horseback riding. You can expect to find a high-class restaurant and wine cellar on the premises, as well.
""Old money"" country clubs have some of the strictest membership requirements since membership is often based on heritage and social connections. It can cost anywhere from $500,000 to $1,000,000 to join, and yearly dues are usually between $100,000 and $300,000.
""New money"" country clubs are less particular about membership and typically accept anyone who can afford the fees. Joining can cost between $100,000 and $250,000, while yearly dues range between $30,000 and $200,000.;
, Working class country clubs are more affordable than their posh counterparts. Some are still aimed at executive level professionals, while others are usually frequented by members of the standard working class.


Executive country clubs are typically populated by people like doctors, lawyers, and executive businessmen. Joining can cost between $5,000 and $80,000, and your yearly fees can range between $6,000 and $50,000. Along with standard activities like golf and tennis, these clubs usually offer some form of nice indoor dining.
Working class country clubs are the least expensive and have the fewest amenities. Joining is almost always free, but you may need to pay yearly dues ranging between $1,200 and $5,000.

, Before you can join a country club, you'll need to find one. The easiest way to find a club is to get a recommendation from someone who already belongs to one, but you can search for one on your own, too.


Getting a recommendation may also help you with the application process since many posh and executive country clubs expect you to come on the recommendation of at least one current club member.
If you don't know anyone who currently belongs to a country club, you can find one by searching in the phone book under ""Country Clubs."" An Internet search for ""country clubs near (your zip code)"" will usually turn up a decent number of results, too.

, If you're searching for a country club on your own, it's best to do some shopping around to determine which is the best fit for you and your family.


Even if a colleague or friend recommends a particular country club to you, it might still be in your best interest to shop around before committing to it.
Pay attention to the costs. Find out how much the initiation fee is (when applicable) and how much your yearly dues will cost. It's a good idea to look at how much the cost of membership has risen at a particular club over the past five years, as well.
Research possible hidden fees, too. Some clubs expect you to spend a minimum amount of money on food and amenities each month. Others may also require or request additional money for various improvements to the club.Beyond cost, ask yourself what you want from your club membership. Make sure that the activities, amenities, and social opportunities you seek will be available to you at each club you check out.

, Each club has different requirements, so once you find a country club you want to join, you'll need to find out from that club what you need to do to get in.


The steps noted here are fairly common to most country clubs, but some clubs may omit a few of these steps. Other clubs may have additional procedures not listed here.

, Many country clubs offer different levels of membership. Each level has different costs associated with it. Higher-cost levels offer a wider range of benefits than lower-cost levels.


Regular or full members will have unrestricted access to the country club's services and grounds. This level of membership also carries the most expensive fees.
House or social members have limited access to many of the grounds. Some parts of the club, like the restaurant and pool, might still be open without restriction, though.
Nonresident members pay the least amount in fees, but the club only opens certain services to them. The amount of time you can use those services and grounds will also be restricted.

, Many posh and executive country clubs will only allow you to join on referral. In these instances, it is best to look for one or two sponsors before you fill out the application.


The sponsor and co-sponsor (when required) will usually need to submit a letter of recommendation in your favor.Note that some clubs may list referrals as a membership requirement, but in many cases, these clubs are still willing to consider applications without referrals. Find out if this is the case before spending time and money on the application process, though.

, In most cases, applications can be obtained by calling, writing, or e-mailing the country club.


Some country clubs make the application available on their website.
Fill out the application as completely and accurately as possible. Aside from basic contact information, this application will ask about your family and hobbies.
Most working class country clubs do not have an application fee, but higher-end clubs will usually require you to pay a fee when you submit your application.

, Many country clubs will require you to agree to a credit and background check upon submission of your application.These checks are done to verify that you will be able and likely to pay your membership dues. A poor credit rating will decrease your odds of acceptance. A criminal history will also decrease your odds.

, Once your application, background check, and credit check clear, you might be asked to schedule an interview.Interviews can be done by phone or in person.
The individual conducting the interview will ask questions about your hobbies and the way you intend to use the club. If your answers do not meet the country club's vision or demands, your application may still be rejected.

, During or after your interview, you might be invited to tour the grounds and test the facilities. When such invitations are extended, it is highly recommended to follow through with them.


Touring the grounds will give you an opportunity to meet the members. Both you and the voting members will get a better idea of whether you'll fit in with the others at the club.
Note that if you already know one of the members, you might be able to tour the grounds before you have to submit the application or sit through an interview. It's generally a good idea to tour the grounds as early in the process as possible. The club structure may not sit well with you, and if you know that you aren't interested early on, you can save yourself and the voting members a lot of time, effort, and money.

, Once you've completed the entire application process, all you can do is wait for an answer from the club.


You will usually receive an answer within 30 days.
If you decide to withdraw your application during this waiting period, you should contact the country club and let them know as soon as you arrive at that decision. You will likely lose your application fee, but no other fines or consequences should follow the withdrawal of an application.

, If the voting board of the country club accepts you for membership, you'll get a call or letter letting you know. Once you pay the initiation fee, you will have access to the club according to the membership level you were accepted to.


If your application is rejected, you will need to start the process over with a different country club.
Some clubs may give you a reason for rejecting your application, but not all country clubs will do so.
Applying to the same club more than once is not recommended unless the circumstances you were rejected upon change.

Wear something flattering.,
Choose shoes you can dance in.,
Do your hair and makeup.",How to Get a Guy to Notice You in a Club1," Make sure you choose an outfit that's flattering on your body type. Something that genuinely fits is key. However, if you want to get noticed, it's okay to wear clothing that's slightly more sexual or revealing. You may want to wear clothing that's a little tighter than your normal style, if you feel comfortable doing so.


Do not pick something that shows everything off, but do choose something that compliments your best features. If you prefer a low-cut front, for example, don't also go for a lower cut back. If you're proud of your back muscles, go for something low-cut in the back but higher in the front.A suit can be great club wear, if you choose one that's not too dressy. A blue suit jacket, for example, worn without a tie can be a nice club outfit.You can also go casual, but make sure to pick something flattering. Fitted jeans can help you show off your legs or, if you're curvier, your curves. A tighter t-shirt can work great. If you want to add a splash of formality, wear a nice blazer over a fitted t-shirt.;
, Wear shoes that you love. Uncomfortable shoes that are difficult to dance in are not the shoes you want to wear at the club. Choose something that goes well with your outfit and is stylish. Most clubs are dark. People aren’t usually going to be looking at your feet.Select a comfortable shoe like flats or sneakers. This will allow you to dance flirtatiously, getting a guy's attention.

, Keep in mind that if you’re dancing, sweat is likely. Wear makeup and a hairstyle that is going to stay in place through the night. For makeup, you might want to change your normal daytime style to something more dramatic -- stronger colors, smokier, more shine, etc.You can also opt for waterproof makeup products, as this may stay intact more throughout the night.
You can use hairspray to keep your hair neat throughout the night.

Practice dancing beforehand.,
Be relaxed.,
Start dancing.",How to Get a Guy to Notice You in a Club2," Unless you’re a really experienced and skilled dancer, practice to some of your favorite songs. Have a friend watch and help you. You might think you’re dancing sexily, but it might just look uncomfortable -- we all need a little help sometimes. There are a lot of videos online that can help you figure out the best moves for you.Try to keep your body loose while you dance. If you make a conscious effort to release tension, your dancing will look natural. This can make you look sexier, increasing potential male attention.

, When you’re at the club, try not to be nervous (even though you probably are). Dancing in front of people can be nerve-wracking. Wait a few songs before you begin and watch what other people are doing. You don’t want to stand out so much that people stop and point. Figure out how you are going to fit into the dance floor. You might even want to wait for a song you know before you start dancing.

, If you’re nervous, dance with your friends. Work on getting more confident and more easily noticed. If you’re feeling strong, dance by yourself. This is often an invitation for a guy to come up and start dancing with you. Even if a guy doesn’t, you can be sure that a lot of guys will notice you dancing by yourself.

Study him.,
Start flirting.,
Try to start a conversation.,
Continue to show interest throughout the conversation.,
Decide if he’s interested.",How to Get a Guy to Notice You in a Club3," Notice what he is wearing, how he behaves, what he drinks, and what he does in the club. For example, is he there to have fun with his friends, or does he just want to pick up potential romantic partners? This can tell you a lot, and help if you approach him. You might study him and realize that he’s there with a significant other, so you will need to move on to someone else.

, If you see the guy at the bar, go to the bar and buy something to drink. If he turns, make eye contact before looking away. You can even look him up and down while he’s watching and then make eye contact and smile, if you’re feeling adventurous. You can also:Offer to buy him a drink. This is a fairly classic method of flirtation.
Be friendly. If you're being openly friendly with a strange guy, he may very well take this as flirtation. Smile at him and even offer a compliment. You can say something like, ""Hey, I love your shirt."", Many men will be flattered if you try to engage them in conversation.Get him to talk about himself, his opinions, and interests. Most of us like to talk about ourselves. If you’re really at a loss, ask about his tattoos (if he has any showing) or if he has any that aren’t. You can also use the following questions:Try a compliment. You could say something like, ""You look athletic. Do you play sports?"" You could also try something like, ""That's a great shirt. Where did you get it?""
If you're both waiting at the bar, comment on this to strike up conversation. For example, say something like, ""Can you believe how crowded it is?"" After he responds, introduce yourself.
Ask about him when starting a conversation. Find something you can observe about him and ask about it as a way to talk. For example, ""Excuse me, but what kind of beer are you drinking?""

, Once you have a guy hooked in conversation, make sure to send signals you're interested. Nod and smile to show you're listening. Maintain eye contact as he talks.Pay as much attention to listening as you do to talking. If you appear interested in someone and what they're saying, this can appear flirtatious.
Appear engaged. Talk in an animated voice, sit up straight, and smile on occasion.

, If you notice the guy flirting back a bit, you have successfully gotten his attention. If he responds to the eye contact and flirting, you have gotten him to notice you! You might want to continue flirting and talking, or take it to the dance floor. Now that he’s noticed you, it’s up to you where you want to take the night from here.

Avoid wanting to change their mind.,
Be open to changing your mind.,
Allow yourself to be wrong.,
Ask questions.,
Use “I” statements.,
Show respect.,
Listen.,
Reflect your understanding.,
Show curiosity.,
Don’t make snap judgments.,
Recognize your audience.,
Read body language.,
Know when not to speak.,
Drop it if it gets out of hand.",How to Be Civil when Talking About Politics," Don’t go into a discussion with the goal of changing someone’s mind or proving how bad their ideas are. Trying to change someone’s beliefs is often at best futile and at worst annoying or upsetting. If you’re tempted to talk about politics with someone, check your intentions. If you want to prove something or tell them how dumb you think they are, you might want to sit this one out.Engaging in respectful discussions means bringing some openness and willingness to listen to the discussion.
For example, if you want to talk about how your position on the war is superior or why people should share your views, hold back.;
, Don’t go into a discussion expecting to change someone else’s mind, however, be open to expanding your own perspectives and ideas. While you can’t change anyone else, you can be open to hearing different viewpoints and understanding why people feel or think a certain way. Use the interaction to learn something about the person or yourself. Instead of shutting someone down for their differing beliefs, be curious about them and challenge yourself.Be willing to challenge your own assumptions and beliefs.
For example, if someone else likes another candidate, be open to hearing about them and why this person supports them.

, When you assume that you are right or correct, you limit your ability to learn new information. Don’t assume you already know everything. Recognize that people bring their own experiences and understanding to topics and you can learn from them.Learn from other’s differences and allow yourself to be proven wrong on occasion.
Especially if you’re strongly against a candidate or party, be open to hearing from people with those different views and be open to learning from them.

, If you disagree with someone, don’t be quick to shut them down or explain why you think you are ‘right.’ instead, try to gain some understanding of them or their comment. Ask questions about things you don’t understand or disagree with. Check your understanding by asking questions.Don’t ask questions to badger the person such as, “Why would you believe that?” or, “So you’re telling me you actually follow that person?!”
Focus on questions such as, “Can you explain that one more time?” and, “Would you tell me more about that?”
You can also say, “We disagree on that. Can you tell me what fuels your beliefs on that issue?”

, It’s easy to get defensive or accusatory when talking politics. Keep the focus on understanding the person and making your voice heard. Stay away from judgments or blame. If you don’t agree with something, keep the focus on you.For example, instead of saying, “You believe that abortion is wrong? What kind of person are you?” say, “That differs from my own opinion, which is that I believe women can make their own choices.”
Instead of saying, “Your beliefs are frustrating,” say, “I’m getting a bit frustrated discussing this.”

, Even if you vehemently disagree with someone, treat them with respect. Avoid calling them names or undercutting their beliefs. Don’t interrupt them while they’re speaking. Take turns speaking and try not to raise your voice.Whatever a person’s political stance, they almost always believe they are the ‘good guy’ and want their beliefs or candidate to make a positive change. Remember this when speaking.

, Having a civil conversation means taking turns speaking and also listening to the other person. While the other person is speaking, put your attention into understanding them and what they’re saying. Don’t try to formulate your response or think about how you can undermine what they’re saying. Truly listen with the intention of understanding.Don’t respond to distractions or interruptions. If your phone goes off, consider silencing it. This shows that you’re giving your full attention.
Make a genuine effort to hear the person out and understand their point of view.

, Part of listening to someone and engaging in constructive conversations by checking in on your understanding. Restate or summarize what you heard the person saying to clarify. For example, say, “I hear you saying that the candidate is not qualified” or, “Let me make sure I’m clear…”Reflect important points by saying, “It seems like childcare is an important issue for you” or, “I can tell you feel strongly about the war.”
These kind of statements help the other person feel heard. They can also respond by saying, “No, I meant…”

, If you wonder why you and another person see things differently, ask them about it. Instead of judging them for their views, get to know them and figure out what has shaped them to hold that particular belief. Put yourself in their shoes and ask yourself some questions.When you understand someone’s point of view, you can learn about their motivations and why they might think a particular way.

, As much as you can, avoid black-and-white thinking. Just because someone likes a candidate doesn’t mean they support every action or stance of that politician. If someone belongs to a certain party you don’t agree with, that doesn’t mean they are an idiot or uninformed.If you feel judgmental toward someone, ask why questions for clarifications. For example, say, “I disagree with you on that and I’d like to know why you hold that position so that I can understand better.”

, If you know the person you are talking to tends to be argumentative or likes to fight or stir trouble, be careful with your words. You might have an especially argumentative or opinionated uncle or a colleague at work who has intensely different views than you. Keep this in mind before or during your discussion.


You may be willing to have debates with your friends but not with your manager at work, professor at school, or your sweet yet racist grandparent.

, Read the person’s nonverbal cues as a way to guide the discussion. If the person looks uncomfortable or agitated, shift gears. If they look upset or angry, the conversation may not be headed in the best direction. Bring it back in or change the subject to something else.While you may enjoy talking about politics, this person may want to keep things light or casual. If they look uncomfortable, drop the topic.

, If you’re somewhere inescapable like an airplane or dinner table, think about what you want to say and how you want to say it. You don’t want to sit next to someone on a long airplane ride and be upset with them due to their political beliefs. Use common sense when bringing up political conversations.If you start a conversation and someone is acting disinterested or not fully interacting, don’t push the conversation. If you’re unsure, drop the conversation and give them the opportunity to start it up again.

, If you can tell things are getting heated or that the discussion could end up hurting your relationship, drop the topic and move on. Say something like, “It’s clear we won’t see eye to eye on this, and I want to stay friends with you.” Then, change the subject or move onto another activity. Some things are not worth risking long-term disagreements or resentments.

Compare yourself to a few friends.,
Don't look at the girl next to you and think ""Her hair is so perfect and mine is such a mess,"" or ""Her skin is flawless and mine is horrible"".,
Call a friend over and make her stand next to you and look at the two of you in the mirror.,
Write what you have observed down: For example, your list might be something like: ""Medium length hair, eyes close together, full lips, below average height, normal skin, generally wear dark clothes, no jewelry"".,
Understand that this is how other people view you, and that is how they will describe you if asked.,
Examine your personality.,
Express your personality!,
Be vocal.,
Spend time on your appearance/ You can't expect people to bother with you if you don't bother with yourself.,
Change your look, slightly.,
Wear bright colors.,
Do not hunch when you walk.,
Start smiling.,
Get involved in something in which none of your friends are involved.,
Initiate conversation.,
Implement the 'changed look' mentioned earlier.,
Do not be afraid to make fun of yourself.,
Do not be a people-pleaser.,
Love yourself.",How to Be an Attractive and Approachable Girl," Most of the time when we look into a mirror, we see what we are used to seeing and not always what is there. We are more likely to see our reflection and notice the minor things that no one else would and make a big deal about. Also, the way we perceive ourselves is very different from the way other people perceive us. The idea of this is to give you a more accurate physical description of yourself by comparing the way you look with someone else. This is not meant to be a negative comparison, which is something we do often.;
, This is not the comparison this article is talking about.

, Check your physical attributes with hers. Is your hair longer, shorter, curlier or straighter? Is your skin paler or darker? Are your eyes large or small? All you have to do is identify your physical attributes. They are yours and yours alone! They are not better or worse than anyone else. They are yours to use. And you have to accept that though you may want someone else's eyes, or nose, they may be wanting yours! You are unique, so remember that.

, Look over the list. Go over this list and tell yourself that this is you. Whatever guy you get has to like you with all of this.

, Make sure that you are alright with this. No matter how deflated your ego is, you have to accept that you were made this way and are wonderful. Think of all the famous movie and television stars that have less than perfect features. Noses that are too long and too short, heights that are way above or below average, skin that is all kinds of different colors. What makes them beautiful is the fact that they like who they are (and maybe have an expensive makeup artist, but the most beautiful celebrities will look wonderful with or without makeup, and it's because they have confidence). Do not continue until you have understood and accepted that the way you look is perfect...for you.

, What are the things you like? The things you don't like? What are the things you are proud of? You might have great taste in music, but if no one knows about it, you really aren't likely to meet someone who likes the same music as you (unless they have talked to you, of course). Ever felt like there is no one in school/college who is like you? It's just because you don't know where they are.

, Referring to the music example, a way you could express your taste in music is by getting pins or shirts of your favorite bands. You can put the pins on your bag and wear the shirts once in a while. You will be expressing yourself to anyone who happens to look at you, without actually saying anything. Decorate your notebooks with pictures, quotes, anything that exposes the way you think. It's more worthwhile to do this on notebooks than lockers. Only you and a few people see the inside of your locker. Utilize anything that is likely to be seen.

, Not loud, not talkative, not overly friendly. But make sure that everyone in school has at least heard your voice once. Whether it was when you asked a question in class or said ""sorry, Excuse me"" when you bumped into someone, make sure you use your voice. Don't talk when you're not comfortable, but if you think you can add something to the conversation, just open up and say it. Another thing you want to do, is talk more when people usually talk less, and talk less when people usually talk more. For example, if you crash into someone else, most people would just say ""Sorry"" or ""Excuse me"" and continue moving. You ought to extend that. Say something like ""Oh, I'm so sorry, are you alright?"". When people are asked something like ""Do you have any plans over the weekend?"", the average person will launch into a long detailed explanation of what they are doing and why and invite anyone else to come along. With something like that be brief. The purpose of this is to make your reactions out of the ordinary. They are more likely to remember you if you stand out, even if it's something as small as the length of your sentence.

, Try a bit of make up but never go overboard. A suggestion would be to focus on the eyes. Nobody ever has ugly or unflattering eyes. If you play the eyes up, not only will you look cool, but when people are talking to you, they'll be more focused. When guys talk about their favorite things about girls, they almost never mention the eyes as the top factor, but even they might not realize that it's the eye contact that starts the attraction in the first place.

, Try something new. Do you always wear your hair up? Let it down and see how it looks. Again, this works best with the comparison technique. Don't implement it unless you like it, and don't implement it immediately either. You still have some more things to get in order before you can wow everyone.

, This is a small but important thing. Guys generally notice girls when they are––well let's just say when they aren't wearing something that is the same color as the locker or wall. They also associate bright colors with confidence and approachability.

, This is a very small thing but very important. People tend to notice you only if you're standing properly. It also makes you more elegant and makes you look confident and approachable.

, If you catch someone's eye (guy or girl) and if you look at someone at the exact same instant they see you, smile. Just a small, modest kind of smile. The one that says ""huh, we saw each other at the same time"" not one that says ""ooh eye contact! Awesome!"" or ""Are you checking me out"". A half smile will do. Try not to show your teeth though. That is one thing that can be interpreted as a possible flirt move (if it's a guy) or an overly friendly move (if it's another girl). If someone makes a joke, laugh! Don't giggle. Don't smile. Jokes are meant to stimulate laughter. If it's a lame joke, laugh at its 'lameness'. Not only will this improve your mood and give you a bit of a confidence boost, the people around you will notice you more.

, This will require a bit of courage, but think about it, if none of your friends are into it, even if you do something stupid, they won't be there to laugh at you. You can join a club or a team. Make sure you are interested in what you pick though. The advantage of this is not only meeting new people, but meeting people you would have never met otherwise, and also a chance to be more confident. If none of the people you know are around, you can let yourself go a bit. Be slightly more vocal and outgoing. The other kids don't know you aren't usually like that. And you will even enjoy yourself more. Everyone needs to be a little unusual sometimes. Make sure you aren't doing a 180 degree personality change!

, If you find yourself alone with someone, make a comment or smile at them and introduce yourself. If you wait for other people to make the first move always, you will be the invisible girl until senior year. If you get nervous around guys, do this with girls. They might be cynical and even rude, but remember that it doesn't matter. You're improving yourself, not looking for a new best friend. Remember to not take any negative comment personally. Besides, what are they going to do anyway? Sue you for saying ""hello"" and smiling at them? It's ok if they ignore you. The idea is to start taking the initiative to talk. And some people might be nice to you and you might make a new friend...sure they won't replace your best friend, but it's still nice to have someone to wave to in the hallway. You aren't losing anything if you take the initiative. You might lose something if you don't. Once you are comfortable starting a conversation with girls, you can move onto the guys. The best way to start with a guy is by just smiling and saying ""Hey"" and wait for him to respond, not too much conversation, if you see them again, you can start a proper conversation.

, Now that you have a few friends outside your circle (or just acquaintances even, that's fine) and now that you are a bit more confident and not afraid to be visible. As long as you think you look good, you don't need to worry about other people. Put a bit of effort in the way you look and imagine yourself as an older and confident woman. Usually imagining yourself older would give your step a bit of an edge, a purpose. Kind of like playing dress-up. Also remember, if one of the more popular people go out of their way to comment or even be mean, it means they noticed you and that you can't be ignored. And most of the time, it means that they have something to be jealous of or threatened by. They might even insult you (although it's nice if they don't) because you look prettier than them.

, One sure way to make other people comfortable around you is actually to poke a bit of fun at yourself. For example, if you're entering a room and you trip, laugh it off and say something like ""Wow, I'm such a klutz today"". Not only will it make you feel less bad when someone else laughs at you, it will improve your approachability. Someone who can laugh at themselves (and others sometimes without being mean) is a rare and amazing person. Hey, no one's perfect. And wouldn't you rather make fun of yourself rather than someone else doing it for you?

, If one of your new (or old) friends asks you to do something you don't want to do. Give them the 'look', the one a teacher might give you if you say ""my dog ate my homework"", a semi-amused, semi non-believing expression. Just smile a little bit, give out your best sarcastic/amused expression and just shake your head no. If they ask ""why"" look at them straight in the eye and say ""why not?"". If they pressurize you, don't panic. Don't yell or say ""no! you can't make me! get away!"". Keep eye contact and even laugh if you can. Sarcasm would be very useful in a case like this, and wit. Leave them with the kind of insult that would make them think, and that would give you enough time to get away. If you think you're being pressurized too much, walk away. Not only will that make you stronger as a person, but you'll show others that you are confident and you dare to say no when you mean no. Most people don't. And that's why, saying no is much more attractive and inspiring than saying yes, even if people don't realize it at the time.

, Love the way you are, the way you've changed. Contentment is contagious.

Choose to harbor positive emotions.,
Perform simple acts of kindness whenever possible.,
Point out the little things that you enjoy.,
Bite your tongue more often.,
Allow yourself to smile.",How to Be a Pleasant Person1," Make the active decision to nurture a positive mindset. This is one of the quickest ways to affect your mood and outlook, which are both constantly shaping how other people feel around you. Further, maintaining positive emotions will contribute to your own satisfaction and the amount of happiness you experience. These sentiments will also positively affect the way you interact with others.Choose to hold onto positive thoughts as they arise, and repeat them in your mind. Similarly, make the decision to set negative thoughts aside, and address any recurring sources of negativity.
Think of harboring positive emotions as providing the base of an “upwards spiral” that will contribute to your own emotional health and the enjoyment others derive in your company.
The more optimism you convey externally, the more positive experiences you’ll share. In turn, these will lead to greater personal and social comfort, success, and happiness.;
, Acts of kindness will immediately send a pleasant, positive message to whomever witnesses or benefits from them. Further, performing acts of kindness will contribute to your own feelings of happiness.For instance, simply smiling while holding the door has the legitimate potential to improve someone’s day. Don’t miss your next chance to do so!

, Take note of the little things that make you happy, and mention them to others around you. Simply spreading a sense of general contentment in the spaces you share with others will cause them to value and appreciate your presence.For instance, simply mention how refreshing the air is on a particular day, or pointing out the blue jay on the tree outside the office window.

, Reduce the frequency with which you criticize or make contentious statements. When you disagree with someone, think about the specific reasons you hold a different perspective before voicing your disagreement. If you are uncertain about whether a critical comment is worth saying, try to see the scenario from the other person’s perspective. This will likely lead you to frame your perspective more pleasantly., Smiling is one of the most powerfully pleasant behaviors you can immediately start doing more often. Not only will you own mood be elevated, leading you to act more pleasantly, the smile alone will positively affect the mood of those who see it – whether they realize it or not!Smile at people you interact with before saying hello. People will almost always smile back, and your interactions will start off pleasantly, even before either of you say a word.

"
"
Articulate your thankfulness.,
Give genuine apologies.,
Listen first.",How to Be a Pleasant Person2," The sentiment of gratitude actually contributes to your own and others’ happiness. Further, those who indicate their gratefulness to others wind up actually being more grateful for the contributions that others make to their lives, and enjoy stronger, more pleasant relationships with those around them. All told, gratitude, happiness, and positive relationships all tend to enhance each other.Incorporate gracious behavior into your daily life by saying “please” and “thank you” more frequently. This does more than simply indicate your basic gratitude, it also helps convey yourself pleasantly and respectfully.

, Whenever you make a mistake, particularly by doing something that hurts another person, you need to apologize for it. This is true whether your mistake was intentional or unintentional.Focus on conveying the fact that you’re truly sorry. Say something like, “I wanted to tell you that I’m sorry about ________.”


Don’t try to explain or shift blame away from yourself. This will make your apology sound disingenuous. If an explanation is necessary, it can be given later, in a separate conversation.

, Instinct usually warrants speaking first and then listening to another’s perspective. However, you will likely be perceived more pleasantly if you get in the practice of listening first, and speaking only once you fully understand another’s perspective. Not only will you learn more about situations and people by actively listening to them, the efficiency and clarity of your conversations will improve.You’re immediately more likable if you are able to convey that you are genuinely interested in another person. One of the best ways to do so is by listening quietly, while making eye contact and indicating you understand by nodding periodically.
After listening, you’ll also be able to frame your own perspective according to another’s vernacular, which make them more likely to hear what you’re saying, and increases the likelihood that the conversation is positive and productive.

"
"
Laugh readily and often.,
Compliment readily.,
Initiate conversations with casual acquaintances.,
Engage in small talk.,
Take the opportunity to include others in your life.,
Welcome new people to shared social groups.,
Expose yourself to other human beings.",How to Be a Pleasant Person3," On par with the visual positivity of a smile, laughing is an auditory message that you’re happy. Further, it conveys that you’re on the same page with someone, that will make you both more comfortable in one another’s presence. And of course, laughing actually causes a release of endorphins that contribute to happiness and relaxation.Never stifle a laugh! Laughter is simply contagious: once someone begins, others are likely to follow, and all will benefit from its positive effects.
Make eye contact with someone immediately after sharing a laugh with them. There is perhaps no better way for people to maintain positive sentiments than by keeping one another laughing.

, Acknowledging that you noticed something about someone that you admired or were otherwise impressed by is another surefire way to create a pleasant rapport between you. Sincerity is key, of course, so don’t go around complimenting people without any actual inspiration to do so. Instead, simply verbalize the complimentary thoughts that naturally come to your mind.For instance, when you find yourself impressed by someone’s behavior or performance, let them know.
Be specific, as this will make the compliment sound sincere. Say something like, “I really admired how you handled yourself in there today. I thought your response to _____ was insightful and productive.”
Make a compliment personal too, by adding something along the lines of, “I’m glad we’ll be working together on this.”

, If you frequently run into someone, or have met a friend of a friend before but don’t really know them yet, don’t hesitate to say hello. Know that you can keep it brief if it feels awkward or if you tend to be shy.Even simply saying hello will increase the likelihood that others will feel positively towards you. Introduce yourself, ask the person’s name, and say something like “Well, great to see you! Hopefully we’ll run into each other again soon.”

, It might be insufferable in moments of particularly uninteresting conversation, but small talk indicates something incredibly important; that you feel the person with whom your speaking is worth your time and attention. Particularly when someone tries to chat with you, at least engage them for a polite exchange about the weather, the sports teams currently in the news, or the latest politician’s gaff.Whenever you encounter someone you know, say hello! Whether friends, or co-workers, indicate that you value the people around you by making a point of engaging with them, even if only for moment.
Don’t allow concerns about a potentially uninteresting conversation to dissuade you from a positive encounter. At worst, you can always politely excuse yourself after trading a few pleasantries.

, In simplest terms, invite others to join you, especially in social endeavors. For instance, whenever running into an old friend, be sure to include an invitation to the next open social gathering you’re looking forward to. Even if others are unable to attend a particular event, your invitation will come across as friendly and pleasant., Especially when someone has been brought into a new group but may not have developed individual relationships, make yourself available. If someone may need a bit of guidance getting used to a new environment, offer to walk them through an activity or scenario they may not have encountered before.Make a point of talking to the person at a social or work gathering you don’t know, and make sure they’re in the loop regarding any future activities that they might also be interested.
Even if only in parting, say something along the lines of, “Hey, two weeks from today is _____. Hope to see you there!”

, Technology has increasingly offered the ability to entertain, and even to sustain ourselves almost entirely independently. This does not mean that doing everything alone will make your happier. In fact, the more time you spend alone, the more important it is to go out too. One quick way to up your social interactions is making lunch plans. While your job will dictate the specifics, try to eat your meals, especially lunch and dinner, with others.


In general, indicate that you want to be involved by vocalizing your interest and joining in group activities whenever you’re able to do so.
Stay a while longer at social functions. Often, more personal interactions will occur when crowds have thinned, and the more you’re able to relate to someone, the more likely the two of you will enjoy a pleasant evening together.

Choose a living arrangement.,
Learn to cook.,
Keep your space clean.",How to Be a Mature Young Adult1," When you move away from home, you have a lot of options for how and where you would like to live.


Dormitories are a great option for college students and are often required for freshman at many institutions. Dorms let you ease into living away from home without saddling you with tasks like rent and maintenance. They're also excellent places to make friends and learn how to live in a community of your own.
Single apartments require the most responsibility right off the bat but they also allow you to have a space that it is entirely your own. Studio apartments, which are small and inexpensive units with one main room and one bathroom, are good first apartments, as are one-bedroom units. To avoid loneliness, you'll have to seek social interactions away from home if you choose to live alone, which can be more challenging.
If you don't wish to live alone, sharing an apartment or house with roommates is your best option. This not only reduces your living costs, it also gives you a good balance between community and privacy.;
, Cooking for yourself is much more cost-effective and healthy than relying on takeout and store-bought meals. It's also a great social skill and will be essential if you ever choose to have a family of your own. There are a lot of different ways to learn to cook and you can use multiple methods at the same time. Look for:


Cook books.
Online instructional videos.
Online recipes and instructional articles.
Local cooking classes.

, For the sake of health and social presentation, it's very important to have a clean home and an equally clean self.


Wash dishes daily. Allowing dirty dishes to pile up just creates more work for yourself down the line and increases the amount of mold and insects in your home.
Do laundry every one to two weeks. If you don't have laundry facilities in your home, look for a local coin-operated laundromat.
Designate one day a week as cleaning day. This is a day when you should thoroughly clean your home, including washing floors and windows, cleaning your bathroom, dusting your furniture, and any other tasks specific to your home.
If you have roommates, divide up cleaning chores and rotate them equally. Set clear rewards and penalties for success and failure to fulfill these responsibilities.

Be polite.,
Do simple things like opening doors for a girl when you're out together or bringing her a small bunch of flowers on your first date.

,
Be courteous when you are talking to a girl you like.,
Do not try to overshadow a girl on any particular note.,
Be quietly confident.,
Remember that every woman/girl is unique.,
Dress appropriately.,
Treat people in the way that you would like people to treat you!",How to Be a Gentleman Towards Girls," When you meet a girl for the first time, be sure make eye contact and maintain it as you introduce yourselves to each other. Don't look at the floor or stare at her body.;
,, As you're talking with each other, don't interrupt her. Ask her questions about herself. Don't get too personal, though. Keep it light at first by asking her about her career, her studies, her hobbies, little things like that. As with step 1, make sure you maintain eye contact as you're talking with her. This shows her that you're paying attention to what she is saying.

, If she's talking about a particular activity that she likes to do, you can say that you like the same activity. But don't try to impress her by bragging about your skill. This is a conversation, not a competition.

, Just because you choose to act like a gentleman doesn't mean that you're not confident in yourself. Part of being a gentleman is not acting arrogantly. It doesn't help being handsome without having confidence in yourself.

, Once you have this in mind life gets easier ... why? If you act like a gentleman and one girl still rejects you, don't let that stop you from acting like a gentleman. Another girl will appreciate your behavior and will be attracted to you. There are more girls in the world than men. Don't forget this.

, Part of being a gentleman is being well-groomed. Make sure you wear clothes you feel comfortable in. They should fit well and make you feel confident. You should also appear and smell clean.

, Ladies expect a gentleman to treat other people with common courtesy. So show how much of a gentleman you can be in dealing with waitstaff at a restaurant or a barista who gets a coffee order wrong.

List your skill set.,
Write a resume.,
Use multiple channels to find jobs.",How to Be a Mature Young Adult2," Make a list of any diplomas, degrees, certifications, credentials, and experiences you have that may be interesting to potential employers.

, If you are uncertain how to properly construct a resume, consult a career counselor, friends and family, or trusted online resources.

, Look for jobs in fields that interest you by performing daily searches using some combination of resources like:
Online job boards.
Employment agencies.
Networking events.
Friends and family.
""Help Wanted"" signs at local businesses.
Sending letters of inquiry to companies that interest you but haven't posted employment opportunities.

Make a monthly budget.,
Build good credit.,
Maintain a checking and savings account.",How to Be a Mature Young Adult3," You can do this by hand, in a simple computer document, or a database program like Excel. Start with your monthly income, then determine the cost of the following:


Rent. If possible, make sure your monthly rent is no more than 1/3 of your income.
Recurring bills such as utilities, car payments and insurance, regular medication, phone, and Internet service.
Food.
Entertainment.
Taxes. Consult the Internal Revenue Service website for all forms, worksheets, and questions related to your tax obligations.
Set aside some money every month for emergencies if possible. You never know when you're going to need to travel or make use of emergency medical, dental, or maintenance service.

, Your credit rating is very important. It is a score many companies and organizations use to determine your eligibility for everything from a credit card, to a home or vehicle lease, to a bank or credit union loan. Most people start out adulthood with poor-to-middling credit. You can build good credit in a variety of ways.


Get a credit card and pay it off at least once a month. Demonstrating your ability to make regular payments strongly improves your credit reputation.
If you are in debt, make good faith payments regularly. Government debt, like for student loans, can be adjusted to make payments easier, though loans from private organizations like banks can be harder to adjust.
Consult a financial professional before making large purchases to ensure you can afford the expenditure.

, It is unsafe and wasteful to keep all of your money in a checking account. Savings accounts are more secure because they often are not attached to debit cards and checks that can be stolen. Savings accounts also have better interest rates so you will earn money more quickly.


Look for good rates. Not all banks and credit unions are the same. Feel free to shop around for the financial institution that meets your needs.
Be careful of hidden fees. Many institutions charge monthly fees for services like debit cards and transfers.
Know your minimum balances. Many accounts require a minimum amount of money to open and may incur fees if their balance falls below a certain amount.

, Learn the dress code and recommended clothing for work, leisure, sports, and other activities.

, You can find good, inexpensive clothing at:


Outlet stores.
Thrift shops.
Vintage clothing retailers.
Online vendors.
Yard sales.

,


Wash white clothing as a separate load with bleach, then wash colored clothing with detergent. Washing white and colored clothing together can cause dye to stain white clothes.
Check your detergent for potential allergic reactions.
Iron wrinkled clothes and use collar stays to keep collars from curling.

, Take at least one opportunity each day to say or do something nice for someone.

,


Let your friends and romantic partners have private time.
Do not invite yourself to someone else's event.
Give your coworkers personal space and do not discuss topics that may be uncomfortable for them.

, In social situations, whether personal or professional, it is more productive and respectful to discuss rather than demand. If you demonstrate a mature willingness to compromise, others will be more willing to work and spend time with you.

, Not only will you gain respect and trust, but people will go to you for help. Take control of a situation if no one else is, and make sure to do a thorough job. Remember, if you are going to do something, do it right.

, It is a kind gesture to do. Also, what goes around comes around...

, What is the point of doing something if you're only going to do half a job. Doing everything your best can help your future to its full extent.

, Taking care of yourself is the first step. If you are sick or have a problem, then it will be hard to get good grades. So shower regularly, wash your hands after going to the bathroom, moisturize your body, cut your fingernails, exercise and eat healthy. Also drink lots of water. This makes you feel tremendously better on the inside and out. Because of this, you will concentrate better in school and you will glow.

, Nobody enjoys a fake laugh, smile or compliment.

, This will earn you respect. Many people are impatient, but impatience can make trouble for you. A better approach is to keep quiet. Think of something that is going on tonight, and how you will plan it. Be considerate to the person you are with... in other words - BE PATIENT!

, This is very important. If you can swear in one second, you can say thank you in a second also. There really is no difference. Good manners will go a long way.

, Talk with correct grammar when you speak. If you pay attention in school, and are curious about things around you, the words will come. Reading books can help you broaden your vocabulary. When you are out in public, be mature and compose yourself.

, Instead of sending an e-card, write a letter. E-cards do not mean as much as a hand written letter. It shows that you are actually taking time out of your day to keep in touch. Working hard instead of ""butt-kissing"" will get you a lot farther in life. Although butt-kissing might be quicker, in the long run, hard work is the morally correct thing to do, and you will gain much more. There is no better satisfaction than a job well done.

, Examples of these are: curse words, smoking, anger/hatred, and unnecessary violence of any kind. It is better to eliminate them completely. If you have a goal in life, suppressing those things will make it easier to concentrate and you will get to your goal more quickly.

, Be environmentally friendly by recycling, donate to charity, or simply share. By doing this, in the end you have made the world a better place.

Recycle, shut off water, shut off lights, stop the bullying. These little things can make a big difference.

, Maintain an appearance that is your age, and is you. If you want people to take you seriously, don't dress Emo or Goth or skater, because in the real world, people will look at you and not take you seriously. But by dressing maturely, you will get a fair chance.

, Take action and be heard!

Always be clean. Take a shower twice everyday, when you wake up and before going to sleep. Brush your teeth, too. Also, is good to smell nice. Try to use deodorant and perfume.
Try to be fashionable. You don't need to spend too much money on clothes, because you can usually find stylish things for a good price. Read fashion magazines and watch TV so you can have a basic idea of what to wear, but you don't have to wear exactly what everyone else is.

Act with good intentions.,
Try to see things from the perspective of others.,
Take a timeout when you feel yourself getting angry.,
Take responsibility for your actions.",How to Be a Kind Person1," Research has shown that acting with good intentions can improve your mindset and help you to enjoy your own acts of kindness. Being aware of your good intentions can also make your act of kindness more meaningful to the recipient.Decide to do something nice for someone before you do it. Acting with intent will help you to enjoy acting in a kind manner.
Enjoying being kind serves as a form of positive reinforcement, encouraging you to be kind more often in order to continue enjoying the feeling.;
, Being kind becomes easier when you empathize with the experiences of others. Try to imagine yourself in the shoes of those around you and think of how your actions might affect them. Do things that you wish others would do for you, if you were in their shoes.Picturing yourself in other people’s shoes can making being kind seem less like something that requires effort and more like it’s simply the right thing to do.

, Being kind is much easier when things are going well, but when the going gets tough people often forget to consider the feelings of others. When you feel yourself getting angry or frustrated, take a timeout and try to calm yourself down.Controlling your temper is one of the most important elements of kindness.
Try counting to ten and taking long, deep breaths when you’re angry. Think about your words and actions, and how they may affect those around you, when you’re angry.

, When you distance yourself from your actions by justifying them as vengeance or deserved, you allow yourself to be unkind for selfish reasons. Instead of telling yourself that the way you act towards others is deserved with it’s negative, take responsibility for the way you treat others.


Don’t convince yourself that negative things you do or say are acceptable because you feel slighted.
You can’t control the actions of others, but you can control how you react to them. Being kind is a choice.

Understand the benefits of compassion practice.,
Imagine a loved one in trouble.,
Focus on what you have in common with others.,
Think about what kindness could do for people.,
Put it to practice.",How to Be a Kind Person2," Studies have shown that you can train yourself to feel compassion for those around you through practice. Compassion practice is a kind of training that will help you better empathize with the people in your life, making kindness an easier endeavor.Compassion practice is made up of mental exercises that you should try to do on a daily basis.
Studies have shown that compassion practice can reduce the hormones in your brain associated with stress.

, Spend a few minutes of your day imagining someone you care about needing help. Focus on the way they would feel and try to envision their stresses and concerns. Create a complex scenario in your mind and imagine their difficulties in as much detail as you can.This exercise will help you to appreciate the difficulties the people you love go through. Developing an understanding of your loved one’s struggles will help you develop empathy toward others.
You can also use this exercise to help you develop more compassion towards yourself. For example, after thinking about how you would treat a friend who was suffering or struggling with something, consider how you treat yourself when you are suffering or struggling. Are you kind to yourself? Do you show yourself compassion? Or do you refuse to acknowledge when you are struggling or suffering? If you treat yourself harshly, then consider the reasons why. What might change if you were kind to yourself?, Take some time out of your day to focus on the things you have in common with the people around you. Think of the emotions they are experiencing or have experienced and add the phrase, “just like me” to the end of each. Try saying some of the following statements to yourself throughout your day:“This person just wants to be happy… just like me.”
“This person is trying to avoid suffering in his or her life… just like me.”
“This person has been down, sad and depressed at times… just like me.”

, Establishing empathy for others and finding what you have in common are just the beginning. Now, as you imagine the suffering of people that you know are ultimately a lot like you, think about what it would mean to you if someone were to go out of their way to be kind to you in the same position.Think about how much it would mean just to know someone was hoping things would get better for you.
Focus on that joy you can imagine others experiencing. That feeling is the basis of compassion.

, Use the progress you’ve made in the previous steps to put your training to good use. Try to find a small gesture you can make for another person each day. It doesn’t need to be anything significant, it just needs to be intentionally kind. Start by sharing a smile or a kind word, and over time you will develop a habit of not only empathizing, but also acting on that empathy.Start with small gestures, but from time to time take an opportunity to go out of your way for others.
Think about the way your kind gestures made people feel and reflect on the way your kindness affects others.

Be courteous and polite.,
Reach out to friends who seem down.,
Show gratitude.,
Donate to charity.,
Be kind anonymously.",How to Be a Kind Person3," Kindness does not have to be a grand gesture. Often, you can demonstrate kindness for others simply by being conscious of those around you and treating others with respect. Do small things like opening doors for others or greeting people with a smile. By being kind to others through random acts of kindness, you will be making other people feel good and you may also feel happier yourself.Small gestures can mean a great deal to a person that’s having a difficult day. Change the toner in the photocopier because you coworker hates doing it, pay for a friend’s coffee or tell a loved one that they’re important to you today.
Kindness isn’t about grand gestures as much as it’s about thinking of others. Demonstrate your concern for others by treating them with respect.

, It can be easy to be so focused on what you’re doing that you don’t notice when friends seem sad or even depressed. Make a conscious effort to reach out to friends who don’t seem happy and let them know that you care.Send an e-mail, message or text to a friend that seems down and ask how they’re doing. Let them know that you’re there if they need you.
Volunteering is another great way to help yourself while helping others.Consider volunteering for a a non-profit organization to help people (or animals) who are in need of help. For example, you could volunteer for a soup kitchen, become a dog walker for a local animal shelter, or donate your time and talents to a homeless shelter.

, When other people do something nice for you, or show you kindness, return the favor by expressing your gratitude. Saying thank you may not seem like it’s a big deal, but a sincere “thanks” can make someone’s effort feel well worth it. Saying thank you can also improve your relationships and improve your own well-being.Think about how much you appreciate being thanked when you go out of your way for someone.
When someone does something nice for you, it means they were thinking about you and cared enough to put forth the effort. Reciprocate that effort by making sure to show your appreciation.

, Kindness can extend to people you’ve never met. Donating your time or money to a good cause is an excellent way to share kindness with the world and it will likely leave you feeling fulfilled when you’re done.Clean out your closet and donate old clothes to charity.
Give a few dollars to a charitable cause that you believe in.
Raise money for a cause.

, A kind act from a stranger can often have a more significant impact on your day than kindness from close friends and family. Spread kindness in the world by doing something nice for someone you don’t know without looking for recognition.Pay for the coffee of the person behind you at a drive through. This kind gesture can set off a chain reaction of kindness that can permeate throughout the day and a part of the community.
Throw a quarter in someone’s parking meter to prevent them from getting a parking ticket.

Be aware of your fashion sense.,
Don't let hobbies damage your ability to socialize.,
Find a hair style to suit you.,
Use discretion when asking for an invitation to an event you were not originally invited to.,
Don't overstay your welcome.,
Respect the personal space of others.,
Know when to say nothing.,
Know cell phone etiquette.,
Make eye contact.,
Don't be clingy.,
Give fitness a thought.",How to Avoid Common Social Errors," The easiest way to tell is to see what most people are wearing or ask a friend who knows for some fashion advice. (This is if you're just clueless about fashion... if you dress in a different way on purpose then this does not apply.);
, You can be a huge Magic: the Gathering, Role Playing, Anime, Star Trek geek and still be considered completely normal. How? By not letting it restrict your socialization. You need to be able to tell when someone is not a fan of your hobby and when you figure that out (hopefully almost immediately), you avoid talking about it and instead focus on things that other people are interested in.

, Having the wrong hair style can make you look really bad. And people will judge you if you have a really bad hair cut/style. For example, if you have a bowl cut just because you've always had one since you were five years old and you don't know what to do with your hair, ask for some advice or ask your barber/stylist to give you suggestions.

, This one is tricky because you want to invite yourself to events and most of the time that's fine. But sometimes people don't want you along and are too polite to flat out deny you. Consider a few things before you invite yourself, such as who is going, and what the event is. If you're not sure whether or not you'll be appreciated, then ask about it, but don't explicitly ask to be invited (unless you're sure it's ok). If they just forgot to invite you, they will invite you when you just casually ask about the event.

, Adhere to the ""toothbrush rule"". If you are in some one's room/apartment, and they start brushing their teeth or giving you any kind of signal that they're about to go to bed or go out, you should start to make the motions of leaving. For example, getting up and saying ""I should get going now."" They will stop you if they want you to stay. This doesn't apply to people that have no qualms telling you to leave.

, Everyone has his or her own personal space. It might be really close (i.e. inches away from them) or it might be pretty far (i.e. 2 feet away). Whatever it is, if someone invades that space (and it's unwanted), it's very annoying. Of course, you have to use cues to figure out the extent of others' personal space.

, Good ways to know are if the other person isn't making eye contact with you or if the other person isn't giving you verbal prompts such as ""yes, and?"", ""then what"", or ""oh really?"". In these cases, it's probably time to shut up or ask them a question and let someone else talk for a while.

, Turn off your phone's ringer in a theater. If you answer your phone (on vibrate) in a theater, whisper and don't let it last more than 10 seconds. It's best, however, simply not to answer your cell phone in a theater, unless it's an emergency. If you're indoors in a public area, step outside for long calls if possible. If you're in a public area but cannot step out, then keep your voice down.

, Looking at your feet or those of the other person makes you seem insecure. Looking away makes you look distracted or trying to say ""you bore me"". Looking at a females breasts makes you look like a pervert. Don't stare too intensely into someones eyes though, because it's likely to make the person uncomfortable. However this varies in different cultures. In the US and the UK, from .5 to 1.5 seconds is about right. After that, glance down at the table, or at another part of their face (not lower than that!). However, keep your face pointed towards their face.

, Most people hate a clingy person unless they really get along well with them. If the person in question has other groups of friends, give your friend his or her own time to do his or her own thing. Don't monopolize his or her time unless you're sure it's wanted.

, Stay healthy. Being in decent shape will help in many ways. Your health will be better, you'll feel more energetic, you'll look better, you'll fit clothes better, you'll feel more confident. It may also help your body odor, strange as it might seem.

Smile often.,
Project an open posture.,
Make frequent eye contact.,
Don’t fidget.,
Mirror the other person’s movements.",How to Look Approachable1," A warm, inviting smile can put anyone at ease and makes you look like you're having a great time. People will notice your smile and think are friendly, pleasant, and open to having a conversation.Studies have shown that smiling also helps reduce anxiety, blood pressure, and your heart rate, which will put you at ease in social situations, too!, When people are uncomfortable in a situation, they have a tendency to physically close off from those around them. Be mindful of your posture. If you are feeling nervous or are in a bad mood, remind yourself to strand straight, keep your arms at your sides, and lean toward people when they are speaking to you. Reminding yourself to maintain these postures will help improve your mood and will help draw people toward you.Show that you are interested in what others are saying by angling toward them when they are speaking. Adjust your feet, legs, and your body to face the speaker. This shows the speaker that you are actively listening and involved in their story.Don’t fold your arms when you are in social situations. You may be projecting negative cues such as ""I'm too busy"" or ""Leave me alone"" when your arms are in this closed posture. Other people will watch your body for cues, so it's important pay attention to what cues you're displaying.

, In social situations, people will look around the room and will likely begin a conversation with someone if they make eye contact with them. Don’t stare at the floor or at your feet. Look up and be aware of your surroundings to attract the attention of others.


When someone approaches, smile and maintain eye contact throughout the conversation. In a one-on-one conversation, maintain eye contact for periods of 7 to 10 seconds. While in a group conversation, maintain eye contact for periods of 3 to 5 seconds.This simple look will demonstrate that you are trustworthy and interested in the topic., It's okay to feel nervous, bored, or unhappy, but if you want appear approachable, take care not to project negative emotions. Shuffling back and forth, biting your nails, twirling your hair, and other forms of fidgeting can display signs of boredom, stress, or nervousness.Be aware of these habits, and take a few deep breaths when you feel the urge to fidget.


Avoid touching your hand to your face frequently. This can signal that you are feeling anxious.Tapping your feet can signal impatience or boredom. People may feel like you aren't interested in the conversation., When chatting with someone at a party or an event, pay attention to their gestures, posture, and stance and try to emulate them. If that person has an open stance, adopt one as well. If they use lively hand gestures while telling a story, try to do the same. Mirroring a person’s body language can help build trust and establish a connection when used sparingly.

When used appropriately, it can help create a positive rapport and signal to the other person that you like their company.

Think about your relationship with the person before you mirror their body language. Avoid mirroring someone who is your superior. If you mirror your boss’s body language during a meeting, for example, they may see this as impolite and forceful."
"
Keep quiet about your accomplishments.People are already likely aware of the talents, gifts, and education you possess.,
Pay compliments.,
Give others credit.,
Don’t be a know-it-all.,
Be quiet.,
Acknowledge your mistakes.",How to Avoid Coming off As Pretentious1," Do not mention your accomplishments unless someone else asks you about them.


For example, if someone asks you how work is going, you could give a short summary of a current project you are working on, like “I’m getting the store ready for the holidays by setting up some displays.” This sounds much better than, “The regional manager came in last week and said I always do the best job getting my employees to set up the endcaps correctly.” Even if the statement is true, it comes across as bragging and sounding superior.
If someone asks you about your achievements, talk about them briefly. If the person seems interested, you can elaborate. For example, the person you are talking to may be genuinely interested in your invitation to speak at a conference. You could say, “Yes, it’s next month. I’m nervous but very grateful for the opportunity,” and then elaborate on what you plan to talk about. That sounds better than, “I was so pleased to be offered the invitation because I’ll get to be onstage with some of the most important people in my field.” The first example is stating facts and feelings, while the second statement implies how important you think you are.;
, Particularly, compliment others’ great ideas or actions. It shows that you are paying attention to them and are not just focused on your own interests.


For example, you could say, “Aaliyah, I loved what you said in the meeting about reaching out to other departments on this project. I think it was important.”
Complimenting people also makes them feel very good about themselves, and positively reinforces their behavior.Put others in the spotlight. Have them talk about their own accomplishments and praise them for their talents.

, Let others know you didn’t accomplish what you did on your own.First of all, it dispels the myth of a self-made person. Everyone is helped along the way by someone else. Secondly, it makes you sound more humble, and grateful for the help you’ve received.


For example, if someone says, “Your sculpture is amazing! You are so talented!” you could say, “Thanks. I had a great teacher in high school who helped influence my work. I give her a ton of credit.”

, Even if you are an expert in a particular subject, that doesn’t mean that there still isn’t something out there for you to learn. Be open to being taught.


When people offer their ideas, don’t shoot them down because you think you know better. They still may have something to contribute, and may be able to offer a different way to look at a situation. Try saying, “I’ve never thought about it that way before” or “That’s an interesting perspective.”
If you know the person to be wrong about a factual matter, determine if it is necessary to correct them (for example, if you are working on an important project). If it is, back up your correction with necessary research and try saying, “Nancy, I’m so sorry. I don’t want to sound like I’m calling you out, but those earlier numbers you mentioned weren’t correct,” then show the information you have. If you remain polite and humble, you will not seem like a know-it-all.
Keep in mind that different people have different ways of doing things that are not necessarily wrong or right. Raising children is a great example. There are many different ways to raise a child successfully, and what works best for one family may be a complete disaster in another.

, Sometimes people come across as pretentious because they have to share their opinion about everything, and they make their opinion sound superior to other people’s. It is not always necessary to share your opinion, so interject wisely.For example, say you are very health-conscious, and your sister tells you she had fast food for dinner. Instead of telling her how horrible fast food is for her (she probably already knows, anyway), you can ask her a question about her dinner (Did she go out with friends? Where did she eat?) or just change the subject.

, Don’t try to pass the blame onto someone or something else. Own them, apologize if necessary, and move on.


Admitting mistakes shows your willingness to be vulnerable, which people connect with more strongly than a person up on a pedestal. Admitting you were wrong gives other people permission to talk about their screw-ups, as well as helps to build empathy."

Develop a friendly wardrobe.,
Wear clothing that is appropriate for the event you are attending.,
Find the right hairstyle.,
Wear approachable colors.,
Use a name tag.",How to Look Approachable2," Your wardrobe can help make you appear friendly and inviting, and looking presentable can help boost your self-esteem.

Ask a salesperson at a clothing store to help you select clothing options that are well-suited for you and appropriate for your body type. Selecting clothes that are flattering, well-tailored, and versatile will demonstrate to others that you are composed, self-assured, and pleasant to be around.Make sure your clothes are clean and wrinkle-free., Dressing appropriately at events will communicate to others that you are respectful and happy to be there. Be sure your clothing is in good taste. People may be less inclined to approach you if your clothing garners negative attention.


Wearing shorts and sandals, for example, may not be formal enough for a wedding shower. If you are unsure of the formality of a particular event, politely ask the host if there is a dress code.

, Ask a hairstylist what style would work well for you. They will help decide what would work well for your hair texture and face shape. Maintaining a well-groomed appearance can help others notice you and signal that you are collected and outgoing.

, Colors can influence how people perceive and react to you. Wearing blues, greens, and warm earth tones such as light yellow and beige can make a person appear more approachable, reliable, and confident.Individuals who wear red may seem assertive, less approachable, and less friendly than others.

Utilize the colors in your wardrobe project a positive, welcoming personality.

When going in for a job interview or attending a social event, opt for a navy or green outfit to set people at ease.
Accessorize your outfits with calm, friendly tones. Wear a green scarf or jacket when going to a casual brunch with a new group of friends to appear calm and peaceful., If you are at work or are at a business conference, be sure to wear a name tag. People will see the name tag as an invitation to approach you and will be more likely to strike up a conversation. This helps you to project the notion that you are willing, open, and available for conversation or networking."
"
Avoid distractions and interruptions during a conversation.,
Validate the speaker’s feelings.,
Ask questions.",How to Look Approachable3," Listening plays a large role in establishing the quality of your relationships with others and can help convey that you are friendly and approachable. When engaged in a conversation with someone, allow the speaker to complete their thought or story without interruption. Maintain eye contact, smile, and nod to demonstrate that you are listening and focusing on them.People will be more inclined to approach you for a conversation if they feel that you are interested and focused.


Do not check your phone when you are talking to someone. Be polite and make it obvious that you are listening and focusing on the conversation.
Focus on what the person is saying. Don’t drift off into a daydream or be sidetracked by other conversations going on around you., When someone describes a sad or upsetting situation, be empathetic and respond appropriately. Avoid questioning their emotional response and refrain from offering advice unless specifically asked. Sometimes the speaker may wish to express an emotion for support rather than for guidance. Showing support and understanding will make the speaker feel comfortable around you. Others will notice and be more likely to strike up a conversation with you.


If someone tells you that they are upset because their dog is sick, validate their feelings. “I’m so sorry. This must be a really difficult time for you. I understand how upsetting it can be when a pet is unwell.” Show the person that you are supportive, friendly, and that you understand their emotional response., If you don’t understand a person’s point or would like to hear more about their perspective on a certain topic, ask them to clarify or elaborate. Show that you are being attentive to what they are saying and you are interested to hear more. This will make the conversation more pleasant. The speaker and others around you will take note of your attentiveness, making it easier for others to approach you.


It is also useful to ask questions when you know you have a common interest with someone. “Jane told me that you recently traveled to Berlin. I visited Berlin years ago! What was your favorite thing about your trip?” Establishing a common ground can allow the conversation to continue and flourish.

"
"
Practice empathy.,
Listen.,
Treat everyone as an equal.",How to Avoid Coming off As Pretentious2," Empathy is the ability to understand how another person is feeling, the “putting yourself in their shoes” feeling. Imagine yourself as the other person in a particular situation, how you would be feeling, and how you would like someone to treat you.For example, think of sitting near a crying baby on an airplane. It is an annoying noise and it is beginning to stress you out. Now imagine being the parent of the crying baby. The parent knows how frustrated other people are at their child and is doing everything possible to get the baby to stop. How would you feel as the parent, knowing people were getting mad at you and the baby? You might feel stressed out, overwhelmed, or helpless. This is how you develop empathy.

, Spend more time listening than talking.This will help you gain understanding and foster connection with others, rather than bulldoze the conversation with your own points of view.


If you have a hard time not dominating a conversation, practice stepping back and letting others take a turn, before you make your point. Sum up the points you heard: “It sounds like everyone wants to get pizza. I’m good with that. Everyone wants pepperoni?”
Ask questions. Be interested in other people and their lives. Most people love to talk about themselves and appreciate the opportunity to share the things they care about with others.

, You are no better than anyone else. We all have our own gifts, and we all have our own struggles, that we bring to the world. Consider that the person you look down upon likely has a life story you know next to nothing about.


Withhold judgment on other people’s lives and choices. Keep an open mind, and use your empathy skills to try to understand where the person is coming from, and why they would make the choice they did.
For example, perhaps the idiot who cut across a lane of traffic to turn was actually lost and in a hurry. Until you know the whole story, it is unfair to judge.

"
"
Try something before you judge it.,
Have enough understanding of pop culture to have a conversation.,
Use your intelligence and education to help others.,
Use common language.",How to Avoid Coming off As Pretentious3," You may write something off as too “beneath you” to participate it or try, but why not try it before you knock it? You may find that you enjoy yourself. Don’t build a wall between you and something else (not to mention the other people who enjoy the activity) just because you look at it with preconceived notions.


Ask someone who loves the activity you disdain to tell you more about it. You might enjoy the activity more if you understand it or have some background information.
For example, you might dislike football, but you decide to keep an open mind and attend a game. Go with a friend who loves it, who can explain the intricacies of the game to you, and who knows how to enhance the experience -- they might know the best refreshments to order at the game, for example.

, If you normally shun popular culture because it is too “low-brow” for you, find something about it that you are at least minimally interested in so that you can carry on a conversation about it with others.


Follow a professional sports team. Or, at least be aware of how your local team is doing.
See a blockbuster movie.
Read the current “must-read” book that everyone is talking about.
Flip through a celebrity gossip magazine at the grocery store checkout or while waiting at the doctor’s office.

, Give back your time and talents to a cause you believe in. Your areas of expertise could be useful to many people.


Volunteer. Maybe you could teach your area of expertise to members of your community at a free class at your community center. Or consider donating your skill set to nonprofit organizations who could use your help. For example, if you’re a web designer, volunteer your time at a nonprofit you believe in and help update their webpages.
Many volunteer opportunities will expose you to different ideas and people, which will help you be less pretentious by becoming more open-minded and less judgmental., There is a time and a place for academic, professional language, but when you are in more casual settings, consider adopting a more everyday way of speaking. Big words can be fun to learn, but you risk alienating others by using them around people who might not understand them.


Consider that simple, straightforward speech often does the job just as well or better than more difficult words that risk the listener’s confusion. For example, “Refrain from grousing” and “Don’t complain” mean essentially the same thing, but the first is far more likely to make someone head to the dictionary.

Give a head bow or a curtsy.,
Choose the proper greeting for emperors, kings, and queens.,
Call princes and princesses by the proper title.,
Select the right term for dukes and duchesses.,
Make sure you know the proper titles for lower ranking royalty.",How to Address Royalty1," When meeting a royal person, it's important you offer a bow or a curtsy. This is considered a formality, especially when meeting a member of the British royal family.If you're male, you should do a neck bow. This simply means bowing by nodding your head.
If you're female, do a small curtsy. This means dipping your body downward slightly by bending your knees.;
, These are among the highest ranking types of royalty, so be sure to address them properly. Emperors, kings, and queens should all be addressed differently.When addressing an emperor, you would address him or her as ""His or Her Imperial Majesty, Emperor of (Name of Country).""
When addressing a king, say, ""His Majesty, the King."" When addressing a queen, say, ""Her Majesty, the Queen.""

, As these are generally the second highest ranking royals, be sure to address them properly. Princes and princesses must be addressed differently.For a prince, say, ""His Royal Highness, Prince of (Name of Country).""
For a princess, say, ""Her Royal Highness, Princess of (Name of Country).""

, There are also formal titles required here. When meeting a duke or a duchess, a formal greeting is necessary.For a duke, say, ""His Grace, the Duke of (Name of Country).""
For a duchess, say, ""Her Grace, the Duchess of (Name of Country).""

, There are various other forms of lower ranking royalty, such as barons, knights, marquees, earls, and countesses. There are proper titles for these people as well that must be used when you address them.Some titles are simple. For example, a knight is simply addressed as ""Sir"" followed by his name, and a knight's wife is addressed as ""Lady,"" followed by her name. The same is true for baronets and their wives.
Royal people that fall between knights and baronets and positions like king and queen are usually addressed as, ""The Right Honorable,"" followed by their name. A marquee, for examples, would be addressed as ""The Right Honorable.""

Use the title “The Reverend” on formal envelopes.,
Include degrees for any pastors with doctorates.,
Address the spouse separately with any appropriate titles.,
Find out if the congregation is historically African-American.,
Factor in military rank when addressing a formal letter.",How to Address a Pastor and His Wife1," Write “The Reverend” followed by the pastor’s full name on the exterior envelope. This formal title is appropriate for both Protestant and Catholic denominations of Christianity. This would be the most typical way of addressing the pastor, if you were inviting them to an event or sending a formal request, for example.If your pastor’s name is Mark Smith, you would address your envelope “The Reverend Mark Smith.”
Gender does not matter. The title is the same. Jill Poe would be “The Reverend Jill Poe.”
If both people in the couple are pastors and share a last name, you address them both as “The Reverends” and then the last name. So pastors Joe and Sally Carr would be “The Reverends Carr.”;
, List the pastor’s degree at the end of the name, or add “Dr.” after the religious title. This ensures that you give the pastor their full formal title based on their vocation and education. This applies to degrees for Doctors of Ministry, Doctors of Theology, Doctors of Divinity and most other applicable religious doctorates.If your pastor Mark Smith has a Ph.D, you would address the formal envelope “The Reverend Dr. Mark Smith” or “The Reverend Mark Smith, Ph.D.” Both are equally acceptable.

, Address the spouse of the pastor after the pastor on the envelope, unless the spouse is in the military. If you don’t know of any special titles, use Mr., Mrs., or Ms., whichever is most appropriate. For a male pastor with a wife, you would write, “The Reverend and Mrs. Mark Smith.” If they don’t share a last name, you would write, “The Reverend Mark Smith and Ms. Molly Doe.”For a female pastor with a husband, you would write, “The Reverend Zoe Deen and Mr. John Deen.” If they don’t share a last name, you would write, “The Reverend Zoe Deen and Mr. John Canton.If the pastor's spouse has another title that is more appropriate than Mr., Mrs., or Ms. you should use that title, instead. This might be the case when the spouse has a doctorate.For example, for a pastor with a spouse who is a doctor, you would write, “The Reverend Jim Price and Dr. Samantha Price” or “The Reverend Maxine Su and Dr. James Su.”

, In many black churches, the wife of the pastor is known as the “First Lady.” You should address her as such after the pastor on your formal correspondence, if this applies. Consult with a member of the congregation to see if the church uses this custom before using this title. There is no such corresponding title if the pastor is a woman and her husband is a man.A male pastor and his wife in such a church would be addressed, “The Reverend Ronnie Franklin and First Lady Linda Franklin.”

, Place the spouse before the pastor on the envelope if they are member of the armed services. Use the person’s military title as well as the branch of the military they serve in. A member of the military, whether active or retired, has higher social standing than a civilian, which is the reason they appear first.For example, you would address a pastor and his wife who is a colonel as follows, “Colonel Jane Wilton, US Army and The Reverend Max Wilton.”

Respect others if you seek respect for yourself.,
Learn which qualities others admire in you.,
Discover which qualities are less than admirable.,
Identify the qualities you admire in others.,
Stick to your morals and values in any situation.,
Evaluate your external appearance.",How to Avoid Giving the Wrong Impression," The old adage, “Do unto others as you would have them do unto you” holds true in any societal situation. Remember that you get what you give--you don’t respect or give others the benefit of the doubt, they will return the favor.


Never assume you know what someone is facing. Whether it’s a run in with an aggressive driver on the road or a friend who constantly appears to be upset about a situation at home, never get annoyed or dismissive with someone because you can’t empathize. Give friends a pass when they seem to be upset (even if you don’t think their situation would be upsetting to you) and take a deep breath when someone seems rude in society. You never know what the people you encounter are truly trying to manage.
Deliver respect even if you aren’t getting it back. Want to appear to be someone with class and dignity? Rise above situations by treating everyone with respect. Not only will you come out smelling like a rose, others will find this trait to be admirable and possibly infectious.;
, Develop and possibly exploit the characteristics that your friends and family members find to be endearing. Also, find out what got you hired at work--professional attributes are also a great way to find out what makes you accepted and possibly respected amongst your peers.


Identify at least three qualities that people love about you. Whether it’s your warm smile or generous spirit or your unwavering determination, focus on three solid traits to develop.
Make a concerted effort to tap into these qualities as often as possible. For example, if your smile is what attracts people most, make an effort to smile more in social situations (provided the opportunity is available) or be available to help a friend if generosity is a common theme.

, As you develop positive characteristics, it wouldn’t hurt to take your “medicine” and find out the bitter with the sweet. Ask trusted resources which of your qualities are annoying or even somewhat mean-spirited. You may not realize that you give off a certain impression or that some of your actions or comments are taken more to heart.


Identify situations where these unfavorable qualities may rear their ugly heads. Perhaps when you feel pressure or stress or even if when you are bored, figure out when some of your less than desirable qualities appear.
Consider specific encounters where you may have led with one of your less than attractive qualities. Whether it was during a stressful meeting at work or a first date, you may be wondering why you didn’t get a promotion or a second date--these qualities may be to blame.
Develop a way to replace the undesirable qualities with a positive trait. Do you scowl when being criticized or roll your eyes when others may be moving too slowly? Think about ways you can revise that behavior and replace it with something else. For example, if you are a big eye roller, instead try smiling and shaking your head. You can still express annoyance but with a gentler less overtly annoyed behavior.

, If you are looking to make a certain kind of impression (more professional, funnier etc.) think of someone you admire and the qualities they possess.


Avoid completely copying someone else’s behavior or mannerisms. Be true to yourself and don’t try to clone someone else to help you achieve a certain goal. Instead, identify a few traits you admire and think about ways you could integrate those traits into your style.
Only consider traits that would be intuitive for you to integrate into your life. If being a fabulous shopper is something you would love to be, but are trying to make it on a budget, find other traits within this person instead. Also, don’t go against your inherent personality in an effort to adopt traits. Find something that would be a natural fit in in order to avoid looking like you are simply trying to be someone you are not.

, Even though you may want to look more like a daredevil (if that’s the impression you want to give) or aggressive in business, find other ways to get your point across without abandoning your homegrown morals and values instilled upon you as a child.


Don’t behave a certain way that could get you into trouble. Perhaps you want to hang out with the “popular” kids and want to make the kind of impression that would get you accepted by the group. However, if it means lying or stealing (if that’s what the kids are into) reconsider ways to be accepted by this group (or look for a different group).
Stick to your principles, even if they may seem to be unpopular. If picking on another person is what’s considered to be cool, resist joining in and perhaps demonstrate how people should really treat each other. Give off the impression that you are above the behavior and perhaps influence others around you.

, Most people actually do judge a book by its cover and if your “cover” is giving off the impression opposite of what you desire, its time for a makeover.


Consider how people treat you before they get to know you. Do they approach you with caution or speak down to you? First impressions starts with your appearance. Perhaps you love punk rock and brash styles, but deep down inside you want people to take you seriously. Will you achieve the level of respect you desire by dressing this way (even though its how you feel most comfortable or expressive)?
Dress for how you want to be perceived, not how you think people currently see you. If you want to be give off the impression you are a professional, an artist or an adult (for example) start dressing like one. You may think that since people treat you one way, you must dress or be styled in that manner. The only one who can change other’s impression is you.
Find a style role model you can use for inspiration. Like the way one of your coworkers is treated and notice that his/her style consists of classic lines and subdued colors? You don’t have to copy the style verbatim but instead weave elements of the style into your own appearance to help you give off a similar impression.

Begin the letter with a proper salutation.,
Address the envelope correctly.,
Include the proper signature.",How to Address Royalty2," If you're writing a letter to royalty, your salutation needs to be slightly more formal than a regular letter. Your salutation should have two lines.On the first line, begin with ""Unto"" and then include the appropriate title of address. For example, if you're writing to the queen of England, your first line would read, ""Unto Her Majesty, the Queen of England.""
The second line should state who you are. A letter to royalty should not withhold the letter writer's name until the signature. If you have any titles, include them here. For example, ""Lord John Smith of Scotland sends greetings.""

, How you address the envelope is also important. Addressing the envelope in an improper fashion can show disrespect. You have to use royal titles on the envelope as well. Do not simply write the name of the queen. Write the title instead. For example, write ""Her Majesty the Queen"" on the envelope., You want to add some formality when signing your name. A regular signature, where you would use a term like ""sincerely,"" is not appropriate when addressing royalty.For high ranking officials, like kings, queens, princes, princesses, and emperors, use something very formal before your signature. Usually, you would write something like, ""I have the honor to remain Your Majesty's most humble and obedient servant.""
For other forms of royalty, ""Yours faithfully"" is usually sufficient.

Follow rules regarding physical touch.,
Opt for formal attire when meeting royalty.,
Stay somewhat formal in your interactions.",How to Address Royalty3," You do not want to offend a king or queen by touching them. You should always wait for royalty to touch you first.Do not attempt a handshake until a person of royal ranking has reached out to you.
Avoid touching a person of royal ranking during conversation.

, Dress your best if you know you are meeting royalty. Formal wear can be seen as a gesture of respect.Avoid things like sleeveless clothing or casual wear.
Dress your best. Bring out your fanciest clothing, and make sure any outfit you choose is clean and free of stains, rips, or holes.

, You do not want to come off as too informal when meeting royalty. Avoid addressing people of royal ranking by their first name or nickname. You should also avoid laughing or making jokes. Always make eye contact when someone of royal ranking is speaking. You want to make sure you're giving royalty your full attention."

Use “Pastor” to address Protestant pastors.,
Use “Reverend” to address Catholic priests of all denominations.,
Use casual abbreviations if desired.,
Address the spouse with their normal title and full name.",How to Address a Pastor and His Wife2," Pair “Pastor” with the pastor’s full name for leaders of Protestant denominations in everyday correspondence. Casual communication such as emails and quick handwritten notes don’t require the etiquette and formality of event invitations. This is a polite and effective way to speak with your pastor.If you were writing a casual thank you note, you might begin, “Pastor Molly Mitchell.”

, Use the title “Reverend” with the priest’s full name in informal correspondence. This will ensure that you’re showing respect, but this more casual form of communication doesn’t require the ceremonial “the” that appears on formal envelopes.If writing an email, you might start, “Reverend John Smith.”
There are fewer rules regarding very casual correspondence. If you know the priest well, it may make sense to use the more casual address “Father.” So for example, “Father John Smith.”Marriage is uncommon in the Catholic Church. If you’re in doubt as to the faith leader’s denomination, but know they are married, assume they are Protestant., If it suits you and the message you’re writing, you can abbreviate reverend to “Rev.” and pastor to “Pr.” Pair these abbreviations only with the pastor or priest’s last name. This is a very casual way of addressing the clergy, and it might make sense if you were sending a quick follow up email about a previous matter, for example.For example, you could address Reverend Max Dunt as “Rev. Dunt.” Similarly, you could address Pastor Lindy Reese “Pr. Reese.”

, Use abbreviated everyday titles, such as Mr., Mrs., Ms., and Dr. with the spouse’s full name. There is no need to include academic degrees after the name or branches of the military, if applicable.For example, you would address a Protestant pastor and his wife of the same last name as “Pastor Mike Huff and Mrs. Rita Huff.” If Mrs. Huff were a doctor, you would address them as “Pastor Mike Huff and Dr. Rita Huff.”
If the congregation were one that uses the “First Lady” terminology, you might address them as “Pastor Mike Huff and First Lady Rita Huff.”

Address Protestant pastors as “Pastor” with their last name.,
Address Catholic priests as “Father” with their last name.,
Use the spouse’s typical title with their last name.,
Switch to a first-name basis if requested.",How to Address a Pastor and His Wife3," In person, it is best to keep things respectful but casual. Call your Protestant pastor “Pastor” and then their last name.For example, you could call a pastor named Jill Shannon “Pastor Shannon.”
Some congregations are more familial and casual than others. If this seems like it applies to your situation, you might try calling your pastor “Pastor” and their first name (For example, “Pastor Jill”) or even simply “Pastor.” You can ask your pastor what they like best.

, Call the priest “Father” and then their last name in casual settings such as after mass. This is an informal greeting that still respects the priest’s authority.For example, you would address a priest named Don Everton as “Father Everton.”
Some parishes like to keep things very casual, in which case the priest may simply go by “Father” and his first name (for example, “Father Don”) or even simply “Father.” You can ask your priest what he prefers to be called to avoid any confusion.

, Address the spouse of the pastor as Mr., Mrs., Ms., or Dr. and their last name, whichever is most appropriate. This keeps things personal but respectful, particularly if you don’t know them well.


For example, you might call a pastor’s husband, “Dr. Johnson,” if he is a dentist. Similarly, you might call a pastor’s wife who does not share his last name, “Ms. Wells.”
If the congregation is one that uses the term “First Lady” outlined in part one, use the title with only her last name. Pastor Michael Jones’s wife Donna would be addressed, “First Lady Jones.”

, It is most important to show the pastor respect as a valued community member, which means calling them whatever they prefer to be called. If your pastor requests that you call them by their first name, feel free to do so. It is then acceptable to apply the same rule to their spouse, as they have indicated the level of formality they prefer.

Open and hold doors.,
Offer your seat to someone else.,
Pay attention when someone speaks.,
Consider the other person's thoughts and opinions.,
Keep all of the promises and oaths that you make.,
Keep chivalry and gender separate.,
Help people with their coats.",How to Act Chivalrous," When people speak of modern chivalry, door-holding is often the immediate thought that pops into their heads. While holding doors open has become something of a cliché, it is still a valid expression of chivalry in modern times. You should not go out of your way--such as running ahead of somebody--just to open a door for them, as that can be seen as rude. However, when you open a door and someone nearby is about to use the door as well, be respectful and hold it open for them.;
, The term chivalry often conjures up images of a gentleman pulling out a dinner table seat for the lady. However, this act of chivalry can be applied in a broader context. For example, if you are on the subway and there are no available seats, offer up your seat to someone else, like an elderly person, pregnant person, disabled person, or a parent with children.

, Chivalry can be manifested in the form of putting someone else before yourself. There's nothing wrong with wanting to speak out and be heard, but try to listen and pay attention when someone speaks to you. Truly listening to someone can be a simple but effective way to show them respect.

, At one time, chivalry was thought to mean that men would have to take charge of everything, allowing the woman to take a backseat. Nowadays, a man should not only allow a woman to voice her opinions, but he should ask for them. On a more general level, when participating in an activity that involves people other than yourself, ask for their opinions when making a decision.

, One of the foundations for chivalry is honor, and that means that you must not break your word. If you're asked to make a promise, do not agree unless you are willing to see it through. This applies to all people, not just women.

, Women, men, and nonbinary people can both be chivalrous and receive acts of chivalry. Chivalry is different from benevolent sexism (the idea that women are delicate flowers who must be protected). To see if you are accidentally being a benevolent sexist, ask yourself if you would treat a man the same way you'd treat a woman, and if you'd be okay with a woman treating you this way. If so, you're doing well.

, Offer to help them remove their coats when entering a building, and to put them back on when leaving.

Respect people in positions of authority.",How to Be Respected," Practice good grooming and dress neatly. Clothing doesn’t need to be expensive but it should be laundered and in good repair, showing that you care about this aspect of yourself. Take care of your health and your teeth. Your smile will show to others that you enjoy your own company, and theirs too.This isn't superficial at all. If you want to be treated with respect, then you have to look like you put time and effort into your appearance.
If you show up to work wearing a stained sweatshirt and dirty sneakers, people will be less likely to take you seriously.
Even if you're hanging out in a more casual environment, put a little extra time into your appearance. You shouldn't get overdressed to go to trivia night at the local bar, but putting in the extra 15 minutes to shave your face or to tuck in your shirt can help you command respect.;
, If you want to be respected, then you want people to turn to you for guidance for how to act in the world. You can't be acting in a disrespectful, rude, or obnoxious manner if you want other people to follow your lead. Whatever you do, remind yourself that people are watching and that you should be setting a good example if you really want to be a role model. You don't have to be perfect, but you should generally act in an admirable manner.


When another person imitates you, it is a sign of respect.
If someone else has set a good example, let them know how much you appreciate it by your own actions (and words too).
Be a good role model at home, work, and in social situations. Wherever you are, there is always an opportunity to show others how to live with self-respect and how to honor the dignity of others.

, Don't just join in with the latest craze just because others may be following the popular style. Respect yourself by making your own choice, this will bring respect from others. If you're unsure of what to do or what you value, and you're looking for someone with authority to guide you, always remember who you are, and always ask yourself if you agree with what this person says and does. Sometimes, it is easier said than done: sometimes you feel lost and are not sure what you want or what you believe. If you want to be respected, though, you have to be comfortable with following the beat of your own drummer.


You may have to make the tough decisions when no one else is willing to do it.
If you're a follower, then you won't be respected as much as if you're a leader who occasionally makes mistakes.
Determine what your core values are and stick to them.

, Stay focused on people rather than objects that may be lost or destroyed; people are so much more important and our true value is not what we have, it is the person we are inside that others will respect. But in the same vein, pay attention to the fact that while materialism is not all of life, it is part of it. We all need things to survive, and while we always must remember that things are not everything and others aren't to be judged just on what they have, we must also keep track of our things and take care of them, conserve them and expect respect for our things from others.


Just don't get it in your head that things are everything. If you're obsessed with amassing as many possessions as you can, you won't be able to focus on growing as a person and building relationships.

, Always act with a purpose. When you set your mind on doing something, think about it, plan it as best as you can, and then just do it. Don't wait forever, don't let other people do your job for you, and don't get yourself into a loop of endless planning and worrying about it. People respect action, and equally don't respect procrastination. Don't put off until tomorrow what you can do today, no matter how unpleasant it may be.


Though it may be more pleasant to spend hours browsing YouTube instead of studying for that test or getting that project done, in the long run, doing the work that is in front of you will make you feel more accomplished and will help you succeed.

, Notice the events happening around you and also the events happening around the world, be they in the field of movies, entertainment, sports or something else. This way, you will be comfortable when people talk about the current trending issues. Having a good knowledge of the subject matter will attract others' attention. If you want to be a good role model, then you can't only focus on your own narrow world, but think about the world at large and consider all of the different perspectives out there. This will make you more knowledgeable and open-minded and will help you command respect.


Even if you don't like certain topics that are pervasive in society, such as politics, religion or sports, try to keep a very general awareness that allows you to ask the opinions of others who do follow such things with passion. They'll appreciate the opportunity to talk their talk, you'll learn more about them. You may never agree but you can listen and acknowledge the other person's interests.
The more you know, the more people will come to you for advice and the more they will ask for your opinion. If people think they can always come to you because you know at least a little bit about everything, then you will command their respect even more.

, Say positive things about others whenever possible, but be sincere - people can recognize the difference between true interest and forced flattery. You don't have to sound as PG as your grandmother, but you should avoid cursing up a blue streak, bad mouthing every person in your office, and generally saying negative and offensive things.


If you do end up cursing, that's fine. Just make sure to excuse yourself and apologize for cursing.
If you're one of those people who tend to have enraged and curse-filled outbursts, try to walk away when you know you're going to have a cursing spell.

, If you don't have faith in yourself, no one else will. Many people will test you, and poke your insecurities. No matter what they say, if you have confidence in yourself and your worth, their disrespectful behavior will go away because they realize that they cannot intimidate you. And even if their disrespectful attitude doesn't stop, you will at least be able to ignore it and maintain your inner peace. Remember that you do not need the acknowledgement of other people to prove your self worth; only you can do that.


You can project confidence through body language. Stand tall, look ahead of you instead of at your feet, and don't fidget or act jittery, or you'll look insecure.
Walk in to a room like you belong there.
Speak slowly and loudly enough for everyone to hear.
Being confident doesn't mean being perfect. In fact, knowing your flaws and working to address them will make you even more confident.

, It is easy to point out the downside of a situation, but if you make the effort to overcome your obstacles through constructive thinking, taking decisive action and facing the problems head on, you can lead happier lives and be an encouragement to others. If you're an optimistic person, people will also want to be around you more, and will be more likely to respect you.


Find ways to assist people who need help and your own troubles will seem less overwhelming, and you'll feel better for doing it! Volunteering is one possibility. But so is dropping in on a lonely neighbor, calling a long lost relative or helping your children build something in the backyard.
Nobody respects a person who whines or complains all the time. Keep as many of your negative feelings to yourself as you can.

, Don't make promises you know you can't keep, or you are unsure you'll be able to keep. It is much more respectable (and more difficult) to just say ""No, I can't do that,"" or even ""I don't want to do that."" This is where you have to respect yourself and your own will, and make it clear to others in a polite and assertive way. And when you do make a promise, keep it. People won't respect you if they think you're flaky, unreliable, and generally not a person they can depend on.


Sticking to your word is important not only in a professional setting, but also with your friends and family. You don't want your loved ones to lose respect for you because you keep letting them down.

, This is the easiest way to command the respect of others. Whether you're really good at your job, an amazing tennis player, a killer dancer, or an impressive painter, if you have a talent or a knack for something that other people can see and appreciate, you'll be much more likely to earn their respect. Of course, truly excelling at something can take a lifetime, but even making the effort to devote some time and effort to it every day will inspire awe and respect in people.


Obviously, you shouldn't try to get good at something just so people will respect you. But being good at something and caring about it definitely helps.

, It's okay to make mistakes; everybody makes them. However, you should still remember that you are the final judge of everything that you say and do, and be ready to face up to your mistakes, learn from them and move on. You may think that people will only respect you if you look flawless and like you've never made a mistake in your life; in fact, people will admire your ability to admit that you screwed up, and will see you as more human and down to earth.This also means apologizing to people when it's necessary. If you've hurt someone, suck up your pride and say you're sorry for your actions.

, Clearly communicate what you are willing to accept and what the consequences for trespassing of these boundaries are. Do what you announced to do (or not to do) every time the trespassing happens. You don't want to be known for letting people walk all over you simply because it was easier than putting up a fight. Know what your limits really are and don't compromise unless it's absolutely necessary.


For example, if you want to go out to meet friends with your partner, inform them of the time and that you will leave at this time; whether they are ready or not. If your partner is not ready to go, leave the house without them. Do not let them call you back or change your plans in any way. Do not try to justify your actions, and refuse to accept blame. If at all, tell them that you informed them of the consequences and they are only suffering consequences that could have easily be avoided if they had played by the rules.

, Keep your home and surroundings clean and well kept. Your neighbors will respect you and the neighborhood will be a better place for everyone. Treating others with respect is the most important thing to do; if you treat someone with respect, they'll treat you with respect. Keep your car clean, your school or work materials organized, and your desk clean, and people will see that you put time and effort into your belongings.


Also, be aware of where your stuff is. If you're the guy who loses your sunglasses or phone every month, people will think you're irresponsible.

, If you want people to respect you, then you can' t give in to them all the time. You don't want to develop the reputation of the boss who will let his employees get away with anything, the parent or teacher who is a complete pushover, or the friend who will let anyone borrow twenty bucks without ever asking for it. It is definitely unpleasant to say no to the things you really don't want to do, but once you get in the habit of turning down unreasonable requests, your life will get much easier.


People will respect you more if they see that you have your own priorities and that you won't just drop everything to help them.
Doing favors for a friend or coworker isn't necessarily a bad thing; just make sure that the favor-giving isn't one-sided though.
When you say no, don't apologize or ramble on too much about why you can't do a certain thing. Say no, give a simple reason, or offer an alternative solution. Keeping it short and sweet will keep you from giving in or sounding wishy washy.

, If you really have respect for yourself, then you don't want to end up in the hot tub of someone you don't actually know wearing nothing but reindeer antlers. Drinking a little can be fun, but keep it to a reasonable level so that other people see that you care about keeping your health, dignity, and memory intact. If people see you as someone who stumbles around incoherently as soon as he hits a bar, then they'll think you don't really value yourself.


It's okay to let loose a little bit, but giving up all control is another thing.

, If you want to respect yourself, then you can't be too nice to people who are putting you down, acting ridiculous, or asking you to do things that are compromising. It's easier to be nice to everyone and to get along with everyone 100% of the time, but that won't get people to respect you. If you want people to respect you, then you have to stand up for yourself when you've been wronged, and to avoid taking crap from people, even if it may be the easier option.


If people know you stick up for yourself when it's needed, they will respect you more and will back off.

, This is another classic trait of a person who doesn't respect himself. Women especially are prone to apologizing repeatedly when they've done nothing wrong. Don't apologize to your boss for not taking on eight more hours of work the day before Thanksgiving; don't apologize to your friend for not being able to loan her $300; don't apologize to your boyfriend for stating your point of view. The takeaway is: do not apologize if you've done nothing wrong.


Apologizing all the time for no reason will make you look weak and not worthy of respect.

, If you want to respect yourself, then you should know how much you're worth, whether it's as a member of your company, a member of your school's debate team, or as a member of your two-person relationship. Remember how amazing you are, how much value you are adding to a situation, and remind yourself of all of the reasons that people should be happy to have you on their team or by their side. Don't let people make you feel like you're worth less than you really are, and if you don't feel valued where you are, try to find an alternative place.


This is especially true for the workplace. If you've been putting in extra hours and extra work at your company for a long time but have gotten no recognition for it, it's time to stop waiting around and talk to your boss about it.

, Of course, if you're a mother, a teacher, or in a position where other people depend on you, it's impossible to be completely selfish or to always put yourself in the #1 position. Still, you should aim to look out for yourself before you think of strangers, friends, co-workers, or other people who also want the same thing. This doesn't mean you shouldn't be generous, but it does mean that you shouldn't put everyone else's needs above your own.


If people see you as the kind of person who puts him or herself last, then you won't be respected. People will think they can walk all over you.

, Open, warm and acknowledging greetings are appreciated and returned by others. A positive and uplifting greeting makes each person feel wonderful and if you can also manage to make a compliment, it personalizes your attention and makes them feel special. Charisma is in large part acknowledging the worth of another person and helping them to feel good about themselves.


If someone does not reciprocate or acknowledge your greeting, give that person the benefit of the doubt. Be polite. It is possible that they may be deeply absorbed in thought or worried about something, and as a result failed to acknowledge you.
The same goes for a lukewarm response to you––don't take it personally. Many people are shy, poorly trained in good manners or even overawed. Give them the space to thaw; most will come round when they realize you don't hold anything against them.

, Bullies are not respected because they don't show respect. Allow people to keep their dignity. Bullies are incapable of showing respect because they typically do not even respect themselves, and/or may not know the definition of respect. And intimidating others to get what you want from life is a fast road to loneliness and being ostracized.


Don't tease people. While it may seem like fun and while you don't mean it, people can really feel offended by teasing that pokes at the heart of something they care about or stand for. It soon turns into disrespect, especially if you insist you're just joking when they ask you to stop, and you don't., In turn, deal with bullies in a respectful manner, so as to disarm them of the one thing they really want––your weaknesses revealed. If they take something from you, start to tease you, or try to treat you like less than dirt, say something like: ""May I please have that back? By the way, that's a cool bike"". Staying polite and not getting flustered will easily throw a bully off guard. Don't shower them with compliments, as once you lose your unpredictability, they will take advantage of that.


Simply keep it a short, nice phrase and then be on your way or back to your work.

, Don't prejudge people, and be pleasant to everyone. Even if you realize someone is a jerk, remain civil and have class; you don't need to stoop to their demoralizing level and play their game. People around you will respect your ability to stay above it all more than bad mouthing or confronting them in a mean way. People will be more likely to respect you if they see that you're open-minded and free from bias.


Judging people will often do nothing more than reveal your own insecurities.

, If you're strident, always presenting your point of view loudly and refuting anyone else's version of events and life in general, you'll be viewed as a boor. Few people can stand the person who hogs the limelight constantly and refuses to acknowledge that other people have a say too. Stay cool and if something does fire your passion, share this by all means but acknowledge that your point of view is but one of many.


Having had a hard life is not an excuse to abuse or take advantage of other people. Bear in mind that most people you meet have faced battles of one sort of other in their own lives and may well be experiencing problems right now too. Seek help for emotional hurt that is eating you up so that you can lead your life as you want it to be, and not according to a past you're still trying to defeat.

, People do not appreciate it when you act superior to them. Once again, listen and respect their opinions, even though these may be different from your own. Remind yourself that the wisest people in the world are those who acknowledge how little they really do know, for there is so much yet to discover.


If you do catch yourself acting like a know-it-all, use humor to make light of it, and say something simple like: ""Sorry, I seem to have gotten a bit too passionate about this topic. Obviously I care about it but I've been rude talking so much. Sorry! Please let me know what you think of this matter. I am a good listener you know!""

, If you really want to respect people, then you can't go around spreading their gossip to anyone who will listen. If you have a reputation for being a blabbermouth, people won't respect you and they won't tell you the juiciest information. Instead, take the information in and don't share it; this will make people more likely to come to you in the future and will respect you as a person who knows when to keep his mouth shut.


Don't try to gossip as a way of getting popular. Sure, it'll make people want to hear what you have to say more, but that doesn't necessarily mean they will actually like you more.

, As the principal in Eastbound & Down says to one of his rebellious teachers, ""I don't think you understand the employer-employee relationship."" Though this is meant to be funny, you don't want to be the person who doesn't respect his boss, his landlord, his mechanic, his teacher, or anyone in a position of authority higher than you. This doesn't mean that you should sit quietly if you feel that someone is treating you poorly, but it also doesn't mean that you should disregard your boss like he's just one of your annoying friends. However, if you think that an authority figure is treating you poorly, write him/her a letter of protest and stay polite. You will probably win, providing that you aren't boisterous.


Respecting people in positions of authority will make people more likely to respect your position. If you show a complete disregard for the rules, people won't think very highly of you.
It is important that you ""recognize"" authority, not ""revere"" authority. Recognizing authority means that you acknowledge the authority of superior figures and obey their rules, but will not suck it up and endure it if they treat you poorly. Revering authority, however, means that you think that your authority figures are perfect and won't make any mistakes, so in front of people of higher authority than you, you will always put yourself last. Always recognize authority, but never, ever revere authority.

Know when to use your handshake.,
Be the first to extend your hand.,
Extend your right hand straight before the handshake.,
Take the other person's hand in a firm but not rock-hard clasp.,

When you are introduced to someone
When you say goodbye to someone
At the beginning or the end of a business, social, church, or other meeting
Whenever it seems appropriate within a business context, such as sealing a deal.;
, This makes a strong, lasting impression on the person at the receiving end. It is also about control; by offering your hand first, you are leading the way. This applies to both men and women; don't shy away for reasons of being coy or putting yourself down.


The only time that you should not seek to be so affable as to offer to shake first is where there is an authority structure in place that should be adhered to. For example, if there is a more senior or higher-ranked person in a social gathering, work or business context, follow the lead of the higher ranked person (President, Governor-General, CEO etc.).

, Do not have your palm facing either up or down; the palm should meet with the palm of the other person.


The exception to using the right hand is if you don't have one, if it is paralyzed or otherwise seriously injured.

, Make sure that the web located between your thumb and fingers meets the web of the other person's hand.

, Do not roll it sideways for the handshake. Keep the fingers together with the thumb up and open.

If such a sign is there, the person may have recently removed his or her wedding ring. Some married people use this trick to appear single so they can pick up dates when they are away. However, the wedding ring tan line could also mean that the person is recently divorced or separated., Check out the car the person drives. Is it a station wagon, a minivan, or an SUV? These could be signs the person has a family.Think about other behavioral signs of being single.


For example, most single guys cook for themselves or go out to eat a lot. Ask him what he cooked for dinner and the recipe, or ask him for the best places to eat., Clues to a person's marital status can be found in what they say. How much have they divulged about their lives? Do they talk about someone often that might be their spouse? One key thing to listen for is how they spend their free time. Single people have very different lives than people who are married or who have families. Ask the person what they did over the weekend. Did they go out with friends, go to a bar, a concert, or on a day trip to the city? Or did they sit around the house, have dinner with known married friends, or go to the zoo? The details of how the person spends their free time can help provide important clues.


Who does the person talk about spending their time with? Is it always their parents, siblings, or cousins? Does he or she spend every weekend with a group of friends? This might point to a person being single.

, Single people have the luxury of going out on a whim, grabbing drinks after work, or meeting for dinner on the weekends. People who are married and who have families do not have the same kind of independence. They may occasionally meet with friends, but most of the time they will go home to their families, or bring their spouses along.

, Social media is a great way to determine if someone is married or not. Look at the person's Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram account. Sites like Facebook lists relationship status, and most social media sites allow the posting of pictures. Look for pictures of the person with someone romantically. How recent are the photos? Sometimes people leave up exes on their profile, but if it's recent, they might be involved.


Is the person's profile notably bare? Does he have a profile picture? Can you find any photos of him and a potential spouse together buried deep in his list of photos? Does he even have social media accounts? Bare or lack of social media might point to something else going on.Do an online search of his name. See if he has social media accounts if you aren't connected with them. See if his name comes up on any websites, like a company website.

, If your new love interest seems to always pay for everything you do in cash, it may because he or she doesn't want the spouse to see the charges on the credit card bills or debit card statements. In today's world, most people pay with things, especially meals, with credit cards. If every date is paid for in cash, this could be a red flag.Some people do carry cash around to pay for cheaper transactions, such as movie tickets and fast food meals. Other people who are financially well off may carry around hundreds of dollars in cash. Most people, however, generally use a mixture of debit cards, credit cards, and cash.

, People who are serious about the person they are dating or who are serious about the budding serious relationship will be willing to extend the date past 10 p.m. Occasionally, they may need to be home at an early hour, like on weekday nights. Weekends, however, should open up the schedule for later dates.Can he only see you between the hours of 6 p.m. and 9:45? If so, then it may be because he has to get home to his wife and family in a reasonable time frame. It's okay if this happens once in a while, but if he always says he has to get back home because of a big meeting the next morning or an early flight, then he may just be making excuses.

, Have you been to the person's house? If you've been dating for a few months and haven't seen the person's home, that may be a cause for concern. Listen for constant, flimsy excuses: his place is too messy, or your place is so nice. If you always go back to your place and have no idea where the other person lives, then you might should worry.Find a reason to go back to his home. If he consistently refuses to let you see where he lives, he may be married.

, People who are cheating act very secretive when it comes to phone calls. Decide if the person's phone habits make sense or if there might be cause for concern.


Does he receive a lot of phone calls while you are together that he never answers? Does he act nervous or purposefully keep the screen away from you? Do the calls just keep coming? Secretive, evasive behavior like this can indicate that he is married.Make sure not to confuse this with being polite. Some people don't want to answer the phone while on a date. The longer you are together, the more comfortable you should become around one another. Eventually, he should answer a call, especially if he gets them constantly.
Does he have two cell phones? Sometimes, this is true for business people. However, people who cheat also can have multiple cell phones. Does he refuse to give you the number? Does he take calls from numbers you never see while out of earshot? These could be red flags.
Does he only call you when he's at the grocery store, in the car, at work, or at the park? Have you ever gotten him when he's at home? If he's calling you when he's away from home, this could point to him sneaking out to call you.You get his voice-mail every time you call and he calls you back much later or the next day at work. If you call him randomly and he does answer, does he speak normally, does he sound like he's on a business call, or does he speak much more quietly than normal? Inconsistent phone behavior could point to cheating.He won't give you his home phone number. Many people only have cell phones now, but if he refuses to give you a home number and exhibits other signs, it may be a flag., If you've been dating for a few months and have never met any of the person's friends or family, then it may be a red flag. Does he talk about his friends and family? Do you know who he spends his time away from you with? Sometimes, people can be hesitant to introduce new love interests to their friends and family. However, if the relationship is getting serious, you've introduced him to your friends, and you still haven't met anyone, he's either not serious or married., You never go out on the weekends. He turns down every spontaneous date you suggest. There is never a romantic weekend getaway, or when there is, it's also a business trip.These unusual way of making plans can point to him having an alternate life he can't get away from.

, If you're not sure, be bold and ask. This can be the simplest and most effective way to learn what you need to know quickly. There are different possible ways to go about this:


Come right out and ask: ""Are you married?"" Refrain from asking in an accusatory tone; simply ask out of curiosity.
Ask, ""Is there anything you're not telling me?"" See what the person comes up with.
Watch the reaction. Is the person exhibiting the signs of lying? Are they averting their eyes, shifting uncomfortably, sweating, or becoming overly defensive?If the person says insists that he or she is not married, then you have to ask yourself why you think he's lying. Are you struggling with trust issues, or is the person just really acting sketchy? If you still feel like something is off, then you may need to end the relationship ASAP. If the person does say he or she is married, then don't waste any more time with him or her. You can get angry and ask a few questions, but get out as soon as you can -- it's just not worth it.

, Go to the courthouse of the city where the marriage was likely to occur. Public records can be useful for finding out whether someone is married now, or what their marriage history has been in the past. Marriage records are public; you can usually see a copy for free or for a small fee. You can usually even tell if the person has applied for a marriage license in the past.


You'll need the person's real name to search the public records. If their name is in common usage, such as Mary Smith, you'll also need a middle name.
In numerous jurisdictions, you'll also need to know which state or province a person was married in and only search there.
Be aware that not all marriage applications or licenses are made public. Some jurisdictions have provisions for keeping this information private. Every state and city differs on what information is available to the public and how it can be obtained, so know the rules of your state and city first.
While you're there, check the divorce records, too. Just because you find a marriage record, it doesn't mean the marriage is still in existence.
There are websites that collate nationwide public records to allow you to search for marriages. These tend to be considerably more expensive than searching locally available public records, but they might prove convenient. Weigh the cost with the convenience before making your decision.

, If you're snooping, then you're doing so at the cost of your relationship. But if you really think this is the best way to find out the truth, then go for it. Here are a few ways to snoop through the person's things to get the answers you need:


Look through the person's wallet. Does he have a joint credit card with someone? Or less obviously, does he share a joint card to PetCo, the local Co-op, or another local business with another person? That person may be his spouse.
Look through the person's phone. Are there pictures of the person with potential spouses or children? If you have seen a person's office, are there pictures there?Look at the names on the person's mail. Is there another person living in the house? Do they have the same last name? While this may simply indicate that the person lives with their sibling or parent, it may be reason to run a deeper check.
Check the person's driveway for two cars. Again, this could be the car of another family member or householder, so don't rely solely on this, but it could be a clue. Are there signs of children at the house?

, It's simple. Check the online while pages or your local phone book to find the person's listing. Search their phone number in an online search engine. Is the person listed as living in the same house as someone who shares his last name, is of the opposite gender, and is clearly not a child or a parent? If so, then this may be a sign that the person is married.


This information can be a bit outdated. The person could be divorced or separated since the listing was printed.

, There are dozens of websites out there that promise to tell you the person's marital status if you just type in his or her name, city, and your credit card information. Be wary of these websites. They might not be legitimate.

, If you're really desperate, consider hiring a private investigator to do the dirty work for you. Remember that this will probably cost a lot of money, so if you're only looking for a simple ""yes, this person is married"" or ""no, they're not,"" it's probably not the best idea. On the other hand, there are a lot of red flags and you find yourself falling harder, you might consider the detective work money well spent. Ask for advice from the private investigator before committing to this route.


A private investigator may be useful where there are concerns about bigamy or a divorce not yet finalized.

"
Assess the situation.,
Remain calm.,
Use positive language to reinforce, not to discourage.,
Make time to be helpful.,
Follow up.,
Ask how you can help.,
Anticipate unspoken needs.,
Genuinely listen.,
Think before you respond.,
Keep your friend focused on the bigger issue.,
Give your two cents and then stop talking.,
Figure out whether or not you're capable to actually help.,
Get your hands dirty.,
Keep your help quiet.,
Help because you want to.,
Be careful.",How to Be Helpful," Before doing something and attempting to help, stop and examine it from different perspectives, both to see different ways you might be able to help, and whether or not your help is necessary. Dig deeper. What is the source of the problem? The kind of help which should be extended to a person greatly depends on the situation and whether or not there are underlying causes.


For example, if a friend's car payment is due and their car is about to be repossessed if a payment isn't made, you could loan the money for a temporary fix, but how possible is it that you'll end up in the same position in the next couple months.
Instead, think about helping your friend set up a budget, or take out a loan. Help people help themselves.;
, A calming influence can be just as helpful, if not more so, than offering someone money or advice. Staying calm is also as essential part of clear thinking and even-temperedness, helping you to see the different possibilities for solutions and help, and choose between them honestly and objectively.


Read the situation and figure out which perspective needs to be represented to balance things out. If you're generally a worrier, it might be your instinct to tell a friend who is nervous about a big event that you're also worried, too, but will that be helpful? Instead, balance it out. Be the calm one in the situation.
If, on the other hand, your friend is thinking about hitchhiking across the country alone with one pair of clothes and no money, maybe your natural-worry will come in handy.

, Positivity is one of the most helpful things you can offer others. Encouraging people helps to inspire confidence, and saying positive things helps to make people feel better about themselves. Try to be the person who makes the extra effort to stay positive, even when things seem tough, and others will value your presence as a helpful contributing factor to the group. Aim for encouragement.


Don't be afraid to dissent, though, if the occasion calls for it. In some cases, it's possible that positivity needs to be leavened out with some hard truths. Don't be afraid to be the one to provide it.

, Being around is one of the underrated requirements of being a helpful person. If you want to be helpful for your friends and family, you've got to be available to be helpful and give them the gift of your time. Try to make time for the important people in your life and be willing to do things you might not normally want to do, to be as helpful as possible.


It may not be ideal for you to spend a Saturday helping your grandmother clean out her basement, but if you schedule some time to visit, at least you can limit it to your schedule and avoid having to skip a meeting with friends to help out, when you'd rather not.
You don't need to sit at home twiddling your thumbs, waiting for someone to call, if you want to be helpful. Live your own life, but consider scheduling time for the important people in your life you'd like to help, so you can give it when it's needed.

, Invariably you will encounter a problem that requires some heavy lifting on your part. This could be taken literally, as when you're asking to help someone move, or figuratively, as when you're asked to help someone kick a drinking habit, or get through a break-up. Either way it does require some effort or investment on your part. If you are committed to helping, you may need to open your wallet, your home, your heart or your mind. None of which is easy but may be entirely necessary.


While it may seem obvious to some, it's also critical to help yourself before you help others. If you're not taking care of your own situations, then it wears down your ability to extend help to others.

, Want to know if you can be of some assistance? Ask. The best way to figure out quickly and efficiently if and what you can do to help out is to just ask, flat-out. See your dad struggling with a lawnmower? ""Hey Dad, need a hand?"" See your friend looking down in the dumps after being embarrassed in gym class? ""Hey man, sorry about that. Want to talk about it?""


Sometimes offering to help without asking can hurt someone's feelings, if they were confident about their ability to do it alone.

, Pay attention to the signs other people are giving you to find out how to help without having to be asked. Think about the ways you might want to ask for help, then apply that to other people. For example, when you're cooking it's nice to have one person chop vegetables while the other person makes the sauce, making the whole operation faster.


If you see a friend drilling math problems with flashcards, offer to help test.
If you see someone struggling to carry too many bags, you probably don't have to ask to know they could use a hand.
If you see your flatmate tidying up, join in so you can both relax more quickly.

, Put away your phone, and give the person you're helping your full attention. Really listen to the person and evaluate the situation as objectively as possible. Digging deeper, asking questions and staying engaged in the person's issues will make you the most helpful presence possible. Don't look for the easy help, look for the real help.


Do not give advice before asking them how they feel, or how they want to respond to a situation.
One of the best things to ask someone who has come to you for help is to ask them how they feel about the situation, and what they think the best thing to do is. Then offer you opinion, not get upset if they do not take your advice.

, This sounds easy, but is a challenge for most people who wish to interject or offer advice too quickly. Offering an open ear with patience and without judgement is more than most people expect and what most people really need. Let them vent while you think of good advice and courses of action, and you will be helping out immensely.

, Often, the help you're offering may be simple, like offering someone a ride. Or it may be difficult, like helping a your friend out get a GED, or a job. The person you're trying to help, though, may have no idea what he or she needs, and may be confused, meaning that you can help out by listening closely and telling the difference.


For example, your friend may think the biggest problem in the world right now is that she can't scratch up enough dough to buy a pair of the new Jordans, but maybe the real problem is her inability to keep a job for longer than a week. How can you be the most helpful in this situation?

, Helping out doesn't necessarily mean offering your advice, your opinion, or even trying to solve the problem with a tidy solution. Sometimes, people will just need a listener and a sympathizer. It's not necessary to fix things to be helpful. Just listen and you can offer a lot more of your time.

, Some people have a super-hero mind, wanting to jump in and help anybody and everybody, no matter what the circumstance. But in reality, there are a lot of things you won't be capable of doing yourself, practically. In that circumstance, it is best to see if you can help them out by finding someone who can better assist. Then, you will be able to see more successful results than had you tried it yourself, and you will know that you were the one to help point them in the right direction.


If your friend calls you from three hours away because of car trouble and is asking you to come pick them up, you could hop in your car and waste the next 6 hours of your life, or you could start looking up body shops in the area, or friends close by who might be more able and eager to help.

, Sometimes, the best course of action is just to hop in and start helping. Don't wait to be asked for help, just volunteer. This is especially true for big jobs, like garage cleanings, or yard work, things that nobody is especially excited to do, but just need to be done. Instead of waiting around and debating, just hop in and volunteer to get started.


Your willingness to work might have the effect of inspiring others to hop in and stop hemming and hawing about what to do. Be a leader.

, Sometimes, receiving help can be a little embarrassing, so try to put yourself in the shoes of the person you're helping and not make a big deal out of it. This is especially true if you're doing something like lend money, or get someone out of a pickle that might have been somewhat embarrassing.


Don't underestimate what might be embarrassing for some people. If your buddy needed help changing a tire because he didn't know how, it might be somewhat emasculating to bring it up in front of all your friends. If he offers to tell the story as a joke, hop in, but don't volunteer the information yourself.

, If you want to be really and truly helpful to others, you need to act from the goodness of your heart, not because you want something in return. This will only lead to disappointment, resentment, and manipulative behavior, making you bitter in the long run. Acting from a place of ulterior motives only makes you less helpful in the long run.


Don't push your help on people. If someone's committed to doing something solo, it's not your business to force your aid on them. Be available if they should have a change of heart.

, There are people out there who will take advantage of your generosity. The joy you derive from helping your fellow man is worth the risk, but such risk should be mitigated wherever possible. Use common sense. Understand your own limitations and bless you for helping.


Look out for leeches. Learn to understand who actually needs your help and who might just be conning, or manipulating you. Don't be emotionally manipulated into doing too much for someone.

Think on a deep level (get to a place where you can completely focus on something, then focus on this).,
Start by planning your day or week (what ever is easiest for you) then, pick out each situation you might get into where you need to ask these questions.,
Take the easiest situations and write out a short script of how a conversation would typically go (with all the positive and negative parts).,
After you've scripted out a short or long conversation (again, what ever is easier), rewrite it so you can fit in some OPEN ENDED QUESTIONS!,
Practice using open ended questions.,
Apply your trial and error on the many situations that matter just a little until you have it as a habit.",How to Write Open Ended Questions," Ask your self ""What's an open ended question? You will find an open ended question is the opposite of a closed ended question, meaning a question someone can't answer yes or no only to. Seriously ingrain it into your mind so you never have to ever ask that again! Understanding is the key.;
, Making it personal will help you learn it on a deeper level.

, All the good and the bad.

, It's best to replace some response with one or two, because that will keep some balance to the equation. Too much info can overwhelm anyone so know them before you try to test your new ""script"". Even if it's just writing it out, when you're successful at implementing an open ended question on paper, you might internalize that success and actually do that when you have a conversation with them.

, The more you script it out, the easier it will be to practice. If you say the wrong thing or accidentally use a closed ended question and sabotage your self out of habit, just take note of it. Then when you try again to plan it ahead of time you can remember ""well Susie has the best smile so I need to remember to use bigger words to distract me from that"". Or ""the boss is so smart, I know if I get too close to him I need to use words that distract me from him or else I will stutter for sure"". Some pit falls can be totally avoided if you pay attention, note them, keep trying and be persistent. Until you can overcome the pitfalls and or use open ended questions automatically.

, Then when you have done it enough to the point you can do it easily, apply this new knowledge on paper with essays or say in the toast masters (where you can get some really good training). The more practice the easier the task.

Try to start your story with a great hook.,
See the images that you want to write about in your head like a scene from a movie.,
If you need a little inspiration, go to your public library and find a book with picture sentences.,
Try using dialogue!,
Throw out boring words!,
For a while, just don't think about your writing.,
The most important detail in making your writing come to life is if you believe in it.,
Nobody will want to read your sentences if they don't look good on the page!",How to Write Sentences That Paint Pictures," This hook should be a sentence that pulls your reader into your story.;
, Picture the weather and scenery, try to feel the character's emotions, picture their expressions. Really get into detail -try to see everything, from how blue the water is(even if it's a murky green, be colorful!), or how threatening the night sky looks if your character is wandering around, lost, in a forest.

, Great books are The Series of Unfortunate Events and Harry Potter.

, Unless your character has super powers, they can't just show up on a cloud! Have your characters talk to each other. If you really want to jazz up your story, have the big scary monster sneaking behind them and have the character say, ""Did you hear something?""

, Go for words like ""murmured"", ""muttered"" instead of ""said"" or ""replied"". Those words are classic though -this does not mean to not use them entirely. Also, BE DESCRIPTIVE! If you're talking about someone's mesmerizing eyes, then refer to them as ""hypnotizing and beautiful"", and describe the emotion in them.

, This is sometimes what I do when I'm writing -everything suddenly feels so real, as if you're in the character's head, and the situation is really coming to life for you. You feel the character's emotions, and the words just flow from you absently. You won't even half remember it unless you re-read it after you're finished writing.

, Don't just think of a spring meadow, but close your eyes and pretend you're there. What would you feel? What would it be like? Would you be peaceful and happy...or have a numbing procrastination?

, Be really careful with your grammar and punctuation.

Keep a small notebook, or use your phone, to constantly record ideas, lines, and characters.,
Try mixing and matching two ideas you've never seen before.,
Read and watch non-fiction books and documentaries to gain real-world inspiration.,
Consider brainstorming with a close friend or group, tossing ideas around together.,
Sit down at the computer and type something, anything, to get started.",How to Write Creatively1," Inspiration comes in many places, but one of the places it never seems to come is when you sit down and tell yourself to ""come up with an idea."" Take the pressure off of your writing days by recording ideas all day, every day. From lines you overhear that make you laugh to sudden stories that burst into your mind, keep track of ideas throughout the day, not just when you sit at the computer.;
, There are no completely original ideas in writing -- everything builds off of other work, real life events, and new combinations of other art forms to form something ""new"" from the old. But this is incredibly freeing, allowing you to experiment and play with crazy new ideas and combinations to make something no one has quite seen before.



House was a brilliant, but simple combination of medical dramas with one-off ""murder mystery"" type shows, swapping medical diagnosis for detective work.

Star Wars is a typical hero's quest, with the plot ripped straight from the oldest known Greek stories. George Lucas's genius? Simply setting it in space.
The collected works of William Shakespeare are full of ""artistic theft,"" as almost every one of his plays was a brilliant amalgamation of other plays, books, and historical records.

, Pay attention to the news, read a biography that catches your eye, and watch documentaries and series. What sorts of issues, stories, and ideas grab you? Are there perspectives that would be fun to write from, or that you've never heard from creatively? The world around you is filled with inspiration, so use it.


Try writing from the perspective of the people you see on the news. You understand the facts of a war or struggle, but try to actually imagine living it.
Creative writing doesn't have to be fiction. What stories from your life speak out to you as potentially exciting or compelling stories.

, This isn't for every writer, but everyone should at least try group writing or brainstorming. It usually works best when someone brings an initial idea in: ""what if the Terracotta warriors were really alive,"" allowing everyone to pitch in ideas and build on the initial idea until it's built into a story worth telling.


Almost all writers enjoy having at least one person to bounce ideas off. Frequently, just vocalizing your plots or ideas can make them much clearer and easier to write.

, Just start typing, and don't let yourself stop for at least five minutes. Write everything that comes to mind, following ideas and threads until you get distracted or bored, then write about something else. This doesn't have to turn into anything -- rather, free writing is the equivalent of stretching for athletes. You get out of your head and onto the page-- the first step towards getting your writing groove going.


Look online at collections of ""free writing prompts."" There are thousands of ideas out there to spark your creative juices and get the writing flowing, even if only for a few minutes.
Rewrite passages from your favorite books -- many famous authors, from Billy Collins to Cormac McCarthy, literally re-wrote favorite chapters to learn from the best."
"
Write the story out linearly, as simply or complex as possible, to give yourself a template.,
Know that great characters drive great stories, not the other way around.,
Set goals and timers to keep yourself writing.,
Think in terms of ""scene"" when writing, not the entire project.,
Fight writer's block by just continuing to write.",How to Write Creatively2," If you're writing poetry, you might start simply sketching ideas, images, and lines that pop in your head, worrying about organization later. If you're writing a novel, you could write a 1-2 page super summary, working through the cause-and-effect now so that you can write in the details later.


There is no ""right"" way to start writing. Some people plan, storyboard, and plot, and others plow right into it and deal with the rest in revision. Experiment for what works for you., The most common moment that people tune out of a story is when the character starts doing things that no rational person would do. This is usually because the writer is trying to force the characters to hit a plot point, instead of letting the character's decisions drive the next plot point. The best characters are:



Well-rounded. Good characters are multi-dimensional, with both strengths and weaknesses. They are not just the ""strong hero,"" ""damsel in distress,"" or a million other simplified character types. They are people and have nuance and complexity

Desiring something, and fearing something else: Plots are driven by character's wants -- what do they need or desire to be happy or safe? Some characters are driven by fear, or the desire not to be something. But all characters are pushed by some desire, a desire that drives their plot.Aware self-agents Good characters make decisions, for better or for worse, that they think will help them. Always ask yourself -- if I were in the same situation as the character, would I see that as a good decision? Sometimes, only one decision catapults the whole story, as the character deals with the fallout. Other times characters make decisions every minute. Just make sure they fit the character., Despite the free-flowing, creative aspects of writing, all the best authors and poets know that discipline is required to truly get your vision out. You'll never finish your story or idea if you're constantly turning to Facebook, or researching an obscure point or allusion, or quitting at the first scent of writer's block. The best way to become a creative writer is to be disciplined, which can be accomplished in a variety of ways:


Setting writing timers -- 1 hour of straight writing, 10-15 minutes of relaxing, then repeat.
Deciding on a daily writing time and place, building the habit.
Getting a writing buddy -- someone you trade 10 pages with each week at the same time.

, This is a great way to make your writing more tight, concise, and manageable, especially for big projects. No matter what you're working on, from poetry to epic novels, limit your attention while writing to the current scene you're in. How can you make this moment powerful on its own? If each chapter or stanza is compelling, they will start to flow together when placed side-by-side.


Consider each scene, chapter, or segment a short story. How can you make it compelling if it was published all on its own?
Scenes should have tension and rising action -- starting with a problem, making things more difficult or introducing new challenges, and resolving everything in some way at the end. It seems overly simplistic, but these three stages are the basis of 95% of all good plots., It is that easy, and if you don't know what to write about, write anyway. It can help to ditch the computer and grab a pencil. Take the pressure off yourself to write something amazing and just write. Remember, even the very best writers always revise, and what you write down while ""blocked"" will get better over time. But if you sit there silently, or go do other things when you should be writing, you'll never get over your block.


This isn't to say some relaxing time isn't worth it when you're stuck, just get back to writing after you're done walking, reading, meditating, or enjoying a cup of writer's block coffee.
Never tell yourself that, ""I can't write right now."" All you have to do is sit down -- the words will flow if you give them the time and energy to do so.

Understand that your first draft is just that -- a draft.,
Read your entire work and ask what the most important threads are.,
Cut as much away from the first draft as you can, ruthlessly erasing.,
Show your work to others and ask for feedback.,
Edit thoroughly multiple times checking that grammar and spelling are perfect.",How to Write Creatively3," Many young writers completely freeze up when they start writing because they immediately realize that it isn't as good on the page as it is in their head. But every writer in the world, from Margaret Atwood to Aristotle, knows that they need to put something on the page, anything, in order to polish it up and make it better. So take a deep breath and remind yourself that this is nothing new, and your ""terrible"" first draft won't be terrible for long.


Looking for inspiration that you're not alone? Check out Raymond Chandler's writing process: “Throw up into your typewriter every morning. Clean up every noon.”, As you re-read, highlight the passages that stand out to you. What characters can you not get enough of, or want to keep writing about? What plot continually crops up in your head with new ideas or twists? What locations feel the most lived in. Go into the first revision for an eye for what works, not for what you don't like, and you'll get a blueprint for further revision.


Know that you'll likely need to keep writing, filling in holes you didn't notice on your first draft. Prioritize those areas that grip you the most already, or the characters that seem the most alluring to write.
It is not uncommon for the tone or main idea of a story to pivot at this point -- don't be afraid to forge a bold new direction if it is clearly more enjoyable than the original plot or perspective.<reF.https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/teacher-blog/2013/feb/01/teaching-creative-writing-ideas-activities-primary-literacy</ref>

, It hurts to cut, but this is the only way to make your story tight, coherent, and powerful. Everything that isn't essential to your story or idea needs to go, mercilessly hacking and slashing until you're left only with the absolute best. If it isn't necessary to the story, it has to go. The most powerful stories, poems, and works make every single word count, gaining power by cutting straight to the point and avoiding filler.


Make sure your dialogue actually adds something and doesn't simply regurgitate information for the audience. Reading dialogue out loud, with a friend, is the best way to make sure it is natural sounding and worth keeping.Save new copies of your work every day you open it up, allowing you to still keep copies of everything you erase in case you later change your mind.
Hemmingway said it best in a letter to his friend F. Scott Fitzgerald: “I write one page of masterpiece to ninety-one pages of s--t. I try to put the s--t in the wastebasket.”, Writing is a form of communication, and what is communication if it is only with yourself?! Sharing your story is intimidating, but it is the only way to become a better creative writing. Other people haven't lived in your story for as long as you have, and that's a good thing -- they'll have a fresh set of eyes to see holes, issues, and the hidden gems you might not have noticed.


Pick your people wisely-- friends who love to read, and you know will be honest with you, are often the best picks.
Let your friends know that you're looking for constructive criticism. While being nice is great, it won't help you write any better., Don't give a potential editor or publisher an excuse to throw your work in the trash after the first typo (which, with standards and competition as high as they are today, they will). Run through the whole thing 2-3 times to fix the little things like word choice and spelling, and consider using a program like Grammarly or hiring a freelance copy-editor for bigger projects.

If you want to brag and run through the city streets yelling, ""I did it!",How to Write Something Great," You need an idea, or a thought, to get your story started. think about what the introduction of a movie is like. think about how all the characters are introduced and how the scene is set.;
, what kind of traits do they have? how will these traits contribute to their actions later on in the story?

, One of these STORY WEBS will help you organize your thoughts and plans. what do you think you are going to write? what kind of conflict, or problem, could there be?

, You can use these sentences later. When you face WRITER'S BLOCK.

, You want to give the readers a taste of what the characters lives are like before you bring on conflicts or emotional changes in the characters life. About 13-20 pages should do it. These first 13-20 pages are your introduction. An introduction doesn't always have to be boring either. You can begin with the ballet recital, bake sale, or something else.

, This is so the reader can get to know the character better. (for example: you could make the characters family member die, and then reveal a big secret about them. that is an example of what will get a readers attention.)

, If the reader is constantly having changes made to the characters or setting of the story, then your reader will get confused. Try to add in extra events or moments of calmness or deep undisturbed emotion, so that the reader will have time to soak in all the information.

, If the book is already talking about a zombie rising, and the reader is still wondering what happened to the hairless cat locked in chains in the basement, then this will frustrate the reader.

, Editing is adding events that could have been forgotten, making sentences more in depth, and revising the story to make sure that the reader can access all the points and perspectives of the situation.

, Make sure that you read over the story yourself and make sure that you got to the point of the story.

, Have a trusting friend look over your writing. Discuss what your friend got from the writing, and see if it matches up to what was in your imagination while you were writing it.

, I did it!"" like a chicken with your head cut off, then do just that. You have every right. Because you should be proud of your amazing story!

Develop a good plot if required.,
Include interesting details.,
Create interesting, realistic characters if appropriate.,
Think of a great title, and make an eye-catching cover.,
Consider hiring a literary agent.,
Submit your materials to a publisher.,
Be prepared to work hard.",How to Write an Interesting Book," One of the most important aspects of a book is its plot, and having a strong one is important if you want to keep your reader's attention. Choosing a plot that tells an important story or message can help your reader connect with your book. Check to ensure that it makes sense, and fix any weak points that may ruin it. Do your best to stick to it throughout your book, and don't stray far from it. For instance, if you're writing about the life and times of Lord Nelson, stick to the facts and avoid going off topic.


Be as original as possible. While it may be tempting to use cliches, it may discourage people from continuing reading, especially if they've already read other books similar to yours. Giving them a fresh and new book will capture their interest and encourage them to purchase it.;
, Be sure that they are relevant to your plot and strengthen it rather than distract your readers from it. Details help enhance the book and the topic you're focusing on. However, make sure that you avoid adding too many; otherwise, it'll become overwhelming and chase your readers away.


Beware of using too many simple sentences, such as ""I ran to the house"" or overly detailed ones like ""I dashed off in a northern direction toward the house."" Instead, opt for a descriptive sentence that is in between the two extremes.

You could try writing a sentence like, ""A burnt smell swept through the air. With a yelp, I dropped the garden hose and dashed towards the house, hoping the kitchen hadn't burnt down. I pounded up the back porch stairs and burst into the kitchen, nearly crashing into my grandfather.""



, Remember that there are certain types of books where including characters may be inappropriate, such as ones about fly fishing or a self-help book about recognizing one's limits. When creating a characters, be sure that they are relatable and realistic. Give them a balance of strengths and weaknesses, and feel free to include hobbies, likes, and dislikes. Select goals for your major characters so that they have an objective to work towards throughout the story. Be as original as possible so that you'll catch your readers' attention.

, Discuss cover designs with your publishers. When using different colors, make sure that they complement one another and capture the theme of your book. For instance, if your book focuses on a serious or dark topic, use darker shades. If your book is happier, you may want to consider selecting brighter, warmer colors. As for your title, make sure that it's related to the topic of your book, and be creative with it so that it captures people's interest. Be sure to use an appropriate, legible font. Few books, interesting or otherwise, have handwriting on the front cover. However, if you're not planning on publishing your book, you can design your cover with a card and any writing utensils (ex: markers, crayons, etc.).

, A literary agent will handle the task of promoting your book and meeting with publishers. By helping you with deal and sales negotiations, she can help boost the chances of your book becoming successful. If problems arise between you and your publisher(s), she can help fix them. Ensure that you have completed your book before attempting to find an agent, as you'll have a better chance of being accepted by one.


Note that a literary agent may not be necessary. If you're planning on convincing a big publisher to publish your book, then you may need to hire an agent to help you. However, if you're approaching a small company, you might not need one.

, Before choosing one, do your research beforehand to ensure that they accept the type of work you're submitting. Be sure that they offer high-quality performance. Once you have decided on a publisher, review their submission guidelines, which normally require you to have a query letter, sample chapters, and a synopsis/proposal of your book.


Remember that the process can be slow, and not every publisher may want you. You may be rejected the first time, but don't give up. Many authors have to resubmit their work several times before they're accepted. You can send your manuscript to more than one publisher at a time, but be sure that they allow simultaneous submissions.

, Although the idea of writing a book is nice, the reality is that it can be a long, difficult process that requires a lot of patience. Be sure that you have both the time and motivation to work on your book. You must be willing to go through several drafts of your work, edit out unnecessary parts, and sometimes even start over if the need arises. You may experience obstacles at times, and you need to have the strength and determination to overcome them. You might run out of ideas or be overwhelmed with so many that you don't know which one to include in your book. However, the harder the work, the better your book will become.

Be careful so you don't turn off readers with the opening.",How to Write a Suspenseful Opening," If you want to write a suspenseful opening line, you should have a good idea of what you want to accomplish with it. An opening line can do many things, and there are many ways to write an introductory line. What you choose will depend on what you hope to build toward.An opening line can convey a fact or a series of related facts that reveal something significant. If the goal of your story is to be suspenseful, the fact/facts conveyed should intrigue and excite the reader.
A factual opening line that creates suspense could detail some recent event or a series of events about to unfold. For example, you might write something like, ""There was only one way out of the canyon, and it was clear that I wouldn't be allowed to pass through it.""
An opening line can also establish the mood of the story to come. Try something ominous and exciting, such as ""The moon looked blood red--but then again, everywhere I looked I saw blood in those days.""
Consider using the opening line as a frame for the story. You've heard the classic line, ""It was a dark and stormy night,"" but try to make the opening your own.;
, Think about starting the story right in the midst of something chaotic, exciting, or terrifying. This technique is called ""en medias res"" (Latin for ""into the middle of things""). Starting a story en medias res immediately grabs the reader's attention. If it's well-executed, the reader will wonder from the first line who these characters are, why they're in their present situation, and what will happen to them.You can also use the opening line to drop a reader into a world he or she will be curious or anxious about. This can also create suspense as the reader will want to find out more about this place and its inhabitants.
An opening line can establish some mystery that will be explored and unraveled throughout the rest of the story. This creates tension and may even give your story a sense of impending doom (depending on the mystery).

, One way to increase the suspense in your opening sentence is by making it choppy and fragmented. Fragmenting breaks up the narrative flow of a normal sentence. This can convey exhaustion, fear, anger, urgency, and other emotions that will catch a reader's interest.Make your fragmented opening line as suspenseful as possible. Try something like, ""Cold outside. Still no heat. Weather hasn't cleared. We're still here. Waiting.""
Notice how much more tension this creates than simply saying, ""It was cold outside and we were still waiting without any heat.""
Play around with different fragmentations until you get a line that really gives you chills.

, Significant action directly involves the main characters engaging in that action. Don't waste your time describing the scenery or the beauty of a moment in the opening line. If you want your opening to be suspenseful, you have to create tension, and significant action is a great way to do this.You don't need to deliver action in the intro, but if you do, make it matter to the reader.
An opening that lacks significant action would be something like, ""The clouds drifted aimlessly across the sky, and every so often the passed by the sun.""
An opening with significant action would be something like, ""I squinted my eyes against the blinding desert sun. A few clouds were overhead, but most of the time I had to stare against the sun and the sand that blew in the unforgiving wind.""

, One of the best ways to build tension and suspense right from the start is by creating characters that are relatable. When readers care about a character, they will be invested in what happens to that character, which can naturally create suspense as the conflict unfolds around him or her.Make your characters realistic and believable. Give them human qualities, and perhaps most importantly, make them flawed somehow.
No one is perfect in real life. When readers encounter a character with relatable flaws, they're likely to be drawn to that character and become invested in his/her wellbeing.
You should plan out your characters with enough detail that you can't fit everything in. However, even things that aren't directly stated in the story will help influence how you write that character's mannerisms, reactions, etc.

, Conflict is what will drive the plot of your story. It doesn't need to be laid out plainly for the reader in the first few sentences, but by the end of the opening paragraph your reader should have some sense of what's at stake and what is to come.Most suspenseful stories rely on some type of struggle, whether it's physical, emotional/mental, or spiritual.
Your protagonist may struggle against himself/herself, against the antagonist (if it's human), or against society/technology/nature. The protagonist may also struggle against ideas/beliefs and God/gods/goddesses.
You may want to have one larger conflict that spans the whole story, and one or two smaller (but still relevant) conflicts that pepper the individual pages to further build tension along the way., You can build tension around the conflict by having it be at odds with the setting. For example, by starting with a scene that is very peaceful and quiet, then inserting some type of unexpected violence, you immediately build tension and suspense.Think about the setting where you would least expect the story's conflict to unfold.
Establish that setting, but hint at something dark/foreboding to come.
Alternately, instead of hinting at something foreboding, you could have the conflict erupt out of nowhere. (Although you should be able to make it make sense for readers, of course.)

, Having a bad or stressful situation become worse is an excellent way to add suspense to your story. As you work through the opening paragraph, ask yourself: ""What would make things worse for this character?""Write the scene so that conflict begins to unfold in the most uncomfortable and/or inappropriate place possible.
Create misunderstandings where one character reads too much into something, which creates tension with a friend or relative.
Be aware of the stakes at all times. What does the main character stand to lose as the conflict unfolds?
Make sure there are clear stakes and difficulties for both the protagonist and the antagonist (if the antagonist is another person).Try having something that seems like a good thing actually be a bad thing, or vice versa.
For example, a character might lose his/her watch, but meet someone while looking for it, which may seem like a good ending to a bad situation...until that character is revealed to actually be a dangerous person for the protagonist to know.

, Don't overlook the importance of detail and sensory information. By incorporating sensory information, you make it more likely that your readers will have an actual gut reaction to the conflict and events unfolding on the page.Nothing makes suspense come to life like being able to see, hear, smell, or feel the source of tension.
It may be easier to work in sensory details after you've finished your first draft of the scene. You'll know by then how the paragraph is structured, and it will be easier to insert sensory information as needed to bring the scene to life.

, You may be tempted to keep building and building the suspense through an ever-growing opening paragraph. This is a risky move, however, as carrying the opening on too long could lose a reader's interest.There's no right or wrong length for an opening, but it shouldn't drag on endlessly.
The reader should be hooked from the opening and it should establish the necessary elements, but then it's time to move on.
Your opening scene should drop readers into your story's world, establish for readers what the source of tension is, and/or introduce the characters who will try to solve the problem(s) at hand.

, There's nothing more frustrating than an opening paragraph that knocks your socks off, then switches gears and never returns to the energy, voice, and suspense of the intro. It can almost feel like it's been written by two different writers, and it can easily turn off your readers.The opening should certainly create suspense and/or tension, but the tone, voice, and style of that opening need to carry through the rest of your story.
Be consistent. If any aspect of the narrative storytelling changes after the opening, your reader might be confused or frustrated that things aren't what he/she expected them to be.

, Remember that you'll need to pace yourself as the story unfolds. Your opening should be suspenseful and should hook the reader's attention. But you don't want to show all your cards, so to speak, all at once.Get the reader's attention, then pull back a little bit.
Don't pull back too far, or your reader might think the story isn't as interesting as the opening, but keep him/her wanting to read more.
Think to yourself, ""Is this crucial to the suspense I want to create in the opening paragraph?"" If not, then let it come later in the story.

, You should certainly write the story you want to write, but remember that some readers may be more easily offended or upset than others. If a reader feels offended from the opening lines of the story, he or she is not very likely to continue reading past that point.Some elements of a story that make certain readers blush (like sex scenes, violence, or vulgar words) are forgivable if they arise later in the story.
Your readers may feel alienated and turned off by reading something zesty like this right at the beginning. If your story requires these elements that's fine, but don't throw it in the reader's face right from the first page.

Know something about the topic at hand, even if it's just a little.,

Take key concepts and break them down.,
Make friends with the word ""because."",

, Just assume that everything you know is true, even if you're positive it isn't at all. Then edit

, to make your writing less definite. If you think maybe what you're writing is not quite accurate, this will help justify what you're saying. For example, instead of saying ""The angles in the polygon added up to 1080º and everyone in our class found this"", you could say ""The angles in the polygon added up to approximately 1080º, and this was generally what everyone in our class found.""

, This may seem complicated, but it's really not. Examples of words like these are imagination, exploration, understanding, thought, talent, meaning, etc (there are so many words like this!). Think of a sentence like ""Susan's understanding of imagination had real meaning to me."" Like, what the heck does that mean? Pretty much nothing, but it sounds good. Also, think of ads, like ""At our school, we focus on teaching your child the ways that they can succeed, by using their imaginations to explore their talents and find meaning inside themselves."" Again, what does that mean? This is a particularly good way to fill up a word limit without saying anything that can be graded against you.

, This is another great way to fill space. If there is just one concept you really get, use the aforementioned tool (using words to say nothing) to write sentence after sentence about it. Don't worry if sentences say the same thing as other sentences, just make sure they sound different. Note that this won't really work if you have to write about a certain number of concepts–teachers will still only find the one.

, This is a good tip if you have you write about, say, exactly three concepts. Take that one concept you understand (or know the most about) and break it down into the required number of concepts. This isn't as easy to see through, and even if a teacher DOES see through it, they'll have a hard time marking you down for it. An example of this is if you understand that Harry and and Voldemort represent good vs evil, you could break it down into 1) Harry represents good 2) Voldemort represents evil 3) Good and evil always meet in the end. It's like magic (no pun intended)–you suddenly have the number concepts you want!

, This word makes it look like you have a deep understanding of the topic, even if you're only using the aforementioned tips to completely invent whatever follows your ""because."" The best way to do these ""because"" statements is by using a lot of verbs to say something you could have said if you didn't even know what the topic was (an expansion of using words to say nothing). For example, instead of saying ""I think Harry felt sad when his parents died"", say ""I think Harry felt sad when his parents died because the author demonstrated this with her explanation of the way Harry has empathy."" This makes you look oh-so-much smarter.

, If you feel a little bit confident, you don't have to have a mind filled with facts. (Though you SHOULD. This is NOT a fail-safe strategy or a good way to learn.).

Without copying them, you can choose specific elements of a variety of touching stories to help shape your own story.Perhaps you’re drawn to stories that have a lot of dialogue and would like to incorporate that into your work.
Or, you might not like long, drawn out setting descriptions and may choose to write shorter descriptions.
You might find that you really enjoy reading touching stories in which love prevails over an external triumph. That’s a wonderful reflection, as it gives you a potential starting point for your own touching story.;
, One engaging feature of a touching story is that it is relatable and readers can imagine and feel what the characters are going through, so you want to think of a situation that many people can relate to. This helps ensure that the maximum number of readers will really get into your touching story. Be creative and don't do something too common; nobody wants to read yet another variation of a story they've read too many times already.Some examples include:


Loss of a loved one or pet
Marriage-related situations
A big move
Finding love
Forgiveness
Going away to college
Getting a new job
Going on a journey of self discovery
A kind gesture met by another kind gesture

, The most important characters are the protagonist (""hero"") and the antagonist (""villain""). However, you will want to add some more minor characters, otherwise, the touching story will not be as interesting. When you are making up characters, write at least some backstory about each of them. Even if you don't put this in the story, it's good to keep in mind so your characters will always act ""in character"". Figure out what role each person has in the plot.You might have a notebook specifically for character development, dedicating a page to each character in which you jot down notes about them. You don’t have to use every character note that you write down. It’s better to have too much than too little, as you can always cut or revise details later.
This is where you can bring your characters to life. Imagine your protagonist. Is she from a small town? How did she end up in the big city? Where did she meet the love of her life who she’ll connect with later in the story? What’s her favorite band? Food? Author?

, Many new authors want to jump right in and write; however, it is better to do some planning beforehand. Making an outline or chart of characters, backstories, conflict, and settings helps ensure that the touching story is consistent and the plot makes sense. This also allows you to fill in any gaps in your story and change points around as necessary.Perhaps the most famous example of plotting a story is J.K. Rowling’s chart for the Harry Potter novels.Notice that she pays attention to details, planning out the action for each month of the story, as well as the plots and subplots. Everything is managed and accounted for in her hand-written spreadsheet.
You should refer to your character pages while plotting to maintain consistency.

, The setting of your touching story is vitally important, serving as more than a passive backdrop. Instead, characters interact with the setting in this type of story, and the setting can, at times, offer a sort of locomotion that propels the story along. One way to relate to your audience, too, is through setting, making your story even more robust.Think about where you want your story to take place. Imagine the house, the store, the school, the city, the state, the country, and write down details of your location in your notebook.
Also consider when this is taking place. Determine what season and time your touching story is set. Does it happen to be during a holiday?
Do you imagine this taking place in one location, such as a boat dock as they wave goodbye to one another? Or do you see your story spanning sunrise and sunset both, on a boat dock and at a high school football game?

, Point of view is also important in a touching story as you want your readers to sympathize with the characters. Do you want to tell your touching story from the point of view of one character in particular so that readers become invested in them primarily, or perhaps as a third-person narrator so that readers are paying more equal attention to all of your characters?


A single-character point of view is useful because you can give your readers access to your character’s inner thoughts, their feelings, their reactions, and the story as they experience it. This interior perspective  is useful because readers become invested in that character.
On the other hand, if you have a third-person narrator in your story, a narrator that is removed and tells the story to the readers, you are able to describe more characters, but with less emotional depth. You may also incorporate free indirect discourse, which allows readers partial access to a character’s thoughts while maintaining that third-person narrator, Often you won’t know what works best for you until you sit down to write. You might decide that a pen and paper is best, or you may determine that typing on a computer works better for you. Also, you might find that writing in a particular room in your house, or in a chair outside, or at a coffee house inspires creativity. Some research suggests that our writing and retention improve when we write by hand because it slows us down, allowing us to think better., Resist the temptation to name characters, places, and the story itself, initially. Sometimes when people write, they spend too much time coming up with names rather than characterization, plot details, and other vital elements. You can (and should) go back later and work on naming your characters.Although you know your characters fairly well by now, having imagined them, written notes about them, and mapped them into your larger touching story, don’t worry about details right now like names. What’s important at this stage is the substance and to make sure that you’re focusing on writing a touching rather than gimmicky story.

, What makes touching stories so effective is that the reader can emotionally connect and relate to the story, setting, characters, and plot. This emotional connection is typically predicated on something very simple, such as love or compassion, so make sure that you don’t overcomplicate or over-sentimentalize your story.For example, while it’s possible that someone has very, very bad luck, most readers won’t emotionally connect to a story in which the protagonist has over-the-top experiences (like being forced to drive a runaway train full of dynamite while trying to save her one, true love). Less is better, allowing the characters and storyline to really shine through.

, You can write a deeply touching story that resonates with your audience and not be overly sentimental. In fact, you want to avoid sentimentality, instead recognizing that you can convey thoughts, emotions, struggles, and experiences without over-expressions of emotion. Don’t avoid emotions in your touching story, just avoid excess.You can tell your reader what a character is feeling very directly by just stating it. For example, “Kurt was feeling anxious as he stood on the front porch, staring at the front door that he hadn’t seen in 27 years.”
Or you can indirectly offer this by using an adjective to describe a person or a thing (noun), which tells the reader the character’s feelings about that noun, giving an indirect glimpse at their feelings. For example, “Chloe made her way down the busy street, hoping that she’d see Samantha before her horrible boss made her go back to work.”

, Remember, you want your readers to relate to and connect with your touching story and really become emotionally invested, so be intentional with your plot, actions, and characters so that you don’t slip into a sensational or melodramatic story. With a touching story, less is more.Be realistic and you’ll be relatable.


A character may have a sick parent who they are unable to financially care for, which is realistic and relatable. But it would be melodramatic to say that character also has a sick child, missing dog, and that they lost their job.
What is one touching aspect of your story that you think your readers could connect with?

, You’ll use style, tone, and vocabulary to manipulate your writing so that your story is touching, authentic, and relatable. Also, consider that your audience and medium of publication will influence the mechanics of your story. Your tone, style, and even your word choices will be different depending on who and what you’re writing for.


Your word choices will impact the mood, tone, and action of your touching story and determine how your reader responds to your touching story.If you want to set a positive tone, for example, you might describe your protagonist as modest, appreciative, cheerful, or benevolent.
On the other hand, you might describe your protagonist’s feelings as she searches the woods for her elderly Labrador Retriever one night as frantic, desperate, and terrified.

, Readers emotionally resonate with sympathetic characters, making them likable and relatable, both vital to an effective touching story. Just like before, remember that less is more here. Don’t overwhelm your reader with character traits; instead, be judicious with how you portray your character, giving more meaning to that which you do offer.Typically a sympathetic character will face an obstacle, or have a worthwhile or even noble cause, or they may have a passion or love to pursue. These aspects humanize your character and give your reader a reason to root for them.

, You want your reader to feel what’s happening in your touching story, and you’ll do this by bringing the characters to life and telling a believable story. Another trick is to make your story emotionally resonant, helping your readers feel what your characters feel.Rather than tell your reader how your character feels, occasionally tell your reader how the character reacts to a situation. What do they do because of how they are feeling?
For example, instead of saying, “Jose was devastated when he learned that Anna had married Sam in his absence,” tell the reader what Jose did. “Jose buried his head in the pillow and screamed after learning that Anna had married Sam while he was gone. He cried and yelled into that pillow to exhaustion, finally falling into a disturbed and restless sleep.”

, Write your first draft with the understanding that it will need a lot of work. Refer to your story map frequently as you write, but don’t worry about editing yet. Spend your time and energy generating the first draft of your story, focusing on developing your plot and characterization. #*Editing is another step in the writing process., You can never have too much backstory, even about the most minor characters. Remember that Shakespeare, Charles Dickens, Tolkien, and J.K. Rowling all paid attention to backstory and characterization, even for the most minor characters. You need to remember, though, not to overwhelm your reader with too much backstory at one time. You might need to spread out a character’s backstory over several chapters so that it’s not too much at once.If you’re writing a shorter story, you might not have the space to spread out the backstory. In that case, choose the most important details that will help your reader engage emotionally with the characters and storyline.

, Touching stories are emotionally complex, and you should allow yourself the opportunity to revise, focusing on different points and areas with each “second look.” Every time you revise your touching story, approach your text with one goal in mind, such as working on character development, or transitions, or dialogue. Working on one area at a time will help you stay focused, not getting sidetracked by other issues that you notice.

, Whether you read out loud to yourself, your Aunt Martha, or your cat, reading your story out loud will make you a better writer.Even better is to ask someone to read your story out loud to you. Hearing a story allows you or your readers to access the story in a different way, and will help you identify issues with tone, grammar, and syntax.

, While revising, make sure that you have your story saved in more than one space. Accidents happen and you don’t want to run the risk of losing your work. Consider putting all of your drafts on a removable storage device or in cloud storage. And remember, don’t delete your drafts. Save each one and name it appropriately, just in case you want to go back and use or refer to something from a previous version of your work.

, Ask someone you trust to read your touching story and give you feedback. They will be able to point out things that you may have forgotten to mention or areas that do not make sense to them. Keep in mind that they may not only have things to say about the story itself; they may have comments about the grammar as well. For example, a sentence that sounds fine to you may actually be worded awkwardly., Whether you would like to be paid for your story or not will dictate what avenue of publication you pursue. If you want to share your work without compensation, there are websites that will allow you to publish your work for free.If you decide that you’d like to be paid for your story, consider sending your story to a publishing company (and some magazines) or self-publish your text., Remember, once something is on the internet, it can never be truly erased, so consider your options before sharing your work digitally. When you sell your story, you’re actually selling the rights to publish your work, not ownership of the story. There are different rules and rights depending on which country you’re in, so make sure to look up what options are available for you. Until you’re certain what route you’d like to pursue, though, don’t share your work digitally with others., Consider if you want to be published in a magazine, or part of an anthology, or perhaps your novel will stand alone. Also, consider if you want an agent or if you’d like to represent yourself in negotiations over your work.You can hire an agent who will do the work of contacting editors and negotiating compensation for you.
You can also self-publish, which will require that you cover the cost of the publication.
You can represent yourself and contact publishing houses and editors directly.

, Create stuff directly from the script. If the script says the characters are lost in the forest, make the scene a forest. Include every little detail that you can think of.

, At the rehearsal when they say the love each other, if they don't sound sincere, Immediately correct that. If they aren't sincere in the final show or the book, that could result in a major problem.

, Or, you can just change up the essence of the scene. Make sure that your characters are being themselves in the scene,and not just how you picture a sweet scene working out. Keep them in place while they're in the scene, and remember what they want from life.

, That can be awkward, and some people don't really want to read that anyway. Just think about your audience. It can even be something like, 'he brushed his lips lightly over her hair, and she looked up into his eyes suddenly leaning into him as their lips met.'

, Writing is a ton of fun to do-don't be afraid to make it as amazing or as weird as you'd like!

Contemplate your organization's vision.,
Write a mission statement.,
Evaluate your organization's current standing.,
List factors necessary to success.,
Develop a strategy for accomplishing each success factor.,
Prioritize your strategies according to viability and growth goals.",How to Write a Strategic Plan for an Organization," Identify what your organization stands for, what it hopes to accomplish, what its responsibilities are, what segment of the population it wishes to cater to and work with, how it wants to be viewed and what type of growth it wants to experience.;
, The purpose of your mission statement is to summarize your organization's underlying purpose, or vision. Strategic plans are extensions of the mission statement, as it is the mission statement that guides the goals and serves as a means of measuring an organization's success. An example of a mission statement is, ""It is our goal to be the nation's leading pet supply chain. We will accomplish this by researching, sourcing and providing for our customers the best available variety of low-cost, high-quality goods, and by exceeding customer service expectations in a way that will foster strong relationships with our customers.""

, In order to plot out a course for reaching your goals, you must first understand where you are in the process of reaching those goals. Consider the following:


Determine what your strengths and weaknesses are. You will need to develop a strategic plan that makes use of your strengths in order to minimize your weaknesses.
Identify opportunities for growth. You may have a couple of investor offers on the table, or foresee an especially successful fundraising effort. Whatever your organization's purpose, you must be able to list viable opportunities for reaching your goals so that you can include in your strategic planning the means with which you will seize and make the most of those opportunities.
Pinpoint threats to the success of your strategic plans. Threats may be in the form of an economic recession, an industry competitor or a change in government regulations. Your plan must address these threats and counter them with a viable strategy.

, Strategic plans must include specifics about the types of circumstances that will lead to the accomplishment of goals.


Keep in mind 4 key focus areas when envisioning your objectives: financial goals, customer relations, operational methods and organization members.
Citing the pet supply example, critical success factors might include things like relationships with quality pet supply distributors, a competent customer care team, a strong Internet presence providing round-the-clock services on a national level, state-of-the art accounting software and a research team devoted to finding the latest, greatest pet supplies.

, This should be in the form of a step-by-step plan, and should outline exactly what needs to be done, in what time frame, for how much of an investment and by which responsible party.

, Taking into account all of the steps that are necessary to achieving each of your goals, as well as the order of importance in reaching those goals, itemize your strategic plan chronologically. For example, your goal of running your own fleet of trucks for delivery purposes may be considered a long term goal, as it will be very costly and you already have a temporary plan in place via shipment through third party entities; therefore, you may prioritize more urgent goals higher on the list.

Try to chose your topic wisely.,
Know your subject through and through.,
Choose a character you love.,
Do not restrain yourself.,
Think in details and atmosphere.,
Think outside the box.,
Be concise but witty.,
Practice.,
Do not believe that your story is good because you put the word end on it.,
Think hard before you put up any writing material online.,
Don’t limit yourself to one genre.,
Know the difference between a parody and a squib.",How to Write a Great Parody," Do not rush into a subject that you cannot handle very well or into the too controversial one. A Donald Trump parody may feel great, but you’ll probably get too personal or overly insulting. A spoof isn’t an excuse for shooting someone down; it’s a very smart, funny and witty way to put the finger where it hurts, but in an elegant manner.


Do not err in the opposite direction either: a parody about your grandma would be very funny for you, but what about your readers? Unless you are a genius (but we’ll dismiss this prospect), there is no fun in describing the dear old lady who looks like an owl when she wears her reading glasses. Who cares? You? Well, but are you the center of the universe? Probably not.;
, There is no point in depicting Batman as a worshiper of the Greek gods. What the hell will you do with that? In case you are thinking of a Batman parody, it would be better to opt for something quite close to the character, like making cute needlework between two rescues of the world and selling it for a charity.

, As it was already said, a parody isn’t something mean, it’s a funny way to show another side of a genre or a fictional hero. In literature, the best spoofs ever made were the creation of authors who loved the characters or the genre. J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings was parodied in the novel Bored of the Rings and has become an institution. It’s a great source of inspiration for any beginner in the spoof arena.


Star Warped is the parody novel retelling all six of the Star Wars films features chapters such as  ""Episode I: The Fans-of-Tron Menace"". It also has a Yoda in lederhosen, yodeling tidbits of wisdom.
A sappy novel parody is an excellent way to get you started. Try to read some very watery stuff from the Harlequin collection, take some notes of the typical characters, those incredibly beautiful girls supported by unlikely manly heroes. Imagine the golden boy madly in love with the mean girl of the story and the nice one making the silliest things on earth to attract his attention. You didn’t do it right if you do not laugh out loud when you reread it!

, Most beginners tend to write like they are walking on eggshells. They polish nice sentences without any meaning and seem to be afraid of putting down what they really feel. It’s quite normal but you should really let loose and write freely what you have in mind, even if it’s not very well written. You have plenty of time to edit later on.

, At this stage of the writing process, you should feel the atmosphere. Are you writing a Stephen King parody? Are you thinking about a specific novel? Maybe you love Dracula and are thinking about this poor guy loosing his canines and being handled by a very clumsy dentist. A good writer has a sense of what’s going on in his mind and is able to see it very clearly, a little bit like a movie going through his head.


Try to be more aware of your surrounding. Writers are experts when it comes to tiny details that nobody else has ever noticed. It makes the salt of the story. A parody is like a magnifying glass: your character has suddenly very strange quirks, but they are as funny as hell because they stay very close to the hero. For example, Frankenstein is a model for the Detroit Auto Show, Sherlock Holmes is a happy fool high on old smelly socks, Hercule Poirot is struggling with an eating disorder and James Bond has no sense of humor at all.

, You are not restricted to household name heroes or fictional characters. You can imagine many other kind of parodies. Let’s say that you are a huge America’s Got Talent fan. Owen, Heidi, Mel and Howie, the nice four judges, aren’t probably as sleek as they look like. You could make a witty (but still kind) spoof about a memorable audition. Put yourself in their shoes and try to sense how it feels when you are condemned to watch some farting, burping or vomiting guys. Turn the show upside down, put the contestants on the judges seats and let them decide of their talent. Here, you can have some great fun, as you’re able to predict how the judges would react when they are put on the spot.

, Imagination, observation skills and a good knowledge of the characters aren’t enough to make a great parody. Let’s take again the Batman example: the dear fellow is knitting a cute pink jumper for underprivileged children after saving the life of a bank clerk robbed by a bunch of scoundrels. He needs some TLC and next to him, on the top of the skyscraper where he found a shelter, Superman is arguing with Catwoman about cherry ice-cream. Show that the life of a hero can be quite petty too. Do it in a smooth manner. Your style has to stay smooth, your words should flow like a river. You need to describe everything in a few sharp sentences. Endless descriptions will kill the wit of the genre and your readers won’t like it anymore.

, You’ll find the right pace for the story when you’ve practiced a lot of writing. One day, you will be able to write a complete and great short story in only one day. You’ll throw yourself in it like a duck in water and feel far more joy than when you were in love.

, Anything you write should be read and reviewed many times. The best thing to do if you want to hone your writing skills is to to put your spoof away in a drawer and to read it again a few weeks later. It’s probably very good if it still makes you laugh.

, It’s the best way to sadden you, especially on social media, where people are often unfiltered in their response. A good writer can take feedback but it also his own comfort, admirer and critic. Such a level of confidence requires a lot of practice and curiosity. You’ll never write anything good if you aren’t able to work alone and with dedication. Writing is your haven and your own world; cherish it!

, Flexibility is the trade of smartness and many good writers didn’t publish always the same kind of books. Get educated, read some famous biographies about good writers and see why they enjoyed so many different styles of storytelling. Do not write to be famous. Writing is a pleasure, not a means for fame.

, The latter is a very angry and sarcastic  piece of literature meant to hurt and to increase awareness. Squibs are very rarely novels; they are rather essays about controversial topics. Make some research before starting any kind of writing.

Decide what your myth explains.,
Think about including a lesson.,
Turn your idea into something fantastical.,
Create a hero.,
Add flaws to your hero.,
Brainstorm magical ideas.,
Write in simple, straightforward language.,
Write in mythological style.,
Introduce the setting and main character.,
Create a reason for the main character to do something.,
Continue the story.,
Finish the myth.,
Read it aloud while editing.",How to Write a Myth," Many myths explain why an event occurs, how something was first created, or why people should act a certain way. Here are some examples from real myths:


Why does the moon wax and wane?
Why do vultures have bald heads?
Why do people prepare and eat foods in certain ways, or on certain holidays?;
, Some myths explain why people should or shouldn't behave in certain ways. This can be a straightforward lesson with a moral at the end, but more often, the reader picks up on the lesson by seeing good actions rewarded, and evil or foolish actions punished. Here are a few ideas that you could use as the main focus of your work, if you like this approach:


The hero succeeds only when he follows the advice of elders or gods — or alternatively, only when he is self-reliant.
The hero must be clever to succeed, solving problems in creative ways.
Some myths even teach that luck can be more important than skill. It can be fun to hear about an ""ordinary"" person who gets rewarded, or entertaining to hear about a complete fool who somehow becomes king., Your myth can be silly or serious, but it should involve something that doesn't happen in the real world. For example, a volcano might erupt because giants underground left the barbecue on. A hero might be forced to learn to care about people after an evil serpent turns his family into trees.


If you're having trouble coming up with a mythological explanation for the topic you chose, write down a list of words that remind you of snow.If you want to explain how snowstorms happen, write down ""cold, wet, white, snowman, ice cream, clouds."" Maybe snowmen live in the sky and sneeze snow down to earth, or maybe the clouds try to give us ice cream that melts on the way down.

, The hero of the story is usually someone impressive and admirable, although as mentioned above, you can write about an ordinary person instead. Think about these questions as you write down ideas for your hero:


Is the hero super-strong, super-intelligent, or incredibly talented in one area? Some heroes have ""superpowers"" such as shooting a bow with perfect aim, or the ability to knock people over with the wind from their breath.
Why does your hero have these special talents, if any? Did the gods bless the hero, did the hero train hard, or was the hero just born that way? Which kind of person would you admire, or which do you think matches the real world best?

, For the sake of a good story, the hero should make mistakes sometimes. Here are some flaws you could choose from, that would cause this to happen:


The hero is overconfident, and ignores advice or turns down an offer of help.
The hero is greedy or lustful, and tries to steal or take something that doesn't belong to her.
The hero is arrogant, and thinks he's better than everyone else, or even better than the gods.

, Witches, gods, monsters, magical items, and imaginary places all make a myth entertaining and larger than life. You could set your myth in ancient Greece, and use characters like Hades or the Chimera, or you can invent your own.


If you're out of ideas, try reading collections of actual myths, or modern books that use mythological characters. Percy Jackson and the Olympians is a good example , Myths tell a story directly, as though it were relating fact. Avoid long, wandering sentences and detailed descriptions. Don't include your own, personal opinion, and present everything as fact.


This tends to make the plot move pretty quickly. In one version of the Herakles myth, the hydra is introduced, tracked down, and killed in just eight sentences., This is easiest to do by imitating the style of real myths, but you can easily use these following writing tricks to make your myth sound traditional:


Use iconic symbols. These vary between traditions, but often include the numbers 3 and 7, animals like the raven or the seal, or characters like the prince or the trapped faerie.
Use the same structure for several sentences in a row. For example: ""Seven days he went up into the sky, and seven days he walked down to go to Xibalbá; seven days he was transformed into a snake ...; seven days he was transformed into an eagle.""Give people a short, descriptive epithet. This is especially popular in Greek epics, which often use epithets that refer to other stories, such as ""Dionysus the wolf-repeller"" or ""Apollo, carrier of the bay branches."", People usually know they're listening to a myth even before the first couple sentences are finished. Here are some ways you can accomplish this:


Set the myth in the distant past, or a distant land. Think of all the stories you know that begin ""Once upon a time,"" ""Far, far away,"" or even ""A long, long time ago.""
Describe the kind of hero people expect in myths. For instance, a youngest brother, a king, or a woodcutter are all common heroes in folk tales. For more epic myths, start with a famous hero or a goddess instead.

, You could start out describing the point of your story, explaining for instance that Coyote decided to steal fire to give to people. It's a more interesting story, however, if the character has a reason for behaving the way he does. Here are a few examples:


Coyote notices people shivering in winter, and they plead for a way to warm themselves.
A queen ignores her suffering subjects. The gods send a plague to her daughter, and the queen must learn to help people in exchange for their assistance to cure her daughter.

, The middle of the myth is up to you, and there are no rules you have to follow. Keep writing the story, keeping in mind the phenomenon or moral lesson you're trying to explain. If you get stuck, move the story along with one of the following:


Introduce a new character. This can be a god, a spirit, a talking animal, or an elder. The character might describe the next challenge to come and how to overcome it, or give the hero a magical item that he can use later.
Create a new challenge. Just when everything is looking good again, have the hero make a mistake, or send a monster to undo the hero's good work. This is useful if you want the story to go on longer.

, Continue writing until you've finished your explanation, or until the hero has defeated all the challenges and learned her lesson. Often, a myth ends with a sentence explaining why the story is related to the present day. Here are some invented examples:


""And that's why the sun gets hotter and bright every summer.""
""And ever since then, people brush their teeth to a shine every night, so the tooth-stealing goblins are scared by their own hideous reflection.""

, Once you think your myth is almost finished, read it aloud to yourself or to a friend. Some phrases might sound better on paper than they do out loud, and myths are usually written to be shared as a spoken story. Go through it and correct spelling and grammar mistakes as well, then have a friend take a second look in case you missed something.

, Thinking of the plot as you go along is perfectly fine, but you *will* have to do some editing later on.

, This diagram gives you a visual aid to the basic outline of your story. First, you will need to draw an up-side-down ""v"" shape on a piece of paper. Hold the paper sideways, so that it is in ""landscape"" form.

, They both should be about 3 or so inches long.

, Underneath it, write out the name of your protagonist, and a trait that makes them distinctive. Do the same for the antagonist. Then list the other important characters and their interaction with the protagonist or antagonist.

,, Remember, this is the biggest event in your story.

, Then comes the falling action. This is usually the last conflict that the protagonist encounters, and towards the end of the story, where he defeats the antagonist. This will be on the right side of the ""v"" on the witch's hat.

, Finally, there is the resolution. This is the ending of the story, where all the conflicts are resolved. This is on the right horizontal line of the diagram.


This is what the final product should look like. The witch's hat diagram is good for novels+ and short stories. NOT for books that are in or part of a series.

Revise your draft.",How to Write a Psychological Horror Story," To write a good psychological horror story, you need to dig deep and write about something that you find terrifying or disturbing. Ask yourself, What scares me the most? What moment or moments in my life made me feel disturbed or unsettled? You may then end up using your most terrifying thoughts or experiences as inspiration for your story.For example, maybe you have an intense fear of losing your grip on reality and hurting someone close to you. You may then use this fear as inspiration for your story about a character who loses their sense of reality and spirals out of control.;
, Your horror story will be much stronger if you have a main character that seems unique and compelling. Your main character should also be flawed and have a distinct personality on the page. Having a compelling main character will keep your reader engaged.Your main character may have an internal flaw, like a struggle with self-esteem or jealous around others. The character may also have difficulty with an external flaw, like a physical ailment or a physical trait they find unattractive.
For example, your main character may be a young girl who is struggling with puberty. She may struggle to make friends in high school and relate to other girls her age because she is seen as a freak or a weirdo. She may have a preference for disturbing stories of the insane and the mad.

, Your story should focus on horror that is psychological, rather than gory or bloody. Though there can still be blood in your horror story, of course. You may include psychological elements like madness, mania, mental illness, or a personal life crisis that leads to a psychic break. You may then gift your main character with one of these psychological elements and write about their experiences dealing with a disturbed psyche.For example, perhaps your main character is triggered by an intense moment with a bully at school. She may then start to lose her sense of reality. She may make choices or decisions that she would not make otherwise if she were not in a disturbed state of mind.

, To get a better sense of the genre, you may read popular examples of psychological horror. You may look for these texts online or at your local library. You may read several examples, including:House of Leaves by Mark Z. Danielewski.

We Have Always Lived in the Castle by Shirley Jackson.

It by Stephen King.

The Yellow Wallpaper by Charlotte Perkins Gilman.

Rebecca by Daphne Du Maurier.

, Psychological horror focuses more on the inner workings of your main character rather than external forces like a monster or creature in the woods. To keep your story engaging, you should try to create an unsettling atmosphere or mood. Add in elements to your story that create a sense of foreboding, where the reader feels something bad or twisted is waiting just around the corner.You can create a terrifying atmosphere by including details that feel slightly off or unsettling to the reader. Twist what seems normal into something disturbing and surreal. Add a dash of horror to even the most everyday experiences and events.
For example, you may add a strange twist to your main character’s day at high school where her experiences seem a little unsettling or off. Maybe she opens her locker to find a pile of someone else’s hair or perhaps she looks out the window in class to see a girl who looks just like her across the street.

, A big element in horror stories is that bad things happen to good people, often over and over again. You should be willing to let bad or evil things happen to your characters, especially your main character, in your story. This will add to the stakes of the story and make the reader sympathize with your main character.You may try to set up your character to experience terror or horror in their life in degrees, starting with a small thing that goes bad and working up to a larger thing that goes terribly wrong. You may also have other characters around your main character experience bad things, creating a general sense of drama in your story.
For example, you may have a main character who makes poor decisions due to her disturbed state of mind. She may become violent or lash out at others, leading to bad things happening to those closest to her.

, You should do your best to avoid cliches in your writing and come up with unique details and descriptions. One way to do this is to focus on the five senses in every scene or moment of your story, describing how something feels, sounds, tastes, smells, and looks to your characters. Using sensory details in your writing can also make the more disturbing moments of your psychological horror story come alive and feel real to your reader.For example, you may describe a character’s experience of a manic episode as “feeling like the world was split in two and I was on the side of darkness and confusion.”
You may also try to describe the way blood smells or tastes, rather than lean on familiar descriptions of blood as “crimson red” or “scarlet.” You may describe blood as “bitter and metallic” or “wet, red rivets that pooled around my sneakers.”

, You should try to avoid falling into common cliches as you write, especially when you are writing horror. Psychological horror is full of common cliches, or situations that have become so familiar they lose all meaning. A house that is alive, a woman on the verge of a nervous breakdown or a family with a deep, dark secret in the attic are all familiar story lines in horror that have been done before. You should try to avoid cliche scenarios and descriptions, striving instead for a story that feels specific and unique to your point of view.

One way to avoid these cliches is to take a situation that is familiar and making it personal to you and your perspective as a writer. Maybe you add a twist to a cliche story line, such as a family with a deep, dark secret that is revealed at the very beginning of the story, leaving the characters to deal with the aftermath in the present. Or perhaps you make your ""woman on the verge of a nervous breakdown"" specific to your experience of anxiety or a friend's experience of trauma so the story feels more specific and nuanced.

, Your horror story should include an ending that feels disturbing or slightly off. You may include a twist in your ending or build up to an intense image that leaves the reader unsettled. Having a strong, disturbing ending can leave your reader perfectly creeped out, an ideal landing point for your horror story.You may decide to make a plot outline for your story to help you build up to a disturbing ending. You can use a plot diagram or the snowflake method to create the plot outline.
For example, you may have a main character who does not realize she had a psychic break until the very end of the story. The big, unsettling twist may be that your main character finally realizes that all of her visions were made up in her head.

, Once you have a first draft, you should polish it so it becomes stronger. Read your first draft out loud from beginning to end. Listen to how each sentence flows into one another. Notice if there are certain passages that are confusing or unclear. Pay attention to any moments in the story that feel disturbing to you.You may underline or mark any sections that need to be reworked or revised. You may also highlight any sentences that seem to work for you, as you can then try to figure out how other areas can work just as well.

, You should find one or two sympathetic readers to look over your first draft. You may read the story out loud to them or give them a copy that they can then read on their own. You may then ask your readers for feedback on your story.Be willing to accept constructive feedback from others. Getting your story critiqued by attentive readers can make it that much stronger.

, Once you have received feedback on your story, you should take the time to revise it. You may work sentence by sentence or work on passages that need the most work first, followed by passages that need a medium or minimal amount of revising.Once you have revised your story, you may show it to your readers again to determine if you are that much closer to a finished draft.

You will soon find out what you can write about to make the best story! You may want to ask other people about their ideas about the world around them, as this story is going to be for many audiences, so don't base your tale on just your opinions. You can never put too much time, effort or description into your story. Here are some great ways to gather details that may lead you to a short story:


Read a book. Experience helps. Reading is good for the brain, it can help educate you on what a well published book looks like. Of course, there are millions of books out there, but try going to your local library and searching for books that may fit your interests. Every book and person is different. Maybe the book will give you some good sentence starters, inspiration, and the type of text you want to write. Make sure to read a wide variety to grow your vocabulary. The next thing you know, you'll have the premise for a terrific tale.
Notice interesting character traits. Maybe you have noticed that your neighbour likes to talk to his plants or that he takes his cat for a walk every morning. This, again, is working with the world around you. Is your sister geeky? Maybe have a geeky character based on her persona. Try thinking about the inner life of this kind of person and see if a story develops.
Pay attention to your surroundings. Take a walk or spend some time sitting in a park and observing and see what you can find. Maybe you'll see a bouquet of roses sitting next to a gutter, or a brand-new pair of sneakers on a park bench. How did they get there? Ponder, daydream!
Listen to people when they talk. Just one interesting sentence that you hear in passing can inspire you to write an entire story. Maybe you'll hear someone say, ""Nobody gets me......"" or ""My dog likes to torture all the men I date..."" Is that enough to start a story? Sure!;
, This is another great way to start a short story. When you pay attention to the world, you should also pay attention not only to the realities of the world, but to the possibilities of the world. When you do pay attention to a story you hear or an image you see, ask yourself, ""But what if it happened like this instead?"" or ""What would this person do if..."" Following this line of thinking can lead you to explore the mysteries that are haunting you.


You don't have to know the ending of a story when you start. In fact, not knowing everything about a story before you start writing it will lead you to explore more creative possibilities and will make your story stronger.
The ""what if"" scenario can be practical or completely fantastical. You can ask yourself, ""What if my dog started talking to me?"" or, ""What if the neighbor who fawns over my dog too much kidnapped her one day?""

, Though short story writing falls under the category of fiction writing, many short stories are heavily autobiographical. If you're writing about something that actually happened to you or someone you know, then that's considered non-fiction writing, but getting inspired by experiences you actually had and then taking them to a new and fictional level is a great plan for writing a short story, especially if you feel that you have ""nothing to write about.""


Many people say that you should ""write what you know."" One school of thought is that if you grew up on a farm in Arkansas or if you spent ten years trying to be a painter in Iceland, you should write about those experiences instead of trying to guess what it would be like for someone to grow up in a place you've never been.
Some writers say that you should ""write what you don't know about what you know."" This means that you should start off on familiar territory and then start exploring something that left you feeling curious or that you didn't know much about.
If you get too comfortable with writing about things that actually happened, you won't have room for creativity. For example, maybe you had a childhood friend who moved away one day without telling a soul, or maybe you were fascinated by a Ferris-wheel operator as a kid and always wondered what happened to him. Explore this world and then make it up.

, Always be on the lookout for stories that your friends or family members have told that would make great fiction. If your mother or grandmother are always telling you stories about their childhoods, start writing them down. Try to imagine what it was like to grow up in a different time or place and start writing out the possibilities. Don't be put off if you don't know everything about that time period; you can always do your research.


When one of your friends says, ""You won't believe what happened to me last week..."" pay attention. You could have the beginning of a short story right there.
The story could come from an unlikely place. Maybe a radio DJ is reminiscing about his childhood in just a few sentences, and you find yourself suddenly fascinated by what his life must have been like.
Just be warned: if you get a reputation of a writer who ""steals"" the stories people tell him and uses them for fiction, then people may be more hesitant to open up to you.

, A story can come from a strong sense of place. By this stage you should know what type of story you are writing. Maybe a Sci-Fy story could be set in an underground laboratory, or a horror tale in a dilapidated shack. You don't have to get inspired by a breathtaking beach or by your amazing vacation to Venice. Instead, get inspiration from the ordinary. Think about what it was like to spend every summer on your grandmother's apple orchard as a kid; remember what it was like to hang out in your best friend's basement back in high/secondary/grammar school.


Writing about the place can lead you to develop interesting characters and conflicts.

, Writing exercises have helped a lot of writers develop their creativity, find inspiration in unlikely places, and to force themselves to write when they feel like they have ""no ideas."" You can start with a daily warm-up writing exercise just for 10-15 minutes to get your mind going, or even write for an hour based on the exercise even if you don't feel inspired at all. Here are some great writing exercises to get you started:Start a story with the following opening sentence: ""I've never told this to anyone before."" If your story is not told first person, maybe start it with, ""She shut the door. Tears streamed down her face. Had he just deceived her?""
Look at a picture of an ordinary barn in a field. Then, describe it from the point of view of someone who has just committed murder. Do this again from the point of view of a girl who has just lost her mother. See how a character's thoughts can influence how he sees the world. Put yourselves in the characters shoes!
Just write for 10-15 minutes. Look back at what you've written to fix mistakes.
Pick a person in your life who you absolutely dislike. Now, try writing a story from that person's point of view. Try to make the reader sympathize with him as much as possible. Remember-it's your story!
Let a character surprise you. Write about a character that you seem to know pretty well, and then let this person do something that completely throws you off guard. See where this takes you. This makes your story more intriguing.
The argument. Have two characters arguing about something completely mundane, like who is going to take out the trash, or who will pay for the movie. Make it clear that this argument is really about something bigger and more serious, such as who is going to end the relationship, or who has been giving too much and not getting anything back. Try to let the dialogue do all the work. Don't make it boring though.
Body language. Write 500 words that describe two characters who are sitting next to each other. Without using dialogue, let the reader see exactly how these two characters feel about each other.

, If you want to be able to master the short story, then you should read as many short stories as you can. You should read both the classics and the contemporary masters, and use the writing of others to inspire you to write some short stories of your own. Here are some contemporary and classic short stories that can inspire you to write more short stories of your own:


Chekhov's ""The Lady with the Little Dog""
Edgar Allan Poe's ""The Cask of Amontillado""
Ernest Hemingway's ""A Clean, Well-Lighted Place""
Eudora Welty's ""A Worn Path""
Raymond Carver's ""Cathedral""
Isaac Asimov's ""The Dead Past""
Ray Bradbury's ""The Veldt""
Tim O'Brien's ""The Things They Carried""
Alice Munro's ""The Beggar Maid""
Jamaica Kincaid's ""Girl""
Joyce Carol Oates' ""Where Are You Going, Where Have You Been?""
Jhumpa Lahiri's ""A Temporary Matter""
Junot Diaz's ""How to Date a Brown Girl, Black Girl, White Girl, or Halfie""
Malorie Blackman's ""Cloud busting"".
Franz Kafka's ""The Metamorphosis""

, Writing classes are a great way to learn about the skill of writing good books and stories. Find a class focusing on writing generally or within a field of interest to you. Writing stories can come in many forms, from kid's books to even articles in a magazine.

, Also practice writing out emotions, feelings and reactions. A good writer knows how to describe all of these in the most creative ways. Try practicing describing things around you.


For example, suppose you have purple curtains. What do the curtains look like? What do they remind you of? Where are they located in the room?
However, don't be overly descriptive, as too much description can slow down a story. Just try to paint a realistic picture in the reader's mind.

, No one likes to read something that is lacks interest or sparks the curiosity. Use unique words. Skim through the dictionary and find words that catch your eye. Or, listen to your favorite show. Be fun, make the reader want more of your work. The goal is to catch the reader's eye, and make them want to read more.

, Make sure the reader can understand what you are writing. Talking ""like dis"" may confuse the reader, and when you are writing a proper book, you want to use more advanced words and avoid the ""ye old"" typos. However, if your character talks ""like dis"", keep it all within quotation marks and be true to your character's real speaking and thinking voice.

, If writing is a passion, then share the passion as a genuine storyteller who is immersed in the tale. Write what you like and what you think is good for your story. Learn to write through your heart.


Listen to constructive criticism and know when it's helpful to improving your writing skills. Also know when it's just griping or jealousy. You'll grow to know this with practice.

, Most short stories are written in first, second, or third-person point-of-views. If you're starting out, you should stick to just one point-of-view. Here are the three points-of-view and how they are used:


The first person. The first person is told directly from the perspective of a character who uses ""I"" to refer to himself. ""I've never told anyone this before,"" is an example of first-person writing. First person is great if you want to stick closely to a character's thoughts and perspective, but it can be limiting if that character's perspective is too limiting. First-person may be the easiest perspective to use if you're just starting out.
The third person. The third person is when you write about a character using ""he"" or ""she"" from an outside perspective, such as saying, ""He was tired."" In the third person, the author can get close to a character's thoughts or can be more distant from the character.
The second person. The second person addresses the reader directly as ""You."" As in, ""You are walking into your office."" This can be a great technique for grabbing the reader, but it can be a bit overdone.

, Every short story should have a plot that grips the reader, leading him to ask what will happen next. This doesn't mean that your story should include a high-speed chase or a murder; your readers can want to know what happen next even if all that's happening is that two people are talking over coffee. Though every short story is different, here are some basic elements of a short story:


The rising action/exposition: this typically comes at the beginning of a short story, when readers are introduced to the main characters, the setting, and the central conflict. However, some stories start off right in the middle of the action and make the readers work backwards to find out what's really going on.
The conflict: the stakes of the story. There has to be something at stake in every story, or the reader won't want to keep reading, no matter how beautiful the language may be. Every story needs conflict or a point of tension; it can be as dramatic as two men fighting over the same women, or a girl wondering if her friend is going to invite her to a party. The nature of the conflict isn't important -- what's important is that the readers have to care what happens.
The falling action: the resolution of the story. After the conflict is resolved or discussed, the story has to wrap up. But most short stories don't have neat happy endings, or even neat endings at that. Many stories end on a word or image that leaves the reader thinking. If the story is neatly ""wrapped up"" at the end, then you've removed some of the mystery and allure.

, Your story has to have a character or characters that your readers should care about and even root for, even if the characters aren't upstanding citizens or good-natured people. You can characterize your characters through a number of different ways and all of them are valid. Here are a few ways to give your readers a strong sense of your characters:


Describe what they say. The perfect line of dialogue can shed insight into a character's intentions -- especially if the dialogue doesn't match what he's thinking.
Describe what they do. Does the character get up at six every morning without an alarm, or does he spend hours hitting the ""snooze"" button before he gets up? Every little action can help build the character, however insignificant it seems at first.
Describe what they look like. Does the character dress to the nines when he goes to the supermarket, or smile maniacally during a moment of deep sadness? A character's physical appearance can shed insight into his mental state.
Describe how they interact with others. Is your character debilitatingly shy, or so bossy that everyone around him is afraid to open his mouth? Is he nice to waiters because his mother was a waitress, or is he a jerk to all waitresses because a waitress once broke his heart, or just because he feels like it? Seeing a character out in the world can reveal a lot about him.

, Dialogue marks the words that characters say, which are usually placed inside quotation marks. Dialogue can reveal a lot about a character both from the things that the character says and the things he chooses to not say. You should find dialogue that sounds like it can be spoken by real people instead of sounding too fancy or forced. Read your dialogue aloud to see if it actually sounds like something a person would say.


The dialogue between two characters can also shed a lot of insight into their dynamic.
Pay attention to what is not said as well. For example, if a little boy is upset that his father missed his baseball game, if he doesn't even bring up the game when they next see each other and says, ""How was work?"" instead, that can reveal a lot about him.
Avoid giving your dialogue obtrusive tags, such as saying, ""Mary stated..."" instead of ""Mary said...""

, The setting of a short story can be crucial or it can have very little to do with the events that unfold. If your story is set in a generic house that has little to do with the story, then fine. But if a character's mistress breaks into the house that he shares with his wife, then every little detail is important, because it can shed light onto the character's relationship with his wife -- and what his mistress thinks about it. Decide how much your setting should matter and develop it accordingly.


Even if the setting isn't so crucial to the story, avoid confusing the reader and let him know where the events are taking place, even if it's just a cow town in Illinois, or a non-descript high school in the middle of nowhere.
The time period can be considered part of the setting. If your story is set in the 1960s, give your reader enough clues, or say it outright, so he doesn't spend half the story thinking it's taking place in the present.

, In writing, voice is the unique way that the words are written that show that they can be written by only you. Your words should have their own quirks, rhythm, and cadence, and no one should be able to duplicate them. At the beginning, it's natural for short story writers to try to imitate their favorite short story writers. But as you move forward as a short story writer, you should find a unique way to express your thoughts and ideas.



Voice describes the way the author's words sound, not just the way the words of a character sound. Every word that is put down in a short story contributes to the voice of the author.

, Though there are a few guidelines, there are no hard and fast rules about what makes a good short story and what makes a bad short story. Still, you can improve your chances of writing a successful short story by avoid some of the common mistakes made by short story writers. Here are some things to think about as you move forward with your short story:


Avoid ""the information dump."" Don't tell your reader everything you think he needs to know right when the story starts. If you spend three pages describing the characters and action before anything actually happens, your reader will get weary.
Avoid the trick ending. No one likes to read a story only to find out that it was all a dream, or that it was told from the point of view of an alien the whole time. O. Henry was famous for such endings, but by now it's seen as cliché.
Keep it simple. You may think that using floral, elevated language to write a short story is the way to go. If you're writing a story about high society life in an ornate castle, then this may be your best bet, but for most concepts, it's best to keep it short and simple.
Avoid exposition in dialogue. Narration, non-dialogue, should tell your readers the basic information about the story. Dialogue should be used to provide more information about the characters and their struggles and relationships, but not to give ""the facts"" of the story. For example, a character should not say, ""Sam, though you are twenty years old and this is your second year at Harvard..."" because this is something that both characters already know.
Keep the stakes of the story clear. Any reader should be able to answer ""What's at stake?"" while he's reading your story and after he's done. If a reader finishes the story and has no idea what was at stake, then the story has failed.

, Give your story a break -- even if it's only for a day. Then, read it with new eyes, and try to see it as a reader instead of as a writer. As a reader, which sentences would you find unnecessary or confusing? Which facts would you need to know more about? Which plot points are too obvious or too complicated? Reading your own work with fresh eyes can give you a fresh perspective on what needs to be changed.


Sometimes just printing out a story that you've been writing in a Word Document can help you see it from a new perspective.
If you really want to improve the story but are completely stumped, try setting it aside for a month or two. You'll be surprised by how much insight you'll gain during this period.
Setting your work aside for a little while is a good move, but don't set it aside for so long that you lose interest in it.

, If you're ready to take your story out into the world, you can share it with a close friend, a fellow writer, an English teacher, or even a group of fellow writers. Make sure you don't ask for an opinion on the story before it's fully formed, or you may feel stifled by the criticism. Joining a writing workshops with like-minded individuals who are seriously committed to good writing can help you gain a new perspective on your own work.


For feedback to be helpful, you have to be receptive to it. If you think you've written the most perfect story in the world, then you won't actually hear a word anyone says.
Make sure you're giving your story to the right readers. If you're writing science fiction but have handed your story to your writer friend, who has never actually read science fiction before, then you may not get the best feedback.

, There are many different ways to revise a story, and it all depends on what the first draft of your story looks like and how much work you may have left to do. Many stories can take ten or more drafts to get right, so don't get discouraged if you feel like you have to change everything in your story. As you revise your work, here are some things to think about:


The need for a change in point-of-view. You may have thought your story worked best in the first person, but on a second read, you may see that the third person would have been better for the story you wanted to tell.
Cutting down on the wordiness. A good rule of thumb is to cut 250 words from the story (provided that it's at least ten pages long) after you're convinced you're done. You'd be surprised by how much unnecessary verbiage you may find.
Cut down on the confusion. Ask yourself if you would completely understand what was going on if you didn't write the story yourself. Maybe the concepts of the story were crystal-clear to you, but your readers could be utterly confused.
Make sure you include feelings, sounds, etc. Feelings make a story alive. After all, what's a story without feelings?
Do more research if necessary. If you're writing a story set in the West Village in New York City in the 60s and find that you don't actually know as much as you thought you did about this time period, it'll be time to hit the books to learn enough to write a convincing story about this era.
Be persistent. When you get frustrated, remind yourself that no first draft of a story is ever very good -- but that if you write a second, third, and even a fourth draft, that you have the potential to write an amazing short story.

Edit the report.",How to Write an Industry Analysis Report," You might examine the industry as a whole or an industry segment which targets a particular subset of the general market. For example, you could be investigating the petrochemical industry as a whole, or a narrower niche, like US petroleum refineries. In either case, you’ll need to identify the companies that offer services or products similar to those which your company offers.You might also need to conduct some cross-industry research. For example, a game developer may need to compile statistics on the console gaming market, PC gaming market, and handheld gaming market.;
, Government databases contain huge volumes of statistical information on various economic sectors. Some of the best government sources in the United States for industry statistics include the Market and Industry Analysis Statistics published by the United States Census, the Department of the Treasury, FedStats.gov, EconomicIndicators.gov, and the Food and Drug Administration. All publish useful reports and statistics.


For other countries, consult federal databases and agencies within your nation, or conduct an internet search with keywords like “government statistics ” to locate relevant information.

, At least two independent research reports with data on your market should be consulted. Contact private data-collection agencies or industry interest groups for a published report or market analysis relevant to your research.


You can also consult experts within your own company. Just bear in mind that their views may be biased or unreliable.

, There may be more than one trade association for your industry. For instance, if you’re in the computer industry, you might consult or request recent industry-wide reports from the Computer & Communications Industry Association, the Association for Interactive Marketing, or the Information Systems Security Association. Whatever your industry, consult trade groups and industry publications to identify info which can provide background info on your industry analysis., Check academic databases such as Google Scholar for published studies on your area of interest. The Encyclopedia of Emerging Industries and the Encyclopedia of American Industries, both published by Gale Research, are also good sources., Make special note of annual revenues in the industry, number of involved companies, workforce statistics, etc. Find statistics about the size of the customer base and buying trends. Cross-check your information against other sources to ensure accuracy. Your industry analysis will be examined thoroughly when you present the final business proposal to investors or stockholders, so ensure your data is solid and sourced properly.

, To do this, you’ll need to know the relevant market size. The relevant market size is the company’s potential sales if it were to capture the entirety of its market niche. For instance, if you’re selling electric cars, your relevant market size is not all automobile drivers, or all people in the world who travel distances which make driving desirable, but rather the total of all electric car sales in a given year.


Be sure to carefully analyze any underlying assumptions that your market analysis relies upon. This is particular important for a new product or a product that is undergoing rapid acceptance.
Relevant market sizes should be calculated in both dollar amount and unit amount. In the foregoing example, the relevant market size might be $200 million per year, or 30,000 electric cars.

, Ask important questions which will help you consider industry trends up through the present. You should consider the impacts of globalization and technological innovation in addition to the more obvious factors like competition from other companies and consumer preferences. Regulatory conditions and the state of the economy at the global, national, and local levels should also be taken into account. Other questions to think about include:


How has the market size changed in the past year? the past five years? the past ten years?
What is the expected growth of the relevant market?
What factors will affect market growth? Are new demographics affecting the market? Are demographics changing?

, If you’re going into or expanding a microchip production line, for instance, you’re going to need several million dollars in equipment and machinery. On top of that, you’ll need computer engineers and programmers to produce and design the chips. Other firms will be competing not only for your customers, but for your employees as well. All of these are things to consider when addressing barriers to entry.

, Indicate their past business moves, their forthcoming products, and their marketing strategies. Include sourcing, manufacturing, and regulatory analyses. The company analysis should be as complete as possible; competitive advantages or disadvantages can arise from anywhere.


Does your competition engage in billboard, radio, TV, internet, or print ads? How many of each kind are effective? Address whether or not your company could meet or compete with their level of marketing.
Think about recent innovations or mistakes the competition has made. Learn from their failures, and improve on their successes.

, Using the framework you’ve built, with info regarding the competition, the barriers to expansion or implementation, industry trends, and availability of consumer attention, you can introduce how your company is positioned within the industry and compares with other companies. Include statistical information about your business and be honest about all the advantages and disadvantages that your firm faces.

, Open with a paragraph about the industry’s history. Write one or two paragraphs about the size, products, and geographic scope of the industry, including both manufacturing centers and consumer centers. Next, introduce your own company’s position within the larger industry context, and foreground how industry trends make the implementation of your business proposal desirable.


Determine what lifecycle stage the industry is in. Is it:Emerging? (very new industry growing at less than 5% per year)
Growing? (a state of steady growth a bit over 5% per year)
Shaking out? (a state in which companies are merging or consolidating, and/or other companies are failing)
Maturing? (growth is slowing to less than 5% per year)
Declining? (a state in which there has been no growth for a prolonged period)



, Indicate expected growth in the industry, trends in products and technology, and factors influencing competition. Describe the competitive landscape in a general way. The rest of the business plan will elaborate on the state of the competition.


Healthy industries are high-growth and generally profitable, with a stable customer base and few barriers to entry. Industries that should be avoided are those that are declining, generally unprofitable, highly competitive and regulated, or difficult to enter., The analysis should describe who the major customer groups are and the unique properties of each. What is the age of your target customer? What is their race and ethnicity? Their needs and wants?


Put yourself in the customer’s place. Think about what they see and experience when they first hear about or encounter your product or service. Consider how they think about their choices.
In addition to considering your current customer base, think about how you can expand your product or service to attract new customers or pull customers away from your competitors.

, Lay the strategy out in greater detail in the rest of your business proposal. Include a detailed timeline and specific goals, like revenues and market share, that you hope to attain. Address marketing strategies, product development ideas, and workforce issues which could position your company for growth within the industry.


You could close with a call to action. A statement like “Given the current state of the market, it is advisable to implement the following business proposal” followed by a rough outline of your proposal can function as a smooth transition into the rest of the plan.

, Pare the report down to an appropriate and manageable size. An industry analysis report typically runs two to three pages. Tweak the length of your report based on how it will be presented. If it is part of a business plan, it is better to keep the analysis short and to the point. If your report will be presented independently, you have more freedom to devote lots of space to raw data and detailed descriptions.

The public law library, typically located in your county courthouse, also has formbooks and samples of various legal documents, including contracts, statutes, and regulations, that you can use as guides.;
, Each government agency typically has its own rules that specify everything from font size and margins to the type of paper that your document must be printed on.For example, the federal government publishes a handbook with the formatting requirements for federal registry documents, including proposed rules and regulations. You can download a PDF copy of this handbook on the U.S. Archive's website.
While some formatting rules may seem arbitrary to you, keep in mind that these rules are designed to make similar documents look the same so readers can quickly and easily access the information they need.

, Before you begin writing your document, check to ensure that the page margins are set at 1 inch on all sides (unless otherwise specified by the agency for which you're drafting the document) and that you are using a legible font in an appropriate size.For example, if you are drafting a federal regulatory document, the margin on the left-hand side should be 1.5 inches, while all other margins are 1 inch each.
Typically, your text should be double-spaced in 12-point font. Your font should be a traditional, easily readable one such as Times New Roman or Courier.
Keep the substance of your document in mind when you choose a font. For example, if your text will include names or titles that you intend to place in italics, Courier is not a good font choice because it doesn't render italics.

, If you're drafting a document such as a legislative proposal or a regulatory document, you typically must include a required heading, the format of which is specified by the agency with which you are filing your document.The heading includes information that allows readers to quickly determine where your document fits into the overall organization of the code or regulatory section for which you're writing. This information will vary depending on the agency for which you're writing.
If you're writing a contract or other legal document, instead of a formal heading you typically will simply title the document. Your title may be as brief as ""Contract,"" or it may be more detailed and include the names of the parties or the purpose of the agreement.
If your document has distinct sections, you also need subheadings to break up the parts or sections of your overall document.
For example, if you were drafting a proposed regulation of veterinarians and veterinary services, you might include headings for ""Veterinary Licenses"" and ""Veterinary Facilities.""

, Creating an outline prior to drafting allows you to organize the sections of your document in a logical manner. If you're drafting a regulatory document, the titles of each section likely will become your headings.In contract drafting, your top-level headings typically should be bolded to set them apart from the rest of your text. You also may choose to have them in a larger font size than the rest of the document.
Contracts typically can be numbered in whatever organization method you feel best suits your content. However, if you're drafting government rules or regulations, they typically must be numbered following a pre-existing scheme.
Decide how you plan to divide the subjects in your document by grouping related statements to establish sections. Sometimes this division may be self-evident, but other times you may have to play with several different themes until you find the one that works the best.
Ideally, you want each major part or section to be of similar length, or have similar numbers of items. This makes your document appear balanced. If one section is significantly longer than the others, consider breaking it into two sections.
Once you've determined how to break up your information, you need to figure out how your sections will be arranged in your document. Generally speaking, you want to place the most important sections at the top of the document, along with those you believe will be most frequently used.
However, you also want to ensure that more general, broad provisions appear before more specific, narrow ones. This arrangement will save you a lot of time in writing, because it will be easier to move from broad rules to narrower exceptions or limits.
Any administrative clauses or penalty provisions (in contracts these are typically referred to as ""boilerplate"" and placed in a section labeled ""Miscellaneous"") should be at the end of your document.

, Short sentences in present tense, using a basic subject-verb-object construction, are the most effective way to write the actual text of your document.Active voice eliminates ambiguity by identifying the party responsible for fulfilling the verb's action. In passive voice, on the other hand, the object becomes the focus of the sentence.
For example, if you write ""when the product is delivered,"" the question of who is to deliver the product is left up in the air. Writing ""When Manufacturer delivers the product"" clears up any ambiguity.
A legal document has a timeless quality to it, in that once enacted or executed the document must provide answers to people over years regarding their rights and duties concerning the subject of the document.
For this reason, declarative, present-tense sentences tell future readers what they must do without confusion. If you write ""The Manufacturer will deliver the product,"" an astute reader might wonder when the obligation actually begins, since the document is written in future tense.
Writing a declarative sentence in present tense, such as ""The Manufacturer delivers the product on the third Tuesday of every month"" preserves the document's clarity.
You also want to avoid negative statements, particularly sentences that require more than one negative. Write what will happen, not what won't happen.
For example, the sentence ""The committee approves projects with a simple majority vote"" is a lot easier to understand than ""A project won't be approved unless a majority of the committee votes for it,"" which not only uses a negative construction but also is passive.

, Legal drafting is seldom, if ever, a one-shot deal, and may require multiple revisions before you can be certain that the words you've used effectively convey the correct meaning and intent.Focus on writing short sentences that don't include multiple clauses. Where explanation is required, consider breaking your sentence into two sentences – one that provides the explanation and another that describes the action to take place.
Reading your sentences aloud can help you see if they are needlessly complex. If you stumble over them as you read, or if they don't sound clear, you should consider redrafting the sentence so it's more easily understood.
Keep in mind that readers can get lost in multiple clauses, and complex sentences invite misinterpretation. For example, the sentence ""If developers don't submit their applications by the deadline, and fail to complete their affidavits, they will be unable to participate in subsequent bidding rounds"" may raise questions of whether developers must both submit applications and complete affidavits by the deadline, or if the affidavits have a different deadline.
A more understandable construction of the example sentence would be ""Developers must submit a completed application and affidavit by the deadline to participate in subsequent bidding rounds.""

, When you're drafting a legal document, every word should have an active, operative meaning in the sentence. Any other words and phrases will confuse readers and can possibly distort your meaning.You probably think of many of these words and phrases as ""legalese."" They clog up your writing and make it confusing to the average reader. Keep in mind that many legal documents that are drafted will be read by laypeople first and foremost – not by judges and attorneys.
Phrases such as ""any and all"" or ""full and complete"" are repetitive and should be avoided.
Many other words or phrases can be simplified. For example, ""in order to"" is a phrase often used in legal writing, but it says nothing that ""to"" doesn't already say by itself.
The same principal applies to ""and/or."" In legal drafting, the word ""and"" means both things are required, while the word ""or"" means only one is required. If you write ""and/or,"" that means only one thing is technically required, although both may be present. Since you want your language to be functional, the word ""or"" by itself is sufficient.
When in doubt, ask yourself if the word or phrase adds anything important to the sentence. If it doesn't, take it out.

, Long series in sentences are hard to follow, and the punctuation can lead to confusion. Bulleted lists will break up the information into pieces that your readers can understand at a glance and easily reference.Use parallel construction in your lists. You can check this by taking the first part of the sentence that introduces the list and completing it with each word or phrase you've listed next to a bullet.
If any of the phrases in the list don't complete the first half of the sentence in a way that makes grammatical sense, recast the phrase so that it does.
Each item in your list should be a complete thought in and of itself.
Keep in mind that these sorts of documents are meant to be used as quick references for specific clauses or statements. Your average reader likely won't read the whole document from beginning to end.

, If you include too many cross-references, your provision will be confusing and cumbersome to read. Unnecessary references won't add anything to your reader's understanding. Only use a cross-reference when it is essential to the meaning of the provision you're drafting. If you're drafting a rule or regulation, cross-references also may be necessary if there's another regulation out there that provides an important limit or exception to your provision.
For example, if the regulation you're drafting is subject to state and federal anti-discrimination laws, it's enough to simply say that. Providing a lengthy list of code citations will only result in readers getting lost in those other laws and trying to figure out how they apply to the clause they were originally reading.
When you're drafting contracts, incorporate other documents for reference only if those documents are necessary to understanding the contract as a whole, or to understanding the rights or responsibilities of a party.
The federal government has special rules that apply with one federal agency cross-referencing the rules or regulations of another federal agency. Generally, these cross-references are not considered regulatory and must meet at least one of a number of conditions, such as to test methods or consensus standards.

, Unless your intent is to reference the other document or regulation in its entirety, point your readers to exactly where they should go to find the information you're cross-referencing.This applies also when referencing other parts of the same document. ""See Section 2.4"" guides readers more effectively than saying ""See the above section,"" especially when you consider that your document may later be amended and additional sections added.

, Include a description of the document and your reasons for cross-referencing it in parentheses after your citation, so readers know why it's mentioned and have a summary of what it says.Providing a description enables your readers to understand what the other law or regulation is about and why it relates to the provision they're reading without having to stop and look it up.
For example, you might write ""See 52 CFR 99.4, consumption of cupcakes at government-sponsored events.""

, Drafting your document first enables you to see clearly which words should be defined and which are unnecessary.Before you write your document, you may think a certain word is important and needs to be separately defined. However, after drafting the document you may realize that word was only actually used once.
Generally speaking, words that are only used once or twice don't need to be included in a separate section for definitions. If a definition is necessary, you can define it in the text where it appears.
Keep in mind that your definitions section is alerting your readers that these words are important, and that they carry a different meaning from common understanding.

, Generally, your definitions should be read before the document is read, so your readers will understand what a key word means. However, with lengthy documents you may need multiple sections of definitions.In most shorter regulations or contracts, the definitions sections is one of the first sections of the documents. This goes back to the general principal of legal drafting that you should place more broadly applicable sections before more limited sections.
Since the definitions apply to the document as a whole, they typically will appear at the beginning of the document.
However, you may be drafting a document with multiple sections that covers 20 pages. It would be impractical to require readers to constantly flip back to the first section to find definitions of words that only appear in the last section.
In these situations, it may be better to have short definitions sections at the beginning of each part that include definitions of words your readers will encounter in that part specifically.
You still may want to have an initial section of definitions at the beginning of the document for words that appear throughout the document.
Organize your definitions in alphabetical order without any paragraph numbering or other labeling. You may want to bold the term you're defining so your readers can find it more easily.

, If a word has no different definition than the common understanding or dictionary definition of that word, there's no need to craft a special definition that applies solely to your document.The point of a definition is to eliminate ambiguity, not add to it. For example, if your document uses the word ""motor vehicle,"" and by ""motor vehicle"" you mean any car, truck, or van that operates on the roads, a separate definition of that word typically isn't necessary.
You also should avoid definitions that contradict the commonly understood meaning of the word. For example, you would only cause confusion if you defined ""motor vehicle"" as ""any car, truck, van, or bicycle,"" since people don't consider bicycles to be motor vehicles.
In that case, you might consider changing the word ""motor vehicle"" in your document to something that more readily includes bicycles.

, The purpose of definitions is to aid your reader in better understanding your document, not confuse him or her further.Avoid part or all of the term you're defining in the term's definition. This can make your readers think they're missing something.
Don't fall into the trap of thinking you have to name every possible thing that might be included under a broad term. Provide the definition, then give a few examples.
For example, you might write: ""'Private transport' means any non-public vehicle or device that people use to move from place to place on the roads. Examples include cars, trucks, bicycles, and hoverboards.""
Leave any substantive rules out of definitions, because readers are likely to miss them.

Choose suitable cards.,
If you are making your own baby shower notes, these can be made very simply using construction paper folded to note-let or card size.,
Jazz up the notes if making your own.,
If making the card, write something on the outside that indicates it is a thank you note, such as: ""Thank you for attending our/my baby shower party"".

,
Write the guest's name along with a salutation.,
Say thank you immediately; after all, this is the purpose of the card.,
Add any small notation that you feel might be appropriate.,
Sign off on the card.,
Be heartfelt.",How to Write Baby Shower Thank You Notes," You can make your own cards or choose cards, depending on your artistic skills and time availability.;
, Insert writing paper on the inside for the inner portion of the card, attaching with paper glue at the centerfold.


If you already know whether the child is a boy or a girl, you might like to use the traditional blue or pink, or a variant of these choices.
Think outside the rectangle or square. Why not make baby shower notes that are shaped like onesies or a rattle? A little something different will turn your thank you note into a memento to hang onto.

, Choosing a theme is a good way to enliven the card and make it cutesy.


Typical images to include on baby shower thank you cards include a baby image, a stork, baby-related items such as rattles, diapers and rubber ducks, etc.
Themes can include: Dr. Seuss; animals (jungle animals, pastel animals, baby animals); cut outs of baby clothing (onesies, diapers or little dresses, etc.); anything in a trio (mom, dad and baby); and so forth.

,, The standard salutation is ""Dear X"".

, The thank you should encompass both the person's attendance and the gift they've brought. For example:


Line one: Thank you for coming to our/my baby shower on X date. It was wonderful to have you celebrate the upcoming birth of our/my baby.
Line two: Thank your for the wonderful gift of . We are/I am so thrilled at your thoughtfulness and kindness. It will come in handy when .

, This isn't necessary, as the note by nature indicates shortness; however, sometimes a guest may have gone beyond the call of duty to be helpful, and it can be kind and thoughtful to make a note of this. For example:


""I am really grateful for the time you took to arrange the flowers for the party. I am also very appreciative that you took care of all the catering; it was really tasty food. And thanks for that great chocolate-poop-in-the-diaper game––I never knew such a fun game existed!""

, For example: Love, Jessie. Or, Love, Jessie and Daniel. Or, Love Rachel and Belinda. And so forth.

, There is no one way to say thank you; let it be a reflection of who you are. That said, a little help can always spark your own ideas, so here are a few more examples of how to say thank you in a baby shower note:


""We'd like to share our heartfelt thanks for your presence at our baby shower. It means a lot to us that you could come and share our special moment. Thank you for the lovely gift of ; the baby will be sure to love it as much as we already do.""
""Thank you for joining us to celebrate bringing our daughter/son into this wonderful world. We appreciate all of your gifts, each of which will be handy very shortly! Love, X and Y""
""Thank you for coming to my baby shower. Mom was thrilled to see you. I can't wait to see the wonderful gift you've left me; mom says it is the best thing she has gotten for me!""
""Thank you for coming and sharing our delight at the impending birth of our baby girl/boy. We were so happy to have you at the baby shower. We can't wait to meet our baby and we can't wait to share with him/her all the things you've given us. Thank you again.""
""My closet was bare of cuddly clothes, my diaper supply was low, my toy box was yet to fill and I didn't feel ready to show. Now I'm all decked out with the stuff for real, so my arrival will be soon you know! Thanks for your generosity and thoughtfulness––mom and dad can rest easy knowing all the basics have been taken care of.""

Determine the presentation style and format for each audience.,
Create a process to track information you will need throughout the event.,
Boil it down to the key points.,
Write an executive summary.,
Include visuals in your event report.,
Document all advertising and media exposure.,
Include a statement of the event’s objectives.,
Include financial information in the event report.,
Include statistics that will be relevant to the readers.,
Have a qualitative element that contextualizes the data.,
Be timely with the report.,
Proofread your event report.",How to Write an Event Report," Event reports can be bound, stapled, emailed PDFs, PowerPoint presentations, and so on. Make sure the event report is organized into clear sections. You want to determine how the results of the event compared to the objectives for it. Summarize the main outcomes of the event.
Tailor the event report for the needs and interests of each sponsor and audience. Consider the objectives of the sponsors. To some degree, sponsors are the key audience for an event report. They want to know whether it was worth sponsoring the event. So consider what they will want to know and what their hot buttons are.
Tailor the event report to also meet the specific needs of the uniqueness of the event and sponsors. Don’t write a color-by-numbers report. Other audiences for the event report include senior executives and financial managers.

, You don’t want to have to rely on your memory.


Tracking key information before, during, and after the event will allow for a more specific, and ultimately more effective, report. It will also allow you to compile it all in a timelier fashion. Consider data collection to be continuous, using multiple people if necessary (including possible interns) to collect data. The bottom line is that you should not wait to create the report until the end of the event., One problem with some event reports is that they do little more than regurgitate the agenda or focus on feel-good, booster-ish statements. Don’t do that. Instead, highlight the key points with a clear, analytical eye.


Pick out some of the event highlights to discuss in detail. Consider which three things worked best, and which three points were most surprising.Avoid packing the article with mundane details, such as the luncheon menu or a detailed summary of the entire presentation of the keynote speaker. You want to pull out the things that mattered.

, The event report should include an executive summary that is a concise version of the more detailed full report. Think of the executive summary as being like an introduction. You could create two reports – an executive summary designed for people who have some interest in the event’s outcome, and a more detailed fuller report for people actually involved in setting up or sponsoring the event.
In the executive summary, you want to boil down and focus on the key objects and results. The executive summary should be brief – just one or two pages. It should summarize the key elements delivered by the event, and it should include a brief interpretation of the data.

, It’s often more effective to offer a chart illustrating statistical trends, instead of just presenting readers with a bunch of numbers.


If the event included a new product, you could present a photo of it. Photos of the actual event could help illustrate the event report. Try to get photos of sponsors’ exposure on the site to document it for the report. Again, this is a task that can’t wait until after the event.
Samples, reproductions, and other on-site examples are good to include. Report the number of people who received sponsor coupons, etc. Document both on-site and off-site exposure generated by the event, in the media, to the audience, for sponsors.

, You want to assess the media that was generated compared to the objectives outlined.


Focus on print ads and articles in which sponsors’ names and ads appeared, in addition to gathering circulation figures and advertising rates.
Document television advertising, public service announcements, ratings and rate card values, and news coverage.
Don’t forget to document radio, rate card ads, values for ads and promotions, audited reports, and so on.

, It’s really important to link the event’s objectives with its results, so make sure that you include a reminder of what the event’s original mission was and which goals were set.


You might include a listing of your event program. You should also discuss who the key participants were in the event at some point. Keep these sections brief, though. Make sure to spend the most time listing and discussing the specific key outcomes of the event and matching them to the outcomes that were listed. Be realistic, and don't try to sugarcoat things that didn't work.

, It’s important to provide a detailed discussion of the event’s budget and what was actually spent (or potentially brought in). Make sure to include a comparison of budgeted expenditures versus actual ones, as well as highlighting things that worked well and areas needing improvement.You should detail all costs, including marketing and promotional activities, staff expenses, and sponsorship costs. It’s a good idea to include a detailed budget. Financial managers and senior executives will want to see evidence that backs up conclusions.
Include an accounting of revenue, such as fees, sponsorships, and exhibits. But make sure that you compare revenues to revenue projections. Compared to what? That's a good question to ask.

, You don’t want a report that’s packed with only feel-good information. The number of people who attended is one statistic you should include. It’s a good idea to provide data that has a measurable aspect to it.


Other pertinent statistics and data can include the number of sales leads generated and the number of visitors to a specific booth. Providing data gives more credibility to the event report. Provide participant/attendee information. Include demographics, attendance figures, and audience research results (such as purchasing habits).
Report on the number of people who respond to sponsors’ campaigns, as well as donations to charitable organizations. Document the economic impact and employee participation.

, Your report should include some statistics, but you also need human quotes to provide contextual feedback.


Gather quotes and feedback from participants and event team members so that the assessment of the event's successes and failures doesn’t come only from the event report’s author. It will be seen as more credible.
Consider including third-party research as well. Placing a value on media exposure is one example of something a third party could research.
Assess the space and set ups. You should spend some time assessing the effectiveness of the location and the set ups from the vantage point of others. Discuss how space was used by the conference, event, etc.

, Try to write and publish the report pretty quickly after the event. Make sure you schedule it on your calendar to make sure that happens. Some people suggest issuing an event report within 30 days, but others say you should do it within a few days.Whatever the deadline is, make sure that you meet it. Perhaps you are writing the event report for an agency that has been commissioned by a specific client. Pay attention to all requests. The bottom line is that your audience will expect both a thorough and a timely report. So take the time to be thorough and get it right, but don’t wait so long it seems dated.

, Make sure that your event report contains proper grammar and avoid spelling, punctuation, and other proofing errors.


Make sure that your answers contain depth. A good rule of thumb is the writing technique “show, don’t tell.” That means it’s a good idea to provide some specific examples to back up more general points that are made in the report.
Don’t forget your audience, and make sure that your writing sounds formal and professional. An event report is not a casual document; it’s an essential document to determine whether the event was worth it, so it needs to be authoritative.

Understand that an executive summary is a short review of a business document.,
Make sure it adheres to certain stylistic and structural guidelines.,
Define the problem.,
Provide a solution.,
Use graphics, bullet points, and headings if the document is easier to skim that way.,
Keep the writing fresh and jargon-free.",How to Write an Executive Summary1," ""Short"" and ""review"" are key words here. The executive summary is not going to be comprehensive in any way, nor will it be a substitute for the original document. An executive summary should never be longer than 10% of the original document. Shoot to have it somewhere between 5% and 10%.


An executive summary is different from an abstract. An abstract gives the reader overview and orientation, while an executive summary gives the reader more of a summary. Abstracts are more commonly written in academia, while executive summaries are used more for business purposes.;
, Most authoritative sources who write executive summaries agree that certain stylistic and structural guidelines should apply. These include:


Paragraphs should be short and concise.
Executive summaries should make sense even if you haven't read the original report.
Executive summaries should be written in language that is appropriate for the target audience.

, An executive summary needs to clearly define a problem, whether it's supply-chain management or marketing campaigns overseas. Executive summaries, especially, need clear definitions of problems because the documents that they are based on, Requests For Proposals (RFP), are often written by technical people with a poor grasp of conceptual issues. Make sure the problem is defined in clear, understandable terms.

, A problem is always in need of a solution. In order to deliver a claim statement of purpose (and a reason to fund the venture), you need to present your solution so that it effectively tackles the problem. If your problem isn't clearly written, your solution is less likely to make sense.

, An executive summary is not an essay; it doesn't need to be long blocks of text. If they enhance understanding or make the summary more skimmable, it's okay to use:


Graphics. A well-placed graphic illustrating the precise nature of the client's problem could drive home the point of the summary. Stimulating the visual sense is often just as effective as their analytical sense.
Bullets. Long lists of information can be broken down into more digestible bullets.
Headings. Organize the themes of the summary, if necessary, by heading. This will help orient the reader as they dive into the summary.

, Jargon is the enemy of understanding. It just so happens to be popular in the business world. Words like ""interface,"" ""leverage,"" ""core competency,"" and ""burning platform"" are all words that you should strive to avoid. They obscure real meaning and can make the summary sound vague and devoid of specifics.

Print your application.",How to Write an Application for Promotion," Before applying for a promotion, you need to be sure that you qualify for the position. If you don't meet the minimum requirements, it is unlikely that a glowing recommendation or otherwise impressive resume will get you the job. Applying for a position without meeting these requirements makes the applicant look foolish and overly ambitious.;
, Perhaps the most important thing you need to do is go over the requirements and desired experience of the new position. At the same time, you need to identify what qualities your potential new supervisor is looking for in the ideal candidate. Knowing this will help you gear your letter specifically toward the demands of the position.


If there is one, read the job listing of the position very carefully. Note every qualification desired and experience required.
If you know someone in a similar position, ask them exactly what the new position entails.
If you know someone who already works under your new potential supervisor, ask them what kind of attributes their boss likes. Inquiry about any other information that might be beneficial to you when writing the application., Applying for a promotion is not a confidential process and will involve discussion with and/or a recommendation from your current supervisor. It is best to know their feelings about your move before you proceed blindly down the path. Speak to them to explain why you want to make the move and to earn their support.

, Although you might be applying for a promotion within an organization you work for or are familiar with, you might not be familiar with the specific individual, branch, or program within that organization. Since you might be applying for a promotion to a new division, you need to spend time investigating whoever will be reading your application for promotion. Consider:


Read up on your new potential boss (if he or she will be a new boss for you) and find out what they are like, what their education and experience is, and what their employment record is like. Even if the supervisor does not make the hiring decision, your research will give you a better idea about your new boss.
Who determines the promotion may not be the new supervisor. In this case, you need to identify who will be making the decision, how the process will work, and key factors that will determine the decision.
Approach your current or new potential supervisor and let them know your interest. Ask them about the position and let them know about your qualifications. Make sure you seem confident and energetic. Odds are they are at least involved in the hiring process for the position., You application for promotion is intended to secure a promotion for yourself. Fundamentally, your application for promotion should sell yourself as a competent, successful, trustworthy, and extremely capable person. After reading your letter for promotion, your boss should have no question in his or her mind about your merits and your ability to succeed after being promoted., Your cover letter is a chance for you to show your personality and add ""color"" to the facts presented on your resume. They allow you to tell your story your way and explain away any concerns your superiors might have about your qualifications or history. Most companies use standard application forms for in-house promotions, so the cover letter is crucial to making your application stand out.

, Perhaps the first line in your letter should be your statement of intention. The statement of intention will clearly explain the intent of your letter. Often times, statements of intention should state your interest in a promotion followed by a statement of where you heard about the position. Consider:


”Please accept this as my letter of application for the position of General Manager of Sports X advertised on the Sports X website.”
”I am writing to apply for a promotion from Assistant Manager to General Manager of Sports X.”
”I am writing to apply for a promotion to the position of General Manager of Sports X advertised in the company's June newsletter.”
Your exact wording can and may vary, depending on the specifics of the position., The next step in writing your letter of application for promotion is to identify yourself. This is your opportunity to introduce who you are to the potential boss (if you are not already familiar to him or her). In this part of the letter, you want to be clear, concise, professional, and confident. Consider:


State your full name and current position. “My name is Thomas Higginson and I am currently an Assistant Manager for Sports X located in Mobile, Alabama.
You can also include any other information that identifies you and your relationship with the company, such as the amount of time you’ve worked there or the location or branch of where you are currently working.
Try to be short and concise with this section. Don’t use it as an opportunity to list your qualifications and experience, but rather just simply identify yourself as a current employee. , One of the most important things to answer is the question of why you want the promotion. Answering this question successfully will signal to the hiring supervisor that you are a serious candidate for promotion. Make sure to express:


How previous experience at the company has prepared you for a promotion.
How the promotion will help you realize your career goals.
Why, based on your experience at the company, you as an individual are uniquely qualified.
If you have been recommended by a supervisor for promotion, mention this here., Now that you’ve identified and explained yourself, you can launch into an explanation of your experience and qualifications. Make sure to construct sentences that clearly and concisely explain your experience and qualifications. Shoot for no more than one to two paragraphs about your qualifications. At the same time, your explanation should be one that demonstrates how your experience and qualifications make you the best candidate for the job.


Explain how your education has provided you with the intellectual background for the desired promotion.
Explain how your experience with the company has prepared you for this promotion.
Explain how your unique mix of education, experience, and qualifications make you the best candidate for the job., Perhaps the most important thing in applying for a promotion is to show that you have been successful in your current position and that you are ready for new responsibilities and challenges. Ultimately, you need to show that you are highly qualified and are the right person for the job.


If your promotion is a natural, linear promotion, be prepared to provide evidence that you have mastered your current position and are familiar with the responsibilities of the new position. If you've won awards or have been recognized by your supervisors, point these out.
If your promotion is a non-linear move upward into a new area, be prepared to demonstrate you are qualified. For example, if you have substantial experience with people or a team from the division you are applying to, point it out. For example, be prepared to write: ""I have worked with Frank and his team in engineering on the X1 project and I am aware of the challenges that leading a similar team will entail.""
If you are a natural leader or manager, provide evidence. For example, highlight a time when you took lead on a project and led a group to success.

, Now that you’ve explained your qualifications, you can get a little more creative and assertive and let your potential boss know how you will complement the division or business, and help them meet their goals. This is really the sales part of your letter of application for promotion, so try to be smooth and persuasive without appearing as arrogant.


Enumerate specific skills that will enhance the operation.
Explain your goal for the job and explain how your previous experience at the company will help you meet that goal.
Discuss your work philosophy., At the top of the letter, you need to provide your contact information. There are a number of approaches to providing your contact information. Ultimately, though, the contact information is extremely important as it will allow the person making the hiring decision to know who you are and to contact you. Consider:


Including your full name.
Your full address.
Position the contact information on the left hand side
Reserve phone number and email for a header, footer, or for the last paragraph of the application letter.

, At the top of the letter, you need to provide a date. The date should be the date you are writing and/or sending the letter. The date lets the reader know when you wrote the letter and if it is timely for the reason you wrote the letter. The location of the date may vary:


On the right hand side at the top of the letter.
On the left hand side under your contact information.
The date should never be centered., Although there are different styles, and you can use the paragraph-indented approach, it is recommended that you use a block or semi-block style. This comes across as more professional and is easier to read.


Do not indent your paragraphs
Make sure each text block is clear, concise, and focused.
Block paragraphs should be single spaced and separated by one line., You should start your letter off with a salutation. The salutation is intended to introduce you to the reader and to address the reader directly. It is also intended to establish a cordial and professional relationship between the potential employer and the applicant for promotion, if a relationship does not already exist.


It is highly recommended that your salutation address the reader in the most specific way possible. Avoid “To Whom It May Concern,” or “Dear Committee” unless you have no other option. It is best to directly address an individual, such as “Dear Mr. Walters.” However, using more general salutations is okay when you do not have more information.
Salutations can vary, depending on the purpose of the letter of application and the audience. They might include, “Dear,” “To whom it may concern,” “Ladies and Gentlemen,” “To the committee.”
Avoid being too informal. Don’t use informal salutations like “Hi,” “Hey,” or even “My Friend.”, The last part of the letter is the closing. In order to be successful, you really need to craft a letter with a strong closing. A strong closing can have the impact of making sure your potential or current employer will continue to think about you as a leading candidate even after they have finished reviewing your application.


If space permits, quickly revisit the top reasons why you are the best candidate for the job. Don’t repeat, but remind the reader.
Demonstrate your enthusiasm again.
End the final paragraph with a sentence such as “Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing about your decision in the future.”
Provide a professional closing phrase such as “Sincerely yours.”
Try to hand sign letters if you can. Using an electronic signature or something similar is permissible, but hand signatures demonstrate the most interest and commitment to securing the position., Using high quality ink and bright white paper, print your paper. Your printed letter should be free of streaks and your paper should be unwrinkled, and clean. If your paper is not clean, you’ll give the impression that you are unprofessional or sloppy.

Write a brief review.,
Make the ""grab"" shine.,
Define the big problem.,
Deliver your unique solution.,

Incorporate your unique selling proposition.,
Talk about your business model, if necessary.,
Discuss your management team, if necessary.,
Provide financial projections to support your claims.,
Ease in to your request.,
Reread your summary.",How to Write an Executive Summary2," Since the executive summary is a summary of another document, you'll need to be pretty familiar with the original document in order to condense it down to a manageable and informative version. Whether that original document is a report, business plan, proposal, manual or different document, review it, looking for its main ideas.

, What is the purpose of the company sponsoring the document, or of the original document itself? What is its scope?


Example: ""Women World Wide is a not for profit organization that seeks to connect women all around the world with effective solutions to domestic violence, as well as offering a network of support for those suffering from domestic violence. While operating from its headquarters in Alberta, Canada, it has received referrals from women in 170 countries across the globe.""


, This section is probably the most important part of your entire executive summary. In two or three sentences you should tell the reader why your business is special. Why does it deserve the scrutiny, business, or partnership of the people reading the summary?


Maybe you have Michael Jordan as a customer and he has endorsed your product on Twitter for free. Maybe you just signed a partnership agreement with Google. Maybe you were just awarded a patent, or maybe you just made your first big sale.
Sometimes just a simple quote or testimonial is enough. The key is to grab the attention of your audience, make the business appear as reputable as possible, and draw the reader in to the rest of the document.

, The first real ingredient of an executive summary is a discussion of a problem, so explain the problem that your products/services address. Make sure the problem is defined as clearly as possible. An ill-defined problem doesn't sound convincing, and won't set up your solution to be as impactful as it could be.


Example: ""Los Angeles is crippled with traffic. Apart from the Metro DC area, Los Angeles has the worst traffic in the nation. It's not just annoying. The smog and pollution caused from gridlock is reducing worker productivity, increasing rates of asthma, and slowly creating a serious health problem. There are more cars in L.A. than there are people old enough to drive them.""


, The big problem is the easy part. Now you have to convince the reader that you have come up with a unique solution for the big problem. If you deliver these two ingredients, you'll have the makings of a great idea.


Example: ""Innotech has created a groundbreaking traffic control system that shaves minutes off of commute time by installing patented ""smart grids"" into stoplight lanes that read the amount of cars in any given lane and direct traffic accordingly. No longer will drivers of America have to stand at a red stoplight for minutes while the green light blinks for no cars in the other direction.""


, Elaborate on the big problem by providing stats for your industry. Be careful not to pretend that you have a larger market than you do! The fact that the medical device industry is $100 billion annually means nothing because your new medical device will only serve a small segment of the industry. Break it down to a realistic market potential.

, This is where you elaborate on your unique solution. What specifically gives your product or service an advantage over the competition? Maybe your home health care service actually sends doctors to the home instead of just nurse practitioners, or maybe you guarantee same day visits so that you don't have to schedule ahead of time. Point out why you are special.


Example: ""Intellilight has the added benefit of being able to detect when no one is home. When a light is left on in an empty room, it automatically shuts off and turns back on again when it detects motion in the room. This saves the customer money on their electrical bill and wastes less energy.""


, Some executive summaries will not need a business model. (Nonprofits, not for profits, and NGOs probably won't have a business plan.) But if yours does, your business model needs to be clear and easy to follow. Essentially, you are answering the question, ""How will you get people to take dollars out of their wallet and give them to you?"" Keep the model simple, especially in the executive summary. A quick summary is all that is needed.

, Depending on what industry you are in, this can be one of the most important parts of your executive summary. Your investors or bankers are putting trust in the team, not the idea. Ideas are easy to come by, but executing on those ideas can only be accomplished with a strong team. Quickly show why your team has the experience and knowledge to execute your business plan.

, Based on your market, your business model, and your historical performance, you need to develop a bottom-up financial forecast. The point of your projections is simply to demonstrate your competence, and your ability to build financial projections based on a sound set of assumptions.


If your plan is for a group of investors, don't spend too much time on this section because they know that you have no idea how much money you might make. Investors typically won't make a go/no-go decision based on your financial projections. They will essentially make their own financial projections.

, Now it's time to request either an investment or loan, depending on the purpose of the executive summary. You should restate why your company provides value. Remind the reader of the big pain that you are solving and your market potential. Finally reemphasize your team and its ability to get the job done. Ask for the dollar amount needed to reach the next major milestone for your business. Don't disclose how much equity you are willing to give up or what interest rate you are willing to pay. This should be done later through face-to-face negotiation.

, When you have written the basics, reread it carefully. You should proofread the summary with extra care. While you are rereading, also consider your audience for the document. Make sure any new references are explained and that the language will be clear to someone who is new to this topic. Rewrite as necessary.


Have a pair of fresh eyes reread your executive summary, paying special attention to:

Clarity. Are the words clear, the ideas clearer, and the summary devoid of jargon?
Errors. Grammatical, punctuation, and spelling errors may abound. Having someone fact-check the figures and statistics might be a good ideal as well.
Forcefulness. Do the ideas translate into a stirring pitch? Where does the pitch fall flat, if at all?
Coherence. What parts don't fit together? What parts do?

,How to Write an Executive Summary3,
"
Recognize that the best marketing campaigns began long before the book is published.,
Think about one to two specific groups of people your writing is geared towards.,
Provide twice weekly blogs, photos, tweets, or other content to build a fan base.,
Build a mailing list online, through your website, or in-person at reading events.,
Nurture a following in your community long before asking them to buy your book.,
Give away printed and physical materials (postcards, bookmarks, posters, business cards) to put your name out there.,
Consider offering pre-orders if your community seems interested.",How to Market a Book1," The truth is that you will be fighting an uphill battle if you don't start building a following long in advance. Remember that market requires both a strategy, as outlined above, and an actual market of people to implement that strategy on.Though there is no magic formula, try taking one to two hours of writing time a week and turn them into ""book marketing"" time. As the book gets closer to publication, you can ramp up the hours spent marketing.;
, You do not have the time or resources to market to every single person on the planet. Nor should you. Think instead of the groups of people who most likely want your book. What else do they read? What websites do they visit? What is the best way to reach these people? Know your exact markets to make every hour and dollar spent more effective:Romance writers naturally skew towards female readers, particularly older women.
Sci-fi and horror writers have dedicated online forums and communities where people share stories and ideas, which is a great place to market/gain feedback.
Literary Fiction writers often have a hard time marketing their books, but should dive deeper into the subject matter. For example, if your book features a Jewish protagonist, the Jewish Book Council often offers free marketing to their followers., Twice a week is your bare minimum -- daily is far more effective. The more you show people that you create amazing work, the more likely they will be to pay for it later. There are thousands of bloggers writing daily, keeping their name on their followers feeds. If you decide to release your book without any sort of online presence, how can you expect readers to trust you over a writer they've read daily for six months?


Don't try to manage Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, LinkedIn, and others all at once. Choose the one to two sites that best fits your and your followers, then pour your time into dominating that market.
The line between working on your blog and working on your novel is a tough one to draw. However, the general rule is to transition to more online writing as you get closer to publication.

, Collect all of the emails you can, using a service like MailChimp to keep them all straight and in one location. The sooner you begin this, the better -- it is your number one way to directly reach fans and potential buyers.Put a ""Sign Up for our Mailing List!"" section on your website. Even better, have it pop up when the site loads.
Don't spam or overwrite your email contacts. One email a month is usually the maximum people have patience for., Word of mouth is still the single most important marketing strategy out there. It is just the hardest to implement. People recommend books to friends when they feel comfortable, love the work, and trust the author. So answer comments on your blog or twitter feed, write an article or small story for someone else's blog, go to local events and readings, and be a mainstay on online forums related to your writing.Search for a sub-Reddit related to your community online. If you're starting out, /r/writers is an open and generous space to share writing articles and discussion.
Never underestimate an in-person connection. Become a mainstay at all your local bookstores, reading series, and other literary events., Leave a stack of these at the cash register counter of a nearby bookstore and watch your book sales pile up. Also, use these as handouts at your next book-signing event, or give them out to family, friends and colleagues. It is said that it takes 10 attempts for someone to recognize a name or brand. Get a head start now.


Give away copies of your last book as ""promotions"" for the new one.
Send authors and publications copies of your books as a gift. Even getting one big endorsement will help.
If you have a big social media presence, free giveaways are a great way to build engagement., If you can sell some books before they've even been printed, you're assured of at least some positive buzz the day it is released. Offering a discounted pre-order sale may not always work if you're an unknown writer, but well-connected or established authors can see some benefits.

Have friends and family read it and critiqued it? Have they given you honest, constructive feedback?
Have you fixed anything glaring that doesn't work in relation to your book?
Have you had any people of repute review your book? Think your old university professor, a local expert in the area on which you've written, a colleague with knowledge of the field, etc.?
Is the presentation excellent? Did you use a good designer or did you do a really decent job of your own design? Again, ask others for their opinion of the book's presentation before launching any further.
Is the price right? No good looking to sell the book if the price is unrealistic.;
,, Write to your local journalists and explain that you're a local author who has written a book about X, Y, Z. This will probably be most effective if your book has local elements in it. It is a smart move to have a press release already prepared to shoot out with each request for a review or article about your book.


Do you know any journalists? Ask them if they can help you.
What about local newsletters, community bulletins, etc? Can they help spread the word?

, There are many ways to use the online world to help promote your book.


Be sure to set up a site that enables people to purchase the book. Offer Paypal and any other relevant payment options.
Sell copies on a renowned online auction site. Keep the auctions rolling over all the time. Include an excellent description of the book and its contents.
Seek out bloggers to help you. Offer a free copy of your book in return for a review. Offer to guest post too but if the blog does offer you a guest post, make it clear that you are the author and therefore biased about your own book!
Get a Twitter account if you don't have one already. Tweet regularly about your book and where it can be purchased -- but don't expect the Twitter world to be interested in unrelenting promotion. Be interesting in other ways, and then you can slip in occasional posts related to your book.
Use Facebook to promote your book. You could even develop a page devoted just to the book.
Check out websites on a similar theme. Have a look through the site and see if there are places where you might be able to leave links to your book. Always ask if in doubt about advertising - you don't want to gain a poor reputation for spamming.

, Send a copy of your book along with your press release and your request for a review. As with the local media, see what angles you can find that connect with the magazine in question, as this will make it easier for the journalist to decide if it's worth running.

, Ask your friends to read the book and then spread its value by word-of-mouth. Have friends take copies of your book, press release, or posters, to various events, workplaces, functions, etc., where it would be appropriate to sell or advertise your book. Don't badger your friends though. Some people cannot stand being asked to do this sort of thing. If you get those signals, don't pressure them. It is better to stay friends!


Always go out of your way to make it easy for anyone helping you promote your book. Run off press release and poster copies, deliver copies of everything to their doorstep, offer to drive them to places if needed, etc. Facilitate their evangelism of your book.

, Get out into the community and hold reading sessions from your book. If you're good with a crowd, and don't mind entertaining people, this can be a great way to promote your book.


Have copies and change ready for sale. Be sure to display them as you are reading from the book. You could do this impromptu (say, in a park on a sunny day), or you could organize it in advance and book a room, place posters and notices around town, etc.
Be sure to meet all regulations about hawking wares if you are also selling - one way around this is to hand out cards with the website address for purchase.

, This can be a great way to sell self-published books. Some things to consider include:


Banding together with a few other self-published authors from the area, so that the stall is really inviting.
Having all of your self-published books available for sale.
Having an excellent display, including press releases and a willingness to yarn with the customers and draw them in!

Determine if your work is protected by copyright.,
Create the appropriate symbol.,
Identify the year of publication.,
State your name or the name of the copyright owner.,
Place the copyright notice on your work.,
Include a rights statement.,
Register online.,
Obtain a paper application.,
Complete the paper application.,
Submit your materials.",How to Make a Copyright Notice," According to the United States Copyright Office, copyright protects original works of authorship.Common examples include dramatic, literary, musical, and artistic works, such as poetry, novels, movies, songs, computer software, photographs, paintings, and architecture. If you create an original work that fits within the categories listed, your work is protected by copyright.


Copyright protection does not protect mere ideas. Instead, the idea must be put into something tangible. If you created a song, for example, you must either record the song, write out the notes or lyrics to the song, or otherwise make the song exist somewhere other than in your mind for it to be eligible.;
, Use the copyright symbol ©, known as “The C in a circle.” You can also use the word “Copyright” or the abbreviation “Copr.” to show that your work is protected by copyright law.If you are identifying your copyright in a sound recording only, then use the letter P in the circle.
The use of this notice was required to have copyright protection in the past. However, as of March 1, 1989, you are not required to provide notice on any type of work.
Nevertheless, it is still a good idea from a legal standpoint to post a copyright notice. For example, it can deter others from plagiarizing your work.

, In terms of copyright law, the word “publish” refers to the year in which you distributed copies or phonorecords (CDs, cassettes, etc.) of your work by sale or other transfer, such as rental, lease, or lending. If your work contains other copyrighted material, then the year the compilation was first published is sufficient.If the work is unpublished, then you can use a notice that reads: “Unpublished work Copyright 2016 Jane Doe.”

, After creating your copyright symbol (or equivalents), you need to provide the name of the copyright holder. You can also use an abbreviation or an alternative designation that is generally known.Use your real name or any other name that you have the legal right to use.


If you want your business to hold the copyright, then make sure you have properly formed the business. You may also need to complete a “Doing Business As” if you want to hold the copyright in your fictitious business name.
With a phonorecord, the producer’s name will be considered part of the notice if the producer is named on the label or container and the notice contains no other name.

, You should place the copyright notice in such a way that it provides reasonable notice of the copyright claim. It should not be concealed or hidden from view.If you can’t affix the copyright notice to the work itself, then you can attach it to a tag that travels along with the article in commerce. If you are selling a motion picture or audiovisual work, then you can affix the notice on a permanent container.
Copyright notice is most often found in the footer of a website, at the bottom of a piece of written music, or in the first few pages of a book. In a video, you may include a copyright notice in the credits or with the title.

, You can also include a rights statement, if you want. This statement tells the public what rights you are reserving for yourself. Consider using the following:For example, you could write “All Rights Reserved” if you don’t want to allow anyone to copy anything.
For a Creative Commons License, you might want to include “Some Rights Reserved.”
To give all rights away, you could include “No Rights Reserved.”

, You do not have to register your copyright. However, registration provides you with important benefits, such as the ability to bring a lawsuit if someone uses your copyrighted material without permission.You can register online at the electronic Copyright Office (eCO): http://www.copyright.gov/eco/.


Registering electronically is faster than registering using a paper application. You also will pay a lower filing fee. As of 2016, you will pay only $35 to register a single application online.You can pay with a credit card.
You must submit “deposit copies” of your work with your application. You might be able to upload these copies as electronic files. Alternately, you might need to mail the deposit copies to the Copyright Office. Nevertheless, you still pay the lower online registration fee.

, You can also register your copyright using a paper application, if you think that is easier. You can obtain forms by calling 202-707-9100 or by printing off forms from the Copyright Office. You will need to obtain the following form, depending on the type of work you are registering:Form TX for literary works
Form VA for visual arts works
Form PA for performing arts works, including motion pictures
Form SR for sound recordings
Form SE for single serials

, Type your information into the form or print neatly using black ink. Each form will ask for slightly different information. However, you will generally be asked for the title of the work, the name of the author, the name of the person claiming the copyright, and information about the first publication.


If you have any questions, then call the Copyright Office toll free at 1-877-476-0778 or at 202-707-3000., You should submit your completed form as well as your hard copy deposits in a secured envelope. Generally, you must submit at least one copy or phonorecord of unpublished work but two copies of published work.Include your fee, which is $85 for paper registrations.Make your check or money order payable to “Register of Copyrights.”

Use concepts from this study rather than referenced literature.,

Target interdisciplinary researchers.,
Choose a professional font for any text.,
Keep the graphical abstract design simple.,
Check the unique specifications of your publisher.,
Submit the image file only.,
Ask for help if you need it.",How to Make a Graphical Abstract for Scientific Publication," The goal is to express the main point of your study in an easily digestible image, therefore it is important that you center your graphical abstract around the concept of your research. If you are studying a particular molecular change, make sure that the mechanism is part of your image. Likewise, if you are working with one particular genome, include some important piece of it in your image.You can find an open source image or create one yourself. Once you have the image, you can use text boxes to add any relevant titles or legends.
The image may also be a graph or chart, which could be generated in Excel or similar programs.;
, Most likely, you will need some text within the image. Be sure to use key phrases in the text that will make it easy for readers to identify the focus of your study. This will help your work be found by more readers.For example, if your graphical abstract will consist of a chemical reaction mechanism for the metabolism of glucose, you could incorporate text by giving the image a title such as “Glucose Metabolic Reactions” or “Mechanistic Diagram of Glucose Metabolism.”

, Though referencing literature is an important part of all research, it should be used sparingly in a graphical abstract. You what the abstract to relay what your study resulted in rather than what led you to do the study. If at all possible, avoid using anything outside of your actual research., It is usually best to use a program that you are familiar and comfortable with. Microsoft Office is generally a good choice. It offers enough flexibility in its programs to create a professional graphical abstract, and most people are familiar with using Microsoft Office.Powerpoint is often used to create a graphical abstract. Using one slide as the canvas for your image allows you to keep the whole image on screen. You can also overlay text boxes and other objects as needed.

, When you are using a graphical abstract, it is important to focus on what you found rather than what you did. Other researchers looking for your paper will be looking for results that interest them before being bothered to read the process. The graphical abstract allows you to provide them exactly what they are looking for in a visually pleasing picture., It can be tempting to snag a figure from somewhere in your paper to serve as your graphical abstract. While this is the easiest route, it isn’t the best. Designing a whole new image that centers around the study as a whole allows you to think about the main points you want to convey. It also helps to get potential readers a more comprehensive look at your study., Make your graphical abstract more visually appealing to draw more people to it. The use of technical jargon is often necessary in research, but it can be difficult for people of other disciplines to understand readily. A clear and concise graphical abstract allows you to relay technical information that appeals to a wide range of audiences without losing them on too much technical jargon. This will allow your work to spread much faster than if it were only being found by others in your field of study., While your image should be focused on a pictorial representation of your research, it is likely that you will need some text in the image. This might include a graph title or legend, or some other writing to help the reader understand what they are looking at. This text should be presented in a professional font such as Times New Roman or Courier., Your graphical abstract should be only one image. Do not submit an abstract that is made of a series of images, such as a slideshow. If needed, you can use a split panel format to show more than one image. This might be useful for showing the progression of an experiment., Guidelines for abstract submissions are different in different disciplines. They even vary slightly from one publisher to another within the same discipline. The rules governing graphical abstracts are no different. You will need to work closely with your publisher to make sure that you are meeting all appropriate requirements.

, All text included should be in the image itself and not an addition or attachment to the image. The image should have a directional flow that is easy to follow, (e.g., left to right). Check with the publication you are submitting to for preferred file types, but common formats are TIFF, PDF, and MS Office files., Some publishers offer services to assist researchers in making a great graphical abstract. If this is not available through your publisher, they will likely know of an independent agency that will help you polish your abstract. Your graphical abstract is the face of your research, and you want to be sure you are putting your best face forward to get your work recognized."

Now that the book is done, you should be spending a few hours every single day engaging with your followers and providing short, free content to entice people to buy the book.The more related to your market, the better. A horror writer might review recent thrillers, a romance writer could offer relationship advice (perhaps in the voice of one of your characters), a historian can offer thoughts on current politics. Be creative about your content.

, They enable you to be viewed by anyone anywhere in the world, 24 hours a day, 365 days of the year. It is one of the cheapest yet truly efficient ways of marketing your work. You can also link your website to forge stronger business relationships with online bookstores, book clubs, and author organizations. Be sure to feature your web address on all promotional materials, both print and online, and always include ordering information.


If you don't have a website, you need one. It is almost impossible to sell a book and gain trust in the modern era if you don't have an online presence. Sites like Wix, Square, Weebly, and others make website easy for anyone., Does your book feature a lot of baseball imagery and stories? Then get in touch with players, teams, blogs, and more to talk about mutually beneficial marketing. You can share their new blog posts for them, and they'll promote your book. Not only will you build a solid, important relationship, you'll both reach fans you otherwise had no chance to talk to.

, Provide all the necessary links and information, and kindly ask them to share the book and links with several friends or family members. This not only heightens traffic for your website but also increases awareness for your book, providing key word of mouth buzz that sparks early sales. You'll be surprised at how many people want to help your book get famous.

Each page on your website and every bio on social media should point back to the sales page. While you don't want to plaster the page with annoying advertisements, there are easy, subtle ways to advertise everywhere:


Put a banner on the top of your web page celebrating your new release. Since the banner is the same, usually, on all pages of the site, this will ""follow"" viewers unobtrusively.
Link out to your book in blog posts where appropriate. If you say, ""while writing my new book,"" link these words to the Amazon or GoodReads page.
Add the link to the bottom of photo posts on social media to the book. The image is the main attraction, but it links quickly to your sales.

, SEO, or search engine optimization, sounds far more complicated than it really is. To be fair, there are people that make a living doing it, but for your purposes it is rather simple. SEO is simply re-using a similar, market-targeted phrase (""sci-fi fantasy novel"") repeatedly to make it more likely to show up on Google. So, in every photo description, blog post, and set of ""tags"" you need to use the phrase ""sci-fi fantasy novel."" You should know the most likely groups to buy your book already, so think of what


Longer, more specific phrases are most likely to work. Random House will always beat you on the Google phrase ""Published Books,"" but they might not win ""cowboy western romance novel.""

Any topic restrictions
Length restrictions
Styles expected
Specific elements to be demonstrated.

, Do not deviate too much but try to use an original voice and style, in order to prove why you're different from all the others seeking the job too. Use your best possible writing, giving yourself the time and space to create a really good piece of writing.


If there are no parameters, this is a test in and of itself. In this case, be sensible about length and topic. Don't write too much and avoid controversial topics because you simply cannot guess at what beliefs or preferences those reading it may hold. On the other hand, don't stick to topics that are so safe as to be boring and cause the reader to put your resume into the ""yawn pile"".

, Unless you're writing something creatively from a fictional standpoint, any facts included must be checked and double-checked for accuracy, especially if this is part of what you are being assessed on. If you aren't sure about something, leave it out until you can clarify it.


Include references as appropriate. It shows that you have gone the extra mile and that you care about accuracy.

, Go over your article in detail to remove spelling errors and grammatical faux pas. Edit for length too; the more said in the smallest amount, the better. It proves you can write succinctly and still get across the necessary messages.

You need to know this for a variety of reasons. Professional versus Personal:


This will definitely affect the type of shots that you are using. You might want it to be a book about the growth of your family. Much different than taking some incredible landscape and macro photos that you want to share with the world.
Consider the layout. How you would present your book to your family and to the public is probably considerably different.;
, Some of your options are: iBook, Blurb e-books, Adobe InDesign and Scribus (free) to name a few.


Printing to a PDF can be an option, but there is limited interaction that is available with PDFs versus an eBook.

, It can be a deal maker or deal breaker.

, You really don't want your book to be published with only one editor and proofreader (you). No matter how good you are, you can miss your own mistakes.

, Don't rush this, or any part of the, process. Once you release it, regardless of if you fix it later, the original will be out there with all of its 'issues'. Try to get it to flow for your viewers.

Identify your target audience.,
Compare your book to other published works.,
Consider what makes your book stand out.",How to Know if Your Book Is Worth Publishing1," One way to determine if your book is worth publishing is to consider who the book is for. Ask yourself, Who is my reader? Who will be interested in reading this book? These questions will help you identify the target audience for your book. Publishers often focus on a book’s target audience to help market it and sell it to readers.For example, perhaps you have a book that is about a love story during the American Civil War. You may then identify a target audience that enjoys historical fiction and romance.
You may also try to identify the demographics of your target audience, such as their age and gender. For example, a love story during the American Civil War may appeal more to women between the ages of 20-45.;
, You can also home in on the market for your book by comparing to other works that have been published in your genre. Go to your local bookstore and flip through books that are stocked in the same genre as your book. Read through them and compare your plot or approach to the approach of other writers. Think about how your book stacks up and whether it fits within a certain genre in the bookstore.For example, if you have a book that is for young adults, you may compare it to other books in the YA section of the bookstore. Look at how your book is the same or different from other YA books that have been published.

, You should think about what makes your book unique from the thousands of other titles that have already been published. Ask yourself, What makes my book unique? How does it stand out from other books? Finding out what makes your book unique and confirming it will stand out can help you decide it is worth publishing.Having a unique book in a genre can also make it more appealing to publishers, which could make it easier for you to get your book published. Some writers try to challenge themselves to write something unique in a particular genre so the resulting book stands out.

J-14 is all about celebrities, fashion, and Hollywood gossip.;
, If you’re regularly reading magazines, then you may see openings for submissions in the current issue. You can go onto any magazine’s website and search for openings. There are also some magazines that are only online, so spend some time looking into into these options as well.Look for “We want to hear from you,” or “Do you have a story you want to share?” headings.


SOS Safety Magazine is an online magazine that covers serious topics like bullying, drug abuse, and suicide.Teen Ink is a monthly online publication that runs entirely on submissions from teenagers.Canvas is an online literary magazine that publishes poems, fiction, and other writings by teens., Talk to a friend or family member about your plan. Ask what magazines they or their kids enjoy reading. If you’re in school talk to your English teacher since he/she is already familiar with your writing. Find out if anyone has a recommendation for a good magazine, or has heard of a writing opportunity. The more people you have around you to help, the easier the process will be.

, If you’re still a teenager, make sure your parents know your goal. Some magazines require you to have parental permission before they will publish your work. You don’t want to get an offer to publish and not be able to because you didn’t check with your parents. Let them know what magazines you’re interested in and your article topic. They will probably be very excited and want to help you!

, As you become familiar with your favorite magazines, you’ll see that they write about the same general topics each month. Think about which articles catch your attention the most, or if you have something new to say on the topic.Ask yourself the following brainstorm topics and see if it sparks any new ideas to help get you started.


Music. Did your favorite artist just release a new album? Do you think swearing in music lyrics should be allowed on the radio? Did a friend just introduce you to a new genre of music that you want other people to know about?
Makeovers. Did you have a great/awful makeover experience you can share? When you cut your hair did you find increased self-confidence? Do your friends always come to you for makeup advice?

Health/Fitness. Are/were you the captain of your soccer team?Do you help your family plan meals? Are you struggling to get enough sleep each night?

, Will your article be more for boys or girls? Younger teenagers (thirteen to fifteen) or older teenagers (sixteen to nineteen)? The age and gender of your audience will influence which magazine is best for you to publish with.

, With the rise of texting and social media, we’ve gotten very used to shorthand writing, like “u” and “lol,” but these abbreviations are not appropriate for magazine writing. A good rule to remember, if your English teacher wouldn’t let you use it in a class essay, don’t put it in your magazine article., As you read, you’re going to find that you enjoy some writing styles more than others. While you may look up to these writers, it is important to let them inspire but not control your writing style. If you’re not a naturally joking person, don’t try to be too funny in your article. Keep it natural., Small errors can be big problems for editors. If your article is full of typos it gives the impression that you didn’t take your work seriously. Before submitting your article make sure you have at least two other people proofread it.

, Instead of submitting an entire article to a magazine, some want you to submit an idea. This is also known as a query letter and is comprised of a good title and brief summary.Your pitch is your chance to sell yourself to magazine. It should include the hook for your idea; draw the editor in so he will want to read the whole article.

, Some writing opportunities will be posted on the website as a regular job. As with other jobs, the cover letter is a chance for you to convince the manager that you are the right person for the job. Let him know how your experience and skills make you the best writer for the job., Don’t limit yourself to just one magazine. Many magazines cover similar topics, and the more magazines you submit to the more chances you have to get published. Just make sure that you alter the article so that it works uniquely for each magazine.

, Magazines gets hundreds of submissions a day, so it might take a while for your article to make it’s way through the process. And even if your first article isn’t chosen, keep at it. The more you write, the better your writing becomes., Even if your article doesn’t get published, you should be proud of your work. It takes courage to put yourself out there and try something new.

Determine if the book has a strong plot.,
Consider if the book has strong characters.,
Note if the book has a unique angle or take.",How to Know if Your Book Is Worth Publishing3," To determine if your book is worth publishing, you should read it over yourself with a critical eye. Note if the plot of the book is strong and engaging. If your book is fiction, you may look at how the plot unfolds in the book and whether it is compelling for a reader. If your book is non-fiction, you may consider how your approach to the subject matter keeps the reader engaged and wanting to turn the page.Ask yourself, If I were a reader, would I be engaged by this book? Would I be compelled to finish this book?
Though it can be difficult to critique your own work, try to be honest when you answer these questions. Be willing to adjust your book if the answers to these questions are “no,” as this will only make your book stronger.

, You should also ask yourself if your book has characters that are unique, detailed, and interesting for readers. You should consider if your characters are nuanced and detailed, with a strong voice or point of view. These are often signs of a strong book that is worth being published.Whether your book is fiction, non-fiction, or a collection of poems, you will have characters or speakers in your work. Try to read your book from the perspective of a reader and think about whether the characters or speakers in your book will draw your reader in.

, You should also consider if your book feels unique compared to other books in the genre. Ask yourself, What is the book’s unique take or angle? How does it distinguish itself from other books in the genre? Considering these questions will help you determine if your book has an angle that will feel fresh and original to publishers as well as readers."

Continue writing.",How to Handle Rejection Slips," It might feel that way when you open the envelope, and the words on the page may sting your ego, but you are in good company. Even the most famous authors who have gotten rich had their share of rejection.;
, There are multiple reasons why your work may have been rejected, such as a similar piece may have already been bought, the tone wasn't quite right or the editor was simply having a bad day. Whatever the reason, remember that it's all business.

, One great way to handle rejection slips is to cull everything you can from an editor or agent. If you didn't receive a form letter, take the time to re-read it, consider the suggestions and critiques, and maybe do some editing.

, Just because one editor or agent decided to pass on your work does not mean that all of them will. Check your list of publishing options and get ready to try again.

, This might sound odd, but the fact that you have received a rejection slip means that you were brave enough to take that step in sending it out in the first place. Give yourself a pat on the back because many writers never make it that far.

, Once you have picked yourself up off the floor from the last rejection slip and have found the next placement option, get back to work. Do not allow self-pity to cripple your creativity and pour your energy onto the page.

Craft a striking, attention-grabbing first paragraph.,
Develop a logical structure and format.,
Work within the prescribed length.",How to Get Your Opinion Piece Published," The basic format for most opinion pieces is to open with a lead paragraph, follow with supporting paragraphs, and end with a conclusion. Each paragraph should build off of the previous one and maintain the reader's interest through the entire piece.The lead paragraph should hook a reader from the start. Many writers find that using a story or vivid example in the first sentence can help catch a reader's interest.
The supporting paragraphs should build off of the introduction. You'll want to pepper your supporting paragraphs with facts, statistics, quotes (if any), and personal anecdotes to help strengthen your argument.
The conclusion should be compelling, and it should leave readers feeling that they understand the subject and your viewpoint on it. If you're trying to inspire action, make sure your conclusion lets readers know what they can do to get involved in the cause you discuss.;
, Whether you pitch your idea or submit it blindly, you'll need to compose a short bio (called a byline in print media) in which you describe yourself and your credentials in the third person.You should also write a professional cover letter that is addressed to the editor of that specific publication. Your cover letter doesn't need to be long, but it should describe your attached piece, explain why you think it should be published, and thank the editor for his or her time.


A byline might read something like, ""John Doe is an environmental activist working for _____. He's working closely with the EPA on the ongoing excavation and visits the site on a daily basis to conduct soil tests in the region.""

, Once you've written your piece and the accompanying byline and cover letter, you're ready to submit it to a publication. You can submit your piece directly to the editor by using the email address provided on a given publication's website. Don't forget to include your contact information, including your name, your daytime phone number, and some title or affiliation that clarifies your authority on the subject.Decide whether to pitch the idea or submit it unsolicited. There is no ""right"" way of submitting; some writers will email an editor at the start of the day and pitch their idea for an opinion piece, while others simply submit blindly., Some editors say that if you don't hear a response within 48 hours there's a good chance your piece isn't being picked up, but once in a while submissions get held up for various reasons.Sometimes there are technical errors that prevent the editor from getting your submission, which you wouldn't know about without following up. Other times the editor may like the piece and decide to wait for a better issue to include it in. For example, one New York Times editor has held opinion pieces for up to two years before printing them.Send a polite and professional email if you haven't heard anything after 48 hours.
You should also ask the editor about the possibility of getting paid for your writing once it's been accepted, as many editors will give a paycheck only if asked about it.

, Every publication has a different angle they may wish to cover a story from. This angle is usually what draws readers to that particular publication. That may be true of both the political slant of that publication and the general subjects that are usually addressed by the editors and contributors. You won't get a liberal-leaning piece published in a conservative newspaper, or vice versa, so know your audience before you submit anything.Check the general angle of both the publication you're considering and its typical audience.
If you read a publication regularly, you should be familiar with that publication's opinions and beliefs.
If you're not familiar with the publication, you can search online to familiarize yourself with their style and their political leanings.
Don't forget that you'll need to write for a general audience. That means using easily-understood (but not poorly-written) language without any technical terms or jargon., Even if you're pitching an opinion piece to a publication whose readership agrees with you, a good editor will look for some acknowledgement of the opposition. It's easy to write a long-winded rant about a subject, but a strongly-written opinion piece should analyze the issue from all angles while still promoting the author's personal beliefs.Identify the dissenting viewpoint and its most prominent advocates early on in the piece. Acknowledge the strongest arguments made by the opposition, rather than the weakest ones.
Concede that the dissenting viewpoint has at least some valid points. This will help you come across as being more rational, and readers will be willing to stick with you.

, Readers are more likely to be on board with an opinion piece that makes a logical and well-structured argument than a rambling or incoherent one. Make sure your ideas are clear and well-informed, and organize your ideas within the article so they flow in a coherent manner from one to the next.


Dismantle the logic behind the opposition's arguments, and support your stance using facts, statistics, and direct quotes from prominent figures working closely on that issue.
Defend your argument with facts that cannot be debated. Work your argument's defense throughout the piece, beginning with a strong argument and building towards your strongest one.

, Most editors will only publish an op-ed piece if the writer has a personal link to the subject being written about. That doesn't necessarily mean you need an advanced degree on that subject, but it does require some type of personal connection to the topic you're discussing.Everyone has an opinion, so think about why anyone should have a vested interest in yours.
You don't need to be an expert on your subject, but it should be relevant to your life.
For example, most people have some opinion on war, but unless you're a veteran or have lost a relative in an ongoing war, your opinion probably won't stand out from most people's (and therefore may not be published).

, If you have a connection to an institution you're writing about, either through your own employment or through a close friend/relative's, be sure to disclose this clearly in your piece. If you don't, the editor might uncover this and see it as misleading or deceptive for you to withhold this information., Before you sit down to write an opinion piece, you should consider how relevant that topic currently is. Has it been covered enough, or has it been over-covered in the news? You should also consider whether you have sufficient authority to discuss the subject. If not, you'll need to at least research the subject thoroughly and read the existing news and opinion pieces out there on that topic., There are many different types of opinion pieces. Generally speaking, if you are a reader submitting to a publication (and not a staff member of that publication) you will most likely submit either a letter to the editor or an op-ed piece.Editorials - these are written by staff members at the newspaper. Unless you are a staff member, you probably will not be able to publish an editorial.
Letters to the editor - these relatively short pieces generally address current events and news topics. They are heavily opinionated, yet focus on specific events.
Op-ed (opposite the editorial page) pieces - these slightly longer pieces must be well-structured, well-researched, and they typically must display some type of expertise/credibility/advanced knowledge in a given field.

, What you write about is entirely up to you, but if you want your piece to get published it needs to be relevant. Things currently in the news often make the best subjects, but any topic that is being hotly debated may be publishable, even if it isn't widely covered in the news.Anything that has become a prevalent media topic or breeds controversy will make an excellent subject.
If you get worked up thinking about the subject in one way or another, it's probably a good starting point for an opinion piece.

, Decide on a central thesis or argument for your opinion piece. You should already know how you feel on the subject, so take it a step farther: why should other people agree with you? Take a firm stance and amp up your opinions on the piece, and be sure you write down all your thoughts to more easily keep track of them.A highly-opinionated piece is more likely to provoke discussion, which means it's more likely to get published.
Find and incorporate facts and details about the subject that others may not know. This can give you an edge over other people writing about the same subject.

, The opening paragraph is usually what hooks a reader, so it's important to get it right before you submit your piece. If your opening doesn't grab the editor's attention, it almost certainly won't catch a reader's interest.The opening line or lines should be engaging and intriguing enough that a reader blindly skimming your piece will want to keep reading.One way to grab a reader right from the start is to open with either powerful imagery or an argumentative stance on some aspect of the subject you're writing about.
A good opening line for an opinion piece on a recent factory closure might be something like, ""The CEO of _____ didn't feel his fingers and toes clench up in the cold like we did as we walked out of our job for the last time this week.""

, Your opinion piece should be easy to follow for most readers. This means that your opinions should be backed up with verifiable facts, and one thought should lead clearly into the next without any awkward gaps of logic or narrative.Someone reading your opinion piece should immediately understand why you arrived at the opinions you hold.
It should also be easy to understand how your thought process moved the discussion from one point to each subsequent point without ever losing focus or clarity.
Have a trusted friend read your piece to confirm that your writing is clear and makes sense without needing any explanation.

, If you submit a piece that's far too long or too short, it's not likely to be published. You should check the website for any publication you're considering to find out what (if any) limits or word length ranges they typically hold writers to. If that information isn't available online, try emailing the editor to find out.Most publications print opinion pieces that run between 500 and 800 words in length.
Some publications run shorter or longer opinion pieces. For example, the New York Times takes articles anywhere from 400 to 1,200 words in length."

Your email address should be something professional, like yourname@gmail.com rather than something like barbiegirl123@gmail.com. You could also use a school email address if it ends in "".edu.""
Make sure that the signature in your email is appropriate. Some people have an automatic signature that says, ""Sent from my iPhone"" or ""Sent from mobile."" You should temporarily disable this feature if you are sending the email from your phone.

, Your email will be structured in the same way as a letter, but it can be helpful to look at sample emails to get an idea of the proper structure and syntax.You can look at form emails that your favorite nonprofits share, or from different advocacy groups."
"
Decide on the purpose of your letter.,
Research your position on the issue.,
Structure your letter effectively.,
State your purpose clearly.,
Send your letter at an effective time.,
Use form letters for inspiration.,
Follow up and wait for a reply.",How to Write Your Congressional Representative4," Most people who write to their congressmen usually do so for two basic reasons; they agree with their congressmen’s actions or they disagree with them. You likely have a purpose in mind when you are writing your representative, like you disagree with their current vote on healthcare reform or you want to urge them to vote in favor of a new tax cut. Your letter should have one clearly defined purpose.


Letters that have more than one purpose, like state cutbacks for education programs and about their recent vote about agricultural regulations, are less effective than sending separate letters for each issue.

, You want this letter to be well thought out, factual, and based on evidence. Regardless of your position on a certain issue, you should research what you are talking about before you sit down to write. For instance, if you are writing about a new bill that has been introduced to the House of Representatives, you should research what that bill says and what it means.


If you are unfamiliar with the legislative process, you can research how a bill is passed and what role your representative has in the process., Generally, the most effective mail is three paragraphs. The first paragraph should introduce the issue that you either support or oppose. The second paragraph should explain why you oppose or support that particular issue or bill that your representative is involved in. The third paragraph should ask the representative to do something.You can ask your representative to vote either for or against a certain bill, to write back and explain their position, or to ask them to explain the legislation that they have introduced.

, In the first paragraph, you need to state your position on the issue at hand. For example, you could say “My name is Kelly Brown and I am writing to ask you to oppose SB 2222 by voting no on March 5th.” This lets the reader know who you are, what your stance is, and what you’d like them to do. It is respectful and sets up your next paragraph where you will explain why you have this position. Your purpose should be specific and very clear.Identify the name and number of the bill or resolution and the date that it is being voted on.

, This is particularly important if you are writing about an issue that is about to be voted on.Both the House of Representatives and the Senate have calendars that are available to the public that show you exactly when they are voting on certain bills and resolutions. If you are concerned about one of the votes that are happening soon, you should send your letter or email before the vote actually happens.The earlier you can send your letter, the more time your representative has to take your thoughts and concerns into consideration.

, If you are passionate about a certain issue, like women’s reproductive rights, look at organizations that work in this area. Major organizations and nonprofits will often supply form letters that their supporters are encouraged to send to their representatives.You can find these letters in the advocacy section of their website, or by reaching out to a member of the organization and asking if they have any form letters to share.The letter to your congressmen should be in your own words, but these form letters can help you get an idea about the scope of the issue and they often have helpful research points that you can include.
You can also send a form letter if you want to. While personal letters are more effective, form letters still make an impact.

, Feel free to send another letter or email about the same issue if you are still concerned about a new development or if the vote hasn’t happened yet. You want to avoid spamming your representative’s office though, so keep your follow ups limited to one or two additional letters. You may or not receive a reply from the representative’s office. The reply may take a few weeks, or you may receive an automated email thanking you for reaching out or a basic form letter thanking you for voicing your concerns. Or, you may receive a personal letter from the representative themselves!


Be sure to thank the representative for the work that they do and for listening to your concerns.

Identify the overall purpose of the training.,
Describe the expected performance.,
Explain the conditions under which the task will be performed.,
Set standards.,
Use clear, direct language.,
Link objectives to real-world events.,
Be specific about what constitutes the standard level of performance.,
Make your objectives as concise as possible.,
Use the SMART acronym to make sure the training objective can be evaluated.,
Avoid using objectives that cannot be measured.,
Include an objective for evaluation.,
Finalize your training objective.",How to Write Training Objectives," Before doing anything else, you must identify the purpose, or the desired outcome, of the training. Usually, training is designed to close a performance or knowledge gap possessed by employees or students. This gap is the difference between the current skills or knowledge of student and the skills or knowledge required of them. Identify what you want out of your training and then go from there to fill out the rest of your training objective list.For example, imagine that your business must train a bookkeeper to record a new type of credit account being offered to customers. The purpose of the training is to train the bookkeeper such that they are capable of efficiently and accurately recording the new entries.
The performance gap here would be that the bookkeeper already has knowledge of all of the business's other bookkeeping entries, but lacks the knowledge and skill to make the new type of entry.;
, The task that will be taught during the training must be clearly defined. A written objective must contain an action verb that can be seen and measured. Use words that tell the student exactly what he or she must do, and avoid any language that might be ambiguous or subjective.For the previous example, the task would be to record the new accounting entries.

, An objective must include a description of circumstances. Provide details that describe under what conditions the task or tasks will take place. In other words, what must happen before the task needs to be completed? Include what tools and support might be used, including textbooks, forms, tutorials, and other conditions. If the task is outdoors, environmental conditions will need to be addressed.For the previous example, the conditions might be when a customer with the new account type makes a purchase. In addition, another condition might be that the bookkeeper must know how to record the entry in the business's accounting software.

, Describe what the student will be expected to achieve in order to have met the training objective. The minimal acceptable standards must be communicated in the written training objectives. Define how the standards will be measured and evaluated.


Standards will be performance goals, like doing a task in a set amount of time, getting a certain percentage of tasks right, or completing a certain number of tasks in a given time or at a certain magnitude.
Training standards usually do not require a mastery or perfection of the task.For the previous example, this would be not just the employee must record the entries, but must do so in an accurate and expedient manner.

, Write objectives such that there is a clear and measurable goal identifiable in the wording of the objective. That is, don't use indirect or passive word like ""understand"" or ""some."" Instead, use direct wording that conveys specific figures or actions that needs to be learned. Doing so will make sure that the rest of your training, including materials, methods, and content, is cohesive.


In addition, this type of wording adds to your ability to eventually measure your training successes.
Clear objectives gives the student the ability to follow their own progress and to know what to expect from the training and its outcome.For the bookkeeper example mentioned in the other parts, this would be something like, ""The bookkeeper will be able to successfully record credit account entries.""

, Objectives are best understood in the context of real-world events. Always include what would occur first to make the employee or student perform the task in question. Then, link the task itself to the desired, real-world result of that task. This helps the student keep what they are learning in perspective.For the previous example, this might be that the entry of the new type of credit account will be made to account for a new service offered to customers, designed to increase sales with repeat customers. The proper entry of the data must be stated as essential to the financial health of the business.

, The standard of performance should be a set number or figure. It could be a percentage of correct actions, a speed of task performance, or another, measurable metric of performance. In any case, this number should be clearly identified in the objective.For the previous example, this could be that the bookkeeper must learn to make the entries with 100 percent accuracy. For other tasks, the percentage may be lower, but accounting tasks should be as close to perfect as possible.

, Keep your objective to one sentence. This keeps your objectives concise and easily understandable. Any longer or more complicated tasks can be broken into multiple, smaller tasks. Any long, complicated tasks will be more difficult to teach and quantify.For the previous example, stick to the basics. Writing that the bookkeeper must record the credit account entries with 100 percent accuracy, given the business's existing accounting software, is enough.

, SMART stands for specific, measurable, attainable, relevant and time-bound. This system has been used by business and government leaders and training managers to institute and teach effective training programs.


Specific: State exactly what the learner should know how to do with specific objectives. All objectives should be clearly defined and not subject to debate or interpretation.
Measurable: Observe and quantify the behavior with measurable objectives. The objectives should be consistent for each learner, and subject to standard evaluation.
Attainable: Make sure the task or action is something that can actually be achieved with attainable objectives. Setting learners up for failure will result in unmet objectives and demoralized students.
Relevant: Determine that this task is important and necessary with relevant objectives. There should be nothing arbitrary or optional about the tasks written in the objectives.
Time-bound: Set achievable deadlines and management schedules with time-bound objectives. There can be no open-ended tasks in effective objectives. Set and enforce deadlines.Using the bookkeeper example from other parts, the SMART acronym would be applied in the following way:

Specific: The bookkeeper should be able to record the credit account transactions.
Measurable: The bookkeeper will record transactions correctly 100 percent of the time.
Attainable: The bookkeeper's task is not so different from current entries.
Relevant: The bookkeeper's task is essential to the business's accounting procedures.
Time-bound: The bookkeeper must learn to make the new entries by the 1st of March.



, Try not to have objectives that you cannot measured objectively, such as making a student ""appreciate"" or ""be aware"" of something. While these are no doubt important, you have no real way of measuring the success of teaching a student these things.For the previous example, don't write an objective like, ""the bookkeeper must be aware of how the new entries are made."" Make the objective more direct with ""they must be able to record the new entries.""

, Evaluate the students, and give them an opportunity to evaluate the training. Some part of the training should be a test of the knowledge gained during the training. After all, knowledge is useless without experience and practice. Remember that this may require multiple repetitions before the performance standard can be reached.For the previous example, this might be that the bookkeeper will be given several hypothetical examples of this type of transaction and will be asked to record them correctly.

, Using all of the aforementioned criteria, refine your training objective until it is exactly the way you want it. Again, make sure all aspects of the objective are clear and measurable.


For the previous example, an example would be, ""The bookkeeper, given the business's existing accounting software, must be able to record the new credit account entries with 100 percent accuracy by the 1st of March.""

Outline your ideas.,
Address The Queen properly.,
Contact The Queen online.,
Manage expectations.",How to Write to HM Queen Elizabeth II1," Make an outline of exactly what topics you'd like to say in your letter to better organize. Include an order of what you'd like to accomplish, so you are focused in your approach. For each bullet item, make sub-bullets to further clarify each point.Be sure to divide your thoughts with different forms of bullets, including Roman numerals, lowercase letters, and numbers;
, Your Majesty or May it please Your Majesty are the preferred terms. While it may be more appropriate to address Her Majesty’s Private Secretary or Lady-in-Waiting, you can nonetheless direct the correspondence to The Queen.


The Royal family also accepts the less formal Madam substitution.If your correspondence is with an aide, abide by the following rules:

The first reference should be Her Majesty The Queen

All other instances should be The Queen

Third person pronouns should be replaced with Her Majesty, While Her Majesty does have an email address, it's not exactly public.There would no doubt be a flood of emails if it were. If you'd like to shoot a quick message, however, the official Twitter account for the Royal family is https://twitter.com/RoyalFamily (@RoyalFamily). It appears Her Majesty uses it instead of her now defunct individual account., The Queen receives a large amount of mail, and it’s courteous to consider the volume of mail Her Majesty receives.It would not be inappropriate to ask for an answer or a reply, even if one is not likely.Do not expect a reply from Her Majesty. If you are lucky enough to receive a reply, it will be signed by the Lady-in-Waiting or The Queen's official writers.

Draft the body of your letter.,
Write a practice letter.,
Ensure the letter is readable.,
Proofread your letter.",How to Write to HM Queen Elizabeth II2," In a polite, formal tone, state your purpose concisely. It is courteous to briefly inform the reader of the general purpose of your letter, follow with a detailed explanation, then finish with a summary or final plea.Be wary of what you write, however. The Queen is a constitutional monarch, so letters to her asking for personal or political support of any kind are ill-advised.A proper tone: ""I wish to inform you of an important occurrence I believe deserves your attention.""
An improper tone: ""I demand that my local football association get recognition!""

, You may want to write your entire letter and really review how it's structured, analyze its flow, and determine if it conveys the true intention. Once complete, try reading any unclear portion of the practice letter out loud to see if it sounds correct to you.


Try sharing your practice letter with a friend or family member. Another set of eyes may find a mistake or provide a better way of presenting your idea.
A potential start: I wish to inform you of an important occurrence I believe deserves your attention. An amazing service to our nation has taken place recently, and I believe Your Majesty will bestow recognition upon the very deserving citizen.


, Legibility can go a long way towards recognizing the letters and words, which makes the sounds and meaning easier to comprehend.Additionally, The Queen is more likely to want to read your letter if the penmanship is crisp. Really put an effort into your penmanship so it appears that you put care into the letter. Follow a few common practices below:


Don't use an extravagant or difficult to read font. Avoid overly narrow fonts.
Black or blue ink is preferable. Lighter colors may be difficult to read.
Use standard punctuation, grammar, and capitalization. Steer clear of practices specific to the web (e.g. All caps for yelling, internet acronyms like ""LOL"", and emoticons).

, You need to be positive there are no typos, grammar mistakes, or stylistic issues. Be sure to take time after your initial writing to do the proofreading, because you may miss issues since the original content is fresh in your mind. Read a single line at a time. Try obscuring the following line so your eyes can really focus on potential errors. You can check for errors by reading your letter from the end to the beginning, one word at a time.


If typing rather than hand writing, use spell/grammar check.

"
"
Sign off properly.,
Address the envelope.,
Mail the letter.",How to Write to HM Queen Elizabeth II3," Quickly summarize your request (e.g. Thank you for considering the recognition request for such a deserving citizen.). Then, if you are a citizen of the United Kingdom, you should end the letter with ""I have the honour to remain, Madam, Your Majesty's most humble and obedient servant."" You could also replace the word servant with subject. If you are not a citizen of the U.K., choose a respectful closing such as one of the following:Yours Truly works perfectly because it’s commonly used when sending a letter to someone of stature. Yours Sincerely is also an accepted closing line., Write your name and address in the upper left corner. You may receive a reply letter directly from The Queen, or you may receive a letter from Her Majesty’s Lady-in-Waiting. The destination address should be as follows: Her Majesty The Queen
Buckingham Palace
London SW1A 1AA

, Fold the letter into three equal sections. For such an important letter, it may even be worthwhile to measure out the folds before bending the paper. Use the envelope as a guide for the first third measurement. Once the paper is folded, place it in an envelope and send it to The Queen.Acquire proper postage. Depending on your location, and the letter's weight, there may be a somewhat substantial cost to mail the letter to London.
If you include something other than the letter, be careful to consider the list of various prohibitions on mail to Great Britain."

Proofread the manual.A manual can lose credibility due to grammar and spelling mistakes.",How to Write User Manuals," The user manual should be written for the audience -- those who will be purchasing your product or service and reading the user manual.An audience analysis will tell you who your main or target audience will be and will guide your writing.


Talk to people who will use your device. Offer test users prototypes of the device and a draft of the user manual under controlled conditions. Solicit these test users’ feedback about things that are not obvious or confusing in the user directions and incorporate changes into your user manual based on this feedback.
You can never please your entire audience; write the manual to suit the target or largest audience.
Think about the audience’s age, health (do they have illnesses, learning impairments, or disabilities?), and educational level to determine the best approach to writing the user guide.;
, If you were part of the team that helped design and develop the device or product, it might be hard to look at the product objectively in order to explain its operation. You might, therefore, want to solicit the advice of a writer (preferably one with experience in writing instructions) and graphic designer in order to help you draft the user manual. You could choose these individuals from an outside consultancy or from your own company or organization., A task analysis is the process of identifying and organizing the steps needed to use the device. A thorough task analysis will identify the materials and equipment (such as batteries, medications, or other user-provided products) needed for each step, as well as the actions, errors, and troubleshooting advice that each step might require.If you have a product that can perform many different tasks or sub-tasks, you will need to perform a task analysis on each task. For instance, in a car, you can honk the horn, strap yourself in, and turn your headlights on or off. Create a task analysis for each of these as needed.

, Advertisements must demonstrate clearly what the purpose and basic operational guidelines of a product are, and you should use these sources when writing your user manual.


For the user manual of a product to be effective, it needs to be written in concert with labels affixed directly to the product.
Ensure your device is legally licensed for sale before writing instruction manual.

, There are several important ways you can streamline your manual. You should place a bold heading at the start of each section with each word capitalized. For instance, “Setting Up Your Device,” “Operating Your Device,” and “Troubleshooting” could all be bold section headings.


Another way to streamline your manual is to use two columns, one on the right with text and the other just to the left of the text with bullet points, numbers, or small icons like warning signs or red exclamation marks.Your manual might be mostly images with some text beneath each image to explain the device, or it could be primarily text with only a few accompanying images. You could also use a flow chart to provide the user with directions. Think about your product and how each method might be of use when writing your user manual.However, avoid mixing different layouts within a manual. Choose one and stick with it.

, Split the manual into chapters or sections that make sense for the product's use, and include a table of contents toward the front of the manual so each section can be found quickly.


A table of contents is especially necessary for longer manuals.
A glossary or index is needed when there are many terms to explain that your audience may not be familiar with. However, glossaries are not recommended; the best choice is to explain confusing terms in the text of the manual itself. If you choose to include a glossary, place it in front of the manual, just after the table of contents.
A list of tables or figures is only necessary if there are more than a few tables or figures in the manual.
An appendix is needed for things that should be explained but cannot be explained at another point in the manual because it would disturb the flow and focus.

, These warnings should be placed in the very front of the manual after the cover page so that the user sees them first. Specific warnings should also be included in the text of the user manual just after or just before a potentially hazardous step is suggested.


For instance, a general warning for an electric device might be to avoid using it during rain.
A specific direction might be to ensure that your hands and the device are both dry before plugging the device in.
Include graphics (such as a skull and crossbones) or different-colored text (like red text) to differentiate the warning from the rest of the directions in the user manual and draw users’ attention to it.

, Your description should include both a written explanation as to the device’s purpose and a small graphic depicting what the device looks like.The graphic should properly label and name all the switches, knobs, and attachable parts that the device includes.

, The setup section should include basic information about how to prepare to use the product or device. If the device cannot be constructed or set up by a home user, state this fact plainly in a bold header at the top of the setup section. You should also include:a parts list
unpacking instructions
warnings related to setup
results of an improper setup
who to call in case they encounter difficulty in setting up

, Begin with basic preparation for using the device, such as plugging it in or washing your hands. Move on to logical, numbered steps that describe how the device should be used, as well as feedback (for instance, “You’ll hear a click...”) the user can expect when using the device appropriately.


At the end of this section, users should be referred to the troubleshooting section in order to solve problems that can’t be quickly explained.
Include graphics where necessary. Some steps are best explained with images as well as words. Think about using photographs or illustrations in your user manual.
In this section, as in every section, be sure to include relevant safety warnings about improper use or operation. For instance, you might warn users of a chainsaw not to drink alcohol or use the chainsaw while on certain medications.
If you think users would benefit, consider including links to online videos that demonstrate proper use and operation of the device. You could include these videos either at the beginning of this section, or (in the case of videos that illustrate only one step) at the end of each step.

, This should be a simplified, stripped-down version of the operational information section, and should be no more than one page. Summarize how to use the device or product. Include basic warnings, numbered step explaining how to use the product, and phone numbers or email addresses that direct users to help.


If you expect the user will remove the summary sheet or need to consult it frequently, you could print it on a removal laminated card, or thick card stock to make it easier for the user to carry with them and reference. You might also include a summary sheet directly on the product so that users can reference it quickly and easily.

, Be sure to enumerate the cleaning supplies needed. Inform the reader of how often they should clean. Then, just as you would in any other section of the user manual, include numbered step-by-step instructions as to how cleaning should proceed.


If cleaning requires some disassembly of the product, or removal of a certain part or parts, be sure to include details on how to disassemble.
Include a warning about the results of failing to clean the device will be. For instance, you might say, “Failure to clean will result in a below optimal performance.”

, For instance, if the batteries need to be changed after every 300 hours of use, include directions on how to check whether the batteries need to be changed, how to remove the dead batteries, and how to insert the new batteries.


If there are some maintenance tasks that can only be performed by a certified technician, divide the maintenance portion of the manual into two sections.

, You should also include information about why storage is necessary, and what the results of improper storage are. For instance, you might write, “Store the product in a cool, dry place such as a closet. Improper storage could shorten the life of your product due to the buildup of moisture within.”

, Group similar problems together under a logical heading. This way, users can find specific problems quickly. For instance, if there are several problems with the computer displaying a blue screen, list them together under a sub-heading like “Common Screen Problems.” You should also include a phone number and/or email for customer service in this section.

, Before writing a manual for your own product. Look at other effective user manuals. Pay attention to the structure, word choice, and sentence style. Major brands like Apple, Google, and Microsoft produce strong, effective user manuals that can help you produce a more thoughtfully written user manual., Standardizing spelling, word choice, and phrasing will make the user manual more user-friendly. For instance, instead of using both “on/off switch” and “power switch” in your user manual, choose one or the other term and stick with it. The Chicago Manual of Style and the Microsoft Manual of Style might be useful style guides when writing your user manual; consult both to see if one will work for your manual., It is easier to understand than its alternative, passive voice, in which the subject is undefined.


Try the Hemingway App (www.hemmingwayapp.com) to identify passive passages in your writing.
Examine these two sentences, the first active and the other passive, for examples of each:

You should open the package slowly and carefully.
The package should be opened slowly and carefully.



, Numerically ordered instructions will help the reader stay more focused on the process of using, connecting, or building the product in question. Instead of writing a long, rambling paragraph, or a series of un-numbered paragraphs, write your user manual with simple, explicit steps, each numbered clearly., For instance, depending on the product you’re writing about, you might begin your steps with imperatives like “Connect,” “Attach,” or “Slide.” By starting each step with a verb, you will clue the reader in to the action required to complete the step.


Do not begin your steps with a system response. For instance, if, after completing a step, the screen will turn blue and blink, include this information at the end of the action that precedes this response, rather than beginning the next step with, “The screen will blink and turn blue.”

, If you’re writing a yo-yo user manual, your audience will be mostly young children. Use simple words and vocabulary in order to explain how the yo-yo works. If you’re writing a user manual for a scanning electron microscope, your audience will be highly trained scientists who can understand highly detailed information, so don’t shrink from using specialized vocabulary or nuanced explanations.


In general, try to avoid jargon and technical language.
To be effective to the broadest array of users, try to write at a sixth to seventh grade reading level., If you are shipping a product overseas to foreign markets, you must write the manual in the native language of your consumers abroad. Contract a translator fluent in both English and the language of your foreign market to translate your user manual into language as clear and user-friendly as that in its English-language counterpart.


If there are multiple language groups represented in your audience, include translations of the user manual in each relevant language.
Google Translate is an excellent tool that can be used to provide your translator or localization team with a working draft of your translated user manual.Simply enter the text of each section of your user manual into the app (available at https://translate.google.com/) and select your target language. After completing the translation, have a native speaker read over and edit the translation for errors. The native speaker should be familiar with the product, as machine translation can generate sentences that are grammatically correct but have a different meaning than the original sentence.

, Look for logical breaks in each section and put useful information into one or two-sentence chunks. The same applies at the sentence level. Keep your sentences short and simple, rather than long and rambling.

, Have a coworker or technical writer edit and proofread the manual as well. In addition to spelling and grammar, a proofreader should look for:


passive voice
ambiguous or confusing language
complicated sentence structure
overly long paragraphs

Research how to write to your local Councillor or MP.,
Write your preferred choice of communication, whether that's a letter, e-mail, fax, or in person if you happen to see your MP down the street buying an ice-cream.,
Remember your English skills when writing your letter!,
Don't worry if they don't reply straight away.,
Ask others about the issue too.",How to Write to Your Local Council," The concept of writing to someone who you may have never met or even heard of may be quite daunting, but don't panic. You are allowed your say so there must and will be a way of communicating with the people who can make a change. Websites are available where you can find a representative to write to and ask about your query.


You could also look to see where the local office is of your MP or Councillor and drop in a letter, or even send a fax if you're fancy enough. Remember though, different Councillors are responsible for overseeing different aspects of the town.
There's not much point writing to a representative who deals with schools and education when what you want to know is about Waitrose Supermarkets and when they will get a new cash machine built outside! So, research who you want to write to and who will deal with your query the most effectively according to their role, and you're ready to start your letter or e-mail.;
, Do remember to be polite, formal, and as informed as you can be about the issue you're addressing. If you're asking about a road to be altered near you for whatever reason, give the representative names of roads and towns so they can visualize where you're talking about, or maybe even photos or a map outlining where the road is.


Give the representative as much detail as possible so they can understand more about what it is that you want to see happen or change in your town. Being informed gives you an image of confidence and intelligence to someone who has that much power and say in the changes of your community.

, Some websites help you to write out an email with your query and then in the preview change the format and make your email look like a formal, typed letter, which looks professional and shows the representative that you mean business.


If you're really not comfortable with writing such a formal letter, practice first and get others to oversee your work before you send it, or even hand-write it, but make sure it is as neat as possible and your issues are still clearly established. Also remember, the people who you are writing to are there to hear your questions and will try to answer them as best as they can. They are available to write to because they want the same as you; to change your town for the better! So don't feel intimidated or nervous, because:

They are normal, ordinary people, and...
If anything, they'll be extremely happy you brought the subject up and may want to discuss the matter further. So, go for it!



, All representatives of your town are very busy, so don't take it to heart if they are taking a while to respond. If your message is being sent through a system where they check the letter first, or if it's all online through a system, the chances are the people running these systems will have another system to make sure your letters are being answered, they're that efficient!


If they don't reply at all, politely send another letter after a considerable amount of time asking if your first letter was received, or maybe leave a message at the local office and hopefully someone should get back to you. Pestering them won't get you anywhere, but a genuine concern about your town deserves to be addressed by someone who has a lot more authority and who can certainly do something about it.

, If you feel strongly about change in your town over a particular issue, such as rubbish needing to be collected more efficiently, or perhaps you need to discuss issues involving transport or housing, talk to family and friends and explain how you think things should be improved, or even write a petition if you think that's the route you want to go down.


Having people agree with you and thinking the same as you makes your case look a lot stronger and you can have confidence that if they think it's a good idea or subject to bring up, then it really must be! Be courageous and stand up for what you believe in, because if you don't say anything about it, then who will? Be the first to 'set a trend' and to get people talking and considering how your town can be made better for you and everyone else who lives there.

Read widely in the genre.,
Know which publishers are taking submissions.,
Get and follow the guidelines of the publisher you're submitting to.",How to Get Your Superhero Published1," Read the stories of your favorite superheroes, but also read the adventures of other superheroes, particularly those who cross into other genres, such as detective fiction (Batman, the Elongated Man), science fiction (Green Lantern, the Legion of Superheroes) and fantasy (Thor, Doctor Strange). The more superhero characters you're familiar with, the better you know what's already been done and what makes a good superhero.


Note the level of characterization superheroes exhibit in both their costumed and secret identities. The Silver Age Flash, Barry Allen, has endured not just because of the Scarlet Speedster's super-speed and vibration abilities, but because Barry Allen has been portrayed as a dedicated police scientist and respected man who makes friends easily, despite his reputation as a lazy slowpoke.
Pay attention to how the stories are told, as well. Many of the techniques in prose writing have made their way into comic book stories. For example, in a 1970s Flash story in which the hero learns that his wife, Iris, was actually sent to the present as an infant by her 30th century parents, the comic opens with Flash talking with Superman and telling him the story in flashback. As Superman had been sent to Earth as an infant by his Kryptonian parents, his presence in the story foreshadows what Flash and the reader learn within its pages.;
, Some of the major comics publishers, such as Marvel and DC, do not presently accept unsolicited submissions other than through special programs or with the assistance of an agent. Smaller, independent comic book publishers, such as Image or Dark Horse, are more likely to be looking for submissions than the major comic book companies, giving you a better chance to get your superhero published - and are also more likely not to want to buy the rights to your character. You can learn which publishers accept submissions by visiting their Web sites or from publications such as ""Writer's Market,"" ""Locus"" or the ""Science Fiction Chronicle.""

, Just as when submitting to a prose market, you must follow the guidelines laid down by the publisher to whom you're submitting your superhero for publication, whether in comic book or prose format. While the specifics vary among publishers, most comic book publishers are looking for a 1- to 3-page story synopsis, a complete script for the first issue of the hero's adventures and sample artwork, accompanied by a cover letter.


Your submission should be addressed to a specific named editor at the company to which you're submitting your superhero, and your description of your superhero and comic book should be brief and descriptive without making comparisons to other published works. For more advice on preparing a submission and cover letter, see a recent copy of ""Writer's Market.""

Publish your superhero's adventures as a short story or novel.,
Enter a superhero-related contest.,
Consider self-publishing.,
Publish your superhero as a character in a role-playing game.",How to Get Your Superhero Published2," Since the publication of ""Superman: Last Son of Krypton"" in 1978, there has been a growing market of superhero novels and anthologies, particularly since the mid-1990s. You can learn about these anthologies from ""Locus"" or from Web sites such as Superhero Nation (http://www.superheronation.com/category/writing/getting-published/).

, Marvel Comics co-founder Stan Lee, who hosted the now apparently defunct reality show ""Who Wants to Be a Superhero?,"" sponsors a contest through his foundation, in conjunction with art supply company Prismacolor, in which entrants submit superhero designs, with the winning design rendered as an action figure.


""Who Wants to Be a Superhero?"" had both an American and British version. In the American version, adults dressed up as their superhero and competed in various contests, with the winner getting his or her superhero published in a Dark Horse comic book written by Lee. In the British version, children aged 9 to 13 competed in similar contests.

, Many of the publishing services that have sprung up to permit authors to publish their own novels also deal with comic books and graphic novels. If you go this route to publish your superhero, you will have more control over the character, but you will also bear the publication costs and have to do more of the marketing work, just as you would if you self-published a work of prose. If you don't both write and draw, you'll also need a partner to do the part of the work that you can't.


As with self-publishing a work of prose, you should also employ the services of a copy editor to ensure the integrity of your work and subsequent adventures, if there are any. The Hulk's real identity became Robert Bruce Banner because of an early writer error in which the Green Goliath referred to his alter ego as ""Bob Banner"" instead of ""Bruce Banner.""

, Another option to get your superhero published is as a character in a role-playing game, such as Hero Games' ""Champions."" You'll need to know the gaming system in which you want to have your character published, as well as how to adapt comic book conventions to role-playing games.


Publishing your superhero in a role-playing game involves writing game statistics for the character, an origin story, a description of how the character uses his or her powers and suggestions for using the character in a campaign. The write-up is usually accompanied by a visual depiction of the character.
Also be aware that many gaming companies will want to buy all rights to your work. If you want to publish your superhero in other markets, you'll either have to choose a different game publisher or negotiate for having the rights revert to you after a certain period of time.

,
Look around magazines, many will publish short stories.,
When you find a magazine that accepts stories, send in your story.,

The better shape your writing is in, the increased likelihood your stories will get read for deciding about publication.


If on a computer, try Spell Check. Alternatively (or in addition to), maybe get a member of family to proofread.;
, One idea: email the story to your friends and ask them to forward it for other people's opinions. Take the opinions into account and make necessary changes to enhance your work.

, It is a good idea to try several, rather than putting all of your hopes into one approach.

,, Be aware that some genres are more challenging to get published than others. For example, if you write science fiction, or horror fiction, it will be harder to find magazines devoted to these.

, Include a letter explaining the story and your wish to be published. Include your email address, name, age, etc.


Try to find more than one magazine, as a back up plan, in case you aren't published (which is highly probable).

, If you've already written your story, then go to a website that lists markets for short stories. One good website for this is the Submissions Grinder, which will allow you to search for presses and magazines that are looking for short stories in your genre.


Look on the presses' and magazines' websites to find out how to submit stories.
Consider submitting to an anthology, too, if your short story fits what the anthology is asking for.

, There are often writing contests, some are for teens and children, too. Ask the librarians for information.

, You may have to pay a small fee, though.


For websites that will publish it try www.authorhouse.com, Booksurge.com, and Dorrancepublishing.com.

, As you advance, you may even have the opportunity to pursue a job in this field, but for most people, it remains a much loved hobby, so don't throw in the day job.

, Many great writers had trouble publishing their books. You can ask writers for tips, or even the editors for what they want to see in a story! Then send in your story to other places!

Keep your diary handy.,
Schedule a time for writing.,
Don't worry about others' opinions.. Diary writing is for you, not for anyone else.,
Create a ""template"" for entries.,
Use bullet points for brief entries.,
Don't give up if you miss a day.",How to Write a Diary Every Day for a Year and Make It Interesting1," One of the hardest parts of daily diary writing is simply getting in the habit of writing every day. An easy trick for getting in the habit is keeping your diary somewhere easy to access and visible.Many people like to keep their diaries with them wherever they go, in a pocket, purse, or backpack. This way, you can write in your diary any time you have an idea for something to write about.Others prefer to keep their diary in an accessible spot in their home, such as next to the bed. Keeping your diary somewhere you can see it can help you remember to write every day.;
, Many people find it helpful to choose a specific time to write each day. Common choices include right before bed or first thing in the morning. Either option gives you an opportunity to reflect on the previous day.Having a scheduled writing time helps you develop a routine of writing daily. This makes it harder to forget, and gets your brain in the habit of writing at a particular time. Eventually, you should find that words start to flow more easily at writing time.
Of course, you can write in your diary any time! Having a scheduled writing time doesn't mean you can't write at some other time if inspiration strikes you. You should also feel free to write more than once a day if you are moved to do so.

, When you write in your diary, don't worry too much about the rules of spelling and grammar or how other people might judge what you write.


Getting bogged down in the rules can distract you or slow you down. This can hinder your creativity.Personal writing, just for yourself, can help you get to know yourself better, decrease stress, help your resolve disputes with others, and process difficult emotions. This can have a positive impact on both your mental and physical health.If there's something in your diary you decide you want to share with others, you can always edit it later if you are concerned about spelling and grammar.

, Some days, writing will flow easily and naturally. Other days though, you may find it's harder to get started. On these days, having some pre-established questions you can write answers to, a sort of writing template, can help get you started. Here are a few suggestions:What did I do yesterday/today?
What lessons did I learn?
What am I feeling right now?
What am I thankful for?
What did I read yesterday/today?
What are my plans for today/tomorrow?
What is the most important thing I must accomplish today/tomorrow/this week? Why?

, Some days, you may not have much time to write, or may just not feel like it. In such cases, it's okay to do a short entry using just some bullet points about events or thoughts you had that day.For example, your entry might read:

Met Sarah for Lunch at Casa d'Italia.
Worried about new work project--will funding come through?
Started reading Crime and Punishment, interesting so far, but a little hard to follow.


Sometimes, these bullet points might provide content for a longer entry you write at some later time. Even if not, it's better to just jot down a few notes than to skip a day.

, If you are, for whatever reason, not able to write in your diary one day, don't get discouraged. Your diary is for you, and there's no rule that says you absolutely must write every day.That said, try not to ever miss more than two days in a row. Doing so runs the risk of getting out of the habit of writing daily."

Make your code easy to remember, but hard to decode.,
Give each letter (or certain words) its own corresponding shape.,
Give each letter its own corresponding letter; A=Q, B=T, C=R.",How to Write in Your Diary in Secret Code," One of the most common coding methods is to give each letter of the alphabet a number, A=1, B=2. The problem is, it is the most common coding method. Reversing this method and starting with Z=1, Y=2, X=3 may be a better solution, but it is still a very flimsy method of coding. Similarly, writing the words from right to left is also a flimsy method because it only takes a few seconds to figure out that it is written backwards.;
, For example, if you wanted to mention shoe, you would instead draw a small square, a textbook could be a square. A table could be a square with three straight lines draw above it. This will make an almost unbreakable code, but it also makes writing, and reading, a very lengthy process. By using this method, you can essentially create your own language of squares, chevrons, lines, circles with boxes inside, etc. and only someone with the decoder sheet would be able to tell what you had written.

, The problem with this system is that it can easily confuse the writer. Trying to write a T while thinking of a B is contrary to the way our brains are designed to perform.

Follow the instructions.,
Understand the purpose.,
Know your audience.,
Watch the mood.,
Pick an appropriate title.,
Set the orientation.,
Recall and relay the correct sequence of events.,
Pick out important details.,
Separate major parts into different paragraphs.,
Include descriptive details as needed.,
Re-orient the reader.,
Opt for a first person point of view.Since personal recounts describe events that personally happened in your own life, you will need to use first person pronouns like ""I"" and ""we."",
Use plenty of verbs.,
Write in past tense.,
Link events together.",How to Write a Personal Recount," When writing a personal recount for an assignment, read the instructions several times until you know all of the requirements you need to meet.


The first thing you need to understand is the writing prompt itself. If your teacher asks you to write about a favorite holiday memory, your recount needs to describe something that happened during a holiday. It should not describe a favorite memory that happened in school, after class on a normal school day, or during a normal weekend.
Pay attention to requirements concerning length, as well. Your teacher may tell you how many words, pages, or paragraphs your recount needs to be. If these instructions are not included and you aren't sure about how long the piece must be, consider asking your teacher directly.;
, Ask yourself what you hope to achieve by writing your recount. You need to accurately portray a real event you were personally involved in.


Most recounts are meant to inform, entertain, or do some combination of the two. Personal recounts are generally written for entertainment, but if your teacher asks you to describe an event he or she was not present for—like what happened during your last sports game or during a time when a substitute teacher led class—you also need to make sure that you provide plenty of accurate information about that event.

, Think about your audience when writing your recount. Ask yourself what your audience might hope to gain or see from your writing.


For classroom purposes, your recount will usually be written for either your teacher or your peers. Your teacher will want to see that you followed the instructions he or she provided. Your classmates will usually want to be entertained with a story they can enjoy or relate to.

, Consider how your audience might feel after reading your recount. For instance, some stories might make the reader feel happy while others might make the reader feel sad. Make sure that the story you tell matches the mood you hope to put the reader in.


For example, if you need or want to write a personal recount about a fun summer memory, you probably shouldn't write about your best friend moving away. As a sad memory, describing the loss of your friend won't create the “fun” mood your recount is supposed to have.

, Most recounts have a title, and that title should summarize the text in a few words.


Choose something simple. For instance, a recount about your favorite pet might be titled, “My Favorite Pet.”

, The orientation includes all of the background details the reader will need to understand your story. You could also label the orientation as the ""setting"" of your story.


Identify the participants. Even though a personal recount must retell a story from your own life, other people will probably be involved in your story, too. Mentioning these individuals early on will prevent the reader from being surprised or confused later.
Explain when the activity happened and where it happened, as well. These details are crucial if you want your readers to understand the events of your story.
For example, if you choose to write about a beach vacation spent with your family, consider starting with something like, “I spent the first week of July with my mother, father, sister, Uncle Eric, and Aunt Lydia. We stayed at a hotel on the beach.”

, Your recount should describe one significant incident, but each event or step that happened during that incident happened in a specific order. Make sure that you write those events in chronological order (the order they originally occurred in).


For instance, if school was canceled for the day because of a major blizzard, you should mention the blizzard first, followed by the discovery that school was canceled. Write about what you did with your day off only after explaining why you had that day off.

, A lot may have happened during the activity you describe in your recount, but if you provide too many details, you can overwhelm or bore the reader. Stick with important details that push the story along instead of slowing it down.


As a general rule, only describe events that the reader would not be able to predict. When writing a personal recount about your weekend, you could describe the games you played, the people you met with, and any special treats you may have enjoyed. You do not need to explain that you went to sleep each night or ate breakfast each morning, however, since those are things your teacher expects you to do every weekend.

, Each major event in your recount should have its own paragraph. If you cram too many details into one paragraph, the story can seem cluttered and confusing.


For personal recounts that cover an extended period of time, each paragraph might describe one easily separated portion of that time. A recount about your weekend might include one paragraph for Friday evening, one paragraph for Saturday, and one paragraph for Sunday. A recount about your summer might include one paragraph for May, one paragraph for June, one paragraph for July, and one paragraph for August.

, Descriptive details may not seem necessary at first, but they can help strengthen the image you're describing in the mind of your readers.


This is especially important when you are writing a personal recount about someone or something important. Personal recounts about your favorite pet should include a description of how your pet looks. Personal recounts about your grandparents should include descriptions of how your grandparents look and sound.

, Near the end of the recount, you should note the setting again to tie things up and remind the reader of what you were describing.


Consider including a personal opinion about what happened. For instance, you might say conclude a personal recount about your Christmas with a statement like, “This past Christmas was very fun.”
You may also need to conclude by describing the outcome of the activity. If you are telling a recount about your visit to the doctor, end with an explanation of what your doctor told you or what medicine he or she gave you.

,


For a personal recount, you need to describe how you felt and what you did. Doing this will be impossible if you do not tell the story from your perspective.

, A personal recount should describe events and activities that happened. To effectively describe such actions, you will need to use plenty of ""action words,"" more formally known as ""verbs.""


For example, if you write about the games you played when your cousin visited you, you will need to state everything you did: “I played baseball,” “We raced each other to the park,” “My cousin and I painted pictures.”

The words “played,” “raced,” and “painted” describe the actions you and your cousin performed.
It makes more sense to say that you performed these actions than to describe these events without saying anything about doing them. A description of the park you raced to won't make sense if you don't first explain that you raced to it.



, The story you are telling happened in the past, so your recount will usually need to be told in past tense.


This means converting all of your verbs to the past tense. Instead of saying that you “enjoy” eating at your favorite restaurant, you will need to write that you “enjoyed” eating at your favorite restaurant.
For most verbs, you can change them to the past tense by add “-ed” to the end of the verb. Examples include: enjoyed (enjoy), played (play), visited (visit), walked (walk)
For some verbs, several letters within the word will change and no “-ed” is needed. A few common examples include: ran (run), ate (eat), went (go)

, Use transitional words that link separate events together. Without these transitions, your recount may seem scattered and disconnected.


Transitions describe the order of events. A few examples include: first, next, later, meanwhile, then, finally
Your recount might look something like this:


First, I did _________.

Next, we went to the ______.

Later, I decided to ______.

Meanwhile, my parents were ______.

Then, all of us ______.

Finally, we ended the day by ______.
